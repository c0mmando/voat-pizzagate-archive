<p>After learning about Nancy Pelosi\'s involvement with Goat Hill Pizza as discussed in the main thread <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1633706">here</a>, I went to take a look at the GHP\'s website. As commented by other VOAT users, I\'ve also noted the two elements touched up on by them. However, I\'ve noted much more which I\'m about to outline here. Amongst one of these is a loose reference article posted at the Huffington Post, which is a Soros funded new-world media outlet that may prove to be of (great) relevance. I was lucky to snag a screenshot of the Huff\'s front page touting the article. However, it disappeared again really fast from the main page.</p>
<p>I\'ve created an image depicting relevant elements from the Goat Hill Pizza website and numbered them. Below the image link you\'ll find my analysis of various elements. The intent is to show actual intent behind the elements; nothing in our universe is without reason.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/vYqeHLv">Overview image</a></p>
<p><strong>1. Logo</strong></p>
<p>As noted by others, the textual logo of GHP features 3 embedded 6\'s. I\'ve magnified the logo twice to make it visible better. The G forms the first 6. The two others are formed by the vegetable-like fruits hanging from the H and P, like a paprika. When you take a close look, you can see that these form 6-figures. The \'attachment\' atop the \'paprikas\' are the curves of the 6\'s. The \'paprikas\' themselves are the circles, the body part of the 6\'s.</p>
<p><strong>2. Welcoming of Lucifer</strong></p>
<p>This image is the dead give-away of satanic intent. First off, this is a photoshopped image which is important to realize. What is done in this picture is very intentful. When you look at the bottom of the picture, you will see a pizza. The perspective is taken as if you were to \'sit\' on the pizza, you could look at the pizza as if it were Earth\'s surface. What do you see above it, close to the pizza, BUT, not way atop the picture? Yes, the photoshopped &quot;sunflare&quot;. This is a photoshop effect that allows light sources to be added to an image. This sunflare/lensflare you see is NOT natural in this image. It blocks the window frame running behind it. It blocks the pumpkins. It\'s as if the lightsource is floating above the seat just before (behind) the pizza. This lightsource does not come from the outside of the building, nor is it a reflection cast from the outside. It is clearly an overlaid image editing effect: the Sunflare. The positioning of the sunflare is again, important. It\'s close to the pizza, rather than a high-noon sun high in the sky. Yes, this image is to reference Lucifer, the rising morning sun. A well known association within Luciferism. The rising of the sun is to represent the welcoming of Lucifer into our world.</p>
<p>However, there is more to this image. You see the two shakers in front of it? The parmesan cheese shaker and the other red peppers shaker. They are positioned behind the pizza (earth surface). The parmesan cheese shaker represents a specific breed of the white race. The peppers shaker represent non-white races. They both look at how Lucifer is rising in the morning. The salt shaker is more full, there\'s less pepper. The white Luciferists regard themselves supreme over the non-whites. There\'s even more to it. It also represents a do-away with current religion (Christianity/Jewry for the white shaker, Islam for the non-white shaker), to be replaced by the One World Religion which is to be Luciferism. The shakers as such represent the welcoming of Lucifer, presented by the sunflare suggesting a morning sun.</p>
<p>This goes rather deep, and for this we have to make a jump to the opening of the Gotthard Tunnel in 2016. If you can remember, this opening ceremony was/is a satanic ritual. The performance, yet again, represents the welcoming of Lucifer into our world. When you look at the ceremony towards the end of it, you will see that the Pope-figure that is part of the performance is lining up with religious leaders of the primary religions on this globe, where the call for religious unification is made.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The design of this image is indisputably intentful and depicts the heralding of Lucifer into our world.</p>
<p><strong>3. Boy</strong></p>
<p>The main page, atop of it, features a boy eating a pizza slice. This was also noted by other readers. Other than the two kids on the front page, no images of adults are found on the page anywhere. This pizza place seems to target children specifically, most evident by the rewards program it offers, enticing children to nag their parents to go eat pizzas over at GHP in order to collect rewards points. Noteworthy is that the boy is shown in a small image, as opposed to the girl which has a prominent position in the main part of the homepage. Together with the explanation under paragraph 4 below, this suggests \'specialization\' in girls. </p>
<p>When looking at the menu, menu items don\'t seem to be very shocking (unlike the French pizza place), but nonetheless menu items do give away hints and intent. I\'ve marked the key references with red rectangles. An example that\'s telling is the &quot;Meat Lover\'s&quot; pizza, that has &quot;Italian Sausage&quot; as ingredient.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The menu strongly suggests sex with children.</p>
<p><strong>4. Girl</strong></p>
<p>This picture yet again is a photoshopped picture. I have brightened and enhanced contrast a little to make better visible the background behind the girl. This shows it to be a clear layered photoshopped picture. The background layer is a wall with wooden plating. See the scratch marks bottom left, which is barely visible in the original. It\'s a photo of a wall. On top of the background, the child has been copy-pasted in. Noteworthy is that it features the kid having a wide open mouth (seems to be a favourite method of displaying kids amongst the evilists). When you look at the picture and mentally generate a 3D wire-frame (3D modelling) for the wall, the kid, and the pizza, it will become evident that this is photoshopped. The kid\'s right shoulder protrudes into the wall and the pizza plate is covering her near completely. This is not a kid sitting at a table eating pizza.</p>
<p>Now, when we look at the menu again, we see &quot;Hilda\'s Favorite&quot;. With goat cheese. The name &quot;Hilda&quot; is a direct reference towards &quot;Hildabeast&quot;. This again is a word twist to &quot;wilderbeast&quot; which is an antilope family hoofed creature, similar to goats. When looking at usage patterns for the tem &quot;Hildabeast&quot;, one will discover that it is primarily used as a derogatory (rightfully!) reference towards Hillary Diana Rodham Clinton. This reference towards HRC exists for quite some time, going back to well before 2004. It is known that HRC has a fancy for (young) women. Pelosi and HRC know each other.</p>
<p>Conclusion: This pizza\'s name is likely a &quot;shout-out&quot; to HRC, a sign of allegiance.</p>
<p><strong>5. Total Horror</strong></p>
<p>Here is where the Huffington Post gets involved. Let\'s start at the beginning. Here on VOAT, it has been established in part that Planned Parenthood is part of a supply chain of horror. It\'s the front end of the production line. It is known that pineal glands are harvested from live fetusses after abortion. These make their ways onto pizzas and other foods for the top level evilists. The smalles circle of consumers know what they are consuming. However, I believe that consumption is much wider and that not all the involved elites know what they\'re eating, other than that it\'s foods with a halucigenic additive (DMT). I might post a separate thread with an in-depth analysis on this.</p>
<p>Iceland is known for taking its stand against global evilism. And as such, Iceland\'s President apparently did his job in giving weight to Pizzagate being a REAL horror. Saying stuff like this man did isn\'t without reason. The Huffington Post picked up on this in an attempt to ridicule, obviously. They most definitely found it worthy reporting about. Here is the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iceland-president-guoni-johannesson-pineapple-pizza_us_58ac7164e4b02a1e7dac2c24">article</a>.</p>
<p>Goat Hill Pizza can\'t stay behind and had to include a typical Hawaiian pizza in order to \'justify\' pine apple as an ingredient. Hawaii and pine-apple are a common association in food; in my country for example, &quot;Hawaii Sandwiches&quot; are sold; they are sandwiches with cheese, ham and a slice of pine-apple in between.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Goat Hill Pizza knows about the pineal gland additive, substantiated by 1 ~ 4.</p>
<p><strong>Closing</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully this will add useful analysis to show that there\'s a willful intent with regards to peophilia and more importantly, satanism/luciferism. While pedophilia is a big thing, it is by far not the biggest: The Luciferism is. Pedophilia is but one horror commited by the Criminal Sektarian Global Syndicate (CSGS).</p>',

            Finished reading this post and also commented on today's post regarding the burning aborted babies in the U.K. and the Detroit missing body parts. This is one of the best written clear explanations presented on Luceferian worship and iconography. The horror is too much for most people so they want to disengage. I am assuming you have connected this to the research on the Pax2 genetic condition that affects the Pineal Gland in the Madeline McCann case involving the Podesta's. This is in regards to the coloboma eye condition seen in McCann, Soros, Rothschilds, &amp; other elites.

                No worries. It is heavy duty and you have to be prepared to see evil and understand the occult but specifically Luceferian worship.

             Can't make heads or tails of first photo--yet; that shiny light does suggest Lucifer/Satan shining down on pizza which represents Satanic pedo ritual, given the rest of their twisted shit

             Lots of meat for boy, salami, pepperoni, Italian sausage, all phallic, more pedo code

            <li>
             Pineapple, close enough to pineal, which name came from pinecone
            </li>
            <li>
             Most definitely yes to pineal pumping methods and reasons in general, also circulates in rest of tissues/blood which are eaten/drunk, not just in fetuses but also Satanic torture victims
            </li>
            <li>
             Then there's that whole thing of where to put the victims' remains, into pigs and then into pizza might be an "artisanal" technique

             Interesting juxtapositioning of news photo links, infant-sized, drugged animal in someone's hands, mocking Iceland president if he is, in fact, working against pedos

            I know this may sound insane, but just hear me out on this and try to keep an open mind. Pineapple and Italian sausage are delicious pizza toppings, and sometimes pizza is in fact... just pizza.

            Are you saying that pineapple on the pizzas isn't really pineapple but is the pineal glands of abroted foetuses? Because I'm sure they can't pass for one another.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it's plausibel what you're saying about the picture with the pumpkins and the photoshopped flare, because of the fact it has been deliberately added, so there must be a reason, and the salt and pepper shaker positions do look a bit odd. But I think it's bit or a stretch to say that calling a pizza 'Meat lover's' and mentioning it has Italian sausage on it strongly suggests sex with children. In fact I think it's a huge stretch - I mean, what is a normal decent pizza restaurant ssupposed to list as an ingredient on their meat/sausage pizza without accidentally looking like a pimp for children?
           </p>
           <p>
            I also think the Hildabeast thing is not clear at all. It's a derogatory name for HRC, so why would they use that when she's one of them?

             No, I am not saying that pineapple on every pizza are pineal glands. They use "pine-apple" as a code word for pineal glands. In some languages the gland would translate back to English as "pineapple gland" rather than "pineal gland". Within their circles they consume pizzas dressed with these and are available only to select, high ranking members. It's one of their best kept secrets.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for Hildabeast, you've gotta look through 'their' eyes. On the 'outside' Hillary might take it as an offense, but within their evil circles it's an actual compliment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oh and as for meat lover's? Indeed, normal people would never think of these terms in this evil fashion. But "those-in-the-knows" will recognize its doublemeaning when other signs of occultism are present which is the case here. This is exactly what "occultism" is about: Hiding in plain daylight. The word (if I remember correctly is Latin for hiding). A derivative of the word is used in 3D graphics as well: Ambient Occlusion. This however has nothing to do with satanism or evil.

            Pineapple is a very popular pizza topping.  Every pizza restaurant around offers it, and I guarantee you they aren't ALL into this stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, every pizza restaurant offers a "meat-lovers" that has Italian sausage.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think you have overanalyzed this.  I'm not stating that GHP isn't evil; I am saying that most of the "dots" you have laid out are incredibly weak.  I think your logo interpretation is spot on, however.

             Kids or anyone for that matter don't open their mouth that wide for a bite of any kind of food. To me they are making her imitate oral sex.

             I will address that in a separate topic; for this I will need to dig up appropriate sources again that I came across but didn't bookmark as I wasn't really compiling circumstantial evidence on this at that time, some month ago. But I've got it in my head what to look for. This will also tie in to satanism.

             Yes, those. The shakers. Sorry for terminology errors; English isn't my native langue but I think I'm coming along just fine. In fact, I might update the references in the main article to reflect your suggestions.

            I stopped at "The salt vial is more full, there's less pepper. The white Luciferists regard themselves supreme over the non-whites."

           <p>
            You think white supremacy is encoded in the salt and pepper shakers? I don't mean to be cynical but that's sort of a stretch don't you think?

               I'm not a shill. I would suggest you read the embedded Gotthard Tunnel reference links further down here to learn a bit more about a certain truth. Approached from a scientific viewpoint. Not from a zealous, religious standpoint. The important bit to realize is that these evil folk believe what is in their belief system
               <em>
                and act upon it
               </em>
               , whether YOU believe it or not.

                If you're not a shill then I've got some advice for you. Don't say things like
               </p>
               <p>
                "It is known that pineal glands are harvested from live fetusses after abortion. These make their ways onto pizzas"
               </p>
               <p>
                because you sound like YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND.
               </p>
               <p>
                Just a little advice. Rule one when trying to argue a point is not to sound like a lunatic.

                 .... the sad thing..  is that this lunacy is a reality when you know the inner details, like said, I'll attempt to compile a report on this much like this report on it. There is a reason why I checked the Adult/NSFW checkbox.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here is the short run-down version of what complicit abortion medics do:
                </p>
                <p>
                 Take out foetus, alive, preserving the head if possible. Hurt and damage the foetus (Planned Parenthood leaked insider videos) to cause maxium stress to the still live foetus. The death is controlled by the abortion doctor for a specific reason: When the foetus dies, an additional chemical makes it into the pineal gland, that reacts with the melatonin in the gland into DMT. The doctor knows how long to wait to maximize DMT yield before extracting the gland from the foetus. Under wake conditions DMT is not formed in the PG, but trace amounts do get in there, by trace amounts of the additive chemical making it into the gland. It's only at the actual death of the foetus that larger amounts make it into the gland as part of the death process. Death is a halluciogenic experience to shield the being from further pain/stress stimuli from still working tissue. This is why DMT is called the 'Soul Molecule'. DMT to THEM represents a captured soul, which, in their satanic belief system is a means to extend life by consuming a soul. The timed extraction is to avoid the DMT to be metabolized which is what actually causes hallucinations / dreams. Now you know why the abortion movies of Planned Parenthood are so sickeningly horrible (to maximize DMT yield upon controlled death) and why President Trump ordered immediate shutdown on all funding to PP world-wide. Plant material can be processed to yield DMT as well, this is done in the home-brew drugs scene, young chemists etc searching for the hottest party drug etc. The yield is not that high though and would take some work.

                  If that were true then why do these people die? The Rockefellers and the Rothschild and on and on, they eventually die just like everyone else.

                   The point is, it is THEIR beliefsystem. If they believe it they will do it. The hole is in your argument. You are not thinking like them, you have your own beliefsystem which differs from theirs. Trying to tell them ritual sacrifice is pointless isn't going to stop them from doing it. Try it. That's the whole shite with this criminal cult. The stuff they believe and do is so outlandish to anyone with an ounce of sense that it nearly always blocks people from accepting it for a truth that some people can actually be so gruesome. Really, I'm not trying to 'argue' with you for argument's sake. I'm trying to tell that they key to accepting the existence of atrocities lies within the realization that they act upon their beliefsystem, whether you believe their philosophy and reasoning or not...

             "Encoded"  Remember watching The Da Vinci Code ? Symbolism has been used for eons. Though Im not a Christian. The people who are use many symbols and code. Especially the ones who are, so to speak, on the dark side. Personally I believe all religions are on the dark side along with the obvious ones like the Church of Satan. These people who do these evil things like Pedophilia and Satanic sacrifice have to keep it on the down low. So symbolism for them is crucial and it comes in many forms. I know its hard to absorb but this is a reality.

             Yes. It's highly disturbing. I've watched the version with a narrator detailing the happening. Yes, scaring us is one tactic. Attempts to make us fearful and shaky in order to weaken us (the good people in this world) so we could not stand up to it, and instead be turned onto each other.

             I've been researching the criminal cult for several years now, but when I viewed that tunnel opening I knew it was time to get into action. I've posted about this on the website "Overclock.net" as well, and wrote several articles about various subjects there that may help you find strength in dealing with this shite. I'd recommend everyone to check it out. Some may think I may be nuts, but that's the price I pay for redpilling fellow earth citizens.

             A vial of salt and / or a vial of pepper on their own don't imply any sort of racisim / supremacy. However, this picture is a willful design with a whole lot more elements (and do it! Go watch the full opening ceremony of the Gotthard Tunnel) and it's only in THIS picture that the salt and pepper have this meaning. Like said, it's more than pedophilia. It's satanism/luciferism. Connect the dots, go watch that Gotthard Tunnel opening. Apology accepted.
            </p>
            <p>
             Additional note: No, the pizzeria is not a Satanic Temple (where Satanism is actively practiced). Luciferism is a "group-binder" under which they unite, declare allegiance and commit atrocities. Pedophilia is but one of them. Point is, it's not "just" pedophilia in the bigger picture.

              First off I apologize for doubting you. I keep forgetting exactly how depraved these people are. I keep assigning them more human dignity than they deserve.

              I've seen that Gotthard Tunnel video. It's very disturbing. It's almost too disturbing if you know what I mean. It's so in your face I wonder if it's a way they try to "defang" their opposition.
