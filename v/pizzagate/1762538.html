<p>It might be worth noting that there are two recent developments concerning classic art: paintings by Dutch masters, in particular Rembrandt.</p>
<p>On story is about the purchase of two Rembrandt paintings by the Dutch and the French governments in 2015, for 160 million Euros, from Éric de Rothschild. Nice paintings, but not so very special, certainly not when compared to other Rembrandts. I think the price is about a factor of 10 too high. The Dutch media presented the acquisition as a wise decision by the Minister of Culture: the French had also been wanting the paintings; there had been a tough bidding phase; luckily for the Dutch people, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam would share the Rembrandts with the Louvre in Paris. Everybody was happy, including Mr. De Rothschild of course.</p>
<p>The other story concerns an exhibition of the so called Leiden Collection in Paris. This collection includes Rembrandts and other paintings of Dutch masters, and it is owned by the billionaire Thomas Kaplan. I do not know any incriminatory facts about Kaplan, but I find some elements of his biography on Wikipedia suspect. In particular he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and he funded a transplantation center at the University of Miami, and he created a &quot;Daisy and <strong>Paul Soros</strong>/Recanati-Kaplan Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology&quot;.</p>
<p>Kaplan was in the news in The Netherlands last 19th February. Incidentally George Webb talked that day about a <strong>George Soros</strong> project for organ transplantations in Haiti with involvement of the University of Miami. See for instance this video at 2m22s:

<p>30 September 2015: France and Netherlands to jointly buy rare Rembrandts
17th-century paintings worth €160m belonging to Rothschilds will alternate between Rijksmuseum and Louvre</p>
<p>The Netherlands and France will together buy two rare Rembrandts for a total of €160m (£118m), the Dutch culture minister has announced, after the two countries defused a potential bidding war.</p>
<p>The 17th-century paintings, which belong to the Rothschild banking family and have rarely been seen in public, will alternate between the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and the Louvre in Paris, Jet Bussemaker said in a letter to the Dutch parliament.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>The marital portraits of Maerten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit are believed to be in the collection of French banker Eric de Rothschild.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>According to the Dutch daily paper NRC, the paintings were reportedly sold to the Rothschilds in 1877 for 1.5m guilders, despite attempts by the Dutch government at the time to keep them in the Netherlands. The Rothschild family in 2013 first indicated it wanted to sell the paintings, NRC added.</p>

<h3>Louvre Museum</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of its season devoted to the Dutch Golden Age, the Musée du Louvre is presenting a selection of masterpieces by 17th-century Dutch painters from the collection of Thomas Kaplan and his wife, Daphne Recanati Kaplan. This selection, brought together at a major international museum for the first time, showcases the largest private collection of works by Rembrandt. Visitors will discover some thirty paintings and drawings by the greatest painters of the Golden Age from the region of Leiden in the Netherlands, primarily ten works by Rembrandt and a painting recently attributed to the artist.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>After Masterpieces of the Leiden Collection. The Age of Rembrandt has been shown at the Louvre, an expanded group of approximately 60 highlights will travel to the Long Museum in Shanghai and the National Museum in Beijing in 2017 and 2018 and to the Louvre Abu Dhabi before returning to Europe and the United States.</p>

<p>Thomas S. Kaplan (born 1962) is an American entrepreneur, natural resources investor, philanthropist and art collector. He is the chairman and chief investment officer of The Electrum Group LLC, a New York City-based investment, advisory and asset management firm with a focus on the natural resources sector.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>On a business trip, he met his future wife, Dafna Recanati (the daughter of Israeli investor Leon Recanati), who had attended the same boarding school as Kaplan. Dafna\'s mother, artist Mira Recanati, introduced him to Israeli investor Avi Tiomkin, who hired him as a junior partner in 1991. Kaplan had impressed Tiomkin by correctly predicting Saddam Hussein\'s 1990 invasion of Kuwait several years before it took place. When Tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in Israel in 1993, Kaplan moved on to execute his own entrepreneurial ventures.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>Kaplan is the executive chairman of Panthera Corporation, a charity which he and his wife co-founded in 2006. Panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>The Kaplans have funded the <strong>Lillian Jean Kaplan Renal Transplantation Center at the University of Miami</strong> as well as a variety of prizes and grants for medical science research. In 2012, the Kaplans created the <strong>Daisy and Paul Soros/Recanati-Kaplan</strong> Family Assistant Professor in Preventive Cardiology, a position held by Dr. Bassem Masri.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>Kaplan is a member of the <strong>Council on Foreign Relations</strong> as well as the <strong>International Council at Harvard University\'s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs</strong>, where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American <strong>General David Petraeus</strong> created the <strong>Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program</strong>. Intended to &quot;intersect history with policy, intelligence, strategic studies, and maybe a little common sense,&quot; the program brings together intelligence officers from several countries. According to the Belfer Center, &quot;Each fellow undertakes rigorous research projects, doing in-depth studies of everything from combatting terrorism to leading more effective organizations. They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of <strong>CIA, NSA, DIA</strong>—and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies... Recanati-Kaplan Fellows are the best of the best: As the Center’s website notes, applicants must come with the personal recommendation of their agency heads.&quot;</p>

             International Council at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs
            </strong>
            , where Kaplan, scholar Graham Allison and decorated American

             General David Petraeus
            </strong>
            created the

             Recanati-Kaplan Foundation Fellows Program
            </strong>
            . Intended to "intersect history with policy, intelligence, strategic studies, and maybe a little common sense," the program brings together intelligence officers from several countries. According to the Belfer Center, "Each fellow undertakes rigorous research projects, doing in-depth studies of everything from combatting terrorism to leading more effective organizations. They meet in small sessions with leaders in the intelligence field—directors and former directors of
            <strong>
             CIA, NSA, DIA
            </strong>
            —and other foreign and domestic intelligence agencies... Recanati-Kaplan Fellows are the best of the best: As the Center’s website notes, applicants must come with the personal recommendation of their agency heads."

            I would speculate that these experts are hired to control the minds of the Dutch and the French: one should not complain about this transaction; otherwise you are a cultural barbarian who knows the price of everything but the value of nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The latter saying was used in the public debate, nineteen years ago, when we had a scandal in The Netherlands with the purchase of Mondriaan's Victory Boogie Woogie for 80 million guilders (in todays money, after inflation: about 100 million Euros) from New York billionaire Samuel Irving Newhouse. The year before our parliament had decided that large art acquisitions would require parliamentary approval, but this rule was sneakily circumvented. The unfinished painting was presented as a present by the national bank to the people, to commemorate the introduction of the Euro. Later Jean Claude Trichet, the vice president of the European bank, later declared that such expenditures undermine the Euro.

              Thank you for the update. I will leave this up, though this is the most tenuous of threads.
             </p>
             <p>
              For the sake of all the work you put in and the success of future threads, if you want to get traction with your research try writing a headline that nails the Pizzagate connection up front. When you've got a lot of text, use the "H" button to break it into sections addressing each of the important points that support your headlines. People open this and their eyes glaze over. Once it sits here awhile with few upvoats, people won't even open it. They figure there's nothing to see.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, it is perfectly acceptable if you make a post and the way you've written it up fails to gain traction, to remove the post yourself, rewrite/reformat in a more effective presentation, and then repost...particularly at a time when more than 900 people are on the board...usually 8am or 6pm Eastern.

               Thank you for your advice. For now, I'll leave the post as it is. It is tenuous indeed. 
Anyway I think it is good to have it archived here; it may come of use in the future.

            That depends on what this market really is: is it a real market or a fake market? Why are the prices so high? Maybe money is transferred for more obscure reasons; see for some speculation this article that was coincidentally posted at about the same time with mine:
           </p>

           <p>
            Another reason is that political leaders are occasionally very generous with the taxpayer's money. That is also a kind of market distortion.

            Please compare this to the story that I posted last December:
           </p>
           <h3>
            1987: pedophile ring exposed, with secret photographic studio in basement of UNICEF building in Brussels
           </h3>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1508258">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1508258
             </a>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I also meant that post as raw data; possibly related to Pizzagate. Then others found that this was tightly connected to intelligence operations. It may even be a very sensitive subject, given that somebody else posted:
           </p>

             I am not. The sale may be just a sale; maybe for a too high a price. Maybe it is a way to transfer money to the Clinton Foundation or so via De Rothschild. Probably not, but that is where my fantasy ends.

             With Kaplan's Leiden Collection I have even less an idea what this could be. But like with my article on the UNICEF case that I referred to, I had no idea either.

             IMO it is important to collect raw data even if it is only slightly suspicious; at some point it may come of use.

              I respect you for not jumping to conclusions and just reporting what you found. You probably know paying way too much for something is a technique for money laundering and trafficking. The Louvre having that pyramid makes me suspicious too.
