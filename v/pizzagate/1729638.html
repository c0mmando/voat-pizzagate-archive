            This is dumb, quasi-Jew here: Judaism kicked off as a popular religion at the time because it was one of the first religions NOT to require human sacrifice. Rule of thumb: As soon as someone mentions reptilian-Jews, its time to tune them out. Regular people are way scarier than lizards.

           <p>
            The issue here isn't the infamous "Blood Libel" hoax used for centuries to falsely accuse all Jews of being child killers. No, the issue is why are you shilling for child rapists and organ harvesters.

            Only a shill would try to slander Pizzagate in this way.

                This post has nothing to do with the truth. If he had it wouldn't have included Jews in the title:
               </p>
               <p>
                "Jews have alway strayed from God into the worship of "

               <p>
                while saying
               </p>
               <p>
                "Those Babylonians are not Jews"
               </p>
               <p>
                Get it? This post is weaponized disinformation to discredit Pizzagate. The "Jews" in the title is a dead giveaway.

                 , and run advanced intervalidating information extrapolation and analysis on this dataset, the article and its replies that I wrote up will be the outcome free from all the disinfo spread around. This is the big picture. The gig is up.

                   I was talking about my post. I realize you didn't address my article. I dumped the outcome I've had in my head for a while into that article to address the opening post for the purpose of stopping the Bablyonian filth in their tracks to set up people against Jews that choose for the absolute Good without thinking twice about the finer details. The Babylonian filth wants war between all three primary religions and eradicate these to then introduce Babylonian Luciferism as the one-world-religion.

            It's simple:
           </p>
           <p>
            It really takes off in the times of Ancient Babylon. Babylon is known for the times where men abandoned God and wanted to build the Tower of Babylon to rule from the skies and become gods themselves. King Solomon, the son of David in fact was not so much a nice guy. He was into Babylonian Occultism. The books describing this sinister side of Solomon were never bundled in what is now the Bible. However, the Vatican houses these and other books which are kept secret from us. The Babylonian Occult (School of Satan / Lucifer) throughout history made it into what is now known the Vatican.
           </p>
           <p>
            Similarly, during the 8th century, the European region Khazar housed a malevolent King who was posed by the Russians of that time to pick one of the 3 primary religions and abandon the occult. They had to choose from Christianity, Islam and Judaism. They chose Judaism and still sprinkled it with the Babylonian occult and continue their practices. These are the ascendants of those who today call themselves "Jew" but are in fact followers of Babylon and Lucifer. Examples of these are today's Rothschild bloodline, the Rockefellers and Soros. But there are many more that have sworn allegiance to the Babylonian cult. The Khazar region of the past is today's Ukraine. That is why the Ukraine plays such a big deal in today's events and why many of these modern day politicians have a direct link with the Ukraine or otherwise have an affiliation with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            This Babylonian cult is witnessed in so many cultrue and structures today. The European Union parliament building in France represents the Tower of Babel. Even its architecture shows an 'unfinished' tower, referencing the fact that God intervened during Ancient Babylon, where the tower got never finished and unfaithful people were dispersed.

And last year, they celebrated one of their biggest feats, connecting Switzerland with the the rest of Europe through the

            </a>
            . In the ritual you can see references to the future outlined further down this article.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is referred to as the "New World Order" is in fact, the Babylonian World Order. The western world and notably the European Union is, in actuallity, "New Babylon". Basically, ancient Hebrew Jewry (following the Torah) had been hi-jacked a long time ago by this Babylonian cult. The Babylonian Khazar created what is known as the Babylonian Talmud, which was an artifically created (by humans) scripture that embeds these Luciferist phylosophies. Amongst one being the creation of the supremacy concept (which is found in parts of other religions as well), giving rise to terms like "goy" and "gentile".
           </p>
           <p>
            Those Babylonians owning and conquering the world are NOT semites. This was proven by an Israeli scients that did DNA research into Jewish heritage. Those Babylonians are not Jews (inspite of what they say, they use it as a mental body armor). They are Babylonian Luciferst scum fucks.
            <strong>
             Babylonia is very alive today and it is the greater evil we face.
            </strong>
            The importance here is to realize though that this cult keeps it occult evil hidden from its low tier, insignificant members. Whoelse would want to follow a cult of evil? The evilist are going to need followers for their agenda. (Meaning, judge the individual and don't go broad-brush on anything that smells "Jew").
           </p>
           <p>
            What really happened in WW 2 is that the Babylonian filth calling themselves "Jew" in fact mass-killed Jews that follow the Torah. George Soros is known to have turned in Jews to the Nazis. That were Torah Jews. While today he's using the "Anti-Semite" mental body armor meme to divert away attention from his evil doings, past and present. This is why Putin called him a "dragon". Referring to the Babylonian Serpent cult.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trGWnQgcg4E">
             Here you can hear a radio interview with a Babylonian rabbi, Abe Finkelstein
            </a>
            . It's gross.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well this piece provides plenty to start further research. Don't turn this into a Jew (or Christian, or Muslim) witch-hunt. Don't fall for these artifical (evil humans created) dualities. Turn the duality-disk 90 degrees, meaning, look at everyone by whether they are truely good or evilish . There's only one duality. The absolute duality that's Good and Evil. Neither look at race, religion, color, whatsoever. They look at wether one would let in or not either.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is the solution to fixing this bump in the road mankind as a whole faces. On to a better world. So we can stop them from (their planned agenda):
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Conquer Russia, China
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Conquer Iran
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Finish the LHC portal to Kepler 452b (that side's up and running already) and pour in Lucifer and its army of deamons which are in fact E.T.s, some are here as scouts already to guide the Babylonian filth with technologies required for this and the following:
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Continue Terraforming of Earth through solarshield technology by chemtrailing aluminum particles into our stratosphere. The shield keeps in heat energy on the night-side of Earth and prevents it from cooling down enough. These E.T.s like heat better than we do.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Build the new Temple of Solomon in Iran, the final Seat of Lucifer.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Enslave mankind (already done) and exploit them every conceivable way. Amongst one of these being to litterally feast on and harvest from innocent defenseless (young) people. (
              <strong>
               THIS IS THE PIZZAGATE / PEDOGATE / HUMAN TRAFFICING LINK

              )
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              These E.T. will eventually dump and eradicate remaining humans and claim the planet as their new colony planet.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            See? Even earthly Babylonian servants will become the hunted after they are no longer useful idiots. Ah well, their own mistake LOL. Once we learn that these E.T.s are the evil ones, we can in fact start welcoming the good ones before the evil ones get to coax us into thinking they are actually the good ones and mistakenly attack those that want to help Earth and humans.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              The evil E.T.s: Reptilian class (Annunaki/"Serpent People", Greys, Tall Whites) from constellation Draco near the Northern Cross, Orion Constellation region the star systems Zeta Reticuli, Rigol.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The good E.T.s: Arcturians from the Bootes constellation, Pleiadeans from the Pleiades star system, originally from Lyra.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            There are many more, but these are most prominent in regards to human history. However, with this piece of text we are ahead of the plans of these evil ones and help save ourselves from attacking the wrong guys when Babylonian World Order endorsed disclosure about E.T. life will come.

             Besides 666, the number 17 is another significant occult "flash-signature" the Babylonian World Order uses. The occult is about hiding things in plain daylight. As with the devil's horns and the OK sign, number 17 is used as a "flash-signature" to indicate a number of things. The most important ones being:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               Showing allegiance to their (Luciferist) cult. This is the most common reason.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Instructing followers of the cult to support any designed narrative surrounding the item / event that shows the flash-signature. This one is significant, because through this, they can communicate from the few (one or two guys flashing their signatures) to the many; all loosely aligned members at every place in society. You will see below.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Now, what is so special about 17 and how does it relate to Luciferist occultism? Well. 17 is the short-hand form for the number of the beast 666. Get your math-hat on:
            </p>
            <p>
             The key to unlocking this number is the Prime Numbers table. But before I will get to it I will need to explain something about prime numbers first. A prime number is defined by a number of factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               Only dividable by the number itself.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Only dividable by 1.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Any other divisor must yield a fractal number. This is the condition that makes a prime number a REAL prime number and not a pseudo-primenumber.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             1 is officially not a prime number. Yet the first two conditions are met. Since both conditions are written the same way (1/1 (by number), 1/1 (by 1)), this is not regarded a prime number. Further more, there's nothing else left to divide it by.
            </p>
            <p>
             2 is officially a prime number. However, this is NOT a REAL prime number. Why? Yes 2/2 ends up to be non-fractional. And so does 2/1. However, there's still not anything else to divide it by (the 3rd condition is not met). Yet it is regarded a prime number because the first 2 conditions are met. And unlike 1, the two conditions don't look the same. But, for it to be a true prime number, it must be divisbable by something else that must yield a fractional number. And with 2 it does not. This is the sole reason, why 2 is the ONLY even prime number. All other prime numbers are odd numbers ALWAYS:
            </p>
            <p>
             3 can be divided by itself (3/3) and 1: (3/1). There's something else to divide it by, a 2: 3/2 ends up to be a fractional number. So, all 3 conditions are met. This is the first REAL prime number.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, let's take a look at the real prime numbers in the prime number table and look at number 17:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               17 is the 6th real prime number. There's the first 6.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               17 is the 3rd, 2-digit real prime number. 3x2 = 6. There's the second 6.

             17 packs three 6'es into it as you can see. And that is why it is used often. Now; let's take a look at known references that employ the number 17 into it. Get ready and be shocked:

             . This is also a well thought-out choice in address makeup. HDR are her maiden initials. Why not HRC as she's mostly known by? Hardly anywhere one would see HDR. Well. The reasoning is this: The 'C' is already denoted by the domain name: 'C'lintonemail.com. To not duplicate the C reference, she had to pick another (or no) letter. However, she was adamant about having 3 letters. I'll tell in a bit why. To get 3 letters without using the 'C', she instead used the initial of her much less widely known maiden name 'Diana'. Hillary Diana Rodham. This results in 'hdr'. The 22 appendage is well-chosen as well. Because, when you'd use the letter count (3), you will get 322. And what does 322 stand for? Yes. The Sculls &amp; Bones Harvard Secret Society. Lynn Forrester de Rothschild was also a Harvard student. Hillary used this email box to communicate with Skulls &amp; Bones members.

             This was the supposedly released file that would show the Saoudi's to be behind 9/11. In the bigger whole, you'll realize this was not a coincidential sequence number of files. No, it was a deliberately picked name for the document: File Number Seventeen. In light of 'support-the-narrative', this was to suggest the Saoudi's were being 9/11 while we all know that is not the case. It basically says, support our blame-game!

             As you can see, the number is used with high-profile geopolitical events and issues. It's their most covert way to flash their presence since the number itself does not suggest anything other than being just a number. So they make heavy use of it. But, I've noted the pattern over the past years and recognized it to be of intelligent doing. When I looked at the prime-number table, I saw instantly what it meant. Here you have it. This essay proves conscious intent with the usage of number 17. It is an occult flash-signature to stamp with statements and events, representing the number of the beast.

             When you note any use of the number 17 with high-profile items you will know the Criminal Sektarian Global Syndicate is saying 'hi' and asks 'followers' to support the narrative displayed by the item the number is used in.
