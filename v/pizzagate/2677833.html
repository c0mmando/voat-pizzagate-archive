<p>&quot;The Vatican released <a href="http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/vatican-responds-to-pa-grand-jury-report">a statement</a> expressing “shame and sorrow” Thursday about the hundreds of predator priests uncovered in Pennsylvania. This statement comes after two days of silence and offers no quote from Pope Francis.</p>
<p>“There are two words that can express the feelings faced with these horrible crimes: shame and sorrow,” the statement reads. “The Holy See treats with great seriousness the work of the Investigating Grand Jury of Pennsylvania… The Holy See condemns unequivocally the sexual abuse of minors.”</p>
<p>“Victims should know that the Pope is on their side. Those who have suffered are his priority, and the Church wants to listen to them to root out this tragic horror that destroys the lives of the innocent.”</p>
<p>In the middle of these platitudes, comes this: “By finding almost no cases after 2002, the Grand Jury’s conclusions are consistent with previous studies showing that Catholic Church reforms in the United States drastically reduced the incidence of clergy child abuse.”</p>
<p>This is what stood out to me… “Almost no cases after 2002.”</p>
<p>We are talking about the kind of sexual abuse against children that would make Harvey Weinstein blush and the Church is using the words “almost no” in its defense.</p>
<p>Let’s read that another way…</p>
<p>Ford Motor: “Almost no Ford Pintos exploded and killed their occupants after 2002.”</p>
<p>The FBI: “Almost no FBI agents were involved in manipulating presidential elections after 2002.”</p>
<p>The local mosque: “Almost none of our Imams sought to radicalize terrorists after 2002.”</p>
<p>CNN: “Almost none of our reporters spread fake news after 2002.”</p>
<p>the Catholic Church: “Almost no children were raped by our priests after 2002.”</p>
<p>And then there is the whole “fool me once” aspect of all this.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of statements we heard 15 years ago when the first child abuse scandal exploded on the Church, and I am afraid empty words are just not good enough anymore.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Just as unacceptably is this sentence in the Vatican’s statement, “The Holy See also wants to underscore the need to comply with the civil law, including mandatory child abuse reporting requirements.”</p>
<p>You have child rapists in your own home and a gangster mentality protecting those child rapists… How can you not be proactive? How can you not be calling on every attorney general in all 50 states to launch investigations — with the FULL cooperation of the church — in all 50 states?  How can you not be demanding these “secret archives” (incredibly, that was the Pennsylvania Church’s term for the secret files detailing the abuse and cover-ups) be released to the public in very diocese, not only here in America but throughout the world?&quot;</p>',

            Brings to mind the bizarre comment weird Pope Francis made in 2014, comparing clerical pedophile abuse to "a satanic mass".

           </p>
           <p>
            "A priest who has sex with a child betrays God," he told assembled journalists. "A priest needs to lead children to sanctity, and children trust him. But instead he abuses them, and this is terrible. I compare it to a satanic mass."

              That was my thought exactly. What a strange thing for a pope to say. No pope in history has used the strange lexicon of this pope. He uses outlandish analogies and scatological references. Not exactly lifting people's minds and hearts to God.

            Those diocesian records that were under lock and key held only by the Bishop had to be subpoenaed by the grand jury before they saw the light of day. Let's cut the crap: The Catholic Church has no interest in exterminating child abuse . When they wrote a consoling letter after abuse became known, the letter was sent to the offending priest, not the victim (who they often hired lawyers to dig up discrediting dirt on). They even wrote a positive job recommendation for a predator priest so he could go to Disneyland and continue the same crap driving their train in the park for 15 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Church has been infiltrated since before the 1950s. These farmed out, pensioned off predator priests/bishops are in their 80s and 90s and they had a lot of time to train, place and promote the same type of predator in the Church. The problem is not going away as long as you have those sexually active homosexuals running the ship .

            "Most of the discussion in the report concerns abuses before the early 2000s. By finding almost no cases after 2002, the Grand Jury’s conclusions are consistent with previous studies showing that Catholic Church reforms in the United States drastically reduced the incidence of clergy child abuse."
I wonder if "someone" has another shoe to drop.....AFTER 2002, yes? I think the Pope is on the radar.  Just my humble opinion.
Remember the unfortunate timing release of James Gunn's pedo priest costume pic.....

            . It should be noted that the Vatican
            <em>
             only
            </em>
            said they were sorry because so many Catholics were upset that they
            <strong>
             remained silent
            </strong>
            when the report was published.
            <strong>
             When asked for a comment, the Vatican's response initiatlly was 'no comment'.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to see
            <em>
             every
            </em>
            diocese in the US and elsewhere in the world as thoroughly investigated as the one in Pennsylvania. And, mind you, even this report shows only
            <em>
             the tip of the iceberg
            </em>
            , since it is based on actual documents they found in Church archives. Meaning, all other cases of sexual assaults - where documents were lost, or the children never spoke up, were
            <em>
             not
            </em>
            researched.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that there are many good people in the Church. But now I also feel it's safe to say the priesthood and Church leaders are a pedo organization. Sorry if this offends anyone here.

They changed Gods times and Laws.

             You do know that Catholics put the Bible together, right?

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In his Easter letter of 367, Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of exactly the same books that would formally become the New Testament canon,[8] and he used the word "canonized" (kanonizomena) in regard to them.[9] The first council that accepted the present Catholic canon (the Canon of Trent) may have been the Synod of Hippo Regius in North Africa (393). The acts of this council, however, are lost. A brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419).[10] These councils took place under the authority of St. Augustine, who regarded the canon as already closed.[11] Pope Damasus I's Council of Rome in 382, if the Decretum Gelasianum is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon identical to that mentioned above,[8] or if not the list is at least a 6th-century compilation[12] claiming a 4th-century imprimatur.[13] Likewise, Damasus's commissioning of the Latin Vulgate edition of the Bible, c. 383, was instrumental in the fixation of the canon in the West.[14] In 405, Pope Innocent I sent a list of the sacred books to a Gallic bishop, Exsuperius of Toulouse. When these bishops and councils spoke on the matter, however, they were not defining something new, but instead "were ratifying what had already become the mind of the church."[15] Thus, from the 5th century onward, the Western Church was unanimous concerning the New Testament canon.[16]

              It literally exposes them for the world to see.  Probably why they punished people with death if they possessed one.
