<p><strong>&quot;Torture chamber&quot;</strong> is an egyptian ritual</p>
<p>Here is some pages of a book about this, recommended by FBI Ted Gunderson</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The following passages from The Egyptian Book of The Dead are graphic and repulsive and are presented solely for the purpose of expose.
“[1] DRINKING BLOOD
(15) “Hail, devourer of Blood, who camest forth from the block of slaughter, I have not acted guilefully”.135</p>
<p>“[2] CANNABALISM- EATING INTESTINES
Hail, Eater of intestines, coming forth from Mabet, not have I desolated ploughed lands.”136</p>
<p>“<strong>[3] TORTURE CHAMBER
(21) “Hail, thou two headed serpent, who comest forth from the torture chamber, I have not defiled the wife of any man.”137</strong></p>
<p>“[4] THE CRUSHER OF BONES
(9) Hail, Crusher of Bones, who comest forth from Suten-henen, “I have told no lies..”138</p>
<p>“[5] WASHING IN BLOOD
Behold ye then god this great of slaughter, mighty of terror, he washeth in your blood, he batheth in your grave.”139</p>
<p>“[6] KILLING ANIMALS – LOCKS OF HAIR
I have obtained the mastery over the animals with the knife in their heads and their locks of hair, who live among their emeralds, the aged and the shining beings who prepare the moment of Osiris Ani, triumphant in peace. He maketh slaughter upon the earth, and conversely, I am strong.”140</p>
<p>“[7] KING UNAS EATS HEARTS
He has taken the hearts of the gods.
He has eaten the Red,
He has swallowed the Green
Their charms are in his belly
He has swallowed the knowledge of every god.
The lifetime of King Unas is eternity;141</p>
<p>[8] KING UNAS IS A CANNIBAL FOND OF SCALPING PEOPLE AND BONDAGE
509. UNAS devoureth men and liveth “upon the gods, he is the lord of envoys, whom he sendeth “forth on his missons. ‘He who cutteth off hairy scalps,’ “who dwelleth in the fields, tieth the gods with ropes;..”142</p>
<p>“[9] BONDAGE – MURDER – CANNABALISM – DISMEMBERMENT
THE VICTIMS THROATS ARE CUT AND THE BODY PARTS ARE BOILED IN A CALDRON AT NIGHTTIME
510. Tcheser-tep keepeth guard over them for Unas and “driveth them unto him; and the Cord master bound “them for slaughter. Khonsu the slayer of the wicked “cutteth their throats.”143
“511. and draweth out their intestines, “for it is he whom Unas sendeth to slaughter; and Shesmu “cutteth them in pieces and boileth their members in his “blazing caldrons of the night..”144</p>
<p>“[10] THE THIGHS OF THE FIRST BORN ARE HEAPED UP
513. The old gods “and the old goddesses become fuel for his furnace. The “mighty ones in heaven light the fire under the caldrons” where are heaped up the thighs of the firstborn;”145</p>

<p>So it seems that Tony Podesta is effectly a part of an satanic egyptian cult including cannibalism and sacrifice, Alesteir Crowley-like.</p>
<p>It fits with his art taste</p>',

            So did op literally google "torture chamber" and post some random bs about the most convenient occult reference on page one?
           </p>
           <p>
            Pathetic.
           </p>
           <p>
            Btw John, not Tony, is the one with hand problems.
Still in torture chamber probably means still in a meeting or just stuck at work ffs.

            <p>
             uh ? 
I didn't googled "torture chamber".
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm reading some books on satanic rituals and i was surprised to see a ritual from the egyptian "book of the dead" named torture chamber ! The terms match exactly with podesta's email.
            </p>
            <p>
             This email is a confirmation, we have to have in mind they're probably masonic/satanic/pedo, like Aleister Crowley.
            </p>
            <p>
             The thing is : to beat your enemy, you have to understand him, especially when he's strong
            </p>
            <p>
             Ps : he says "last night was fun" + "STILL in torture chamber".
            </p>
            <p>
             Imagine a satanic ritual with john involved the day before. It makes sense
            </p>
            <p>
             Imagine he was at the hospital for a surgery the day before. It does'nt.

            Yes, Tony and John Podesta are sick men. Note the subject line of the email: "Last night was fun". And then he asks John and his wife Mary if they want to go for Valentines Day dinner.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is it me or does this email imply John and Mary were over at Tony's house wife swapping in the "torture chamber". Tony had so much fun he hasn't even left the torture chamber.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please someone come up with a less disturbing explanation. I feel like vomiting right now.
