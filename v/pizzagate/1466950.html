<p>This is my first post so none of the shill business please.</p>
<p>When the news first broke if the Podesta brothers being possible susoects in the kidnapping of Madeline McCann I emailed Richard D Hall (<a href="http://www.richplanet.net/starship.php">http://www.richplanet.net/starship.php)</a>) who is a British broadcaster and has had a programme on Sky TV for a number of years.</p>
<p>Richard has done extensive research on the McCann case and I respect his views/opinions and agree with most he says.</p>
<p>He is a very likeable, good humoured and a great researcher.</p>
<p>Below is his response I received today.</p>
<p>I think he and the other person mentioned Neal Saunders (author) make some valid points.</p>
<p>•••••••••••••••••••••••••••</p>
<p>The e-fits of alleged Madeleine suspect cannot possibly be the “Podesta
brothers”.  Each of the two e-fits were constructed by two different
people and are two persons recollections of ONE alleged suspect.  So the
two e-fits are not two people.  They are in fact the same person.  This
means the e-fits are unreliable because they look so different.  Because
they represent the same person they cannot possibly be representative of
two brothers.  The whole sorry tale of how these e-fits came into
existence is also highly suspect.  They allegedly represent a sighting by
a family called the Smith family.  I dealt with this sighting thoroughly
in my film, “The Phantoms”,  watch it here,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.madeleinefilms.net/page7.php">http://www.madeleinefilms.net/page7.php</a></p>
<p>The film demonstrates clearly that all alleged sightings of an abductor
carrying Madeleine are probably fabrications.  I actually communicated
with Martin Smith, who is the father of the family allegedly responsible
for the e-fits.  Please watch the film to understand why the e-fits cannot
possibly be considered as any form of reliable evidence – for a single
abductor never mind brothers.</p>
<p>The other point to note about the e-fits, is the fact that Madeleine was
not abducted.  She was not taken from her bed.  The evidence for this
statement is contained in over 11 hours of documentary films which can be
viewed here,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.madeleinefilms.net/">http://www.madeleinefilms.net/</a></p>
<p>Or, more recently I interviewed a respected U.S. statement analysis who
also concludes that Madeleine was not abducted.  You can watch this
interview from these links.</p>

<p>As far as I am aware there is no evidence that the Podesta’s were in Praia
Da Luz during May 2007.  The claims made in online videos of this are I
suspect bogus.</p>
<p>Regarding the more general claims about the whole Pizzagate subject I
recommend that people read this analysis by researcher Neil Sanders who
has featured as a guest on my TV show many times.</p>

            Hall's conclusion is invalidated by his own research. The witnesses didn't get a good look at the suspect: the efits could have been the result of a parallel investigation or a fit-up.

            My concern with this is twofold:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              This cheapens investigation into real cults and child trafficking rings
such as Elm House, Franklin, Kincora boys home, Boys town, The Presidio,
Jimmy Savile, Penn State, Jeffrey Epstein, and Deep Creek Cabins etc etc
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This will be used as a weapon to damn the alt-media, accusing them of
spreading false news.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            You want a conspiracy theory – ok here is a plausible one. Trump (and
indeed all Politicians) hates the media – all media that does not toe his
line. Perhaps a rabid Trump supporter could be convinced to start
something like this believing he is just damaging the left when in fact he
is helping to smear the entirety of alt media. This could conceivably lead
the way for the new Grand Comptroller issuing a ban or far tighter,
draconian regulations?

            The BBC are now using the Pizzagate story to ridicule “alternative media”
and the internet
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Isn’t it a co-incidence that this story comes very shortly after many news
items declaring that “fake news” on the internet is a problem?
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-38106131">

           <p>
            In general some alternative news outlets have challenged and exposed
mainstream media over recent years for inaccurate reporting and
fabricating stories for particular agendas.  I suspect some of these
outlets have been targeted and pizzagate was seen as an ideal
dis-information story to use with which to discredit these outlets.  They
are not dumb.  If you’ve been forwarding links to “pizzagate” revelations
then you’ve probably been helping to perpetuate a psy-op whose goal is to
discredit the veracity of all information coming from the internet
