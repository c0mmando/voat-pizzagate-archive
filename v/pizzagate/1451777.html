On Wednesday, Portland, Ore. police arrested Terrence Patrick Bean, who has been charged with two felony counts of having sex with a minor last year. This man is not just any old guy accused of having sex with a 15-year-old – he’s a big-money Democratic donor and liberal political activist with connections inside the Obama White House. Bean raised more than a half-million dollars for Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign.</p>
<p>“Bean has been one of the state’s biggest Democratic donors and an influential figure in gay rights circles in the state,” reports oregonlive.com. “He helped found two major national political groups, the Human Rights Campaign and the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund and has been a major contributor for several Democratic presidential candidates, including Barack Obama.”

There are reports that Nancy Pelosi owns the pizza parlor with a goat theme. It’s apparently registered in Panama to make for convenient money laundering – or maybe just the website is registered in Panama and the business has more local ties.</p>

Goat Hill Pizza might be linked to Pelosi and Podesta, but it might also be linked the the White Rabbit case.</p>
<p>It is not clear that there is a direct link between Pelosi and Hastert. However there is a definite link between Podesta and Hastert:</p>
<p>Regarding Podesta’s art collection:</p>

<p>They are known for purchasing “awkward” works, such as video installations, that many other private collectors will not consider. “It’s easy to store them, but difficult to display them,” says Podesta. To get round the problem, he and his wife have excavated a huge subterranean vault beneath their house outside Washington – a white space 5m square and 4m high in which it will be possible to show “very complicated video pieces” on all four walls.</p>
