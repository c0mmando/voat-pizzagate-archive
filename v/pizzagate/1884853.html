<p>Apparently they would have sexual encounters in woods near a golf course (Atherstone Golf Course, Warwickshire) and ended up involving local boys in their sexual activities. They would have sex in front of them and the wife would also have sexual relations with them and the husband would sometimes film the encounters. </p>
<p>This is connected to pizzagate in many ways - chiefly, it involves elites and the BBC, which covered up for Jerry Savile, and this couple needs investigation to see if they have even more ties to elite pedophiles. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man who claims he was indecently assaulted as a child by two ex-BBC radio presenters says boys were invited to come into the trees &quot;one at a time&quot;.</p>
<p>The alleged 14-year-old victim, now in his 30s, told Warwick Crown Court he was &quot;convinced 100%&quot; that a couple he saw having sex against a tree in 1992 were Julie and Tony Wadsworth.</p>
<p>He claimed Mrs Wadsworth, now 60, performed a sex act on him.</p>
<p>The couple deny indecently assaulting under-age boys between 1992 and 1996.</p>

<p>And this from a Yahoo story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The activity started in the summer of 1992. The boys were too young by law to take part in any sexual activity or display.</p>
<p>&quot;Even though nobody forced them to do anything, that does not matter. What would happen was following observation by the lads, Julie would engage in sexual activity with them.</p>
<p>&quot;The boys were all under the age of consent, this would have been obvious to grown-ups such as Mr and Mrs Wadsworth.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms Moore said Mrs Wadsworth was &quot;doing the activity&quot;, but the defendant\'s husband watched and &quot;occasionally&quot; performed a sex act on himself.</p>

            It feels like to me that all these mid level pedos are getting thrown under the bus to both protect higher ups and squelch those voices out there that are tired of nothing is being done. I don't care how ,an of these fucks it takes,  bit by the end of this shit I hope they have to build more jails just to hold the pedos. That is, if they aren't executed  first for murdering the children.
