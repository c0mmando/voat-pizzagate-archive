<p>The letter states “As well as warning pupils about the risks of sex, lessons should also inform older pupils about sexual pleasure and how to achieve it for both themselves and a partner. Schools should teach that heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality are equally valid&quot; .  This means they\'ll be teaching little kids it\'s okay to take hormone blockers, lop off penises and breasts and, most frighteningly, teach them how to perform and receive anal sex.  This is grooming, sexualising children and child abuse.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.conservapedia.com/Peter_Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a> is a former member of PIE (Paedophile Information Exchange) and is gay. He contributed to a book with the acronym BOY that argued for the complete abolition of any ages of consent and asserted that children seek and enjoy sex with adults.

<blockquote>
<p>What purpose does it [the age of consent] serve other than reinforcing a set of increasingly quaint, minority moral values left over from the Victorian era?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chapter just after Tatchell\'s is entitled ‘Ends and Means: How to Make Paedophilia Acceptable’ and opens with an account of sexual activity between an adult and two 8-year-old boys.

<p>In 1998, Tatchell wrote an obituary in The Independent for Ian Campbell Dunn, co-founder and leader of PIE, describing him as a hero. </p>
<p>In 2000, Tatchell\'s pressure-group Outrage succeeded in forcing the UK government to reduce the age of consent for homosexuality from 18 to 16. When their victory was announced, Tatchell\'s Outrage group demonstrated displaying banners saying &quot;16 is just a start&quot;. </p>

            Seriously, at what point are the parents going to get a clue and all get together and pull their children out of school?
           </p>
           <p>
            This is ridiculous. It's actually child abuse under the guise of education. They sexualizing children and the parents are sitting idly by and waiting for permission to take action?
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep the kids home! Do it en masse! They can't throw thousands of people in prison ... although they'd like to!

            Every day I'm thankful I send my daughter to a traditional private school. I nearly didn't, as I went to a draconian dickensian nightmare of a school. But things have changed and she won't be subject to the shit I was, neither will she be subject to this perverted PIE influenced homo/paedo propaganda.

            They've lost control over how their children are taught. They lost this because of their fucked up desire to be socialists/communists.

            Peter Tatchell is an advocate of lowering the age of consent, has associations with PIE, and has written many articles on Man / Boy sex. He is filth. He wants the age of consent for sodomy lowered to 14, if not abolished. He’s been campaigning for years

            He’s outwardly anti Israel and pro Palestine and is one of those ‘Muslims and Fags unite’ clowns. He’s probably controlled ‘opposition’ whilst his true mission is to degenerate and multiculturalise the west.

              You're a douche and no doubt a shill.  With remarks like 'kill him' you are painting Voaters as rabid, violent alt-righters, which is not what we are. Go away.

               "painting Voaters as rabid, violent alt-righters".
False, You're the one trying to do that. 
I'm saying , do more than talk. If you see degenracy destroying your culture/civilization and do nothing, then you're equally as guilt.
Kill the jew. Kill the muslim. Kill anyone who means to control. you.
Not doing so, is aiding the enemy. Nothing you said alters what I've said. You've merely thrown a tantrum, a meaningless prayer against a swinging fist. ..at your face.

                I am doing my bit and by best and am utterly committed. I’ve spread the word from early days on pizzagate and got endless banned by twitter etc. I red pill my friends. I fight back and IRL I am involved in a case concerning historical abuse at an institution I attended. I have more planned and continue to push the knowledge I am not interested in salving conscience and feeling good. This is about JUSTICE. For me and all the good people. I am currently going through harassment to do with my social media posts, police harassment for posts, and trying to find somewhere to live. I have happily and gladly left the corporate world after earning well.... to help the movement. Spread the knowledge. I was involved in the early investigation and found some good info on the comet ping pong workers. I am doing it. And I want to do more. I have more research to reveal but my life is, like many survivors, chaotic, disorganised and subject to huge ups and downs. We’ll get there. I really believe so. And it’s a moral and spiritual fight. 👍🏻

                 Do what you can, when you can. There's no such thing as "doing enough' or "Doing too much". Don't ever let anyone convince you otherwise.
What you're fighting for is more than just against "culture change" it's against, culture replacement or cultural murder (yours). 
Fight with everything you have. EVERYthing.

            The People of the U.K. need to find a way to get armed and start a revolution to overthrow their sick and perverted tyrannical government who think they are the parents of their kids and them. Enough is enough!

             You're absolutely right. Their tyrannical Government knows this , which is why they've disarmed them of tools of equality.
Instead of making their own tools, they worry about how to appease their new lords, get giddy over some newborn chimp, and
get drunk dreaming about kicky ball. 
If they were going to revolt and actually make a difference, itd be done by now.

             That isn't the only example of this being stood up to. It's the only one
             <em>
              publicised
             </em>
             , but others have done similar things against this ridiculousness as well. Just because the media don't report it doesn't mean it isn't happening.

             Geee! Generalise much? You know what you see in the media about England. Scotland is far far worse for this kind of stuff. London isn't England. England still exists if you get away from the big cities. Asshole.
