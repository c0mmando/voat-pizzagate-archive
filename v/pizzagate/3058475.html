<p>It makes you wonder what Bills company really is. In all of these videos he condones pedophilia. Who names their company Kid Love Productions? Apparently Alex Jones called out Bill as well. Alot of people calling out Bill Maher Kid Love Productions. Regardless of your thoughts on Q and AJ we know something sick is going on with that company. </p>

            It's amazing, to me at least, what is right in front of us once we learn to read the language or images or signs. They put all it all out there for there "group" to see.  Once we learn their comms it is obvious that something bad is going on.

            Question:
            <strong>
             Has Q ever called out a pedo that we didn't research here before?
            </strong>
            There are a bunch of
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            posts about Bill Maher, as early as 2017.
           </p>
           <p>
            To me, it seems he is only recycling old Pizzagate research, which is fine to an extent, as it spreads some awareness, but I'd really LOVE to see him expose pedos that were not already discussed here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or did I miss something?

             I think you're looking at the problem, the wrong way around.. 
The real question ought to be.. is there any other pedos, that we havent found already.  Q can call out pedos, but you'll find that almost all of them are known already and for many years already.
They just 'slipped' through DOJ FBI before...because they were being protected.  Is there anyway to make a centralised thread that each post links all the voat posts that are made about that person...(with the posts being dated to enable chronological reconstruction (which is very important to enable understanding.. context is eveything.)

              I tend to doubt that, good sir. This goes further and deeper than most can imagine. I agree many famous ones are known, and for quite some time, but there are so many "nobodies" involved in this as well. Many, many.

Psycologists and Doctors.. you can name them.. TV producers and newspaper editors.. you can name them.  Hollywood producers and directors and actors and writers and talent scouts.. you can name them.
But there will alsways be accquistion networks that feed larger international networks like the Finders for exemple run by governement and CIA style agencies, but they were always inspired by the Royal whorehouses put in place (on an industrial scale) from Queen Victoria onwards.. (and she was married to...??)  Nobility likes to rape children..  So.. going to the real large problem with pedophilia.. why is it still a problem?  Because Royalty engages in it, and is supported by Nobility who also engage in it because.. the Churches all engage in it.  So lots of 'nobodies' doing it because the big names are all getting away with doing it.
(Im angry at the Pedophiles and those in charge, not you, please dont think Im railing against you.=))

                 it's how corruption spreads itself.  The servants dont bother playing by the rules when they see the Kings doing even worse.  Looking forward to forthcoming trials to see if anything changes.. (remember.. whenever they get caught.. they get sent to a country club for a couple of months.)

              Question: Has Q ever called out a pedo that we didn't research here before?
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Yes. Q dropped the Anderson Cooper pictures that led to anons here and on 8chan to link our research into the Tony Podesta artist that paints the dead kids to the Biltmore hotel pool.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also...
            </p>
            <p>
             Everything on this board started with the Podesta emails leaked to Wikileaks. Steve Piescenik said in November or December 2016 a group of whitehats, including Assange are responsible for helping Donald Trump stop Clinton and the deepstate from completely overthrowing the Constitution. FBIAnon leaked the pedo symbols on the FBI Record Vault for us. A year later, Q showed up and said a group of whitehats are helping Trump overthrow the globalist cabal, and he was going to be giving crumbs to provide as much transparency as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can believe that's all a BS psyop and it's just spy vs. spy.
            </p>
            <p>
             But it's somewhat of a stretch to think there are two totally
             <em>
              different
             </em>
             groups of whitehats working with Trump to drain the swamp. I'd bet a substantial sum of money that the group Piesczenik referred to and the Q team are one and the same. We're here because of the pre-election leaks that started that effort.

              Well, yes, I think it is a psy-op, as you know. I don't think Trump is draining the swamp in an universal sense, otherwise Q would attack Republican pedos as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              'Draining the swamp' here only means that one deep state faction is trying to take out the other one, imo.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've really gotten tired of Q.
             </p>
             <p>
              Imo what happened was that one guy in the GOP (forgot the name, unfortunately) called out Hillary for having had Alinsky as a mentor - he mentioned that Alinsky dedicated his 'Rules for radicals' to Lucifer. There was a big uproar (that was in June or July 2016 IIRC).
             </p>
             <p>
              I think this was when they got the idea they might want to take this further, and expose HRC and buddies, and use it for winning the elections.
             </p>
             <p>
              Q/Trump isn't hurting any Republican pedos, like he never hurt Jeffrey Epstein, before a father complained, and like he made Acosta Secretary of Labour, although he was involved in giving Epstein the lenient plea deal.

               He's part of the same church that had the Davidians as one of their offshoots..  The Koresh Messiah tool was very similiar to the Charles Manson tool..look up into cult behaviour in Africa.
The entire Q is a Psyop.  The fear I have.. is that it's Micheal Aquino (or one of his lackeys in the Church of Set) - Mind War uses psychological means to defeat you, by making you think that enemy is too big to be destroyed (too big to fail) and therefore it isnt worth fighting..  The same mindwar works, when you ensure that no fighting takes place because the battle is already won. (trust the plan)
I'd love to see all the pedo's gone down, but we all know (or ought to know) that that will never happen.. and even if you cut one head...pedophilia is an ongoing problem and always will be, regardless of networks going down (which is great.. Id never thought Id see so many go to jail.. but they always get pitiful sentences and picked up again when they get let out..) 
The other horrible thing I have in the back of my head.. is Animal Farm.  No one talks about what comes AFTER the Deep State.. or Derp State.. or Deep Shaft.. whatever you want to call the leftover Nazi's and wannabe Zionists and money hungry whore politicians in the military industrio complex that Eisehower tried his best to tell you about but no one cared..
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y">
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y
               </a>
               That was recognised and seen in the Iran Contra scandals where it was even called out for what it was...no one cared....(because they were all busy raping boys in the whitehouse to care about justice and protecting the innocents.) 
What comes after?  Trump is literally putting a Dictatorship in place and reviving the cult of the Emporor (last time that happened was Caligula.. so all the God Emporor memes.. and Trump's Praetorian Guard.. excuse my whilst I vomit copiously.. The roman Empire was built on slaves. (as all civilisations are)  I dont want to see us go back to that particular mindset.. although.. Citizens vs Non Citizens..  kind of like.. US Citizens vs Illegal Aliens at the moment.. (the thing that scares me there.. is that fascism always requires an external enemy to demonize..Us vs THEM.. I guess that's just the way humans are..
Anyway.. Im frightened that Qnauts are all horses. and Trump and Q are the pigs.  Everyone wants to see the end of the pedo networks as the control mechanism that it was/is that's controlling the politicians.
But snuff and child porn also has to be addressed.  Its porn that perverts. (and watching it can become addictive for lots of wrong reasons..its about brain chemicals..)  Even serial killers will tell you that they mostly turned due to sexual fantasies that they saw played out in pornography.

               Well, Trump made Jeb into a laughingstock, and Q has repeatedly said the two-party system is an illusion and that many on both sides are compromised. And arrests of human traffickers have gone up exponentially under Trump. As far as Acosta goes, there's a good chance Trump put him in charge of human trafficking to turn up the heat on what went down with Epstein. That certainly fits Trump's past modus operendi.

                   Republican voters became highly displeased with most of their elected officials under Bush, and they sent many of them packing. A lot of non-politicians inspired by Sarah Palin and the Tea Party ran for office during Obama era. I'd bet there are fewer pedos in office now than you think. Also, Republican leader types and constituents both tend to be big on guns. Have you ever heard of a pedo who was a Second Amendment proponent (who wasn't a Muslim radical or in a Mexican drug gang)?

                 You don't think it's possible Trump promoted him to put a target on his back? To create a feeding frenzy that would lure his enemies into exposing the Epstein fiasco in their attempts to take him down?

                 I do.

                <p>
                 And I thought so long before Q brought it up this week. Trump has built a successful brand he is very proud of. He's no idiot. Under what other logic would he put a guy who let the most infamous sex trafficker in modern memory off the hook in charge of human trafficking? Especially when the press has been trying to tie him to Epstein's crimes since before the election.

                   Where's the logic in that?  Trump did not build a $6 billion dollar business empire by not caring what his most important executives do. Nor did he do it by rewarding them for putting him in weaker position that threatened his brand. It makes no sense.

                     I think highly of him, because he has gotten impressive results. He's fulfilled more of his campaign promises than any previous president in history, and he's not finished yet. I support him because he's the only "politician" I've ever seen who does what he says he's going to do. I also support him because the most evil power abusers in the world all hate his guts and he stands up to them. So, when I see something like the Acosta thing, I'm willing to wait and see what happens.

                       No it's about optics. If President Trump starts arresting Dems for the crimes they've committed against our country, they will scream it's all political and they are being arrested as political opponents. He must have politicians from his side of the aisle arrested or investigated/brought to light too and in order to do that they have to be in positions of power such as Acosta. Since those in the mockingbird media hate anything or anyone they perceive President Trump to support, they will go after Acosta even though Acosta gave their buddy Epstein a sweet deal. Are catching my drift yet? This is more complicated than you think and what it looks like on the surface.

                       I'm not certain he wanted to be president in the first place. I am certain he wants to finish what he started, and that he does NOT want it undone by whomever else might win in 2020 -- which is exactly what would happen. Four years is not enough time to make the kinds of lasting changes he has been set on making.

                       That's a pretty arrogant assumption. I know several dozen Trump supporters, and ALL of them care about the Epstein situation and are scratching their heads about Acosta. If I didn't care about it, I wouldn't be talking about it, trying to be as informed as possible about it, or even having this conversation.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Accepting Trump's track record and being willing to wait for an explanation of an anomaly like Acosta does not equal not caring about whether a US Prosecutor was rewarded for letting a serial child rapist go free. Don't fall for the MSM/Shareblue meme that Trump supporters are just a cult of brainwashed, blind idiots.
