            The ruins of Palmyra were one of the wonders of the world-- from the area of earth's earliest civilisations. It's a tragic loss. The very letters were are using right now were invented there. As was mathematics

            First of all I have no faith in DeBlasio.  He was on Hillary's Senate Campaign.  There is also the reading of the Secret Pizza Book that he read to a classroom of children.  Those two are enough for me to make up my mind that he is not to be trusted and that he can easily be swayed by the other pedo elites (yes I believe he is one also).  Remember most politicians are in office because they are  able to be blackmailed.  He is one.
