            Stop calling it pizzagate. You look like a retard, you hurt the movement. I'm sure you're not a retard, And i'm sure you're trying to help the movement.  But I'm telling you look retarded, and you're hurting the movement by looking retarded. So stop looking retarded.. In order to stop looking retarded, you have to atleast cut pizzagate from your vocabulary... I can't help you past that, But you have zero chance NOT looking retarded, if you say the retarded name.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks Brother. Keep doing what you're doing, Bsides using the retarded name. It's literally that simple.

            I get it... This what the sub is called...But don't ever use the name pizzagate again. You're hurting everyone when you do. Simple as that. The name is dead. Stop trying to revive it. You make things worse.

            Speaking of narratives there is one being spun right now that should not be pizzagate related but since people suspect that the Republicans have suddenly flipped overnight to a strictly non-pedo blackmail party it has drug a lot of political issues into pizzagate and turned it rather swampy lately. I'm not sure this is an accident, but maybe a coordinated effort to dilute pizzagate and spin it into the swamp. People are trying to post a lot of threads about muh Russiagate, muh Al Franken, the GOOD (sarc) Saudis, etc....

            ALBERT PIKE elite Freemason spelled this plan out very clearly in his book Morals and Dogma.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Recently a meme effort was made to spin giving Jerusalem to the Talmudist Zionists as a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy. That makes me want to throw things. The Old Testament that the Zionists use is the Talmud. Nobody despises Jesus more than the Zionists.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Christianity is being killed off and replaced with Zionism. Giving Jerusalem to the Zionist is the ultimate blasphemy against Christianity.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Some people can look at this next picture and understand in one meme what just happened. "Judeo-Christianity" is "Christian Zionism" and that is oil and water and destruction of Christianity. Zionists getting their hands on Jerusalem is not the 2000 year old Jews returning to their homeland (laugh)

            People have completely forgotten about the Tea Party.  A quarter of my fb friends were die hard supporters but all went back to being pro HRC.  They can't even see what's going on.  They've programmed our brains to go from one thing to the next.  PG was nationwide and absolutely huge.  For the amount of publicity it received and now, nothing.

            Actually you have several witnesses worth of evidence.   Which is far more than you have against Podesta or Alefantis.

           <p>
            And those witnesses are backed up by supporting and contemporaneous evidence.

             Show me the evidence then??? They refused to hand over the year book because it would show it was a forgery which is now coming out to be true. We see as the mainstream media tries to brush over that aspect and sweep it under the rug. Also why would you defend the Podesta's??? There was FBI substantiated coded language which was and is used in sex trafficking of children and hoards of evidence of shady business by the Clinton's who are in very close ties to the Podesta's and others. As for your assertion that there is more evidence in the Roy Moore ALLEGATIONS then there is against Podesta or Alefantis, answer me this then ... why did Tony Podesta step down from his own company and Roy Moore is still campaigning??? Meanwhile a Senator and Congressman of the the democratic party (Franken and Conyers) both have stepped down and why is that??? It is because there is actual tangible point your finger at evidence against both of them! All they have on Moore is a Salem Witch Trial case and quite frankly Moore could be guilty but if we just throw out due process over allegations lacking any real evidence we are taking steps backwards in our Republic. Note all these ALLEGATIONS came out right before a campaign for a vacant senate seat! The timing alone should lead an honest person to be skeptical of the entire situation. I will take it a step further and blame these women if they are in fact telling the truth! If someone waits 30-40 years to report any crime it kinda takes away from their credibility. It might sound insensitive but it does not make it any less true. If you have a crime committed against you, then you must step up in reasonable time frame to hold that person accountable in our so called justice system. Stupid allegations like these and others take away from the people who really cannot speak up like children and those who have been literally silenced by death. There is so much more sex crimes that do not get reported against children because we are focused on stupid #metoo shit. It disgusts me to see people arguing over groping allegations when we have 100,000 people missing at any given time in the US alone and the number of children missing each year in the US is estimated to be around 800,000 ... how is that for contemporaneous evidence???

              This is absolutely false.   There's zero coded language in the Podesta emails AND the FBI has never substantiated any code.  What the FBI did do is talk about symbols.   None of which were in the Podesta emails.   Some pizzagaters have conflated the fake code list with the Real FBI document on the symbols.  The code list was often passed around as a screenshot.  It was just from an anonmyous internet poster, not a law enforcement document.   This is a reason I defende them.  The evidence isn't there.

              These are not in any way equivalent.  Also Podesta stepped down because of he violated the FARA act.   That is completely separate from pizzagate, no pizzagater ever mentioned this last year.

             <p>
              It's a widely used, but incorrect number.  That 800,000 is now under 500,000 and that does not mean 500,000 kidnappings a year, it includes every instance of a missing kid.  Even if they just got lost at the mall and are found with an hour.  For a better understanding of these stats, check this out.

                You don't know how an intelligence dossier works.  Raw intelligence always needs to be evaluated with other evidence to reach a determination.
               </p>
               <p>
                What Christopher Steele was reporting was what he had been told by his sources.  To determine truth you need to evaluate if the the sources are telling the truth.   Are they claiming first hand knowledge or just repeating something they heard. If they are claiming firsthand knowledge, are they in a position to have this knowledge normally?  If they are talking about a conversation between two people at the Mayflower hotel on a certain date, can you find out if those people were actually in the hotel that day?   Are they lying?   Are they telling the truth, but repeating lies that were told to them.  Is this just gossip. An example, a guy in Texas who said "I think Obama spent $65,000" on pizza and hot dogs.  Is that true or is that gossip?
               </p>
               <p>
                A lot in the dossier has checked out including details a large scale cyber campaign against the US and possession of damaging material on Clinton...just like Don Jr was promised.  This before  it was revealed the DNC emails were hacked.  Also included, details of a massive sale of part of Rosneft, Russian state oil company, he said 19% was to be sold.  19.5% was sold and people think the half percent was the brokerage fee. The number two guy at the oil company was found dead in his car.   Heart attack they said.   However, he was in the trunk of his car.  Carter Page told Congress that went to Moscow and met with high government officials and an official as Rosneft.
               </p>
               <p>
                He talking about a Russian diplomat in Florida was actually a spy.  Russian pulled him home super quick.

                Regarding the kompromat on Trump.  Here's what we do know of that night.
               </p>
               <p>
                Trump had just pulled off a big business deal for a tower in Moscow and was celebrating.
               </p>
               <p>
                He was offered prostitutes.  Trump's  bodyguard said someone wanted to send 5 prostitutes up to room, but he prevented it.  He watched Trump's door for a while and then he went to sleep.
               </p>
               <p>
                The BBC reported in January of witnesses who saw someone arguing with hotel security over the prositutes (to keep them from having to sign in apparently )
                <code>
                 “There are, though, reports of witnesses in the hotel who corroborate Steele’s reporting. These include an American who’s said to have seen a row with the hotel security over whether the hookers would be allowed up to Trump’s suite. "

                 Priceless. You talk about the pizza/dogs email being just gossip... then you turn all serious with the "Kompromat on Trump" as it was somehow backed by evidence. You write a lot of words but doesn't make a lot of sense. You don't have a clue about how an intelligent dossier work yourself. Stop pretending you care about the truth, it is not working.

                  The kompromat on Trump is backed by evidence.  But it's not at all conclusive.  I don't think the kompromat is proven at all.   The dossier itself look better all the time.

                 <p>
                  The pizza/dogs email is not backed up by anything.   And it's clearly secondhand.

                   The pizza/dogs email is real evidence. It is an authentic email leaked by WL. While it's true that there MIGHT exist an innocent explanation for the following:

                  <blockquote>
                   <p>
                    I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in
pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long
ago, assume we are using the same channels?

If this is all so innocent, it should not be too hard to answer the question: "Hey Stratfor guy, what did you mean in this pizza/dogs email?".

                      It's absolutely secondhand information.  It's obvious from his words that he uses that he is repeating something he was told.

                       Even if he was repeating something he was told as you said (the fact that he said 'I think' doesn't prove anything but let's disregard this for now), what difference does it make? What is your point? It doesn't mean the information itself is not important.

              Well, maybe never enough of them, but there have been some in state govt. that have been caught with minors and have been sentenced.  The last one I believe was in Okla.  What I meant is that we have made inroads (not enough) and they will keep trying to stop us.  But we will not let them.  We are on our way.  Today I am afraid to leave my laptop waiting for the PedoBig Reveal

               They have the ammo if they are serious. Guess we just have to wait and see.

                There is a new listing on CDAN and it implies J Epstein and R Branson.....but also in the comments was this:  a suggestion that George Clooney also be outed.
