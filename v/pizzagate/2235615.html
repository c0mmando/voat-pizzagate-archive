<p><strong>Is the House of Cards about to fall?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are dominos? What is a cascade? What is the domino effect? This domino will come last.</strong></p>
<p>Q also talked about a map:</p>
<p><strong>What is a map? Why is a map useful? What is a legend? Why is a legend useful?</strong></p>
<p>1) The references to &quot;the house of cards&quot;. Of course this refers to the HBO series. Interesting that Zero Hedge some time back thought this show was art imitating life and one of the actors, Doug Stamper, was John Podesta. I\'ve never watched it, so I don\'t know. </p>
<p><strong>Maybe when the anon told us to \'follow the cards&quot; the House of Cards show was what we were to follow.</strong> </p>
<p>(Hat tip to the perspicacious and intrepid Commoner for this insight.)</p>
<p>Another point is that &quot;card&quot; was supposed to be a code word in the Podesta emails. I know some work was done on this; if I remember correctly, &quot;cards&quot; were thought to be admission tickets to art museums. I have to look that up.</p>
<p>2) The references to &quot;dominos&quot;. Two possible meanings to dominos: </p>
<p>a) a series of geopolitical events happening in a series and dependent upon each other. The Stratfor guys used &quot;dominos&quot; in this context to describe things going on in the world scene. They also sent out for Dominos pizza a lot, too, and one guy wrote a strange &quot;domino&quot; poem which we analyzed on VOAT.</p>
<p>b)&quot;Domino&quot; of course, could also mean, in my estimation, the most sinister and horrifying revelation of the Podesta emails---what many of us concluded was a perverted, sadistic pedophile game conducted in secluded mansions on the Labor Day weekend on Martha\'s Vineyard. </p>
<p>Perhaps Q\'s reference to dominos conflates both meanings? That geopolitical events tied to the worst of the pedophiles\' activities are going down. </p>
<p>Very interesting that &quot;dominos&quot; and &quot;cards&quot; are mentioned together in Q\'s thread. If it\'s true that &quot;cards&quot; and &quot;dominos&quot; refer to the pedophile elites\' atrocities in art museums and on Martha\'s Vineyard, it would seem that exposing those criminal activities are the ultimate card to play in Trump\'s deck and that revelation would bring down their satanic house of cards more than anything. </p>
<p>It could literally cause a &quot;cascade&quot; of falling dominos.</p>
<p>3) The map reference is very intriguing because the black and white &quot;handkerchief map&quot; which Susan Sandler told John Podesta she thought was &quot;pizza-related&quot; was an especially sensational finding in the Podesta emails and caused a great deal of speculation. Of course, the legend to the notorious handkerchief was never discovered. That was the missing piece.</p>
<p>I\'ve always thought the black-and-white handkerchief map was related to dominos which are also black and white and may have been instructions to the &quot;dominos\' game which occurred in the same house the handkerchief map was found. Have written many posts about it.</p>
<p>I don\'t know about anyone else, but the &quot;domino&quot; game was the absolutely most terrifying and sinister discovery of the Podesta emails. That Q seems to be bringing up these references now is giving me the chills. I think &quot;cards&quot; were also related to Martha\'s Vineyard. Wasn\'t there an event on Martha\'s Vineyard that required cards?</p>
<p>This is taking us back months, almost a year ago. I never thought I\'d be combing through the Podesta emails again, but that seems to be where this is pointing to, unless I\'m way off base. </p>
<p>But, for all of you autists: don\'t &quot;map&quot;, &quot;domino&quot;, &quot;card&quot; all ring bells? How many times did we sift through those darned emails looking for clues about them? Maybe our hard work then is going to pay off now.</p>
<p>(This is related to pizzagate because it is about references in the Podesta emails, the source of the Pizzagate phenomenon.)</p>',

            Dio boia porka madonana che casino! The Jews AND the Italians were/are great  money people. An Italian told me about money talk..  Banks were tables like benches , that would break,  bankruptcy go under water, recede flood like the Nile, the river banks would  hold the currency....the flow...I think Casinos is where the cards are.

            I thought there was a lead regarding a name of somebody Gidon Feen, I posted about it, bc he was friend to Alefantis and Podesta and someone else....fuck...anyway, Feen worked at the podesta group.... And  Let youth Shine which  had partner's (foriegn name balahi?) that own casino resorts....The Monarch Cotel being one, I found the logo to Monarch casino in Reno Nevadaa a near match to FBI pedo logo chart, a double heart also butterfly innuendo monarch programming....so someone said something on that thread about Paddock s  involvement around that hotel in the past as a pilot.  Seems like those are houses of cards too. Not to mention in Italiana casino literally means whore house. For example it's also a swaer word, if your stuck in traffici, no pun intended, an Italian always says " Che Casino! " which sounds like K kazino to the ear. I was a kid when I went there and wow dirty mouths calling  traffic a whorehouse, something to get used to. House is CASA  and Casino is little house, except normally it would be casino, to reflect the female, but because it's utilitilized like a thing an object, the word  became male. There's problyore to that about the word casino, and why a casino is not a casino.  For one thing on a Italian, if you said Casino you would most definitely not be speaking about whorehouse, only little house would be understood.

            Casinos seems pretty much like where the cards are. And also happen to b a place where sex traffic already happens with adults that's well known. Who knew kids were involved, are they? Seems llikely. I wish this phone weren't all cracked, I'll die of cancer regardless from all the shards...what is a map? What is a legend... Grrrr why the weird questions!!! Angry angry.  Please just fucking debrief us already Q

            "Follow the Cards" reminded me of this years 2017 cover of Economics.  I think we are in THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE time, which is the second to the last card which is THE STAR with the COMET and the little kids faces in the center of the stars. The TRUMP card!
