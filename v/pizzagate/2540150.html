<p>LOS ANGELES, CA, USA, May 9, 2018 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Director Omar W. Rosales releases his new book ‘American Cult’ about the NXIVM sex cult that recruited Hollywood heavyweights. The novel goes into detail about NXIVM brainwashing techniques.</p>
<p>“The group uses sleep deprivation, indoctrination, and group sessions to reinforce their lessons,” noted Rosales. “There was some bizarre stuff going on. The members worshipped Keith Raniere as their Vanguard and saw him as a Messiah. They claimed he was a concert pianist, the world’s smartest man, and that he could tell your complete personality by playing Volleyball with you. None of it was true.” He said.</p>
<p>Rosales directed the award-winning documentary film Heaven in Exile about His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Tibetan refugees. While he was editing his film, Rosales was recruited by NXIVM cult members. “I was tricked into taking the classes. I was told I would meet more people in Hollywood and industry insiders,” said Rosales. He continued, “The classes are good at first, but people are being brainwashed. The Cult wants you to devote your entire life to NXIVM and take classes that never end.”</p>
<p>NXIVM would also force members to open NXIVM-affiliated businesses. These businesses would then fail, because no one but other cult members would use them. Rosales observes, “Kristin Kreuk’s business was Girls by Design. It had no business plan and provided NXIVM-based empowerment and leadership lessons to young girls. Allison Mack’s business was Juicy Peach. In the logo she designed 10 years ago, Allie drew an upside-down vagina, with a bloody bite mark. The mark was in the same spot where she later mutilated her sex slaves.”</p>
<p>“The whole thing was sick. I’m glad these folks went down in flames,” he says. “After I finished my film, I put the experience out of my mind. It all came back when the story broke about the sex slaves and branding,” said the Director. “As a community, we need to recognize and put a stop to these groups, especially the ones that take advantage of young actors.”</p>
<p>Rosales now works as a Disabled Rights advocate. He is a former Marine and attorney. The book American Cult is available on Amazon.

            The "classes" eerily remind me of scientology. That's exactly what they do.. they push their people to devote their entire life to taking never ending "betterment" classes.

             For sure.  I'm rewatching Leah Remini's series on HULU exposing Scientology...about half way through Season 2 now.  You could literally replace the word "NXIVM" with "Scientology" in the original post and it would be true.  Not surprising though because most cults use these tactics of mind control in one form or another.
            </p>
            <p>
             For those wanting to learn cult mind control tactics, Remini's series on Scientology (HULU) is a really good place to start and fascinating!

             The "classes" eerily remind me of the 'Kindergarten' system we implemented throughout our society post WWI...

             I can't believe people are dumb enough to fall for this stuff.  Really.  I just can't.  Even just hanging around with those nut bags you just have to know your are gonna end up in trouble.  Yikes.

               Many are generational cults that use and groom children in the family as well.  There are all kinds of cults hiding out under the radar that people have no clue of.  If we were to poke this sleeping giant of evil, people would be shocked out of their gourds.  If you want a real wake up read the comment history of our SRA Survivor here,

               I did a post on her where she pops in to talk.  She is my inspiration.

               She was part of a family cult and what happened to her is astonishing and the fact that she has lived to tell the tale and name her abuser is a miracle beyond belief.  How she has survived is beyond me.  I talk to her quite often we are now friends.  She is in our prayers quite often.

                I've already researched SRA years ago.  Still do in small doses but I can't immerse myself in it anymore for obvious reasons.  I know what I need to know without all the gory details again.  That research is literally the reason why I believe in a God now.

                 Yes, God is what they are trying to kill by committing those horrid crimes, especially on the children.  Our SRA Survivor in the post, she still very much believes in God.  Not the Church as it is,  but God.  This is what we must not let happen, people leaving God.  Prayer to God is not supporting the church.
