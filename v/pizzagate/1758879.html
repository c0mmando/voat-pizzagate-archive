             The Brock Shills get restless and are paid overtime when there is another story happening the Deep State doesn't want talked about.
Any verification yet of the Epstein, Kosovo and Iraq organ trafficking story?  Or is that the elephant hiding in the corner while people watch the shiny object (Flynn immunity claims) in the newsroom?

              Here's another angle on the Flynn story

              </a>
              <br/>
              Excerpt: "The picture evolving here (lots of sleuthing and sources) is this:
An Israeli company (or whoever is behind it) wants a gas pipeline to Turkey. It hires Flynn and Alptekin to arrange a positive climate for the Leviathan pipeline within the Turkish government. It offers Flynn more than half a million for a little (4-month long) influence work. His job is to create a “friendly atmosphere” for the deal by using his influence in the U.S. to accommodate Erdogan. A major point that is expected from Flynn is to arrange the handover of Gülen, by whatever means, from the U.S. to Erdogan."

               Canadian airport employees ID’d as ISIS supporters
              </p>
              <p>
               "A troubling new report suggests Montreal’s Trudeau International Airport has been infiltrated by radicalized individuals.
              </p>
              <p>
               The investigation found that one employee with airport security clearance reportedly shared Islamic State propaganda videos, including graphic imagery of torture and murder, through social media accounts.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another individual, according to the report, suggested that the November 2015 Paris massacre, carried out by Islamic State agents, needed to be replicated.
              </p>
              <p>
               One of the radicalized employees reportedly had direct access to runways and aircrafts at Montreal’s airport. This employee allegedly had a great deal of knowledge and documentation about military-calibre assault weapons. 
And yet, according to the report, this individual still works at the airport, and has simply been moved to a new post — away from runways and aircraft."
              </p>
              <p>
               And this in the article too!
              </p>
              <p>
               "According to Jean Pierre Fortin, a spokesman with the Customs and Immigration Union, there is a “crisis at hand” when dealing with our borders.
              </p>
              <p>
               The ongoing surge in asylum claims and illegal border crossings along shared Canada-U.S. land border has left the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) scrambling for resources.
              </p>
              <p>
               “We’ve had to shift officers from the Trudeau-Montreal airport to the land borders to deal with the surge,” Fortin said in a phone interview."
              </p>
              <p>
               So the land border issues cause ISIS supporters to find gainful employment at the Airport.  That would never happen here. /sarc

             Flynn indeed has a story to tell.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is this pizzagate or what? Remember it's ONLY been the FLYNN's father&amp;son that ever tweeted about Pizzagate, now this post castigates a cloud on Flynn for what?
            </p>
            <p>
             The truth is FLYNN &amp; COMEY are about to investigate pizzagate and go public, and isn't that what you all wanted all along? yes or no?
            </p>
            <p>
             The sad fact is you are selective, you want the DEM Pedo's, but you want the rePUG pedo's to be exempt from prosecution.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is an irony isn't it, that TRUMP's team on 4chan &amp; reddit "TheDonald", created pizzagate, but it went viral, and the shoved it over to voat/pizzagate where it is heavily controlled not to mention 'trump', who of course is a major player, and showed up the most often in Epstein "little black book".
            </p>
            <p>
             Flynn of course and his son tweeted ( that's twitter compeche bot? ) that pizzagate was real, and that's what this is all about Flynn would not stop talking to Comey about investigating and of course TRUMP long ago made a deal with Hillary that he would NOT talk about fucking the children, if she didn't thus CLINTON&amp;TRUMP have been silent about pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             This PISSED Flynn off, main reason he went on board the good ship TRUMP, is that he drank the kool-aide and thought Trump was the real-deal, well Flynn found out that Trump is just another mafia made-man in the DEEP-STATE Pedo-Dollar machine.
            </p>
            <p>
             Joo-Bucks would have no value, if not accepted by Saudi for Oil, and Saudi would never accept toilet paper ( joo-bucks ) unless the USA in 1972 promised unlimited children to be used in Saudi as sex slaves and household pets. Israel &amp; Saudi have had a happy time for the past 40+ years, and nobody in the Deep State wants anything to change, well except for people like Flynn, and Comey.

              You make some compelling points.  I hope you are dead wrong in these points.  At some point, sooner or later,  we all may have to entertain the idea that Trump is in on this demonic activity.  That being said, that time is not yet upon us.  This is going to go down as THE biggest scandal in modern political history and bringing a conclusion to it will take more than the 6 months its been since this has been a story....
             </p>
             <p>
              We must all continue to stay focused and vigilant in our investigative efforts.  The path to victory is in sight and we to continue to create and promote positive energy into this effort.

            I don't think so...at all. but then again who knows. Until something really happens all we can do is move forward, and soldier on. We have to continue to try and stop it. Just because he was in two wars that were all a part of the big cabal, does not mean he knew that there was something nefarious about it. He like all our good soldiers, it is possible was equally mislead. I supported Bush, now that I am learning differently, I am highly disturbed. Maybe Flynn found out about all of this stuff after the fact and he has waited until someone like Trump came along to do something about it. You know that going after these people is deadly... Trump is the only one who could do this with the right folks. But even He is going to have a hard time at it.

            Flynn indeed has a story to tell.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this pizzagate or what? Remember it's ONLY been the FLYNN's father&amp;son that ever tweeted about Pizzagate, now this post castigates a cloud on Flynn for what?
           </p>
           <p>
            The truth is FLYNN &amp; COMEY are about to investigate pizzagate and go public, and isn't that what you all wanted all along? yes or no?
           </p>
           <p>
            The sad fact is you are selective, you want the DEM Pedo's, but you want the rePUG pedo's to be exempt from prosecution.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is an irony isn't it, that TRUMP's team on 4chan &amp; reddit "TheDonald", created pizzagate, but it went viral, and the shoved it over to voat/pizzagate where it is heavily controlled not to mention 'trump', who of course is a major player, and showed up the most often in Epstein "little black book".
           </p>
           <p>
            Flynn of course and his son tweeted ( that's twitter compeche bot? ) that pizzagate was real, and that's what this is all about Flynn would not stop talking to Comey about investigating and of course TRUMP long ago made a deal with Hillary that he would NOT talk about fucking the children, if she didn't thus CLINTON&amp;TRUMP have been silent about pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            This PISSED Flynn off, main reason he went on board the good ship TRUMP, is that he drank the kool-aide and thought Trump was the real-deal, well Flynn found out that Trump is just another mafia made-man in the DEEP-STATE Pedo-Dollar machine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joo-Bucks would have no value, if not accepted by Saudi for Oil, and Saudi would never accept toilet paper ( joo-bucks ) unless the USA in 1972 promised unlimited children to be used in Saudi as sex slaves and household pets. Israel &amp; Saudi have had a happy time for the past 40+ years, and nobody in the Deep State wants anything to change, well except for people like Flynn, and Comey.

              Trump don't fuck them in the pussy, it hurts the merchandise, him and Epstein ONLY fucked the little virgins in the ass, if they cooperated then they went on to become little whore in the Trump Casinos, otherwise they were sent the door, about a dozen parents went to the cops over the years, most were bought off, or threatened by the mafia ( Roy Cohn trumps mentor was #1 NYC  mob lawyer ), Trump is a "MADE MAN", he is OLD NYC MOB, pretty boy goyim for the joo mob of nyc.
