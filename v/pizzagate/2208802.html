            One of the main places the Icke shape shifting lizard stories come from is Icke's interview with ritual abuse survivor Arizona Wilder. The video is still on youtube as "Revelations Of A Mother Goddess.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her tormenters convinced her that they were shifting into lizards and her memories of it are very real to her. She describes it in such vivid detail that it is amazing. Her testimony of ritual abuse is so similar to other survivors that I do not believe she is faking being a ritual abuse survivor. I think she really was abused.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like many survivors her memories may be a mixture of reality and her programming mixed together.  I think it is probably implanted screen memories of lizards because I have not been able to believe that they really turn into lizards.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lizard thing is an enigma. I have heard other survivors talking about their abusers faces "shifting" in the context of suddenly vibrating and becoming blurry and morphing in shape. Supposedly these were not during times of torture or drugging but who knows.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have also seen a girl who was not a mind control victim say she was having sex with a guy and that his face "vibrated or something" and went in and out of focus. She slowly learned that this guy was a cult member.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not sure where the truth is on all this but I do think that Arizona Wilder's testimony and belief in shape shifting lizards played a large part in this meme, and perhaps Icke's speaking about it. According to Icke he has heard the shape shifting stories from survivors other than Arizona Wilder too if my memory serves me correctly.

             iirc he claims "divine inspiration". He used to be a sports commentator. He kinda lost his shit at one point, and suffered some mental issues. I read one of his books many years ago and I think he attributed it to a spirit and his calling.

            Lizards and Icke.

            With 9/11,
           </p>
           <p>
            when you get to the point where you can see it as a controlled explosion,  can see the powder emerging, your ordinary mind must change.  This hurts like hell.  An enormous void emerges over which you must leap.  It's going to  be lonely over there.   Cognitive dissonance demands we grasp a new understanding of reality, or run back to the old.
           </p>
           <p>
            The new one says, it must have been a planned event.  That changes everything a person has thought about the people in power over all.  Either you have the prior experience to follow your own eyes, nose, ears, or you don't.  Being able to think alone is rare, we all desperately want to be a part of our groups consensus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seeing 9/11 as a planned event, is a current litmus test of insanity.  Say that and your a nut case, a certified conspiracy theorist and an outcast.  The perceived validity of this sanity test is eroding slowly.
           </p>
           <p>
            The same sort of sanity test is being set up here consistently.  If you follow David Icke it's only so far or your smeared with Lizard sauce.  That can't be true they claim, therefore,...
           </p>
           <p>
            Many fine people here are ready to acknowledge that Icke has been speaking difficult to swallow truths for 20 plus years,   But then they add a disclaimer, ".....except with this lizard thing, he's obviously full of it".  How do they know this for sure?

            David Icke over time seems to be more and more of a prophet... Millions of people though, including myself, have a problem with the Lizard-reptilian hybrid theory of his..... I will say this regarding that: Time is aiding that theory as well. I'm not sold on it, but there does appear to be coinciding evidence of the Reptilian theory that dates back previous to Icke. Only time will tell.

             I'm with you on this. These days I keep my eyes wide open and keep my mind wide open to anything and everything. One thing is for sure, there is much much more to all of this than any of us yet realise. I use to cringe every time Icke mentioned shape shifting lizards, not anymore, I have now seen way too much to just disregard what that guy says. 
 When you start looking deeper into quantum computing and how it works, you might be swayed into believing the multi dimensional universe could in fact be very much a reality.

              He has been right about sooo much eg satanic ritual abuse, pedophilia in government  9/11 zionism etc etc. My question for this forum is what if he is right about the lizards too? ....we know they tourture children and drink blood....this doesnt seem very 'human' to me.

              That's what I was thinking. But sometimes, when I consider that Satan seems to be able to change his form, I wonder if there might be some truth in what Icke talks about.

               Ickes reptilian presentations have been very literal and not just illustrations to hypothesize on. He has a lot of "out there" shit.  Great to see him be gaining public cred with this though.

              It’s an allegory, and it’s a reference to the primitive part of the human brain, often referred to as the ‘lizard brain’, which is responsible for fear and aggression. The limbic system is where compassion and care manifest, and neocortex is where abstract thought emerges. So, when you understand the central nervous system, David Icke’s message can be interpreted easily. You must be symbol literate to understand his and many other teachings, new and ancient.

            I'm sure that slapping ass story was purposeful.  His 'apology' is deflection.

            He was charged with abuse yesterday, it came out.  What more will it take for people to realize what this man is capable of?  Has he really apologized?  I can't believe it.  They think they rule the world and our children are theirs for the taking.  Sick perverted vermin.  I want him taken down before he finally dies.  And her too. Her always sitting there with her head up high.  Time to expose the Nazis.
