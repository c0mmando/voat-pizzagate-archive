<p>In probing what would become one of the most disturbing cases of serial child molestation in Minnesota, the detectives also uncovered a history of missed opportunities and reluctance to expose a potential scandal. According to the investigative file, obtained by the Star Tribune under the Minnesota Data Practices Act, the detectives learned that in the early 1970s, Jacobs had lost as many as three teaching jobs because he fondled children, yet in each case, his supervisors kept the situations quiet.</p>
<p>They learned that in 1993, after Jacobs rose quickly in his new career as a police officer, a top state law enforcement official heard from someone who was molested years earlier by Jacobs but settled the issue with a private meeting. Jacobs\' employer, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, was never told.</p>
<p>Not until a 15-year-old boy came forward to say the man he knew as &quot;Uncle Bill&quot; had been touching him for years did Jacobs finally face the consequences for his crimes. Where so many others had looked away, the teen looked his abuser in the eye in a Minneapolis courtroom. Jacobs was sentenced in May to 18 years after he pleaded guilty to second-degree criminal sexual conduct.</p>
<p>By then, nearly two dozen men claimed Jacobs had abused them as early as 1962.</p>
<p><strong>this is connected to pizzagate by the obvious, police connections, coverups, violated trust</strong></p>',

            I personally know someone who was molested by this man while a student at Blake school. Blake is a very prestigious private school. Senator Al Franken attended school there.
