            : I've been contacted about this submission being repeatedly deleted, and I would like to add my two cents.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, I want to say that I do believe
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/HopingToHelp">
             @HopingToHelp
            </a>
            is right about posting this to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            , as per the definition of Pizzagate that he very correctly quoted with the right emphasis in the original post. But on the other hand, I can also see how someone not having already familiarized themselves with Becki's story would question the relevance of this particular submission, as it assumes some prior knowledge on Becki that is not explicitly stated as part of this post. All in all, the problem with this submission is not a lack of relevance, but a lack of
            <em>
             demonstrating
            </em>
            that relevance.
           </p>
           <p>
            To clear doubts about rule 1 once and for all, I've put some effort into creating a sourced intro that can be included in every Becki post in the future, to connect her, with timestamped links, to the systematic and high-level facilitation of child sex trafficking, also known as Pizzagate. Feel free to use this, or something similar, for future Becki posts to avoid confusion and frustration:

              I agree with your removal, the relevance indeed wasn't clearly demonstrated. Plus this is a really subjective one anyway, I personally think that a victim testimony talking about how their abuse and trafficking was satanic in nature should be considered relevant until it's proven to be a hoax, since victim testimonies are actually treated as evidence before court, but I can totally see the validity of arguments against that as well.

            HopingToHelp, does Becky claim her abuse was perpetrated and/or covered up by the elite "Pedocracy" (the rich and powerful, government or church agents)? That's what
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/GoPluckYourself">

            If my step brother puts on a Moloch mask and makes me play Sacrifice-the-Naked-Virgin, it could be Satanic Ritual Abuse but not directly related to Pizzagate, as defined in the sidebar. Not trying to be snarky, just trying to clarify. General testimony about SRA belongs in

            . Direct linkage to the "Pedocracy" belongs here.

            So...can you link us up to the direct connection? Thank you. :)

            This is a post about the personal account of a victim and nowhere in it do you say anything about how this sra relates to pizzagate.
