<p>All of the bands I could find on youtube performing at the Bar were Death Metal/Black Metal or Punk bands. Yet they are described as &quot;kid-friendly&quot; with features like pinball, a photobooth). Notice also &quot;minors permitted&quot; You would think that means maybe during the day but no, that seems to apply at all times which seems strange to me since where I come from that would never be tolerated at a bar at night.</p>
<p>From a yelp review:</p>
<p>&quot;It was a busy day, there was a dude checking ID\'s at the door...that\'s cool...except the fact there are like 4 babies in this place. Instead of checking my ID maybe call child protective services because I\'m pretty sure that baby isn\'t 21, and I am pretty sure both mommy and daddy are drinking. &quot;...&quot; I like this place, but I have a real issue with bar babies.&quot;</p>
<p>Google lists it as &quot;kid-friendly&quot; :</p>

<p>Reading through rest of the reviews on Yelp is like reading through rejected fan fiction of It\'s Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes. It\'s seriously some of the worst reviews I\'ve ever read:</p>
<p>&quot;In short, the place was dirty, the food was tasteless, and the waitstaff gave us major attitude when we pointed out to them that they had overcharged us by $15, claiming we had 5 beers when we had only had one. When we pointed this out, the bartender claimed that &quot;well it was on the ticket that you had five--I havent been here the whole time&quot; She had been there the whole time actually, and I dont care really what your bad excuse is for being careless...when a customer points out a mistake of that magnitude, attitude is not acceptable--an &quot;Im sorry let me make this right&quot; is called for. I finally got my partial refund in cash which was strange, but we were just trying to get out of there at that point.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We were hungry and wanted to order some nachos, a shot and a couple more beers. We waved our hands, put a wad of cash on the bar, whistled, and yelled. I think the bearded bartender was on E or in a K hole, because all he could do was dance and shake his tail.... Literally, he was wearing fox tails in the back of his pants. About 15 minutes after moving up to the bar, we finally got our $9 shot of Bulliet, downed that baby as fast as we could, and ran across the street for some tacos and good service.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;One, the people working here really need to fucking focus. Look at me. Take my order. It\'s really irritating that you\'re either so stoned you don\'t know where you are or I\'m not your childhood friend so you\'re going to completely ignore me until you finish your conversation with the 7 dwarfs dressed in all black. Second, turn down the fucking music. I like loud. I like very loud. There is no reason however to turn the volume to painful levels. If I can\'t hear myself screaming at my friend then YOU are doing something wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The music may be up to the discretion of the bartender - it might be classic country (played way too loud) or death metal being played mid-day. The pinball machines, pool table, photo booth, and ample outdoor seating are a great bonus and bring in a interesting mix of people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Waiting to order at the bar I was wondering if someone had pissed under the bar - seriously strong. Maybe someones catheter bag broke?&quot;
&quot;In general it is sticky in this bar. Bathrooms are disgusting. Dark and dirty - but the drinks are strong and cheap. I have not eaten here - I\'m too scared.&quot;
&quot;The bathrooms are incredibly disgusting. The clientele for the most part appear to be unemployed hipsters&quot; 
&quot;Also, the bathrooms are horrifying. Jesus Christ.&quot;
&quot;There is a terrifyingly narrow bathroom that I was too scared to go in. Even the full size bathroom was a but terrifying. Not dirty, just dark, cold, and reminded me of a torture chamber. &quot;</p>
<p>There are plenty more outrageous stories.</p>
<p>&quot;Calling us all faggots was really professional of you. I really appreciate the 4th grade insult especially after the tip I left you.&quot;
&quot;I sat down at the bar, looked at the menu, then this blonde ***** of a bartender rudely asked what I want and if I don\'t say in the next two seconds she\'s going to the next person. &quot;</p>
<p>I\'ve compiled much of them in the comments in this thread (where there is also some more info)</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1579249">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1579249</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/alleyway-cafe-and-bar-portland?adjust_creative=dWJMtmYxpd5N5yoyzSuhtA&amp;utm_campaign=yelp_api&amp;utm_medium=api_v2_business&amp;utm_source=dWJMtmYxpd5N5yoyzSuhtA">And the rest of them are here</a></p>
<p>And to get a picture of the type of impression this place I decided to find how many times the word &quot;hipster&quot; was used to describe it, just in the comment section where I posted the other links. 19. Yes, 19 times.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/KAeH8Hl">http://imgur.com/KAeH8Hl</a></p>
<p>If I were to describe to you a venue and describe it as a hipster bar/restaurant that has kid-friendly features, hosted punk/metal concerts for all ages and had some strange and creepy artwork inside you\'d think I was talking about Comet Ping Pong. I am starting to think the loud metal music may be used to cover up other noise and that is a disturbing thought. I mean they can\'t really like this music that much can they?</p>
<p>I am looking to find evidence that the bar is in fact owned by Scott Cummings, even in part that would prove to be extremely damning when taken into context with the evidence we have found already. I need more people on this as well since I\'ve only looked at this for a few hours now and there is already a lot of very disturbing stuff I\'m discovering!</p>
<p>P.S. Can someone verify that this comment from &quot;woolming.fam&quot; is Scott Cummings? I seemed to gather that from the comments in the other thread but couldn\'t verify it: <a href="http://archive.is/6aaZ3">http://archive.is/6aaZ3</a> </p>
<p>That is the absolute worst so far imo, worse than any of the Alefantis stuff and there is no way this can be brushed off as innocent or a &quot;joke&quot;.</p>',

           And to get a picture of the type of impression this place I decided to find how many times the word "hipster" was used to describe it, just in the comment section where I posted the other links. 19. Yes, 19 times.

           If I were to describe to you a venue and describe it as a hipster bar/restaurant that has kid-friendly features, hosted punk/metal concerts for all ages and had some strange and creepy artwork inside you'd think I was talking about Comet Ping Pong. I am starting to think the loud metal music may be used to cover up other noise and that is a disturbing thought. I mean they can't really like this music that much can they?
          </p>
          <p>
           I am looking to find evidence that the bar is in fact owned by Scott Cummings, even in part that would prove to be extremely damning when taken into context with the evidence we have found already. I need more people on this as well since I've only looked at this for a few hours now and there is already a lot of very disturbing stuff I'm discovering!
          </p>
          <p>
           P.S. Can someone verify that this comment from "woolming.fam" is Scott Cummings? I seemed to gather that from the comments in the other thread but couldn't verify it:

           That is the absolute worst so far imo, worse than any of the Alefantis stuff and there is no way this can be brushed off as innocent or a "joke".

            Congenital Anomaly Register and Information Service (CARIS) Is he tagging children with congenital anomalies??? They have the coloboma eyes.
           </p>
           <p>
            DMT and the circadian rhythms (PAX6) impact on ageing.
           </p>
           <p>
            PAX6 is related to the eyes along with PAX2. PAX6 is significant because it is the connecting pineal/occular piece.
           </p>
           <p>
            PAX2 is related to cellular death.
           </p>
           <p>
            PAX3 I imagine is the PHI gene in that case, the form of the objects, whereas PAX6 is functional.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes he is tagging those children with that condition. The reason Mads eye keeps changing, is because she was possibly cloned and the public sympathy garnered subconsciously ushers in acceptance for the practice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes indeed they are looking for particular genetics to clone. They want Aryan and not in the sense of blonde hair/blue eyed. It has more to do with Neoteny and also a particular bloodline which harbours congenital mutations within the pax genes, such as ouroboros eye. Hence, the pick children with this distinction.

            This mark is known as being indicative of a very particular genetic mutation.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Snake-in-the-eye" as part of Sigurd's name denoted a physical characteristics. He was born with a mark in his left eye, described as the image of the Ouroboros (a snake biting its own tail) encircling the pupil of his eye. The snake mark had been prophesied by his mother Aslaug, the daughter of the Valkyrie Brynhildr. Source:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigurd_Snake-in-the-Eye">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            In modern times, it has been suggested that the mark in Sigurd's eye was a result of a congenital mutation of the PAX6 gene. Source:
            <a href="http://en.rodovid.org/wk/Person:58462">

           <p>
            Ok, so now we an occult reference to the genetic eye mutation, the snake which eats it's tail Ouroborus
           </p>
           <p>
            Also we know SOROS and MCCANN share this common trait.
           </p>
           <p>
            As PAX6 is known to affect the pineal gland, as referenced above through academically citable sources, it is interesting to know rationalwiki cites that 50% of the population's pineal glands will have calcified by age 12 source:
            <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pineal_gland">
             http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Pineal_gland
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I hypothesis (no source needed mods) that this may well be another genetic quirk and relevant to the consciousness and capacity of the individual.

            For this to manifest in an individual both parents would have to be genetic carriers of the congenital Pax6 Mutation. Both the Scandinavian Ring Dynasty/Rosomani, and the Pictish Agathyrsi had their origins in the Albian/Black sea region and migrated North and West through the Baltic, across the Swyddian Soleyar (Scandinavian Peninsula) to Alba Scotia (Scotland). It is likely that both tribes were carriers of the same Pax6 Genetic mutation that was responsible for cases of Anaridia among the Khazarian population from which the Judean family of Herodias (also carriers of the Pax6 mutation) originated. source:

           <p>
            Yes, it is commonly found as a visual indicator of a deeper genetic quirk within the Pax6 transcriptor.
It's also largely involved in our sense of smell, the olfactory bulb is responsible for neurogenesis, the production of stemcells, which are critical to organ and clone engineering.

             I think what makes it even more sick and strange is that it's a man commenting that and the winky face. As a mother of 2 myself, if one of my guy friends commented this about one my girls, I would most definitely be weirded out. Plus, it was completely out of context of the picture. Like WTF does undies have anything to do with this picture?

            May have been eluding to the kid wearing undies instead of diapers because toilet training. The mother replied "success today" which I think probably means with the toilet.

             It still seems like an inappropriate thing to comment on social media, especially with the wink...

             The girl in the photo appears to be Quinlin, daughter of Michael Cummings and Nicole.

            </p>
            <p>
             I would think there are way more appropriate ways to comment about that on social media and even to be commenting about that at all seems strange to me. On the other hand it would be such an outrageous comment to post on a picture of a child without that being the context that it does seem plausible. It is also possible it is something of an inside joke as well, playing on that ambiguity. But it is a good point, the undies/no diaper is a lot less disturbing than undies/no undies context and it is an explanation that would make this less damning.

              They are just talking to each other in their own way which is totally innocent and not expecting that Alefantis would create a shit storm that would make people look at their innocent little inner family conversations about the kid learning to use the toilet and succeeding to not wetting the bed. I think you should probably drop it.
             </p>
             <p>
              But since this account with that pic and conversation was the only one that hadn't gone private, if it goes private today then you know they kept it public until today to entice investigators into focusing on some innocent posts and making wrong conclusions.

            Since you mention myspace, there was a breach a while back where it was possible for anyone to view private photos.  Archives were on freenet last time I checked.  If any of the pizzagate cast of characters had myspace accounts, this might be worth pursuing.  Just a thought.

             I tried downloading this but I can't seem to get it to work. I've never been able to access Corey Woolman's account f.e. If someone else wants to have a go at it by all means, there might well be something in there.

              The myspace dump was from early 2008.  Would that still be of interest or was that too long ago?

              Here's the story about the myspace security leak.

              My Freenet isn't working as of a week or two ago. Freenet is very decentralized so I won't think paranoid thoughts. I'll try to get those photos downloaded.

            Great post, OP. The girl in the last photo you shared, is it me or does she too have bags under her eyes?

             She seems to, but I just looked it up and I'm not sure that is damning in and of itself:

              According to this
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "There are a number of reasons for dark circles under your baby's eyes, and almost all are normal, says pediatrician Tanya Remer Altmann"
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm no expert but it seems like it does not have to indicate abuse or neglicence.
