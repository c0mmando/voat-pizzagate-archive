<p>A 15-year-old boy is missing from the nation’s largest shelter for migrant children in Texas, according to multiple media reports.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Southwest Key Programs said the boy was being housed at Casa Padre in Brownsville, Texas, a converted former Walmart that can hold up to 1,500 children. The site has become an epicenter of controversy following the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy that has seen thousands of immigrant children separated from their parents and placed in such facilities.</p>
<p>The shelters, however, appear to have limited abilities to keep children in their custody. On Saturday afternoon, the boy, who had been held at Casa Padre for more than a month, reportedly walked out of the building and did not return, according to The New York Times and CNN.</p>
<p>Jeff Eller, Southwest Key’s spokesman, said the group could not legally require migrant children to stay at the facility if they wanted to leave, noting their only recourse was attempting to talk them into staying.</p>
<p>“As a licensed child care center, if a child attempts to leave any of our facilities, we cannot restrain them,” Eller said in a statement to CNN. “We are not a detention center. We talk to them and try to get them to stay. If they leave the property, we call law enforcement.”</p>
<p>The boy’s departure has been reported to authorities and he has been registered in the missing children’s database, according to CNN.</p>
<p>Eller told the Times that while the event was rare, some children had left the group’s shelters before, though he declined to give a firm number. He said that less than 1 percent of kids who come through Southwest Key have chosen to leave.</p>
<p>Facilities like Casa Padre house children who were separated from their parents amid the Justice Department’s crackdown at the border, but also those that were detained at the border alone. The boy who left the site on Saturday arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border by himself, according to The Times.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s White House says it is working to execute a plan to reunite many of the migrant children detained in recent months with their families, although the effort is likely to be complicated and take some time. Many of the children have spread out between locations throughout the United States like Casa Padre.</p>
<p>The government said Saturday some 522 kids ensnared in the border separations had already been returned to the parents and the reunification process “well coordinated.”</p>
<p>“The United States government knows the location of all children in its custody and is working to reunite them with their families,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. The agency said that 2,053 children removed from their families are still in custody.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The Pentagon will make space available on military bases for as many as 20,000 unaccompanied migrant children detained after illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, a spokesman said Thursday.</p>
<p>It\'s not clear which bases will be used to house the children. HHS has assessed facilities on four military bases, but the Pentagon said it has not been told which, if any, of the four will be used. The Pentagon said it will have no role in operating the temporary shelters, which would be controlled by HHS.</p>
<p>The four bases already assessed as potential shelter locations are Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas, plus three bases in Texas: Dyess Air Force Base, Goodfellow Air Force Base and Fort Bliss.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Wednesday he is not involved in decisions about housing migrant children detained after crossing the border. But he said the Pentagon will provide whatever support is requested by either the Department of Homeland Security or HHS. The Pentagon memo to Congress said that as of Wednesday it had received no request from DHS.</p>
<p>The children who would be housed on military bases are those who cross the border illegally by themselves, as opposed to those accompanied by adults. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep together children and parents apprehended for crossing the border illegally for at least 20 days. The order also directs the Justice Department to fight in court to permanently remove the threat of separation.</p>
<p>The Missing Boy has me worried.  He was there for a whole month without leaving.  Recently there have been a lot of people buzzing around that Center.  Did someone find that boy too hard to pass up?  I hope they find him.  He has been reported to the Missing Children\'s Cente., Why do they not release his picture?  There are too many unanswered questions.</p>
<p>Children being housed at the Military Bases is a good idea if it\'s done right.   But one thing jumped out at me.  Little Rock Arkansas.  PADLOCK IT.</p>',

             Right.  There is some serious reason to question this boy's disappearance.  Since he arrived by himself, there is no parent to hook him up with either.  No one will ask questions.  You can bet LE down there has been bought up for a long time.  They set that up right away.  This is a very lucrative money maker for many investors and politicians and elite.  The are going to fight this to the finish.  As I said, look at all those that went down there right now.  The sanctimonious ones.

            I wonder about the workers at these places
           </p>
           <p>
            are they the same people who worked there under previous Presidents?  maybe because they have expirence?
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe these places are ran the same as before, many of the same people

             I am sure they rarely replace people.  Just like the cabal.  The people are in so deep they can't leave and the money is good.  Did you notice the link about some being moved to Army Bases?  One of them is Little Rock.

               Could be that they know who is running these bases and they are the safest ones. I don't know, but I too am watching this.  Yeah, the CP is worrisome.

            Hes probably older than 15 anyway but just said that because it's easier to get out of a juvenile center than an adult one. Hard to tell age with these young men who can grow full on mustaches at 8.

             I want to know why he was there so long anyway.  Way too long.  Why did they keep those boys so long.  Making money on them.  Our money.  Also I bet there were many more missing and where did they all go.  If we find out where they all really went, Oh Boy.

What do they care one less child.
            <br/>
            Poor kid
Here in Glendale the kids are enclosed in a chain link fence.  No one in. No one out. 
Cameras were there yesterday ....
            <br/>
            what’s the point of holding them if they can leave?  Doesn’t make sense.   He was held because he was a minor , because he’s a minor he can leave ??!

            “As a licensed child care center, if a child attempts to leave any of our facilities, we cannot restrain them,” Eller said in a statement to CNN. “We are not a detention center. We talk to them and try to get them to stay. If they leave the property, we call law enforcement.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Eller told the Times that while the event was rare, some children had left the group’s shelters before, though he declined to give a firm number. He said that less than 1 percent of kids who come through Southwest Key have chosen to leave.

            The boy who left the site on Saturday arrived at the U.S.-Mexico boarder by himself.

            He will have no one looking for him or missing him.  There will be no parent wanting to be connected with him like the others.  I am having a really hard time with this.  Also if there are 1% that walk away, that seems like an awful lot.  AND I bet that guy that made that statement really doesn't care if that boy is found or not.  He's just another runaway.  Just like in DC.  Where is that boy?
