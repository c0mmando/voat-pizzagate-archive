            I initially though we might be the victims of a particularly clever LARP, but what redpilled me was the following:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             shit going down in SA is big time stuff
            </li>
            <li>
             Q mentions Rothschilds, then, wham, Rothschilds are in the news with a plane crash. When was the last time you EVER heard ANYTHING in the news about the Rothschilds?
            </li>
            <li>
             Q mentions Soros (ok, low hanging fruit) then all of a sudden Soros moves all his money into a “fund”
            </li>
            <li>
             1400 sealed indictments
            </li>
            <li>
             Q mentions Hunt for Red October and then a submarine goes missing? WTF?
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I’m sure there is more (we should start a thread on predictions coming true).

             Respectfully (and I say this as someone who was riding high on the Q wave just a few days ago):
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              The Saudi princes were 'held' at the Ritz (or some such place) while the majority of their monies were transferred to MBS. They are now released (or about to be).
             </li>
             <li>
              There was a plane crash near a Rothschild
              <em>
               property
              </em>
              -- about which we have no real further information
             </li>
             <li>
              Soros - ya, low hanging fruit.
             </li>
             <li>
              Indictments could be big -- certainly has been a big build up -- part of my red flags might be impatience.
             </li>
             <li>
              Missing submarine is big -- when did Q release this? Sub went missing on Wednesday -- seems like Q mentioned it after that.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Meanwhile:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              <p>
               The Saudis are still prosecuting their horrific war in Yemen, something strange is going on with the Lebanese PM, and they've signed a peace treaty with Israel to simplify going to war with Iran -- all NWO projects about which Q is silent, and Trump apparently supportive.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Even if Jacob or one of the other Rothschilds was on one of the two downed craft, that hardly affects the Rothschild family or their wealth.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               So, Q &amp; Team telegraphed their moves to Soros so he had time to protect his money? The people we're up against aren't actually all that bright -- but they are several steps ahead of us.There's much more to this than we can see -- and I suspect that what we can't see
               <em>
                can
               </em>
               hurt us.

            I am not saying that Q's questions do not lead to good information.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is my point. People are under the impression that Trump is taking down the NWO. Trump just got back from Asia making deals for the NWO that probably number in the hundreds of billions of dollars at a minimum.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some people are under the impression that an NWO takedown is underway. That is taking advantage of people and shading their perception of reality because it is a lie. People should not be misled, have their efforts used, for a situation they believe is taking down the NWO.
           </p>

            Its cruel.

             I see Q driving this narrative. I know that my understanding may be clouded by how I am interpreting their clues, but there are many who share this understanding. And, as

              @SoldierOfLight

             pointed out, Q is calling Trump our Savior. This supports the notion that Q is driving the narrative.

              I think maybe the Savior narrative got started when some of the Saudi family got arrested but not sure. That was interpreted as "taking out one leg of the triangle." People think that means the NWO triangle I think. Saudia Arabia's arrested family members are not important enough to qualify as a leg of the NWO triangle and not even close.
             </p>
             <p>
              I know some people may hate my guts for pointing these things out but it makes me angry that the Q thing makes people think the NWO is being taken down while the Trump administration is setting up deals in the NWO network. That is so damn cruel.

            First off, thank you for having the balls to post this. Wish I could give you more than just one upvote because it seems like anywhere I go, just QUESTIONING what Q's intentions are makes me a target. It's okay for HIM to question, but God forbid we question the questioner.
           </p>
           <p>
            Questioning=Being a Debbie Downer? Since when? (Oops, there I go again, questioning.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The amount of rationalizing that people are doing to prop up the Cult of Q and the Cult of Trump to make it all better in their heads makes me want to punch a wall. And yes, it's become a cult. Does it bother you that Q equates Trump with Our Savior? I'm not even a Christian and that makes me want to vomit.

            Personally, I don't think Q is a Larper--I think he's the latest incarnation of Operation Mockingbird. Basically, lead the alt-right digital crowd to the trough and make them drink the Kool-Aid of submission to authority. Since those people are more likely to own guns, bonus in case a revolution erupts. Just tell 'em Q said that Martial Law is a good thing and they'll comply. And Q thinks the NSA are the good guys, btw. The same guys who developed the software to spy on the world in their homes using peoples' TVs and other devices. Oh, uh somebody stole those toolkits and gave them to the bad guys so it's not the NSA's fault if bad shit happens as a result of what they did because they had good intentions. And according to Q, we're supposed to rally behind the NSA against the CIA. Nope. The enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend.

             This.
            </p>
            <p>
             The more the 'Q' saga is going on, the more I am worried, deeply worried.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is it not possible for so many pizzagaters to take a step back and look at it from a distance? Why put all your hopes on Trump when all we know from observing politics and elite child abuse is that this is a non-partisan issue?
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm all for throwing members of the Cabal into prison, but currently it is worrying me that some "of the usual suspects" might go to jail, and the Q crowd will think 'oh great, problem solved, proof that Trump is saviour, we don't have to care about elite child abuse anymore'.
            </p>
            <p>
             Where's the spirit of thinking independently now that carried the pizzagaters along for the better half of this past year?

              Exactly. If some of the big names go down, I'm going to cheer, but until the trafficking rings completely collapse, our job isn't done. And if we don't hold them accountable, who will? The normies?

              Good points. I'll add MK-Ultra and all of the more recent incarnations of that program to the list of why military intelligence isn't a group I want to get under the covers with. Oh, and tunnels, particularly DUMBs. What happened to the Pizzagate investigators who researched the connections between the military industrial complex and child sex trafficking? How about all those posts that include the ones about the Greenbrier Hotel, etc.?

             This. Also, Q certainly is driving the narrative in limited directions, not all of which align with what we all have discovered for ourselves. I feel like the free-range /pizzagate researchers are getting driven into a corral or box canyon.

              Agreed on all points. Pilots who are taught how to survive mountain flying will first fly past a canyon opening to see if it might box them in before they commit to entering. Then, if they enter it, they hug the right side to give them as much room as possible to turn around if they become trapped. This approach seems sensible for just about everything.

                 Just checked out the latest Q-drop post. It's like Christmas morning over there, the kids are so excited.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Uncle Ian is the first commenter -- calming the kids' doubts, setting the narrative. Interesting timing, his showing up @ /pizzagate right before the Q drops begin. Barely recognized him as the commenter running all the douchebaggery on this post this morning. And yes, I get the irony that I showed up at the same time -- and I also notice that I stepped up to hold the other end of the tug-o-war rope. This world is cursed with divisiveness.

                     We're not gonna get done what we need to get done on social media. It's impossible to build the necessary trust. But awareness is growing, so we've got that going for us.

               I am not saying that Q's questions do not lead to good information.

              <p>
               This is my point. People are under the impression that Trump is taking down the NWO. Trump just got back from Asia making deals for the NWO that probably number in the hundreds of billions of dollars at a minimum.
              </p>
              <p>
               Some people are under the impression that an NWO takedown is underway. That is taking advantage of people and shading their perception of reality because it is a lie. People should not be misled, have their efforts used, for a situation they believe is taking down the NWO.

            Uh oh, I smell a "negative day" in the Pizzagate subverse. People, be careful not to adopt the mentality of a resigned victim, such as  "Meh nothing will be done anyway, they're too powerful, we're all screwed,  everything is a psyop, boo hoo hoo!". That's what they want you to believe. Be strong, stand tall and fill your heart with optimism.

             The feeling that Q is most likely a psy-op has nothing to do with the "mentality of a resigned victim". Quite to the contrary. It prevents us from running into false or old rabbit holes when at the same time we could  spend our energy on trying to get the full picture.

              not

            <p>
             If they are not, and it is a psyops, then we need to regroup and refocus because we need to figure out how to effect REAL CHANGE.

             Most definitely. We also need to clarify our thinking and become more strategic. We need REAL HOPE -- not manipulated hope.

              My comment was not intended to you. I've read a few comments today from various threads and I just had this general feeling that the mood was negative.

              Agreed. And we already have this hope, major things are happening as we speak. The dems establishment is turning against the Clintons (everyone thought they were invincible!), hollywood perverts are getting exposed... and now the same thing is happening in the political sphere. It's all happening.

               These are all good things, and heart-breakingly long overdue.
              </p>
              <p>
               Q is promising much more than this, though, yes? And could the general negative mood you've noticed be, in part, attributed to yet another Monday where HUGE THINGS were promised, and next-to-nothing was delivered?

              <p>
               Don't know if I've said this on this thread, but the constant raising and dashing of hopes drains us -- emotionally and cognitively. Is it possible we're being toyed with? If so, I want to help get us out of the trap.
              </p>
              <p>
               IF it is a trap -- I guarantee you we will be
               <strong>
                ENORMOUSLY
               </strong>
               stronger and smarter when we get ourselves and each other out of it.

                If it is a trap, then some of us will fall into it, but we will be all fine. The people who believed Q 100% without reserve will probably be pissed off at first, then they will learn something from the experience and they will carry on. That is,
                <em>
                 IF
                </em>
                Q is a LARP.
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Several people said that regardless if Q is LARP or not, the questions he asked helped them understand the bigger picture
                </strong>
                , so that's positive in itself I think.
               </p>
               <p>
                And don't forget the ridiculous amount of sealed indictments... from what I understand it's the first time in history there are so many in a so short amount of time. Something big is happening, whether or not Q is genuine or LARP. We can see it very easily with our own eyes. We must trust ourselves and trust our feelings. Huge stuff is happening, all documented, real news. There is no reason to feel let down at the moment.

                 Yes. We also need to be aware that we have blindspots -- individually and collectively -- and develop ways to help one another see into them.

              Wow. This is NOT by

               @ESOTERICshade

              and most definitely NOT a Debbie Downer narrative. FFS.
             </p>
             <p>
              Really? Doesn't it seem a bit strange that we cannot come together to rationally look at the Q phenomenon and decide whether it helps us or hurts us?
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm NOT saying "we're fucked, they're too powerful, give up." I'm saying we might need to get smarter, faster about how we deal with this.
             </p>
             <p>
              If Q is your last hope of us overcoming the Cabal -- and Q turns out to be shit -- what then? Then where will your hope be? THAT is my concern: that we will all devote however much cognitive and emotional energy into Q, only to learn, when we're exhausted, that it was never real.

               I agree and will add. Pizzagate got where it is because it was a decentralized movement with no leader. It was comprised of people that know how to think instead of being told what to think.
              </p>
              <p>
               An organization of this nature is almost impossible to derail unless you knock out its communication platform completely.
              </p>
              <p>
               Q is setting himself up as a leader. Nobdy knows where Q is headed or what Q's true motives are.
              </p>
              <p>
               Q makes grandiose claims of being an insider in the Trump administration involved in an elaborate secret coup. I will not lend my energy and time to that, and give up my own independent thinking, to follow an anonymous person who makes such grandiose claims.

                <p>
                 Q has been credited as being a person with high level secret clearance inside the Trump administration. Some believe Q is Trump himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Q is posting from an anonymous message board named 4 Chan and is world famous for some of the biggest larps in modern internet history.

                  Neither of those really matters, though. What we should be debating is the actual leaks themselves, right? These two statements are basically saying "4chan is full of trolls", which is obviously true. It adds nothing to the debate.

                   These do not qualify as "leaks" in my opinion because Q is literally what is known as a "4chan autist" or I will tone it down from there to say "a poster on a message board."

                  <p>
                   People are following Q's "rabbit trails" in a leader/follower fashion. I do not trust Q nor should I.

                    That would mean Pizzagate itself should be dismissed because the food code information that led people to search the Podesta emails for "cheese pizza" came from 4chan.

                     That is not my argument. My opinion is that Q's credibility as any sort of leader should not be given any credence because he cannot be vetted.

                     Many people are of the opinion that perfectly valid pedophile related research was continually deleted that met the rules. These same people are frustrated by the fact that such latitude is given to this subject. My opinon is like some others, that it demoralized the community and made it stagnant compared to what it once was.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     To your credit you did not participate in deleting the pedophile related research people are frustrated about. You and I have a record of working well together, such as on the CPP settings in the sidebar. I went out of my to prove you right on that because I knew it was good for the sub.

                Mostly I have spent the last month on an enormous learning curve, trying to catch up with what you all have learned and researched over this last year. FWIW, I am fresh eyes in the investigation, which might make me a bit more immune to Q's tactics.

              You are not part of a super secret operation being led by Q. That might hurt your feelings but the sooner you recognize it the sooner you can start being productive and focusing on revealing pedophiles instead of playing in the rabbit hole.

               You seem to think we are being somehow "less productive" by listening to what this Q has to say. People here just want to know the whole truth, so we listen to different channels, trying to make sense of the information we see. Sometimes we realize the information is genuine, sometimes we realize the information is BS, it's okay, we move on. We keep on going.
              </p>
              <p>
               I understand your doubts about Q, most of us are not 100% convinced as well, but you don't know for a fact that this is a LARP. It's just your belief and you might or might not be correct.

                  <em>
                   his is a 1 month old account.

                      I don't know what will happen when the Twitter clampdown comes on December 18. If they are stating that they will ban twitter users for engaging in hate speech on or off the Twitter platform that is an announcement that the technology is in place. Which also probably means they have thousands of "haters" already loaded in the kill chute. :) That will cut a major line of communication for the truth movement. How well Skippy get his beatings without Twitter? lol

                        I just looked again and i'm not sure now. I don't know if this site is credible and I saw another blurb somewhere mentioning richard spencer's name in connection to all that maybe. Maybe its just bullshit i'm not sure.

                         Someone on another thread posted a link to the original twitter post (on twitter site), so it seems to be legit.

                         I think it's possible to lead a happy life without using Twitter ;-), but the censorship is worrying me nevertheless. Might also be a blueprint for coming censorship on other social media platforms.

                    You could have gone safe and posted a boring thread for your first post which may have resulted in no downvotes and maybe a few upvotes. But you didn't. You took a stand and opened up a discussion that is sorely needed because of the very fact there is a clamp down on that very discussion. I read Q's posts as I think they're interesting. I'm trying to figure out what, who, and why. Those are healthy questions. In fact, asking questions is Q's method. And that was your approach with the post. Why should anyone be threatened by people asking questions? Those who are trying to shut this discussion down are clearly scared. Maybe they're just scared that Q and Trump might not be the Bogeyman killers that they hope. Or, maybe it's something more.

Here’s an example... they took things that y’all have already dug into and vetted the shit out of like Pizza, Podestas, Rothschilds, corrupt central banks and shady foundations/backdoored payouts, etc. and tied it to lots of other shit that you either haven’t touched on or talked about very much yet, if at all, or shit you’d assume could be linked, yet haven’t dug into it or linked it at all. Then, they attempted to use what little access they had and could exploit in real time to justify the wild goose chases they were sending you on, ON PURPOSE, and used it to validate themselves to you so you’d believe them and think you should be digging into the areas
                       <strong>
                        <em>
                         they were intentionally misdirecting you on FOR THEIR OWN LAUGHS.

                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Like I’ve said lots of times before, if you dig enough into anyone or anything, you could technically connect lots of the same names, places, orgs, foundations, departments, agencies, offices, corporations, etc. but THAT DOESN’T MEAN ALL OF THOSE DOTS ACTUALLY CONNECT, in the way you’re being misled to believed, by people inappropriately abusing limited accesses they have,
                       <strong>
                        <em>
                         to validate why you should believe them, to you, to keep you baited and hooked

                       Basically, 50% of the shit y’all chased in those threads, you’d already connected the dots on, over the last 18 months, across lots of different boards/discussions. The other 50%, was intentional misdirection, mixed in on purpose,
                       <strong>
                        <em>
                         for their laughs not for your “education” and the “spread of awareness” on behalf of the oblivious greater good

                      </p>
                      <p>
                       50% of what was spread over the last 5 weeks now, was based on fake, falsely connected dots,

                      Honestly, I've had bigger priorities than keeping up with Q lately such as stuffing my face with as much food as I can in one sitting several times a day. When this alleged MegAnon said in the same thread you quoted:

                     I think Q's posts are interesting, too -- and I was wildly posting #FollowTheWhiteRabbit links on the twitter for a couple of days. I have great faith in meme magic -- think it might save the world ;) -- and I want to make sure to keep the powder dry for the Real Deal.

                      As a test, on my Facebook page I posted the Roseann Barr meme of her on the phone saying that Q should call her. I wanted to see if the Q craze had entered the consciousness of my normie friends and family. Apparently not, because there were no comments and only one person liked the post. She's very much not awake and I think she simply liked seeing a meme of Roseann, lol. So that made me question even more what value Q brings to the table, besides hope. Or, hopium as

             Sorry your confirmation bias bubble is getting bruised. Learn to debate instead of insult. It would make your message carry some meaning.

            Its a massive troll in my opinion. Plain common sense tells us that you don't let children be raped and tortured because you have to condition the delicate minds of the public first. If they had the power to stop it they would stop it immediately regardless of how surprised the public would be. This will require military and intelligence intervention and has nothing to do with the public.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Operations of this nature are not leaked to public image boards so that the enemy can watch the plans unfold. Common sense alone should provide awareness of that. These people are so ruthless that they torture and rape children. You do not notify them you are coming for them and let them watch the plans. This a cruel joke. It boggles my mind that anybody would believe it.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The whole narrative about the "bad saudi princes" got arrested and now we have the good ones is a non-starter. The whole Saud family is a bunch of savages. Make that depraved savages.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q sold that as knocking out "one leg of the triangle" for the first time in history. Nope. The true triangle is D.C. - Vatican - London. Saudia Arabia is a puppet of the world banking oligarchs and is continuing to starve millions in Yemen and exposing them to cholera on behalf of the NWO. Iran will be next on the list. Good Saudis?
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Zerohedge has reported that negotiations are ongoing to free the arrested Saudis if they agree to give up about 70% of their wealth which would be somewhere around about 400 billion dollars maybe, give or take a 100 billion. That should leave them millions to continue to rape kids and be depraved degenerates in grand style.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Saudia Arabia has no choice anyway because they helped Mossad, C.I.A., and British Intelligence pull off 911. If they do not do as they are told the western banking oligarchs will blackmail the hell out of them and accuse them of 911.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the Q take on that benefits who? The deep state. The deep state gets to look like they took out the Saudis that Clinton was affiliated with to help pizzagate. The truth is that this is probably nothing more than a turf war between Clinton/Bush and the Kushner/Trump factions.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I think Clinton seriously pissed off Trump's ego and he does not take that lightly probably. The Clinton's may receive some ass pain because they have pissed off a lot of people but they also have who knows how many people blackmailed? The Clinton/Bush cabal may be somewhat on the ropes of a waning criminal dynasty but that remains to be seen.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Gangsters abhor a vacuum where money is to be made. Brings us to Kushner. Kushner comes from a criminal Ashkenazi family. I think it was his father that was in the real estate busines, lost a turf war, got busted, and went to prison. Or maybe one of his father's brothers. Don't remember exactly. Point being, if the Clinton/Bush cabal are going to lose some of their empire there are sharks in the tank waiting to scoop it up.
           </p>
           <p>
            And lets not forget that Kushner is sitting up there in that prime piece of real estate huge building with the 666 address. He must be fairly special to get that occult trophy.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The new Twitter stars are probably part of the larp. Or they just do not understand what is happening.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Q is announcing that Trump is taking down the NWO. It would not be announced on an image board because it would be counter productive to the effort. The Trump faction is not letting a group of people that are so psychopathic that they rape and torture children watch their coup plans on 4Chan.
           </p>
           <p>
            The NWO is protected by NATO. NATO does not play. Also the entire global banking cartel would have to be knocked out. Gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            The big hope is that the U.S. military has had enough of the criminals and they will take care of all this. Hmmm....good luck because the military has some pretty bad people at the top of it and is responsible for a lot of the MK Ultra type business.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Moving along somebody has to take care of these people. And this is by far not everybody that would cause trouble if you mess with their power status and money. These Jews, Ashkenazis, Vatican people are all mixed together and hidden in everything. This is not near the whole rat nest either.

            The Black Nobility own and run the Vatican, SMOM, Jesuits, KOC, and La Cosa Nostra.
           </p>
           <p>
            The European Monarchies like the British Crown are branches of Rome and they manage secret societies like the Freemasons which infiltrate government agencies and run corporations for the monarchs.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The SMOM is the top military council and it works closely with the Orders of St John ran by Protestant monarchs.

           <p>
            The royal and noble bloodlines are all working together as a global crime syndicate and part of the modernized Roman Empire.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Greek royal House of Glucksburg run the Greek fraternities and sororities and use initiates as their agents.
           </p>
           <p>
            The British Crown controls universities like Yale and Harvard and use them for recruiting Crown agents.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Jesuits are Roman intelligence and infiltrators and use their universities for recruiting and training Vatican agents. Many Knights of Columbus are police officers, mayors, lawyers, and judges and they protect the Italian Mafia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Italian Mafia are enforcers for Rome involved in extortion, money laundering, murder, and drug trafficking; and they pay their dues back to the Sicilian Mafia which pay dues back to the Black Nobility.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Court blah like the Rothschild, Warburg, Walton, Wallenberg, and Dreyfus families serve the Roman Curia and Royal courtrooms like Buckingham Palace and Stockholm Palace.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Holy See is the All Seeing Eye and operates as an intelligence network. The Latin phrase Novus Ordo Seclorum means New Order of the Ages and is on the US dollar bill and US Great Seal. The Vatican uses Latin as an official language and for documents.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The Black Nobility and other Royal Families have been concealing trillions in private banks in Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. The Swiss Guard protects the Vatican.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Swiss Cantons have been in contract with the Vatican for centuries and Switzerland is basically a Papal State.

             William Donohue and Jesuit Pedophilia (pizzagate)
submitted 2 days ago by ThePuppetShow
This relates to pizzagate because the Jesuits are an elite organization controlling factions of our government and they're involved in many pedophilia cases.
In 2014 the NYT published an article titled For Nuncio Accused of Abuse, Dominicans Want Justice at Home, Not Abroad. The article discussed Archbishop Jozef Wesolowski, the Vatican ambassador who serves as a personal envoy of the pope, being accused of sexually abusing minors in the Dominican Republic.
            </p>
            <p>
             “He definitely seduced me with money,” said Francis Aquino Aneury, who says he was 14 when the man he met shining shoes began offering him increasingly larger sums for sexual acts. “I felt very bad. I knew it wasn’t the right thing to do, but I needed the money.”
This is what the Jesuit leader, William (Bill) Donohue of the Catholic league had to say about this article..
            </p>
            <p>
             The Times erred again by repeating the myth of a pedophilia scandal: 100 percent of the victimizers were male; 81 percent of the victims were male; and 78 percent were postpubescent. That would make it a homosexual scandal. Indeed, less than 5 percent of these cases involve pedophilia.
This particular comment made me dig a little further on this guy because even if his numbers are true, he's obviously willing to overlook the 22% of prepubescent children who were molested to defend a Jesuit pedophile. What I found is going to sound real familiar to the regulars here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here are some things "we know that we know" about William Donohue: he has been president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights for nearly twenty years; he's quick to accuse anyone criticizing the Catholic hierarchy as being a Catholic-basher; he relishes publicity -- always ready for his Fox News Channel close-up; he's a stalwart defender of all things Catholic; he's gruff and likes to throw his weight around; he's mean-spirited and prone to making outrageous comments; he's a serial gay-basher; he has been a staunch apologist for priestly child abuse, claiming it was the result of having homosexual priests; and, he has a predilection for dumping on Jews.
Donohue slams Rabbi Waskow
Last week, BuzzFeed had an interesting little story about Donohue. BuzzFeed's story revolved around a "private email" he sent to Philadelphia Rabbi Arthur Waskow.
According to BuzzFeed, Waskow, a progressive political activist, author, and a Rabbi associated with the Jewish Renewal movement, "had criticized the Vatican and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in a Huffington Post op-ed for
             <code>
              attacking the religious freedom of millions of American women and the religious freedom of American nuns' over contraception."
In response to Waskow's piece, Donohue sent him an email calling the piece a "snide attack on the Catholic Church" that "exhibits appalling ignorance." Donohue ended his note with: "Moreover, since when is it the business of any religious leader to condemn the strictures of another religion? You are not only clueless about the situation concerning nuns, you have stuck your nose in where you don't belong."
How's that for launching a civil dialogue?
Donohue's email started a brief exchange, which ended by citing his friendship with former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, who, according to Donohue "once said that Jews had better not make enemies of their Catholic friends since they have so few of them. Think about that the next time you feel compelled to attack my religion. Donohue also included a postscript saying,
             </code>
             I do not have a long nose.'"
Donohue has been down this rage-against-the-Jews road many time: In 2004, Donohue, a major admirer of Mel Gibson's movie "The Passion of the Christ," expressed his displeasure with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for snubbing Gibson's film. In typical Donohue style, he said: "Mel Gibson releases the most significant blockbuster movie of the year, but it's not good enough to make the cut for a Golden Globe. That's because his film promotes Christianity, and the Hollywood crowd will have none of it. The only movies they like to make about Christianity these days are ones that demean it."
In December 2004, Donohue told fellow defender-of-the-faith, Pat Buchanan, who was subbing for host Joe Scarborough on MSNBC's "Scarborough Country," that the reason "The Passion" wouldn't get its just due is because "Hollywood is controlled by secular Jews who hate Christianity in general and Catholicism in particular."
I've proven recently, what I've know for years, that it's the Jesuits controlling the "game" across the board. This is more proof that it's not the Jews that you can't talk about, it's the Jesuits. William Donahue has made MANY appearances on "Jew controlled media". Why would that happen if the media is really Jew controlled?

             History of the Jesuits From the Book "THE HISTORY OF GERMANY" by Wolfgang Menzel [In four volumes. This quote is From Volume 3 pg 1072. Book not dated but was written in the late 1800's. Menzel, Wolfgang, 1798-1873]  ___________   this volume has not been scanned into archives.org yet.  Volume 4 has been scanned/is in there - but I did not see anything about the jesuits in that volume.

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "The Society of Jesus was founded by Ignatius Loyola, an enthusiastic Spaniard, for penitents, who, in those heretical times, ere long made it their business to confirm the faith of the wavering, and, consequently, became the tools of Rome. Benedict XIV, named them St. Peter's Janissaries.
            </p>
            <p>
             Their object was the restoration of unlimited hierarchical power, and they despised no means, however base, that might conduce to success, according to their celebrated maxim, "The end justifies the means."
            </p>
            <p>
             The society was intended to form an aristocracy of talent, whose office it was to guard the avenues of knowledge against the rest of mankind; and, as a precaution against individual treachery, no member was permitted to quit the order except to take the vows of a Carthusian, by which he bound himself to silence and solitude for the rest of his days.
            </p>
            <p>
             The heads of the society had unlimited power to remove, punish, and assassinate the members. The first vow taken by the initiated was that of unconditional obedience. A system of secret espionage pervaded the whole society; suspicion was condemnation; and the victim was sentenced to die in seclusion of starvation, as it expressly directed by Suarez, the great Jesuitical casuist.
            </p>
            <p>
             The members were divided into classes, the highest of which, the professors, elected the head or general of the whole order, who resided at Rome. Every province of the order was under the superintendence of a pater provincialis. The higher grades were kept strictly secret from the lower classes, who were merely the blind tools of the former.  The pope conferred the most extensive privileges upon the order, which was empowered to interfere everywhere with the clergy and with all other orders. -- And, in order to renew the times of the first apostles, the Jesuits sent out missionaries, who visited the most distant parts of the globe, for the purpose of converting the heathen and --- of taking possession of the New World.  They brought countless treasure into Europe, by means of which they placed themselves on a firm footing and acquired immense influence at a period when money was power.
            </p>
            <p>
             The most celebrated of these missionaries was St. Xavier, who met with a martyr's death in India. Numbers of the Jesuits shared the same fate; many, in particular Germans, were distinguished for piety and learning and by their exploration of unknown countries. Among the European Jesuits were many fervent spirits actuated by the purest zeal; many simple and poetical minds unstained by hypocrisy, for instance, Balde; many deeply learned men, sincere lovers of truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             It would be unjust to pass a sweeping condemnation upon all the Jesuits.  But the ruling spirit and the political effect of the order were immoral.
            </p>
            <p>
             The manner in which they denied the truths brought to light during the Reformation, sought to veil them by bringing to view the weaknesses and errors of Protestantism, or to suppress them by force, cannot be justified.
            </p>
            <p>
             The sophistry with which they still defended undeniable and long-sensible abuses was revolting to reason.  The means by which they bent the powerful and wealthy to their purposes were often the most unholy.
            </p>
            <p>
             pg1074   One of the principle objects of the Jesuits was to replace the sale of dispensations, which had fallen into bad repute since the Reformation, and which was, moreover, almost indispensable to the church. This was done by means of the lax morality of the confessional.  The more luxurious court life became, the more easily did the Jesuits forgive the sins committed by the aristocracy;  in order to pacify the new conscientious scruples awakened by the Reformation, they became the advocates instead of the judges of sins, from every description of which they, by their casuistry, exculpated the offender.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Spanish Jesuits went furthest. The book of Escobar, the confessor's manual, passed through thirty-six editions, which were printed under the direction of the society and of the church.  The church closed her eyes to any measures taken by the confessors, provided they made proselytes and gathered the stray sheep into the fold.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to their casuistical system, all sins were exculpated: First, by the doctrine of probabilismus, that is, by the mildest of all possible interpretations.
            </p>
            <p>
             A says, "Sich a sin is too horrible to be forgiven."  B says, "Certainly; still it might thus be exculpated, " etc. etc.  Upon this C says, "According to A's opinion it cannot be forgiven; but it can be according to B's; and as an authority is all that is requisite, and the mildest point of view is admissible, I agree with B." 
Secondly, By the directio intentionis, that is, by the thoughts being occupied during the performance of a bad action with an innocent object. Thus, for instance, one might bribe another or accept of a bribe and, at the same time, be merely thinking of civility or gratitude.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thirdly, By the reservatio mentalis. It was allowable to take a false oath by voluntarily adding a mental reservation, as, for instance, a man might swear he had no money, although he had some, provided he mentally added "none to lend," etc.   One might take an oath thus, "I swear (that I say here, although it is untrue) that I, " etc. or "I swear that I did not do that (a hundred years ago or a hundred miles hence), " or " I swear to do so (if I cannot think of something else)."
             <br/>
             page 1075    Fourthly, By amphibologia, or equivocation; for instance, one can deny anything touching the French by thinking of the word "gallus" as implying a cock instead of a Gaul.  Fifthly, By the intenio bona, which was the principle thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Strictly speaking, the only virtue required in a Jesuit was the promotion of the intentions of his order; whoever did this, merited eternal bliss, which was ever the case. The sins of the wealthy and powerful, whom it was to the interest of the order to treat with lenity, were excused on the ground of their having no intenio mala, that is, that the sin had not been committed for the sake of sinning. Thus, for instance, adultery was allowable in princes and nobles, because the marriage vow had been broken, not for the sake of committing adultery, but for the sake of another woman.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sixthly, and lastly, By pia opera, by good works; woever honored the Jesuits, built colleges for them, gave them money, etc., whoever, in general, did good service to the Catholic church, diligently observed her ceremonies, purchased a dispensation, etc., was completely free from guilt.
            </p>
            <p>
             Means such as these easily gained over the wealthy and the powerful.  The Jesuits displayed the greatest activity at court, their maxim being to influence the flock through its leaders. They long governed all the Catholic courts of Eurpoe, sometimes as confessors or tutors to the sovereign, sometimes as coucillors and negotiators, the most talented men of their order especially devoting themselves to poitical matters; but their principal profession was that of a procurer; the secrets of the confessional rendered them masters of the weaknesses of the princes and  princesses, whom they doubly flattered, by affording them opportunities to satisfy their inclinations, and, at the same time, giving them full absolution. Like the Lutheran court chaplains, they ever found means to secure the eternal salvation of the sovereign, whatever might have been his crimes.  They even succeeded in creeping into Protestant courts for the purpose of converting the prince or of corrupting his councillors. It was in this manner they converted Queen Christina of Sweden, the  [pg 1076] daughter of the great Gustavus Adolphus.

             The most important projects of the Protestants have been frustrated by the secret intrigues of Jesuitical emissaries at the courts of the Protestant princes.  The Jesuits also applied themselves to the study of medicine, by which means they got the life of the sovereign, in whose service they were, into their own power, and many of the poisonings which took place at that time may be placed to their charge, no less than manh of the assassinations, by which they removed the leaders of the opposite party.
            </p>
            <pre><code>   &lt;i&gt;NOTE THE TERM&lt;/i&gt; short-robed Jesuits
</code></pre>
            <p>
             In 1614, the general of the order, Aquaviva, prohibited the public defence of regicide by the Jesuits, probably from fear of giving offence to their royal patrons. In order to work with greater security, they had secret members among the laity; princes were even enrolled in their ranks. These members were termed the short-robed Jesuits.
            </p>
            <p>
             Education was almost entirely controlled by the Jesuits, who, by this means, secured the rising generation and methodically implanted in the people the spirit requisite for their purposes. Everything that might prove prejudicial to themselves was carefully avoided in the schools and in their writings, and all Protestant books were strictly prohibited.  Although there were many deeply learned and shrewd-minded men among the Jesuits, the want of truth in their discourses, rendered their schools far inferior to those of the Protestants; nor could the knowledge they acquired ever benefit the people, owing to their almost constant use of the Latin tongue, which was at first natural, the first Jesuits having been Spaniards or Italians, but which was afterward purposely persevered in with a view of preventing the students from studying German and, more particularly, Protestant works.
            </p>
            <p>
             The inclination of the Jesuits to place themselves as an intermediate class between the priests and the laity, and, by this means, to govern both, is clearly discernible in their new forms. They avoided the old terms of "monastery, monks," etc. and termed themselves a "society"; their houses, "colleges and residences."
            </p>
            <p>
             [Pg 1077] In South America, in the province of Paraguay, they even usurped sovereign rule, but had the prudence to veil their model-monarchy, in imitation of which they one day hoped to rule the whole world, from the eyes of the curious.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was the Jesuits who desecrated the spirit of the venerable mother-church while attempting to preserve her body, the tottering edifice of hierarchical tyranny. One of her heads had prophesied concerning them, "As lambs have we crept in, as wolves will we govern, as dogs shall we be driven out, and as eagles shall we return."
            </p>
            <p>
             The most celebrated of the Jesuitical dogmatists of Germany, during the thirty years' war, were Gretser, self-named "malleus haeret icorum," and Tanner. During the subsequent peace, the Bollandists gained great celebrity in the Netherlands by their "acta sanctorum," a continuation, principally by Bolland, Papebrochius, etc., of the legends of the saints, formerly collected by the industrious Benedictines. The Annals, published by Baronius, up to 1607, in opposition to the Magdeburg Centuries by Flacious, were the greatest historical work of the Catholic church.

             Esoteric, your whole argument here rests on the premise that stuff hasn't already happened. That Q seeks help before taking action. That is not what the leaks show, however. They show someone giving clues about behind the scenes operations that have already happened, and links to historical events. The help requested is in waking up people despite the silence of the MSM and corrupt justice system.

             100% of the reason we haven't done likewise is PROPAGANDA -- those I know alive during WWII say they will NEVER forgive the Germans, or the Japanese!  What do you think these mass-trauma wars and psyops are for ?!!

              Trump is not speaking about openly knocking the teeth out of the NWO and announcing that they are going down. Some anon name Q is, on the biggest larp board on the internet.

               Q is POORLY-SUBCONTRACTED DISINFO "white rabbit" is the most trendy ambiguous "lead" with which to rope in WOMEN and normies with their gay social engineering "hashtag campaigns" -- /pol/ and the chans proving yet again that NOTHING HAPPENS UNLESS SMART WHITE MALES DO IT.
              </p>
              <p>
               Even JEWISH HOLLYWOOD PERVERTS are being used to gleefully show that "although POWERFUL WHITE MEN are finally losing their jobs, the issue of sexual violence..."

               If the JEW MEDIA didn't have people at each other's throats this process would be MUCH EASIER.

            Wasn't yesterday - Monday - meant to be the BIG DAY where all the perps would go to jail?
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill, HRC and 1798 more?

            No?

           <p>
            Nothing happened, but the crowd is still celebrating Q?
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead, they should him sent back to wherever he/they came from.
           </p>
           <p>
            I opt for 'they' because this has clearly been a psy-op of a professional social media team.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's bothering me to see how many of the pizzagate crowd fell for the Q rubbish and how easily someone could influence the narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            You would have expected them to disbelieve anything Q tells them now that the BIG DAY passed without anything big happening. Why nobody seems to care is beyond me.

            His questions were not diversionary, 
the questions are meant as answers, if you read them like statements, number 1
and 2. if you "ask the question" of google, the questions rise up in the algorithm which lets the normies see the questions that rise in googles daily most asked questions. if you will notice, i think Google turned that feature off right after this started, but i can't swear to that.

              it was a theory on the thread. Its quite interesting, if Q is trying to make the AI respond... 
there was a very interesting thread on /pol/ last night about Google Translate, and just repeating two letters pe pe repeatedly and it started translating some weird stuff. I tried the mumbo Jumbo that was found on the Elsagate comments and some interesting things came up when you translated it using Bengali to English.

             I'm thinking the whole tactic is diversionary. Dedicated researchers are chasing down leads to ... things they already know.
            </p>
            <p>
             And how wide is Q's appeal beyond those who are already researching? Do we have anyway of knowing?

            I would rather see it as a nice way of redpilling a lot of people. In any case, if Q is legit, everything would be made so that you will never be able to be sure. He can't just give proof that he is, since we are not the only ones reading 4chan. Just thinking out loud...

              What I'm saying is, if it happens that he is legit, you wouldn't probably be able to know it for sure.
Being on twitter for quiet a while, I assure you a lot of people get redpilled and have a motivation boost to look into things they were not aware of.
             </p>
             <p>
              The right question seems to be : is there currently any positive change wave and event pattern, that we can identify as "unusual" ? I'd say yes, obviously.

               From what I can tell on the twitter, it's folks who already know -- people who were already investigating -- that are participating.
              </p>
              <p>
               Is there anyway to check numbers on twitter? How about here -- have we had a large uptick in first time visitors?

                I don't know if there is a way to check that, but I saw tweets from people claiming they just discovered pizzagate and other stuff.  Is it doubtful ? Of course, like everything.
