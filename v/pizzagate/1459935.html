<p>So I went to the twitter of Jorge Puello Torres</p>
<p>Jorge has 5 followers. So I looked into one of them which was <a href="https://voat.co/user/Casamiafs">@Casamiafs</a> a restaurant in the Dominican Republic right near where Laura Silbsy was planning on opening her &quot;orphanage&quot; in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>I then looked into 1 of the 40 people <a href="https://voat.co/user/casamiafs">@casamiafs</a> follows. I found <a href="https://voat.co/user/jgpichardoc5">@jgpichardoc5</a> and decided to research him since he\'s from the DR and perhaps he knows Jorge Puello Torres who was Laura Silsby\'s &quot;lawyer&quot; who was involved in sex trafficking in El Salvador and trafficking in Canada. He also worked undercover for the government of the US and I believe Canada as well. Now who randomly will take on Laura Silsby\'s case for FREE especially when they aren\'t really a lawyer? I repeat he was NOT a lawyer! On top of that why would the parents of the 10 convicted of kidnapping Haitian kids who were NOT orphans want to be represented by a sex trafficker and all the other problems Jorge Torres Puello has?</p>
<p>Inside job? I mean he did work undercover work for the govt at one point and Clinton helped get them free as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WaStateGov/posts/10154672428814063">https://www.facebook.com/WaStateGov/posts/10154672428814063</a> (Everyone should read his posts without harassing him. His english isn\'t great and he is very redundant but hes been talking about high up politicians for the last 2 or 3 years which I found very interesting. He even asks Bilderberg group to help him)</p>
<p>So I google Jonathan Pichardo and find his Facebook above. Supposedly, he has lots of family in the US and DR government. I see he checked into Washington DC and read a lot of his posts which he constantly talks about politicians and asks to keep certain politicians safe when they come to the DR or when his family is in the US.</p>
<p>One post I quoted from his FB</p>
<p>&quot;I want cia director working on this I get inform thath something bad happen to mr ron DON’T TOUCH DON’T TOUCH MR RON MY EX SALVATION ARMY BOSS&quot;</p>
<p>So I looked up his ex boss Major Ron Bursoe from the salvation army.
<a href="http://www.multivu.com/assets/63223/documents/63223-Major-Ron-Busroe-Bio-original.pdf">http://www.multivu.com/assets/63223/documents/63223-Major-Ron-Busroe-Bio-original.pdf</a> (Was the the second link to show up. I WILL COME BACK TO THIS LINK)</p>
<p>&quot;Busroe was the director of the Haiti Recovery and Development Office. While in Haiti, Busroe coordinated a team of seven Salvation Army officers and directed all post earthquake recovery and development initiatives. He had previously served in Haiti and used his experiences there to ensure that all recovery efforts incorporated both the needs of the community and the mission of The Salvation Army. &quot;</p>
<p>Now lets rewind to my post last week...</p>
<p>Is this Jorge Puello Torres? The fake lawyer who was a sex trafficker that helped Laura Silsby...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/george.detorres1">https://www.facebook.com/george.detorres1</a> Here is his Facebook (Joined 2012 which is 2 years after the whole Haiti situation) <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgedetorres">https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgedetorres</a> Here is his LinkedIn. When you go to Laura Silsby on LinkedIn this guy shows up in &quot;People also viewed&quot;</p>
<p>Do these people look similar?</p>
<p>George De Torres Facebook pictures and pictures on google of Jorge Puello Torres. Picture him with a shaved beard and 3 years later.</p>
<p>Do these names not look very similar?</p>
<p>Gerorge DeTorres and Jorge Puello Torres</p>
<p>Keep in mind he is known to fake many documents and goes by a million different names so it wouldn\'t be a surprise for him to switch his name especially since he used to work undercover for the govt...CIA? I don\'t know but I can\'t rule that out.</p>
<p>Now what gets weird is where did George De Torres work?</p>
<p>MUTLIVU, PR NEWSWIRE! Which I find extremely odd this news wire that I never seen in my life had news at the top of my google search when I looked up John Pichardo\'s ex boss Major Ron Bursoe. Also, Ron Bursoe was in Haiti the same time Laura and Jorge Puello Torres were. Lastly, Casa Mias who follows John Pichardo has a restaurant in the DR close to where Laura Silsby planned on moving the &quot;orphans&quot; to and I believe when Jorge Puello Torres lived in the DR he lived close to Johnathan Pichardo .</p>
<p>I could be totally wrong but as soon as I saw MULTIVU I felt this was something to really look into. Let me know what you guys think. If you plan on researching this...don\'t harass any of these people, screenshot everything in case we have something here and keep it in Voat for now.</p>',

He also worked undercover for the government of the US and I believe Canada as well. Now who randomly will take on Laura Silsby's case for FREE especially when they aren't really a lawyer?

            nice work. All people who do these things, leave a trail. it is their unconscious way of coming clean. Jorge especially. when common names are mispelled, like  jorge, george, it is a sign of false name use. Take for instance, another George -geroge brooks, or george burke -brooks and burke sound similar. if you gave the alias, and were found out, you could throw off, and say it was misheard . George Brooks, gave his name as George Burke when he reported a Mcann sighting. Later it was found out to be brooks. I can imagine of confronted on this, he would say oh I said brooks, they must have misheard it has burke. big red flag, that no one knows who this George Brooks from the uk is, who own pizza shops next to each other in Portugal. I feel it is george brooks the photographer in the uk. He has hotdogs written on his blog and instagram. he has white hair on the sides, like the passport photocopy of brooks' passport. I need confirmation

             Yes, you make a great point.  Let me know if you think they look alike.
Keep in mind I thought this last week. Now that I saw the link MULTIVU (where George De Torres works) when researching John Pichardo's ex boss Major Ron Bursoe who was in Haiti at the time I feel this is too weird.

              that facebook, is a super find. shows he has tried to make a new identity. or has been set up with one. i can only imagine, so long as there are pedophiles like Clinton in charge, a lot of people were given liscences to get away with these things. Jorge mentions working undercover. Could it be, he claims to working undercover to find child traffickers. This would be the perfect get out of jail free card, which it seems this person did have some help, to be able to say, when caught, "I was just investigating it," undercover. Notably he did not give this excuse. but maybe he did not need to, as he was told he would be ok.  what is ironic, is I was just watching a doco on Australian tv, that talks about pedophiles who prey on children overseas. It had American people who were trying to help authorities get convictions. They made a big deal, about how they are stepping up to the problem. yet in the case of Silsby and Jorge we have the opposite, where they are intervening to save them. This points to them having direct connctions, that they did not want to comt to light. Silsby and Jorge both know plenty, I feel. they both operated as though with impunity, and indeed got immunity when found out. something very wrong far, when people who kidnap entire groups of children, are being let off.

            Yes this whole case is full of red flags.  Do you think the picture of Jorge Puello Torres and George De Torres looks alike?
