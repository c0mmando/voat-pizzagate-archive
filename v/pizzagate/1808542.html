            Can you believe how organized the media is that every single western news outlet can neglect to mention the porn production charge? They could have mentioned it and claimed that it was false but they don't even mention it.

             The article that I posted originally is not the one that shows up now. The article I posted named the NGO that this woman was working for. They're calling her an aid worker. She drew my attention because she was allegedly a child protective agent. (Really ?)

            In this article it said Clinton tried to get her released as well. So let's see, a woman from Falls Church, VA. Alarms go off right there.  That is Unification Church command central aka Moonies.  They love to deal in children.  The whole town is composed of Moonies.  I remember months ago someone who had lived or visited posted here that the whole town was weird like they were all MKUltra. So that if for starters.  Then she starts this NGO with what $$$?  It just so happens to be homeless street children looking for a better life and they just want to help.  Sound familiar ? Of course, Clinton and Obama want to help.  I am sorry, I just think it smells.  Just because somebody is released does not mean they might not be guilty. Or maybe, not guilty and I have become harden with all of these NGOs wanting to help homeless kids that no one cares about and there is a major demand for organ trafficking and pedophiles wanting product.

            Egypt: Miss Morocco Accused in a Child Pornography and Human Trafficking Case
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2014/08/137246/egypt-miss-morocco-accused-in-a-child-pornography-and-human-trafficking-case/">
             https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2014/08/137246/egypt-miss-morocco-accused-in-a-child-pornography-and-human-trafficking-case/

           </p>
           <p>
            Rabat – A Moroccan beauty queen is believed to be involved in one of the biggest child pornography and human trafficking schemes in Egypt according to Egyptian media outlets.
           </p>
           <p>
            The unidentified Moroccan beauty queen has reportedly been accused of funding a fake association that exploits homeless children in the production of child pornography, as well as using them as human shields in several political demonstrations and conflicts with the police.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Egypt’s Yaoum7, the fake association that goes by the name “Biladi” or my country was co-founded by an American woman and her husband. The American couple are said to have stripped over 20 children and videotaped them naked in a minor pornographic production.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Sunday, the Egyptian police detained the associations’ main financier for investigation. “She admitted to having received funds from a Moroccan beauty queen,” Yaoum7 reported.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Associations’ financier said that she had received moral and financial support from the Moroccan beauty queen, without revealing her name or the details.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Association’s co-founders, Aya Hijazi, 27, and her husband Mohamed Hassanine, 26, admitted to detaining over 20 homeless children in their Cairo-based house.
           </p>
           <p>
            The US couple stated during the investigations that they had forced the children to have sex with each other in order to record them in a pornographic film production.

             No, they were detained in 2014. How would Trump negotiate release while not president?
            </p>
            <p>
             "The couple and their co-workers had been incarcerated since May 1, 2014, on child abuse and trafficking charges that were widely dismissed by human rights workers and U.S. officials as false. Virtually no evidence was ever presented against them..."
            </p>
            <p>
             Virtually? That means something was submitted as evidence. No mention of that WaPo? Are these C-ISIS-A ass-ets? Is this his anti-Silsby-narrative move a la "hey look, we all release overseas human traffickers"? Or maybe the opposite in that "hey these folks were innocent so we welcome them, but this Silsby character, I just don't know"?

              The article you replied to is from 2014 and had been posted below by another person here. I simply reposted it to update the article I had posted earlier.

              Every so-called Child Protection Organization especially NGOs needs to be inspected for evidence of child trafficking.

              Well, if they are really guilty it is not boding well for Trump.  Also, the message that WP is sending by front page news is very telling as well.  Trump has given them his blessing.  Is this a message that he has been pressured or threatened to knuckle under.  Is this WaPo's message to the Cabal Community and Friends?  I hope not.

            An Egyptian American charity worker who was imprisoned in Cairo for three years and became the global face of Egypt’s brutal crackdown on civil society returned home to the United States late Thursday after the Trump administration quietly negotiated her release.
           </p>
           <p>
            President Trump and his aides worked for several weeks with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi to secure the freedom of Aya Hijazi, 30, a U.S. citizen, as well as her husband, Mohamed Hassanein, who is Egyptian, and four other humanitarian workers. Trump dispatched a U.S. government aircraft to Cairo to bring Hijazi and her family to Washington.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hijazi, who grew up in Falls Church, Va., and graduated from George Mason University, was working in Cairo with the Belady Foundation, which she and her husband established as a haven and rehabilitation center for street children in Cairo.
           </p>
           <p>
            The couple and their co-workers had been incarcerated since May 1, 2014, on child abuse and trafficking charges that were widely dismissed by human rights workers and U.S. officials as false. Virtually no evidence was ever presented against them, and for nearly three years they were held as hearings were inexplicably postponed and trial dates canceled. Human rights groups alleged that they were abused in detention.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Obama administration unsuccessfully pressed Sissi’s government for their release. It was not until Trump moved to reset U.S. relations with Egypt by embracing Sissi at the White House on April 3 — he publicly hailed the autocrat’s leadership as “fantastic” and offered the U.S. government’s “strong backing” — that Egypt’s posture changed. Last Sunday, a court in Cairo dropped all charges against Hijazi and the others.
