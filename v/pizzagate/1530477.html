<p>&quot;Larry [King] attends meetings/parties at the Omaha Girls\'
Club ... about every other week. He sometimes invited Joey
Webb or Nelly by calling the Webbs and <strong>telling them to
have one of the kids ready in so many minutes. Nelly said
they had no choice about attending these functions.</strong> She said
she attended only once about 2 years ago (age 14) but Joey
attended regularly from the time he was in seventh grade
(approx. age 12-13) until he left the Webbs\' home (age 16).
When Nelly attended she and Larry King went alone in
his limo. Other times, Mrs. King and Mr. and Mrs. Webb
also attended.</p>
<p>Nelly described these functions as lasting about 45 min­
utes. She said she attended one held on a Fri. evening about
7:00 p.m. There were about ten to fifteen older men present
and about twenty-five young teenage girls there. The girls
all signed a brown notebook Larry King had. Nelly has
appeared very frightened and teared up when asked about

<p><strong>Larry King either called or sent invitations to Nelly,
Kimberly and Joey to attend parties</strong> at his home which are
held about every other week. This began about two years
ago. Again, <strong>Nelly said the kids had no choice about whether
or not they would attend. They were driven over to King\'s
with Mr. and Mrs. Webb....&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Subject: Invitation: Taco and Tequila cookout on Sunday, December 28		</p>
<p>&quot;Dear friends and colleagues,
We will have the third annual cookout at 1837 California Street NW on Sunday, December 28th and we would like you and your partner to be part of it. This year, our party will be taco themed-with fresh, <strong>handmade tortillas flown in from Mexico</strong> the previous day, an entire suckling pig as well as sides and salsas.  We plan to start eating (and drinking) in the early afternoon hours at 3 p.m. Kosher and vegetarian options will be available. We will have a decent selection of white and red wines at hand as well as beer. This is a family friendly event, so <strong>you should bring all children that are available</strong>. Please let us know if you will join in.
All best, Helga Flores, Matt Duss, Michael Werz</p>
<p>P.S.** Parking is difficult in our neighborhood, Dupont Metro ten minutes by foot. 16th and U Streets bus stop five minutes.**&quot;</p>

<p><strong>An Open Secret&quot; Documentary</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Former child actor Egan filed lawsuits against Singer, TV executive Garth Ancier, Broadway producer Gary Goddard and ex Disney honcho David Neuman in California and Hawaii earlier this year alleging wide-scale sexual abuse, only to dramatically drop the action a few months later.</p>
<p>Egan is one of the major voices in the documentary and claims Singer, who vehemently denies the allegations, was one of the big players at <strong>drug-fueled male-only parties</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>He alleges he and other young boys were urged to get naked in a hot tub with Singer and his middle-aged entertainment industry friends.</strong></p>
<p>Amy Berg refused to cut Egan, who also sued another group of Hollywood players 10 years ago alleging similar abuse, from her documentary.</p>
<p>‘He puts Bryan Singer at the party,’ she told MailOnline. ‘He talks about him being at the party.’&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Subject: Re: Farmers L Update and Welcome Mat</strong></p>
<p>&quot;With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping up again to share <strong>our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to the farm in Lovettsville.</strong> And I thought I’d share a couple more notes: We plan to heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility. <strong>Bonnie will be Uber Service to transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.</strong>  And with the forecast showing prospects of some sun, and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I suggest you bring sweaters of whatever attire will enable us to use our outdoor table with a pergola overhead so we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo). I am ccing Trudy to repeat the invite, and sending pining wishes-you-could-come to Rima, John P, and Laurie &amp; Chris. </p>
<p>Con amore,
