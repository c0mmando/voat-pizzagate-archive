            Why don't you show the videos where the girl and boy admit that it was the mother's boyfriend Abraham Christie that beat and tortured them for a month into telling those stories when he took them to Morocco and the mother let him?

              Nobody is paying me to have my own opinion based upon the real facts and it is pathetic that this is the only comeback supporters ever come up with (alongside accusing anyone who dares question it of being a pedo supporter) and yes, please do show the (leaked by the mother &amp; Abraham) medical report which in reality shows that the injuries to both children were recent and therefore could not have been committed by the father who they had seen for 3 months.  The bruises and cuts were fresh and healing and could only have been done in the last couple of weeks, meaning it was Abraham who did it when in Morocco, as the children admitted (something you never show either).
             </p>
             <p>
              Want to talk about how he drugged them over a period of time as the medical report on their hair samples show?  Or the child porn found on his phone?  How about how the boy is partially deaf in one ear now because he hit him so hard there?  How come not a single one of the examining doctor's peers agreed with her report?  How about the method she used to come to her conclusion was discredited 25 years ago because it is not a reliable indicator of abuse.  Do you consider her examining the children TWICE to be abuse itself?  Care to show how she admitted in court that the damage she had exaggerated could have been caused by the suppositories the mother said she had given them for their constipation?
             </p>
             <p>
              Telling me to kill myself because is an awful thing to say simply because I don't agree with this particular story and I pity you because you cannot let go of your own projected personal issues to see what really went on here.
             </p>
             <p>
              Abraham Christie abused these children for his own sick reasons.  All the evidence shows that but you carry on with blinkers firmly glued on in supporting him instead of ever admitting what he did to the children.  Unless you actually consider that his torture of them was justified in getting the story out of them, as I have even seen some supporters say.  Do you agree with his methods?
             </p>
             <p>
              The fact that nobody who still supports this sad story never answers any of these questions shows just how much you are in denial about what really went on here.
