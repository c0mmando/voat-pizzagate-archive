            I'm not a Democrat, but I am certainly a liberal. And I believe with high probability that there has long been government protection for elite pedophile rings, and I believe with moderately high probability that Alefantis and Co. have played a recent role.

            That article proves the media can't think for themselves.  The writer says how completely shocked he is that party members believe theories "against" their own parties.  It's disgusting that he's so shocked by this.  Maybe they didn't put enough fluoride in our water after all.
           </p>

            We, The People, CAN still think for ourselves.  Pizzagate is about saving children not smearing a party.  Trump already won.  We are not trying to smear Hilary.  We are trying to rescure the children and prevent future children from being raped tortured and mirdered.

            Notice how the article outright disproves the Obama birth certificate conspiracy when just a few weeks ago we have qualified investigators in law enforcement showing their findings to the MSM.

             For example, it’s not shocking to learn that more than half of Republicans think President Obama was born in Kenya, which was throughly debunked years ago.

            I've always hated stupid, implausible conspiracy theories that can make an entire group seem "nutty" just by association. But, starting back in '08 I started seeing some things that really bothered me about the level of secrecy going on in our govt. This election had a lot more lightbulb moments, including pizzagate, but once those lights started going off it was much easier to discern the truth. So the truth about 9/11 and autism made a lot more sense suddenly. The main thing I hope everyone can get out of this is that our stupid two party system is a fraud all about controlling us and pitting us against each other so that we don't see the Devils at the top. If we all unite and turn against them, WE will control the narrative of our, and these innocent children's, future. So I vote for putting aside these dumb labels, supporting this new president, (who's obviously not acceptable to the very evil people who have been controlling everything), and hope/pray he actually IS different and can lead the way breaking up this evil.

             Well said!  But with the news media and Hollywood calling us crazy and ignoring the truth and promoting Trump hate, it's nearly impossible for us to all unite.  the majority of democrats will never embrace Trump.  They don't want the truth

            Maybe he should pursue other studies? Everybody's different. I would check into 'unschooling.' Anything but public school. Google John Stossel unschooling. Good luck.

            That's great to hear. This is a bi-partisan issue and hopefully both sides of the isle are purged by Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a political realignment going on anyway, and there is more commonality with many of Bernie's voters and Trump, than with Hillary IMO.

            I unplugged after the anthrax fake news scare push for war into Iraq 2002-3ish.  Even as a teenager My intuition told me it was bullshit and I told everyone around me and they freaked out and yelled at me. Bengazigate-&gt;weinergate-&gt;Pizzagate is finally what has lead them to my way of thinking (they are all liars, and once you see it, it's quite obvious).

            Being an insider, I tried telling people all this crap for the last 40+ years! I'm glad everybody is REALLY waking up now.

            This is why I have never owned a TV, read news papers, or listened to radio. Well exception to the old radio show such as "The Shadow" lol. That wasn't my favorite though.. But TV was the most evil propaganda invention of all time. Mesmerizing the masses, drawing them in and filling their brains with shit!
           </p>
           <p>
            But the education system is fully infiltrated as well, I MEAN FULLY!! As in I wouldn't trust more than 0.00000000003% of all teachers from pre-school to university. You all better start home schooling.

            It's just about time to lynch the Indonesian Islamic POTUS pretending to be an American Christian mulatto. Slaughter a pig and through him in a tub with it and string him up by the BALLZ using the pigs intestines! Time for BALLZ TO THE WALLZ!!

              The entire medical infrastructure is designed specifically to keep people in a state of dependence. The more dependent people are the more they follow the heard. Like big oil, which, by the way, the Rockefeller helped create the education and medical models used today, .. Anyway, big oil, AKA "Standard oil", controls your dependence of petroleum products. They became powerful through oil and then created even more dependencies. When all alone, fuel is free and readily available, WATER is FUEL. It can run your engines and refresh the global water at the same time, removing all pollutants making environmental water cleaner.
             </p>
             <p>
              They have created so many dependencies, its next to impossible to get out of without a physical civil war. The entire model they want to create is a socialist slave model where all people become so desperate, the will do anything, even eat their own children. We saw this before in Bolshevik Russia, you know, the enemies of Hitler! Funny Roosevelt and his VP were communists allies to Stalin.
             </p>
             <p>
              As President Kennedy stated, we are infiltrated by communists. Then he made executive order 11110 and was assassinated.

              Here is how it went down. The Bolshevik revolution was planned far in advance, but so was the liberalization of the rest of Europe and America.  The perpetrators of this had to establish control over education, media, banks and industries of power, such as oil. This was done by migration into Europe as best exemplified by its results in Germany after WW1.
 The desired effect was to take full control over the economic infrastructure, brainwashing children in schools, adult people with news media, controlling banking and strengthen the debt based model to make it impossible to get out of. Two new socialist parties were formed to to take control of the situation they deliberately created as the "rescue" of society. They created 2 for back up. However, Hitler threw a kink in their chain and took over one of their bogus parties. He had recognized the situation. But without going into that, I was going to tell you that the Bolsheviks had planned an attack on Europe to take place in the mid 20th century, this plan was concocted in the late 1800's. The plan was to take full control with one of the 2 socialist parties, take away guns from civilians, create a temporary utopia and then, when people were fully complacent and Dependant of their government, who would not even have an army, would be attacked and taken over by Bolshevism. It was also planned to be supported by the US. Note: the same was already taking place in the US, mass poverty, deliberate destruction of land, lives and economy. The stage was set to make America easy to commit and submit to the democrats/liberal/socialist/progressives.

              It has only been since the time of Kennedy that the demoncrats have made a point of infiltrating all political parties in the US and the same goes for all western nations. They no longer depend on just 1 or 2, but have a broad range of political infiltrations.

              The CIA is one of the worst, but it is the education system and the books being published that you have to beware of. The lies that are being taught are sickening. You should even revue the books you use to teach your children at home.

                Not sure what to recommend, the only things I have ever read was science journals, data, government records, case files, blue prints, nuclear physics volumes and quite a few dictionaries, all that sort of boring stuff. I've never read the news paper or watched TV. While I have used the internet extensively since the 80's, it wasn't for news or socializing, I'm very new to social networking.

                  Why would I question the lunar landings? Don't pay attention to government shills trying to make absurd conspiracy theories to obscure the truth, I can only imagine thats where you got an idea like that from.

                   Point taken. I've done just a bit of research, just in case, as so many things are suspect nowadays - it's always good to question 'authority' and what you've been told to some degree. "That idea" actually is quite pervasive nowadays just btw. But again, point well taken.

                    90% of the crap that goes around out there is BS fabricated by professional shills. The intention is to make conspiracies look like insanity and hoax's. They upload more hoax and nut job video's to youtube than anybody else. They are at all different levels, from the reasonably truthful to the extremely absurd all with the intention of hiding the ones that are full truth or at least fantastic speculation. And if you hit the nail on the head with the truth, you'rs will be deleted or your account banned. If you provide any evidence and your info is truthful and has an impact on others, or they are scared it will.

                      They have production studios around the world and possibly millions of shills in all countries except North Korea, who have their own. Each shill manages anywhere from 100's to 1000's of bots. So lets say there are just 1 million shills with an average of 500 bots under their control, thats 1,000,000 X 500 , 500,000,000 equivalence. Accuracy is not their game so these don't need to be perfect. The other factor is that they have film studio's and think tanks providing them with material and they have a job doing it on a 40 hour work week. So 500,000,000 would easily out number 2 billion normal people. And now you know why NEWS anchors are paid so well. $17mils annual to sit on their ass in front of a camera and spew shit they are told to.

                       Sounds like truth would not be able to be found or discerned anywhere and anyway. So how do you do it? It would help your credibility if you would answer the two questions I posed. (And again I don't doubt what you're saying about disinfo and bots but by your numbers we live in a complete complete Matrix.) Actually I've known, to some extent, for a while, why they get paid big bucks to sit and spew.

             pretty close to 1/4, anyway.  Could be more if you account for margin of error.

             Edit:  Wait, where did you get 24% from?  The source linked in the article says 17% of Clinton voters (the poll doesn't seem to have broken it down by party affiliation).

            "but it’s the small percentage of weirdos who believe in the conspiracies aimed at their own side that’s always the most fascinating." -- when it comes to raping, torturing, killing and ripping children apart -- either for fun or for their organs -- there is No Political Side. There is only the perpetrators of this abominable horror, and those who fight to stop it. Politics be damned. It brought us this blackmailable horror in the first place. This is a fight for the Soul of Our Humanity. Nobody here should think for an instant that this is a Demo-only problem. If so, you have missed the point entirely. 
e.g. go back to the 1989 Wash. Times article. Call boys in a midnight tour of the WH, during Reagan/Bush era. Hmmm. Where did the boys stay while in DC? They stayed at Barnie Franks' (demo) house. Personally, i was somewhat gratified, surprised by the 24% given to Demos. -- maybe because we have our own abundant share of Hillary-haters as well.

            Nearly half of the nation’s Republicans believe John Podesta’s leaked emails contain coded messages referring to “pedophilia, human trafficking and satanic ritual abuse,” according to a new poll from The Economist and YouGov. But more shocking is the number of Dems who have signed on to the asinine conspiracy: Twenty four percent say Pizzagate is “definitely” or “probably” true.

             I'm a progressive Dem, and I am floored that the Dem numbers are that high. I thought we were dealing with maybe 2-4% of Dems believing it to be probably or definitely true. These numbers are great news.

              95% of my friends who I've talked to in real life about pizzagate either believe me or at least say they don't know, but I might be right.  I'm a progressive democrat and almost all of my friends are too.  Granted most of my friends are already somewhat skeptical of the media.

            Yeah it's big-time cognitive dissonance. I began to wake up to the lies when I first got on the net ten years ago, and the rabbit hole hasn't ended yet. Sympathy for me, I had only three tv channels growing up. Boy was I propagandized.

            Everything you have been told is a lie.  It takes awhile to sink in.  And who would've guessed the CF is a huge part of the web!  We haven't listened to those who have been saying it for years....that the CF is a child trafficking conglomeration.  The myriad of articles from msm from a mere couple of years ago about child trafficking and posted somewhere here on voat, and now complete silence, it's as blatant as you can get.

             Am I not the only one who has been trying to read all of these anti-Pizzagate articles? One was promoting a site called Hoaxy.There was also one on Daily Kos that was deleted a few hours later. Why was it deleted? Was it censorship? All these anti-Pizzagate articles are serving our cause. We win, either way. I keep searching for that magical "legitimate attempt at debunking all the major claims of Pizzagate without appeal to 'authority' or genetic fallacy" article, but I can't seem to find it. So long as they fail to address the major claims, our message will continue to spread.

            Since NYMag is relatively popular MSM site, this would be a good opportunity to write truthful arguments in the comments section to convince readers and other people.
