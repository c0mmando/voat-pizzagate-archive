<p>“The leaders of a <strong>fundamentalist Mormon offshoot called Knights of the Crystal Blade</strong> took each other’s daughters as child brides, according to a search warrant that was recently unsealed.</p>
<p>The men, <strong>Samuel Shaffer</strong> and <strong>John Coltharp</strong>, were arrested in December and charged with kidnapping after an Amber Alert was issued for Coltharp’s daughters.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Shaffer told police that he married Coltharp’s 8-year-old daughter, and that Coltharp married his 7-year-old daughter.”</p>

<p>“Deputies discovered one of Shaffer’s daughters and one of Coltharp’s daughters inside two blue plastic 50-gallon water barrels located approximately 1,000 yards south of the Coltharp property. Shaffer told police the two girls had been placed in the water barrels to hide them from law enforcement.</p>
<p>Police said the two girls had spent approximately 24 hours inside the barrel in subfreezing temperatures. “These two children were not properly dressed for the cold temperatures and did not have food or water at that time…” “</p>
<hr />
<p>The serial child rapists each got 26 years to life.</p>
<p>Shaffer was sentenced in June:  <a href="https://fox13now.com/2018/05/22/member-of-utah-polygamous-doomsday-cult-sentenced-to-40-to-life-in-prison/">https://fox13now.com/2018/05/22/member-of-utah-polygamous-doomsday-cult-sentenced-to-40-to-life-in-prison/</a></p>
<p>Coltharp was sentenced yesterday, Aug. 8:  <a href="https://fox13now.com/2018/08/08/utah-doomsday-cult-leader-sentenced/">https://fox13now.com/2018/08/08/utah-doomsday-cult-leader-sentenced/</a></p>
<p>“In strong words to the judge, Sanpete County Attorney Kevin Daniels said he wished he could have sought the death penalty against Coltharp because of the <strong>trauma inflicted on as many as six children</strong>.</p>

<p>Daniels said he is still pursuing charges against other members of the group. Sanpete County prosecutors filed a felony charge against another member of the Knights of the Crystal Blade. <strong>Robert Roe,</strong> 35, was charged with first-degree felony sodomy on a child. Daniels <strong>alleges Roe took a 5-year-old girl as a bride.</strong></p>',

            Utah and LDS church really are the perfect microcosm of the shistdom.  LDS proper still acts like they have nuffin to do with protecting the fundamentalist despite the local gov (bought and paid for--money and probs golden tickets to the celestial!--by the church) giving preferential treatment to FLDS mining groups (who use their own kids for slave labor, pay'em less than illegals), allowing them to scam the welfare system, and taking child brides while exiling young boys (competition) out into the world with no education, skills, etc to survive. Then of course there's things like the pace memo
            <a href="http://www.utlm.org/newsletters/no80.htm#PACE">

            %20MEMO which, if true, would lead one to believe this tradition of child abuse isn't just perpetrated by those weirdos out in the desert but in the top ranks of the beehive state in SLC.

            I want to gas all followers of Semitic religions and bring back polytheism to keep the stupid, dogmatic unwashed masses occupied. At least polytheism makes sense of the disorder of the universe.

             I get that the old Gods of old mythology played their parts and had great powers, but isn't Jesus the one true GOD of our realm?

            was charged with first-degree sodomy on a child.  took a 5 year-old girl as a bride.  She was probably the one he sodomized, I am assuming.  I want to cry.
