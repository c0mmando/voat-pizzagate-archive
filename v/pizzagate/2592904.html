<p>&quot;Mason Verger is introduced in the novel Hannibal as a wealthy sexual sadist who was horribly disfigured during a therapy session with Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He plans gruesome revenge against Lecter, which sets the novel\'s plot in motion. The novel and TV series also portray his dysfunctional relationship with his twin sister Margot, whom he subjects to years of emotional and sexual abuse.&quot;</p>
<p>Mason Verger is the son of one of Baltimore, Maryland\'s most wealthy, politically connected families. His father, Molson, founded a meatpacking company that had grown into an empire by the time of Mason\'s birth.</p>
<p>&quot;Mason takes pleasure in acts of cruelty and sexual violence, including torturing animals and molesting children. He also performs autoerotic asphyxiation, and enjoys collecting children\'s tears with sterile swabs and flavoring his martinis with them. At one point he befriends Idi Amin, with whom he claims to have re-enacted the crucifixion of Jesus by nailing a migrant worker to a cross. Publicly, he claims to be a born-again Christian, and operates a Christian camp for underprivileged children—whom he molests. As a teenager, Mason raped his twin sister, Margot, who went into therapy with Lecter to deal with the trauma. Lecter suggested that it would be cathartic for her to kill her brother.</p>
<p>Verger is eventually arrested for – and found guilty of – several counts of child molestation, but thanks to his family\'s political connections he is sentenced to community service and court-mandated therapy in lieu of prison time. Lecter serves as his court-appointed psychiatrist. During one of their sessions, Lecter gives Mason PCP and tells him to peel off his own face with a piece of broken mirror. In a state of drug-induced euphoria, Mason complies, and afterwards feeds the pieces to his dogs, except for his nose, which he himself eats. Lecter then tells Mason to demonstrate autoerotic asphyxiation; Mason hangs himself and breaks his neck. He survives the ordeal, but is left disfigured – losing his lips, nose, cheeks, eyelids and left eye – and paralyzed from the neck down.&quot;</p>
<p>So Mason is from a &quot;wealthy politically connected&quot; family and is a huge child molester. He runs a Christian camp for underprivileged children which is used to molest children. </p>

          <p>
           Mason Verger is the son of one of Baltimore, Maryland's most wealthy, politically connected families. His father, Molson, founded a meatpacking company that had grown into an empire by the time of Mason's birth.

           "Mason takes pleasure in acts of cruelty and sexual violence, including torturing animals and molesting children. He also performs autoerotic asphyxiation, and enjoys collecting children's tears with sterile swabs and flavoring his martinis with them.

           Verger is eventually arrested for – and found guilty of – several counts of child molestation, but thanks to his family's political connections he is sentenced to community service and court-mandated therapy in lieu of prison time. Lecter serves as his court-appointed psychiatrist. During one of their sessions, Lecter gives Mason PCP and tells him to peel off his own face with a piece of broken mirror.

          <p>
           So Mason is from a "wealthy politically connected" family and is a huge child molester. He runs a Christian camp for underprivileged children which is used to molest children.
