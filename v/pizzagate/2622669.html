<p>Body of resignation letter </p>
<p>Dear Brad and Kiersten,</p>
<p>This letter is to inform you that I will be resigning from Gaia as of the end of my Term, and am requesting that I be allowed to exit before then – the sooner the better – for reasons I will now explain.</p>
<p>As I state later in this letter, I do not wish to discuss this verbally, so please let me know in writing if my request will be honored.</p>
<p>This will have been nearly six years of service, the equivalent of getting a Ph.D. had I been doing this work for college credits.</p>
<p>I appreciate all that you have done for me in terms of getting my work out there, and without censorship – at least up until the most recent Term.</p>
<p>I have become profoundly uncomfortable with almost every aspect of this work environment and management structure, particularly as of FY 2018. The company as a whole seems to be having a severe psycho-spiritual crisis.</p>
<p>My reasons for withdrawing are multifaceted. Out of a sense of respect, honesty and self-preservation, I will share a few of them, though it ultimately is not a requirement that I do so.</p>
<p>First of all, let me say that the so-called “Gaia Employee Movement” has nothing to do with Corey Goode, nor with me. I have no idea who these people are. I have no idea why they asserted that Corey and I were both going to be leaving. They made that up. Leaving this job was only a last-ditch resort until I saw the scope of damage that my reputation is now suffering. Corey was concerned that you would think this movement had something to do with him, or his legal actions. It does not.</p>
<p>The grievances that Corey has put in writing regarding how he was treated are absolutely legitimate, and mirror my own. They also bear similarities to the nature and spirit of the many complaints being made by the Gaia Employee Movement, which is a condensed version of what we also see in secure online forums such as Glassdoor.</p>
<p>The reason why everyone is yelling in your face is you. It is not a problem with them. I refuse to pretend otherwise any longer. These are people who have been so deeply abused and crushed, on the soul level, that they feel no other choice but to cry out in agony. Desperate people are willing to take great risks, which is a very sad thing in this case. This is why I hope Corey’s problems can be resolved without any public legal filings.</p>
<p>There is a profoundly deep problem with the entire way in which Gaia is running. I do not believe it is fixable. Nor do I wish to be involved in trying to fix it.</p>
<p>If I were to enumerate all of the things I have personally seen and witnessed, and how they have made me feel, this would be a very long letter. My goal is not to leave with any sense of bitterness. Nor can I afford to be dragged into any litigation whatsoever – regardless of whether this Company offers me the support of its attorneys or not. Ending my employment now is a much better alternative than continuing in this present environment.</p>
<p>Regarding Corey’s legal actions, I do not have any need or desire to retain an attorney at this point. My goal is to have a peaceful, private separation and get back to doing my own thing. It may be rough for a while but I need a clean break and a fresh start.</p>
<p>I have willfully ignored an enormous number of offensive, disrespectful and abusive situations in order to do this job the last six years – primarily out of a sense of financial dependency. That was my own weakness, as I needed time to grieve and take it easy after a devastating seven-year ordeal with my physically violent ex, which overlapped with my first three years on this job.</p>
<p>I am now being overwhelmed with emails and written comments from people who have heard about the Gaia Employee Movement and are very upset about what they are learning. They are demanding that I leave this platform immediately. I can provide many examples to prove this point upon request. The level of anger and disgust I am seeing in any one of these letters is deeply troubling.</p>
<p>This is already starting to cause me significant career damage and it will get far worse if I don’t do something about it, fast. In the post- MeToo era, this issue has explosive, devastating and inevitable potential to do harm. Entertainment companies have never before been so vulnerable to public uprisings and whistleblowers. This is uncharted territory and is very dangerous.</p>
<p>Should any of these alleged employees or journalists actually attempt to contact me directly, I am guaranteeing you in writing, right now, that I will have nothing to say to them. Just as in the case of Corey’s litigation, I want to remain completely uninvolved and neutral. This whole situation is terrifying to me in terms of what it could potentially do to the credibility and value of my entire life’s work.</p>
<p>The YouTube videos about this are proliferating. They cannot be silenced thanks to people’s First Amendment rights. If you were to try to stop them it would get much worse at a much faster speed. I am already seeing these videos getting tens of thousands of hits.</p>
<p>This situation is on the verge of “going viral” in a very big way. I can see it coming. I am being called out by name in many of these videos. People are wondering why I am still involved, and they are extremely angry. It is getting very, very ugly.</p>
<p>My recommendation is for the Company to accept my resignation, as it will draw the teeth out of this movement, give them a perceived “win,” and allow you to more quickly return to business with offering your impressive collection of curated content and original programs. Otherwise, if I were to remain affiliated, the heat will grow exponentially. If I retain the job and refuse to comment, the damage to my career and reputation could be nearly total. I have to look out for my own future.</p>
<p>Your team had Tucker Collins send my wife a letter, which effectively amounts to a request for me to take your side in this battle in the public eye, including video appearances. That is not something I wish to do, nor am capable of doing. Why? Because several of the things the Gaia Employee Movement (GEM) has been saying are absolutely correct, based on my firsthand eyewitness experience – which I do not ever want to share with the public.</p>
<p>The Company also attempted to upload a video to my YouTube channel that aggressively promotes Luciferianism – namely S1E1 of Ancient Civilizations – even while Gaia supposedly has a policy of “no religion,” at least for my fellow colleagues and me. I was tricked into participating in a very religious program that I do not want to have any affiliation with. This show is literally saying that God is Evil and Lucifer is God – who (ahem) also happens to be a reptilian alien. Seriously?</p>
<p>How would this look if it all got dragged into the public eye, especially in light of the overwhelming online movement called Pizzagate? Millions of people are now working to identify Luciferian elements in our society, and they are murderously angry about it.</p>
<p>This is easily proven by the fact that Edgar Maddison Welch walked into Comet Ping-Pong Pizza in Washington, DC on December 4th, 2016, and fired his assault rifle. He was sentenced to four years in prison.</p>

<p>Some have debated whether these Pizzagate claims are grounded in reality or not, but that does not change the enormous danger that political activists in this arena are now posing to the accused.</p>
<p>The potential damage to my career, reputation and physical safety from the existence of “Ancient Civilizations” on the Gaia network is massive, as I have been very outspoken in the public eye against Luciferianism, and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Even worse, I had already written several investigative articles about Pizzagate on my website before Ancient Civilizations was released, making it clear that I believe these claims are largely based in provable facts.</p>

            It's so fun to see Wilcock gets sucked back up into his own pile of shit,
           </p>
           <p>
            How could the guy go for 7 YEARS on AA and NOT KNOW that eventually they had to broach the subject that the freemasons "God" is Lucifer and the "God" of the old testament is Enlil and therefore Lucifer is Enki of the Annunaki. How DUMB do you have to be? Such an eloquent pile of bullshit you wrote above. "I was held hostage or financial reasons" - what a fucking lush.
           </p>
           <p>
            This fun little controversy is going to bring this whole brainwashing shitshow called Ancient Aliens and the Gaia Faggot Network down like Spaceys House of Cards.

            Wilcox is a gatekeeper, intentionally pushes frivolous material to discredit the truth that gets associated with it. Wilcox should not be sourced here any more than Alex Jones or David Seaman. This is entry level stuff guys.

            Only heard of the show.  Didn't know who Wilcox was.  The resignation letter was profound.  It's written by someone who is scared.

           <p>
            I went to Gaia's site.  Again, never heard of them.  Seeing Roku, Apple and other names at the bottom was telling.  It looks like a combo of self-help/brainwashing/entertainment video.  I'm sure the video is manipulated in a way to affect the viewer.

            OK. I hadn't heard of this until just now. I have been on the fence about Wilcox until I read far enough through his blog to see him gushing about Peter Gabriel and Steven Tyler. This after I just read a Steven Tyler reveal on CDAN. Tyler bought and sold young girls to supplement his waning revenues. He's a serial child rapist and trafficker.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wilcox also lost me by referring to the Comet Ping Pong shooter, when we all know that it was a diversion operation used to discredit the investigation. Wilcox is either a limited hangout or a complete moron.

            I feel sorry for David. He has been deliberately drawn into things that are not what they appear.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like when John Podesta appeared on Ancient Aliens David distanced himself from it saying he had no.idea Podesta was going to appear on it. (((They))) know exactly what they're doing. They've tried to discredit and compromise David for years, time after time trying to wear him down.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the comments someone asks why he doesn't just upload his stuff exclusively to YouTube. I suspect its due to his YouTube being compromised late 2016 -
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://divinecosmos.com/davids-blog/1210-youtube-disabled/">
             https://divinecosmos.com/davids-blog/1210-youtube-disabled/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            David at the time couldn't understand how one individual could destroy his whole channel,  'own' his videos and even says himself (quote from above linked article) -
           </p>
           <p>
            "AT LEAST THE GAIA VIDEOS CANNOT BE STOLEN
           </p>
           <p>
            Thankfully, Gaia is privately-owned, and all 300+ episodes I have on there are secure. "
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps Gaia had a hand in his YouTube attack, convincing him the best way forward is to stick with a private company... unwittingly for David one that is corrupt, sinister and appears to promote the very things he is against.
           </p>
           <p>
            More investigation required into Gaia methinks!

            What’s this bullshit I missed between Corey and David? I was a member of the forum Corey originated from and saw his whole rise to fringe fame with Gaia and Wilcock. But I never followed it because I knew first hand that Corey was a liar, and that David has been saying erroneous bullshit ever since claiming we were all going to “ascend” in 2000. I could tell lots but to me this is all in the Internet forum drama category and thus usually very boring.
           </p>
           <p>
            I’ve known people affiliated with Gaia as well and I’ve also heard very odd sexual things going on with them, that the company leaders were in some kind of weird sex cult basically. They also hired George Noory, who was the boring Turkish douche hired by Clear Channel (neo-cons) to host Coast to Coast AM after Art Bell retired. Coast to Coast is probably what first drew national attention to Wilcock as well. It’s all a very tight knit little club with CIA handlers from the “Aviary.”

             Where did you hear about the weird sex cult stuff? Be great if we could get some links before they likely disappear. Unless it was just through verbal discussions if so please tell us more:)

              Just discussions is how I heard about it and I don’t have anything that isn’t already public other than that private discussion. But from what I remember there is already a fair bit that is already out there. Sound healing video on YouTube with Gaia exec, the lead woman in the vid is into orgies and sex ritual stuff. Through people like this, DW is at most just one degree removed from really weird stuff. I hope he’s in earnest about what he says but he’s conned people before, so..
