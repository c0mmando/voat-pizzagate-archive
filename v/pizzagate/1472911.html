            Right before he died, he said he had a tape that would bring down the Obama administration. Then he died and they released some BS video where Obama said something slightly controversial and were like "see, this is why we obviously didn't kill him, because this video is not that bad, see!?"

            haha fair enough. The facial hair is pretty odd.  He used to be as church broke as they come so he must have a lot of people to worry about..the pedo elite AND the mormon mafia. I wouldn't want to be in his shoes. I'm not even sure which is worse.

            Yep, I remember Beck going on about FEMA camps being built....was going to have a big show on it......then conceded, backed off, changed his stance saying it was just a conspiracy theory....referred to the popular mechanics article that debunked it......yep, same popular mechanics that says those photos from outer space/trips to mars are real.  Then Beck hit the big money.

               not true, at times they are commanded to lie. In fact their own apostle has said "the truth is not always useful." Besides, what mormons do to mormons and what mormons do to gentiles are not one in the same.

            Beck definitely changed.  He actually used to be really funny on radio, TV did not suit him IMO.  He gets inappropriately weepy on TV.
And to be honest, he was the first to publicly realize that there was a spider web of nefarious connections at the highest levels of our govt.  There was obviously some sort of incident, because he freaked out and moved to a gated community in Texas.  Now he just looks broken...he reminds me of the character that was castrated in Game of Thrones.
