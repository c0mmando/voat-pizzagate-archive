            Dear friend,
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Giuliani has been taken to a safe location and we are awaiting instructions from a group of people we call light workers, who work behind the scenes to protect people like Rudy who come forward. They are patriots within our government, protecting what is left of our Republic and Constitution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, Mr. Giuliani is in grave danger, but he is safe for now. And indeed, they are using CGI and other methods to "replace" him.
           </p>
           <p>
            What appears to be a hired group of COINTELPRO agents have taken over the Internet, declaring Rudy's brave statements a "hoax" and pointing everyone to a completely fake Twitter account (
            <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani">
             https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani)
            </a>
            ) that Mr. Giuliani has no access to and nothing to do with. These agents and agitators are easy to spot and identify.
           </p>
           <p>
            We understand the skepticism as well, but Mr. Giuliani's safety is paramount. His safety is the priority, and at a later time when his safety can be assured, he is expected to make a public announcement -- but not within the borders of the United States. We cannot state in more urgent terms how serious this issue is for his safety, and that of his family and some of his close friends.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Giuliani requests humbly that you spread his Official Statement far and wide on social media (this link --
            <a href="http://henrymakow.com/2016/12/rudolph-giuliani-confirms.html">
             http://henrymakow.com/2016/12/rudolph-giuliani-confirms.html
            </a>
            -- contains the statement and his other Tweets for you to use).
           </p>
           <p>
            The best way to help us is to spread the word, and re-post Rudy's statements about PizzaGate from his closed Twitter account using social media, like YouTube. His statements contain many truths that will lead you in the right direction. Do not let agitators and agents try to stop you, because they will, and they will attack and threaten you. If you feel your safety is in doubt, please do not proceed.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is all we have for now. We will be in touch.
           </p>
           <p>

            It was a troll account meant to make the pizzagate investigation look bad. Anyone who is spreading this disinfo is doing the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            The biggest giveaway was when the account tweeted:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <h1>
             PizzaGate is real. Washington D.C. is the center of world's biggest pedophile ring. Those trying to deflect and deny this story are pedos.
            </h1>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            One of the biggest things that keeps people from being open minded about the pizzagate investigation, are the mouth-frothers who accuse anyone who is skeptical of being a pedophile, themselves, which makes it look like a mindless psyop witch hunt. And this twitter account did  just that.

             Wrong.  It was not a troll account.  According to "snopes" a CIA enterprise, it was a troll account.  Snopes protects the bad guys.

             <p>
              Snopes can be pretty questionable, but other places I've seen concur. Do you have evidence to show this really was Giuliani?
