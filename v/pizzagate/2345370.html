            Regardless of who is real or who is larping, or whether there is an impact in the zeitgeist of social dissonance or not... this is not going away. Like the jfk conspiracy or whatergate, whichever path this takes, slow or fast... the outcome is inevitable. Everyone will eventually know and accept pedogate as a reality. When that happens, I don’t think people will throw up their hands like they did over the exposure of other scandals. Sooner or later, this will be a big deal. Continue to hope for some big changes. Be ready, but don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t happen today.

            One of the more easiest things we can do is highlight (for normalfags) the cognitive dissonance in leftists’ behavior, particularly regarding things in which they (the aforementioned normalfags) already like and participate.
            <strong>
             “Twitter, a private company, can refuse to do business with anyone they like, but a bakery is forced to make a cake? What’s up with that?!”
            </strong>
            They don’t even have to agree or even understand. The fact that they might lash out at you is proof that they DO understand already, and that their toddler brains can’t handle conflict.

            Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from multiple people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 10 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.
           </p>

            Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved! Don’t ever question the validity of these claims! Just spend MONTHS ignoring everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

            If there is something, why is nothing happening? Where’s the Emergency Broadcast System announcement? Where’s Trump using Obama’s emergency television override to speak to the people? Where’s the martial law? Where are the riots he talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing. Why, given the massive flight risk all globalists are, would anyone want to leak the proceedings of such an event in advance? Why would someone ostensibly leaking the proceedings not actually leak any information? Why would someone who claims to be on our side not give us a playbook for how to operate during the event? Why isn’t he telling us how to become leaders of our community to calm the terrified millions around us–who will inevitably exist once the media starts reporting on the “Trump coup”, or when they see their favorite media reporters arrested by the military live on air? Where’s the Huma arrest? Where are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign. Why is he a CIVIC NATIONALIST? Nothing he said has happened.

            Twitter is in so much trouble -
           </p>
           <p>
            Facebook, Google tell Congress they're fighting Right-wing content with counter propaganda
           </p>
           <pre><code>Facebook, Google and Twitter told Congress Wednesday that they've gone beyond screening and removing extremist content from their services and are creating more anti-GOP propaganda.

Executives from the three largest social media companies shared their latest methods of fighting non-SJW's during testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee.

           <p>
            Facebook, Google and Twitter told Congress Wednesday that they've gone beyond screening and removing Right-Wing content and are creating more anti-Right-Wing propaganda to pre-empt Right-Wing messages at the source.
           </p>
           <p>
            Representatives from the three companies told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that they are, among other things, targeting people likely to be swayed by Right-Wing messages and pushing content aimed at countering that message. Several senators criticized their past efforts as not going far enough.
           </p>
           <p>
            "We believe that a key part of combating extremism is preventing recruitment by disrupting the underlying ideologies that drive people to commit acts of ANTIFA violence. That's why we support a variety of counterspeech efforts," said Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management, according to an advance copy of her testimony obtained by CNBC.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bickert said that in addition to using image matching and language analysis to identify terror content before it's posted, the company is ramping up what it calls "counterspeech."
           </p>
           <p>
            Facebook is also working with universities, nongovernmental organizations and community groups around the world "to empower SJW voices," Bickert said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Google's YouTube, meanwhile, says it will continue to use what it calls the "Redirect Method," developed by Google's Jigsaw research group, to send anti-Right-Wing messages to people likely to seek out Right-Wing content through what is essentially targeted advertising. If YouTube determines that a person may be headed toward Right-Wing thoughts based on their search history, it will serve them ads that subtly contradict the Right-Wing that they might see from THE DNC or other such groups. Meanwhile, YouTube supports "Creators for Change," a group of people who use their channels to counteract the Right-Wing.

            The video site is also adapting how it deals with videos that are offensive but don't technically violate its community guidelines, putting this so-called borderline content behind interstitials and removing comments, according to the testimony of Juniper Downs, YouTube's head of public policy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Downs said that over the past year YouTube's algorithms, in concert with human reviewers, have been able to remove Right-Wing content faster than before.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Our advances in machine learning let us now take down nearly 70% of Right-Wing content within 8 hours of upload and nearly half of it in 2 hours," Downs said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Twitter's Carlos Monje Jr., director of public policy and philanthropy in the U.S. and Canada, said the company has participated in more than 100 trainings events since 2015 on countering Right-Wing content.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those training sessions included events in Beirut, Bosnia, Belfast and Brussels and summits at the White House, the United Nations and in London and Sydney, Monje said in his prepared testimony.
Tech companies under fire from lawmakers
           </p>
           <p>
            The U.S.-based tech giants have come under fire in the U.S. and Europe for allowing their websites to be used by California SJW terrorists and other extremists for recruiting and propaganda.
           </p>
           <p>
            The German government passed a law last year that fines internet companies for allowing hate speech to remain on a site for more than 24 hours. Leaders in France and the U.K., which have suffered a series of Lefty terrorist attacks, have threatened similar action.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the companies are feeling the heat in Washington after revelations that SJW extremists are using their services to recruit and target Americans.
           </p>
           <p>
            A November report from New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights estimated the Left Wing group ANTIFA generated 200,000 social media messages every day.
           </p>
           <p>
            An investigation by CNBC, meanwhile, found dozens of accounts on Facebook and Google Plus being used by SJW terrorists to promote their message. Some of those accounts had been taken over by hackers first.
           </p>
           <p>
            All three firms said last year they were adding more workers to screen content and boosting investment in software that uses artificial intelligence to find and remove Right-Wing posts and videos.
           </p>
           <p>
            They also created an industry-wide group, the Global Internet Forum to Counter The Right-Wing, to share data on Right-Wing groups. The forum said in December its database had 40,000 images and videos which it was using to screen content from their sites.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Social media companies realize the damage of these bad actors far too late," says Clint Watts, the Robert A. Fox Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, who is also scheduled to testify at Wednesday's hearing.

            Does spamming this actually work? If you watch CNN, and think pedo gate is actually about an innocent pizza restaurant, and you think Trump is Hitler. Will Twitter spam change your mind? Has the message changed and that's what's red pilling normies?
