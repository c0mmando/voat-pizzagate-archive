<p>Fr. James Martin: \'Out at St. Paul is one of the most vibrant Catholic LGBT ministries\'</p>
<p>NEW YORK (ChurchMilitant.com) - A so-called Catholic LGBT ministry is heralding the canonization of a notorious pederast, the late Harvey Milk.</p>
<p>Out at St. Paul (OASP), the gay and lesbian ministry group based at St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in New York City, posted on its Facebook page Tuesday an article lauding the openly gay activist Milk as a saint. Milk is upheld by pro-LGBT activists as a martyr for their leftist cause.</p>
<p>What they hide is the known fact Milk had a homosexual relationship with a mentally disturbed 16-year-old named Jack McKinley and was attracted to others like him. </p>
<p>Milk\'s biographer Randy Shilts noted in his book The Mayor of Castro Street that the pederast was extremely attracted to &quot;young waifs with substance abuse problems&quot; and &quot;men in their late teens.&quot; </p>
<p>Joseph Sciambra, a Catholic advocate who truly cares for the salvation of each individual that struggles with same-sex attraction, also references Shilts\' work on Milk. Citing Milk\'s biography, Sciambra writes, &quot;It would be to boyish-looking men in their late teens and early 20s that Milk would be attracted for the rest of his life.&quot;</p>
<p>The homosexualist Jesuit priest Fr. James Martin has often praised Out at St. Paul. Last June, Fr. Martin tweeted, &quot;\'Out at St. Paul\' is one of the most vibrant Catholic #LGBT ministries in the country, perhaps the world.&quot; He added that the group is &quot;a model for many parishes.&quot;</p>
<p>In 2017, the Jesuit called for Catholics to reverence so-called gay marriage. </p>
<p>Referring to an active homosexual friend in a same-sex marriage, Martin said, &quot;I have a hard time imagining how even the most traditionalist, homophobic, closed-minded Catholic cannot look at my friend and say, \'That is a loving act, and that is a form of love that I don\'t understand but I have to reverence.\'&quot;</p>
<p>Martin\'s favorite strawman is labeling Catholics who morally object to the homosexual lifestyle as &quot;homophobic,&quot; saying such Catholics &quot;hate&quot; people with same-sex attraction.</p>
<p>Cardinal Gerhard Müller, the former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, said in May that homophobia isn\'t real. </p>
<p>&quot;Homophobia simply does not exist, it is clearly an invention,&quot; he affirmed, saying it was a tactic by activists to dominate &quot;the minds of others.&quot;</p>
<p>Among Fr. Martin\'s many errors regarding LGBT outreach include:</p>
<p>Saying homosexuals are not required to keep chastity
Saying Catholics should reverence so-called gay marriage
Supporting transgenderism in children
Promoting so-called gay marriage
Affirming that gays should be allowed to kiss at Mass
Believing that chaste homosexuals aren\'t leading a fully integrated life
Insisting God makes people gay</p>
<p>Many bishops refuse to address the issue and are intimidated into silence by such terms, said Cdl. Müller.</p>
<p>&quot;Today some bishops do not have the courage to tell the truth and allow themselves to be intimidated,&quot; he said. &quot;They do not understand that homophobia is a deception that serves to threaten the people.&quot;</p>
<p>One bishop who is standing up to Martin\'s deceptive LGBT outreach is Bp. Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas. At the U.S. bishops\' November meeting in Baltimore, Strickland seemingly was referencing Martin when he asked bishops why they let such a person speak in their dioceses.</p>
<p>On Nov. 13, Strickland began, &quot;Do we believe the doctrine of the Church or not? There\'s a priest that travels around now basically saying that he doesn\'t. He seems to be very well promoted in various places.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Strickland called his fellow bishops to use their authority to shut down this priest, which was generally understood to be Martin.</p>
<p>&quot;Brothers, I think part of the fraternal correction or the fraternal support we offer each other is to say: can that be presented in our diocese? That same-sex marriage is just fine, and the Church will one day grow to understand that,&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>Martin rejected Strickland\'s claims.</p>
<p>On Nov. 24, Martin stated, &quot;Recently, a cardinal and a bishop both offered their critiques of people who identify as \'LGBT\' and my own ministry to LGBT Catholics.&quot; He added, &quot;The bishop did not mention me by name, but it was hard to imagine who else he could have been talking about.&quot;</p>
<p>Martin has often called for a change in the language of the Catechism of the Catholic Church that refers in paragraph 2358 to same-sex attraction as being &quot;objectively disordered&quot; and in paragraph 2357 to homosexual acts being &quot;intrinsically disordered.&quot; Instead, Martin wants the language to be changed to &quot;differently ordered&quot; — implying that a same-sex orientation is just as legitimate as opposite-sex attraction.</p>
<p>He says this rejection of Church language is owing to sensitivity to homosexuals. Martin has, however, expressed his opinion that active gays should be able to kiss during Mass and insists homosexuals are &quot;born that way&quot; and they &quot;can\'t change.&quot;</p>

            One of Milk’s victims was a 16-year-old runaway from Maryland named Jack Galen McKinley. As previously mentioned, Milk had a soft spot in his, um, heart for teenage runaways. Motivated by an apparent quid pro quo of prurience, Milk plucked McKinley from the street.
           </p>
           <p>
            Randy Shilts was a San Francisco Chronicle reporter and close friend to Harvey Milk. Though Shilts died of AIDS in 1994, he remains, even today, one of the most beloved journalists in the “LGBT” community.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shilts was also Harvey Milk’s biographer. In his glowing book “The Mayor of Castro Street,” he wrote of Milk’s “relationship” with the McKinley boy: ” … Sixteen-year-old McKinley was looking for some kind of father figure. … At 33, Milk was launching a new life, though he could hardly have imagined the unlikely direction toward which his new lover would pull him.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In a sane world, of course, the only direction his “new lover” should have pulled him was toward San Quentin. But, alas, today’s America – a burgeoning relativist land of make-believe – is anything but sane.
           </p>
           <p>
            Randy Thomasson, child advocate and founder of SaveCalifornia.com, is one of the nation’s foremost experts on Harvey Milk. Of the Shilts biography, Thomasson notes, “Explaining Milk’s many flings and affairs with teenagers and young men, Randy Shilts writes how Milk told one ‘lover’ why it was OK for him to also have multiple relationships simultaneously: ‘As homosexuals, we can’t depend on the heterosexual model. … We grow up with the heterosexual model, but we don’t have to follow it. We should be developing our own lifestyle. There’s no reason why you can’t love more than one person at a time.'”
           </p>
           <p>
            Whereas McKinley, a disturbed runaway boy, desperately sought a “father figure” to provide empathy, compassion, wisdom and direction, he instead found Harvey Milk: a promiscuous sexual predator who found, in McKinley, an opportunity to satisfy a perverse lust for underage flesh.
           </p>
           <p>
            Years later McKinley committed suicide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another teen who crossed paths with Harvey Milk was Christian convert and former homosexual Gerard Dols. In a 2008 radio interview with Concerned Women for America, Dols shared of how – as a physically disabled teen – the “very nice” Harvey Milk had encouraged him in 1977 to run away from his Minnesota home and come to San Francisco.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Dols, Milk told him, “Don’t tell your parents,” and later sent him a letter with instructions. Thankfully, the letter was intercepted by Dols’ parents who then filed a complaint with the Minnesota attorney general’s office.
           </p>
           <p>
            The incident was evidently swept under the rug.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what does a man like Harvey Milk get for his apparent crimes? While most sexual predators get time in prison and a dishonorable mention on the registry of sex offenders, Harvey Milk got his own California state holiday (“Harvey Milk Day”) and, more recently, his own commemorative postage stamp, awarded by the Obama administration’s USPS.

             This is tragic. Gays are often promiscuous. Even those with partners have open relationships.  Put them on a deserted island away from kids and let them bugger each other.

              I don't know what causes that. It is true, although many are not.  I truly believe they have mental issues connected to their sexual choices.  Yes, they should be kept away from Children.  I hate to say it but how else can we protect them.  Always we must cater to the minorities at the cost of others. We are not talking about Special Needs people, these are people with mental issues.  No they are NOT born that way and their numbers are only about 2% of the population.  I am not in favor of being cruel to any group, but MY GOD, Our Children must be protected.

            In 1977, Harvey Milk’s election marked a moment of hope and progress not only for San Francisco, but the entire nation. It’s truly a testament to his legacy that he is so warmly remembered 40 years after his assassination. Today, we celebrate what Harvey stood for.

               I see her for lunch tomorrow.  Should be good.  I will have a hard time.  She lived in San Fran around that time.  So she surely has been brainwashed into believing their propaganda.  Really, who wants to believe their country would do things like that.  I don't blame her, just wish I could get through to her.
