<p>I wanted to bring to your attention some very disturbing facts regarding the missing kids covered in the news as late. I will be contacting many investigative journalists but I hope that you will take up this story because it is a very big one and needs to be known... i hope that you, as a fellow human, will find the time to devote to this story and I will help you every step of the way, if you ask it.</p>
<p>Please look into this.</p>
<p>First off... I don\'t care what side of the aisle you identify with; red, blue, purple, rainbow...whatever.</p>
<p>We are all, at the end of the day, one human species. A core feature of our humanity is our offspring and, as human beings, we should all labor to protect the weakest among us.</p>
<p>Should.</p>
<p>With the recent report of immigrant children being separated from parents, I have really started to become suspicious (moreso than before). Whereas this practice is not new*, it should be EXTREMELY alarming to consider the implications of what exactly is occuring.</p>
<p>It is not solely immigrant children that are going missing...</p>
<p>I am exhausted, mentally and physically, due to nearly 8 hours of constant research so I cannot compile a complete list of all the things I\'ve read, plus my computer and phone both seem to keep freezing up.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this:</p>
<p>DynCorp a la Cerberus Capital, the PMSC of choice for this administration (Feinberg appointment as head of Intelligence Advisory) is and HAS BEEN the corporation hired to manage Child Protective Services.</p>
<p>Let this sink in...</p>
<p>The private mercenary group who was caught in Bosnia prostituing children, the PMSC that brought you underage boys to dance for DynCorp employees, the people who were caught killing civilians un-impeded in Iraq... The organization who used labor slaves from war-ravaged areas is now the agency tasked with keeping track of thousands of undocumented children...</p>
<p>They are awarded contracts in all branches of the military as well as the Dept of Health &amp; hospitals and the SSA...**</p>
<p>What better way to make sure the populace at large is kept blinded of the fact that these children, as well as many other thousands in the CPS system, than to have unstoppaple access to all databases that could potentially track them?</p>
<p>I\'m aware that, following Bosnia, new ownership was found; however, this does not mean that those practices were condemned or even punished...at all. And they apparently still seem to have an issue with high-level execs continuing to perpetuate pedophilia...</p>
<p>No DynCorp employee has ever been criminally prosecuted for any of these crimes. While most recently in April of 2017 the Vice President of Business Development for DynCorp, James Grazioplene, was arrested for molesting children in the 1980s, this was during his term as an officer in the United States Army.***</p>
<p>Now... Let\'s add to this fact that Trump had to choose between DeVos\' brother, Eric Prince (Blackwater/Academi/the list goes on...) And Feinberg (Cerberus Capital/DynCorp/Computer Sciences Corporation)... He chose the guy with a company that is well-versed in human trafficking instead of Blackwater, who just harvested organs and made millions off of Afghani heroin.</p>
<p>So my point is... We have hundreds of thousands of immigrant kids, separated from their families, by an agency that had NO OBLIGATION to tell family members where they are, run by an organization of mercenaries that specialize in child rape, under a president who so publicly decried child sex trafficking that he hired the leader of a well-known, corrupt contractor and signed an executive order that has NO SPECIFIC POLICY on trafficking via PMSC\'s....</p>
<p>And if that\'s not enough to satiate your need for proof.... Trafficking has increased under this administration. ****</p>

            ShartistryinMotion and Esoteric this may seem odd - it does some to me but - this morning I’m feeling the need to say that i apologize for being so sassy and apologize for my part of flipping Ill will around. We are all angry it seems. Sincerely hoping and praying for healing of our individual lives, our country and our world. Trusting it will happen.

             Clarity comes with exposure.  It’s coming I think. Prayer helps for sure.  If not your practice then just reflect or meditate on less division and focus actions towards attaining unity.  Which is why I chose to apologize this morning.  This is not winable online. Nor by getting in each other’s faces personally. Somehow someway we Americans need to relearn how to sit down and work together and at times allow compromise. It’s obvious we are split on the solutions.

            By the way Shartistryinmotion, President Trump was trying to change up and protect these kids from what has repeatedly happened to them in the past several administrations. Here is an article about what happened in Obama’s. But I’m sure that HW &amp; GW Bush and Clinton aren’t far behind. They’ve been supplying pizza gate for years. It’s time for the light to shine on this. Thank you for your efforts President Trump.

            Trump has so far arrested 6000 pedophile and rescued hundreds of children.  Your writing has much good info but it’s pointing in the wrong direction. There are now likely 40k sealed indictments awaiting adjudication.  He is working either in alignment or collaboratively with the International Tribunal for Natural Justice against  human trafficking and child sexual abuse. Here’s the link - President Trump is mentioned by the justices. He’s a good guy.

             He has done nothing and he is one of them. Rothschild saved him and own him. They are the controllers along with other families. Rockefeller is another one and he owned the controlling interest of one of the fronts for the CIA and MOSSAD that they funded. Grow up, he is a NYC billionaire occultist who partied with Epstein, Clintons and was a media fixture, CIA runs media. You're a child.

             Only the ones stupid enough to be found. Any (((savvy))) pedophile is going to want as few others operating as possible, since it reduces the risk of them all getting caught. It also provides a good smokescreen for covering his own behavior, like those priests who preach against gay people then get caught playing "hide the salami" with their alter boys.

              TRUMP IS MENTIONED. Watch the opening plenary session - approx 50 minutes in length.  Trump is mentioned I think twice in the second half of the video by the primary adjudicator tribunal member from the United States. Since this was held in April, this is before President Trump made as much progress as he has interesting these assholes. Why don’t you watch the video. Trump is a good guy not goy.

                No one yet identified.  But Q asserts they have all of the evidence. The current IG  Report is fact filled.  There are at least two more inspector general reports to come out which will be covering the Clinton foundation, the Clinton global initiative, uranium one to name but a few topics.  It’s interesting - the picture circulating uf congresswoman Sheila Jackson. It doesn’t appear that I can post a picture here. But you might go look at pedophile symbols. I know the FBI website has them. Look at the one for boy love. Then look at Miss Jackson’s sparkly ring design. Coincidence? Maybe. But then she went to Haiti a few times with Hillary and so did Maxine and Nancy. We will be learning there’s an awful lot of Haitian orphans who just up and disappeared. This really is huge, awful and unbelievable except —-. Again please go watch that international tribunal for natural justice video and learn something. This is not Democrats versus Republicans. This is good versus evil.

                    Sweetie pie honey bunches of oats the third eye is associated with the illuminati it’s also I believe the eighth chakra it’s located in the forehead right above and between the two eyes it is thought to be a source of great wisdom therefore you wouldn’t have one and it also represents the pineal gland which many in your Tolerance Clan kill babies to eat. You will find out and if you have any sense at all you will feel the disdain and disgust that I have since finding all of this out. First suggestion for an eye-opener, go search these three words. Podesta art collection. There you will find a disgusting assortment of disemboweled bodies of children tied up and half naked and disgusting sculptures mimicking Jeffrey Dahmer’s bodies. Enjoy!

                      Sweetie pie honey bunches of oats the third eye is associated with the illuminati it’s also I believe the eighth chakra it’s located in the forehead right above and between the two eyes it is thought to be a source of great wisdom therefore you wouldn’t have one and it also represents the pineal gland which many in your Tolerance Clan kill babies to eat. You will find out and if you have any sense at all you will feel the disdain and disgust that I have since finding all of this out.

                      Here’s a gift for you esoteric shade. Remember that John podesta was Obama’s Chief of Staff I believe and Hillary’s campaign manager. Here is an assortment of his and his brother Tony’s artwork. Like people hang out together. These horrific people are pedophiles and pedivores.  I hope you and yours wake up. If you do wonderful.  I’m done here for now. Look at these images!  Dare you.  Keep scrolling.

                      So O brilliant shady one what is your definition of third eye? I am hardly New Age I am Christian through and through and I am thrilled that we have a voice again. Whether you understand this or not yet this is a battle between good and evil not just Democrats and Republicans. Open your two eyes and turn on your third eye and get a fucking grip because it’s going to get really rocky soon . God forgive me for using the F word but I do believe this man deserves to hear it

                       It has more than one definition and so far you are not even close. It means more than you realize. "the secret is 3" You can't learn it until you flush the Q out of the brain.

             Yes it’s virtue signaling but it’s also smokescreening to distract from the IG report. The left has a wonderful way of doing this. What a coincidence that school and other mass shootings often happen right after something big happens against them. However this morning another possibility came to mind many of them may actually be experiencing with drawl. Trump cut off the financing to traffickers back in December. This week he cut off access on our southern border. These  sick horrible people need their fix.

            Many times, we have seen it reported that DynCorp is a CIA shell company.  the NSA, the CIA, the FBI... local police precincts, the media,
           </p>
           <p>
            The list goes on and on for things that are corrupted and need to be torn down... exposed... investigated.
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems like many here are torn between two possibilities:
           </p>
           <p>
            1: Trump is on our side, working slowly through the corruption and the more of the swamp. Many want this to be true. It may be. It may not. Be prepared for the worst, hope for the best.
           </p>
           <p>
            2: Trump is on their side; trolling and gatekeeping; taking advantage of the elites that have been exposed, scalping them and cashing in on making them look bad. Hope it’s not true, but don’t be too surprised if it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point, I think maybe a 3rd possibility is reality: Trump didn’t expect to win. He thought it was rigged, and planned to pull a new reality show platform out in f the election, and maybe launch some conservative pkayland casinos. When he won, he regretted it, but has gone to work. Doing some good on foreign policy and the economy, but totally like a fish out of water; trying to take on the deep state like a kitten fights a lawnmower.
           </p>
           <p>
            That’s just my hunch, but I’m sure I haven’t covered all f the bases. I’m not ready to totally subscribe to a theory. It’s a work in progress.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember, Watergate took years to get results, and it really only brought down one guy. He didn’t even got to prison for that matter. JFK’s assassination still goes without justice. Don’t expect this to be quick. Let’s suck it up and set aside some emotional resources for a pitched war that could take time.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is God’s battle and ours. It’s not up to one man to fight it single-handedly, less Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            The OP asks for discernment on our part and unity. Upvoat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let’s gird ourselves and keep fighting the good fight.

              I’ve been thinking Armageddon actually.  I felt like we’ve been in the trip per year is just listening to the liberals and their twisted logic and intolerable intolerance. I just always imagined Armageddon with armies wielding knives are shooting cannons and guns rather than two opposing armies of ideology. But here we are - good versus evil!

               Isaiah describes faithless humans as a stormy see of angry humans in the last days:
              </p>
              <p>
               Isaiah 57:20 “But the wicked are like the restless sea that cannot calm down, And its waters keep tossing up seaweed and mire.”
              </p>
              <p>
               When I think of the protests and various such things, I wonder when they will be satisfied. Likely never.
              </p>
              <p>
               This society was also described very well in 2 Timothy 3:1-7
              </p>
              <p>
               “But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here.  For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal,  having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness,  betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God,  having an appearance of godliness but proving false to its power; and from these turn away.  From among these arise men who slyly work their way into households and captivate weak women loaded down with sins, led by various desires,  always learning and yet never able to come to an accurate knowledge of truth.”
              </p>
              <p>
               I was stunned when I first read that. To me, that describes modern people to a ‘T’.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for Trump being some kind of ‘chosen one’... anything is possible. Cyrus was a non-believer that was used to fulfill God’s purposes. His actions were predicted beforehand, which is something I doubt where Trump is concerned. When it comes to something like this, I couldn’t possibly know for sure.
              </p>
              <p>
               Maybe in the end, we all serve God, even those that don’t believe.

                Excellent and thanks. I’ve decided I’m finished researching pizzagate and the dark forces so evident today. It’s way unhealthy feeling and it’s become evident there’s a need to focus elsewhere - like less time validating and more praying. Btw—- Rods from God is not insane at all.  We already have rail guns/kinetic bombardment.  I’ll find good videos to post. Fascinating. Space Force also not insane. The space domain and dominion/protection of it has been discussed for many years. Plus it seems the current focus is on asteroids and a few have come closer recently.  Do a search on both issues as they are interesting.

                 I just mean that those weapons and concepts blow my mind. I don’t doubt that they are real. In fact, there are some great youtubers theorizing on footage of outrageous explosions in China.

                 As for pizzagate: It’s totally understandable. I have to pray constantly to be here. I have to keep checking what I believe and know to be true... so I don’t lose my faith... so I protect my sanity. It’s too much evil and sorrow. If I may hope on a few things for people that are getting burned out and need a break: pray. Check out the Bible... and just keep yours eyes open. Keep an eye out for predators and protect the little ones around you. Inform any that are willing to listen and direct them here.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And if you stumble across something that needs to be shared here... by all means. Come back whenever you’re up to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Hang in there.

                Suggestion for when the liberal progressive marxist party collapses. Find a library.  With real books.  Learn to talk to people. Treat others more nicely shadey / it works better. Feels better in the long run too.  And yup I’ve had a few dogs who sure defecated on the floors.  W effort they learned.  And you? Bye

                 Justin Davis Files. This one is really bizarre and sad. Justin Davis was on the run from the cult. He posted on facebook while homeless. About the only pleasure he had in life was going to public places he could play chess for free. He was a good chess player. While on the run and homeless Justin posted what he could on facebook in an effort to out the people he knew that were murdering and torturing. They did weird things to Justin such as sneak up on him while he was asleep, drug him, sew threads into his chest coated with poisons or some substance, and clipped the ends flush with the skin so that they were not visible. I rescued this information and uploaded it to archive.org

It is also ROTHSCHILD linked...

              The Evelyn de Roth. branch were huge Hillary supporters:
"The former Jersey girl wants a fairer world and a certain friend in the White House.
Sometime during the months after Hillary Clinton had stepped down as secretary of state and before she announced to the country that she would mount another run for president, Lynn Forester de Rothschild said this to her longtime friend: “I just want you to know I pray every night that I die before my children and after you are president.”'

            Cerberus Capital is Soros.  Search and verify.  This writer is likely a liberal script flipper trying to deflect fault to President Trump.  Stay the course. Trust the plan.  Trump is winning.  The awful traffickers and child abusers/sacrificers/killers will be exposed. Winning!

               Yeah, this is the rationale put together and deliviered last year while picking his admin. Still, though, kinda hard to just stick the soros tag on him when he's literally a part of the administration rather than being opposed by the admin. Most of his admin is like this too. Search and reveal. Trust the plan. Follow Bolton. Why ask why, try bud dry. then taste the rainbow cuz I'm loving it. Ba da da da da

              Don’t know about tigers blood but he doesn’t drink infant, toddler, child blood nor eat their organs with the primary love of pineal glands and adrenals full of screaming child adrenochrome.  And yes I just registered after reading the artfully written, half truth filled but entirely misleading Wolf in sheeps clothing original post in this thread.

                Newbie on VOAT.  But still way way way more informed and almost laugh at your childlike retorts.  I imagine that you received MNFA ridicule training eh?

                 Knew you were a Qber. It shows in your lack of esoteric knowledge. There are LAYERS of truth and you are only scratching the first surface. I have been doing this long enough to be your grandfather. Stop smoking the Q and learn some real history about secret societies. My patience with you Q people is very thin.

             I am not buying into this. I watch the news like a hawk. Big six has been pushing this hard prior. There is no proof offered other than suspicious women parading latino girls at night. It reeks of them accusing Trump of what they are doing. No face shots. It is like a group of pedo's got together and came up with a stupid media plan to divide actual research. There will be more on, and of, this I am sure.

              I'm trying to look into the Cayuga Foster care centers but because of the new European regulations cannot access some American websites at the moment.  Here is a link about Cayuga, please could you have a look and see if there is anything relevant?

            This is very interesting and I would like to pursue it further as I've made a number of posts about Cerberus and Dyncorp in the past.  Could you please provide some source link to validate the claim that Cerberus Capital is overseeing this operation? Thanks.

             Capital Group, the company of UK PM’s husband Philip May, profited from Donald Trump’s caging of children in immigration detention centers. The centers are run by General Dynamics, which is partly owned by May’s investment firm.
            </p>
            <p>
             General Dynamics has been assisting the US Office of Refugee Resettlement in processing immigrant-children cases during President Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy. As many as 2,000 children are reported to have been separated from their parents in just six weeks under the controversial policy. A distressing audio clip of children sobbing went viral on social media.

             DeathtoMasonsASAP  I don’t think it’s that people won’t listen here. It’s just obvious when someone comes in trying to act nice and informative but gives us information from sources we’ve learned not to trust. I’m sure you can relate to that, even if you are more of the liberal progressive persuasion. It’s a rough time for us all.

            You got down voted by people who love Trump more than they want to help children. That is what partisan politics does. Don't take it to heart because you are only stating the obvious. They will down vote me too for saying this.

             A good portion of the downvoats will be from sock puppet shill accounts. The purpose of this sub is to convince people they need only sit back and watch their white hate heroes fight for them. Nothing happens, nothing changes, so Q was created to convince people the fight is going on, you just can't see it. It is coming any day now...
