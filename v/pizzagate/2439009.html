2008</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic - Pueblo Viejo Dominicana Corporation (PVDC) has announced that it is making steady progress at its Pueblo Viejo site in Sanchez Ramirez province. PVDC is a joint venture between the Canadian mining companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(((Barrick Gold))) Corporation, based in Toronto, which holds a sixty per cent interest, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and Vancouver-based (((Goldcorp Inc.))), which holds a forty per cent interest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The project is the largest foreign investment in the history of the Dominican Republic. The total pre-production capital budget is expected to be approximately US$2.7 billion. An additional US$300 million would follow to complete a phased expansion to bring the processing plant to 24,000 tonnes per day (tpd) from the initial 18,000 tpd once Pueblo Viejo is in operation.</p>

<p>Inside story: the Bush gang and Barrick Gold Corporation  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the influence of this political faction, Barrick acquired important interests, first in the United States, then in Canada and South America. In South America, as Barrick boasts in its 1995 annual report, the company has an aggressive, long-term approach, with mines and projects established in strategic locations in Argentina, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. &quot;Almost two-thirds of the exploration and development drilling budget will be spent in South America, where the company has decided to focus its efforts,&quot; the annual report states. In addition, with its intended conquests in Indonesia and Africa, the firm now says it aims to move from third to first among the world\'s largest gold mining companies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peter Munk and Barrick director Andrew Sarlos are very close associates of international speculator George Soros, in a grouping of Hungarian Jewish emigres. A personal investment director for Britain\'s Queen Elizabeth, Soros is the world\'s leading promoter of the legitimization of criminal enterprises, particularly narcotics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The majority investment in the firm was held by Adan Khashoggi and his arms-trafficking partners, who were just then gearing up the Iran-Israel-Nicaragua guns and cocaine tangle which would explode in 1986 as the &quot;Iran-Contra&quot; scandal.</p>
<p>(((Adnan Khashoggi, a Bush-allied Saudi billionaire and arms trafficker, founder of the Barrick Gold Corp.; famous for his illegal weapons sales to Iran )))</p>
<p>The nominal chief of Barrick Gold was Peter Munk, a Hungarian Jewish immigrant...</p>
<p>Munk\'s rise in Australia was aided by his lifelong close association with fellow Hungarian emigre Sir Peter Abeles, Australia\'s transport mogul. Munk\' s stepfather had been secretary and assistant to Abeles\'s father in Vienna in the late 1940s. </p>
<p>Abeles is reportedly known in Europe as &quot;the White Knight,&quot; in reference both to his British knighthood, and his reported large role in the cocaine trade. Jonathan Kwitney, in The Crimes of Patriots (New York: W.W. Norton, 1987), reports that, after Abeles encountered labor union problems in his American business, Abeles gave to gangster &quot;associates of ... the most powerful Mafia leader in the United States ..</p>

<p>He founded Barrick Gold Corporation to launder CIA gold. According to Holt, Soros and Wanta made trillions from Bush brothers’ collapse of Russia’s currency and theft of Russia’s gold.

<blockquote>
<p>Goldcorp was officially incorporated in 1994. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldcorp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldcorp</a> </p>
<p>In 2001 Rob McEwen, Goldcorp founder, and (((Frank Giustra))), purchased Wheaton River Minerals, which was then a junior company. By 2005, as the price of gold rose, Ian Telfer, a &quot;mine entrepreneur...turned an insignificant shell company into a billion dollar gold producer.&quot; In 2005 Goldcorp absorbed Wheaton River Minerals.[7] According to Bloomberg News, Wheaton River Minerals was the precursor for both Goldcorp and Endeavour.[4] By 2014, Goldcorp was the world\'s fourth-largest producer of gold.[8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ian Telfer is a British-born Canadian mining executive, entrepreneur and Chairman of the Board and Director of Goldcorp Inc. Besides leading Goldcorp, he is known for founding and leading other Canadian mining companies, including TVX Gold, Silver Wheaton Corp., and Uranium One, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Telfer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Telfer</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to his work with Wheaton River Minerals and Goldcorp, Telfer has founded and led other mining companies. In 2006, Telfer and Frank Giustra formed UrAsia Energy, a uranium producer operating a mine in Kazakhstan.[15][16] Telfer served as UrAsia’s Chairman.[16] In 2007, UrAsia merged with Uranium One Inc., with Telfer continuing on as Uranium One’s Chairman.[16]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2003—2007: Frank Giustra formed a company called Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. for business in Colombia. Starting in 2005, Giustra meets with Bill Clinton and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, then wins lucrative business deals in Colombia. By 2007 the three even met in Clintons’ home in Chappaqua, New York.  In the same year Pacific Rubiales signs a $300 million deal to build a pipeline in central Colombia, gains control of Colombia’s largest oilfield, and acquires the right to cut timber in a biologically diverse Colombian forest.</p>
<p>Also in 2007, Giustra and Bill Clinton cofound a Canadian offshoot of the Clinton Foundation called the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (CGEP). It will later be alleged that this is a “slush fund” allowing foreigners to donate money indirectly to the Clinton Foundation in the hopes of getting favorable treatment from the Clintons. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative (CGSGI)</p>
<p>In 2008, Telfer pledged $3 million to the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative.[24]</p>
<p>According to the Clinton Foundation website, CGSGI is &quot;pioneering an innovative approach to poverty alleviation.&quot;[9]
CGSGI aims to alleviate poverty in the developing world in partnership with the global mining community. Along with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, Giustra pledged a minimum of $100 million each toward the effort and the money was given to the Clinton Foundation.[7] On June 17, 2010, Giustra joined wth Carlos Slim and President Clinton to create a $20 million fund to assist small businesses in earthquake-ravaged Haiti.[10]</p>
<p>May 2017
“Gold — of all the money-generating things I do, it’s my favorite and the one I understand the best,” Giustra says.
Among his business interests, Leagold is the one that’s currently got his attention. Its Los Filos deposit in Mexico’s Guerrero state is twice the size of assets that launched Endeavour and Goldcorp-precursor Wheaton River Minerals Ltd., he says.
<a href="http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/frank-giustra-takes-a-break-from-the-blade-runner-sequel-and-an-italian-olive-estate-to-return-to-his-first-love-a-gold-mine">http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/high-net-worth/frank-giustra-takes-a-break-from-the-blade-runner-sequel-and-an-italian-olive-estate-to-return-to-his-first-love-a-gold-mine</a> <a href="http://archive.is/MHsle">http://archive.is/MHsle</a> </p>
<p>Back in 2001, he had become convinced that gold, then trading below $300 (U.S.) an ounce, was poised for a run, in part because low interest rates would erode the value of the U.S. dollar--a stunningly accurate prediction. Along with Ian Telfer, a gregarious veteran mining executive who\'d taken a wrong turn in the dot-com world, he bought a controlling stake in Wheaton River Minerals, a dormant mining company then valued at $20 million. Wheaton\'s first major acquisition was the Luisman mine in Mexico.</p>

            In 2001 Rob McEwen, Goldcorp founder, and (((Frank Giustra))), purchased Wheaton River Minerals, which was then a junior company. By 2005, as the price of gold rose, Ian Telfer, a "mine entrepreneur...turned an insignificant shell company into a billion dollar gold producer." In 2005 Goldcorp absorbed Wheaton River Minerals.[7] According to Bloomberg News, Wheaton River Minerals was the precursor for both Goldcorp and Endeavour.[4] By 2014, Goldcorp was the world's fourth-largest producer of gold.[8]

           Ian Telfer is a British-born Canadian mining executive, entrepreneur and Chairman of the Board and Director of Goldcorp Inc. Besides leading Goldcorp, he is known for founding and leading other Canadian mining companies, including TVX Gold, Silver Wheaton Corp., and Uranium One,

            In addition to his work with Wheaton River Minerals and Goldcorp, Telfer has founded and led other mining companies. In 2006, Telfer and Frank Giustra formed UrAsia Energy, a uranium producer operating a mine in Kazakhstan.[15][16] Telfer served as UrAsia’s Chairman.[16] In 2007, UrAsia merged with Uranium One Inc., with Telfer continuing on as Uranium One’s Chairman.[16]

           2003—2007: Frank Giustra formed a company called Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. for business in Colombia. Starting in 2005, Giustra meets with Bill Clinton and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, then wins lucrative business deals in Colombia. By 2007 the three even met in Clintons’ home in Chappaqua, New York.  In the same year Pacific Rubiales signs a $300 million deal to build a pipeline in central Colombia, gains control of Colombia’s largest oilfield, and acquires the right to cut timber in a biologically diverse Colombian forest.

          <p>
           Also in 2007, Giustra and Bill Clinton cofound a Canadian offshoot of the Clinton Foundation called the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (CGEP). It will later be alleged that this is a “slush fund” allowing foreigners to donate money indirectly to the Clinton Foundation in the hopes of getting favorable treatment from the Clintons.

           <p>
            In 2008, Telfer pledged $3 million to the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative.[24]
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the Clinton Foundation website, CGSGI is "pioneering an innovative approach to poverty alleviation."[9]
CGSGI aims to alleviate poverty in the developing world in partnership with the global mining community. Along with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, Giustra pledged a minimum of $100 million each toward the effort and the money was given to the Clinton Foundation.[7] On June 17, 2010, Giustra joined wth Carlos Slim and President Clinton to create a $20 million fund to assist small businesses in earthquake-ravaged Haiti.[10]

“Gold — of all the money-generating things I do, it’s my favorite and the one I understand the best,” Giustra says.
Among his business interests, Leagold is the one that’s currently got his attention. Its Los Filos deposit in Mexico’s Guerrero state is twice the size of assets that launched Endeavour and Goldcorp-precursor Wheaton River Minerals Ltd., he says.

            Back in 2001, he had become convinced that gold, then trading below $300 (U.S.) an ounce, was poised for a run, in part because low interest rates would erode the value of the U.S. dollar--a stunningly accurate prediction. Along with Ian Telfer, a gregarious veteran mining executive who'd taken a wrong turn in the dot-com world, he bought a controlling stake in Wheaton River Minerals, a dormant mining company then valued at $20 million. Wheaton's first major acquisition was the Luisman mine in Mexico.

            * The previous operator of Pueblo Viejo closed the operation in 1999 without proper environmental remediation, leaving a legacy of polluted soil and water. After acquiring control of Pueblo Viejo, PVDC assumed responsibility for environmental remediation of areas within the mine development boundary
           </p>
           <p>
             * While Barrick monitors downstream water quality in the Margajita together with local communities, the company is not responsible for treating downstream water or the tributaries that feed this section of the river, as these areas fall well outside the mine development boundary
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
              Today, the Margajita has returned to its natural color and its pH level has increased significantly, measuring in the 7.0-8.5 range at the point where treated water is discharged into the river
            </li>
            <li>
              Since acquiring control of Pueblo Viejo, PVDC has re-vegetated 3,500 hectares of land, built a large water treatment plant to treat water on site before discharging it into the Margajita River and, acting as an agent of the government, removed 180,000 cubic meters of contaminated soil left from prior operations.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
             * PVDC also agreed to provide $75 million to fund the clean-up of historical liabilities that are the responsibility of the Dominican government. The management plan for the clean-up phase is currently awaiting government approval.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Cyanide use at Pueblo Viejo:Barrick did not begin using cyanide at Pueblo Viejo until the summer of 2012.  All cyanide used in processing goes through a cyanide destruction circuit before tailings are deposited in the mine’s tailings storage facility.  Pueblo Viejo is designed to comply with the International Cyanide Management Code and is in the process of being certified. The code sets out stringent environmental and employee best practices for all aspects of the cyanide life-cycle, including manufacturing,  transportation, use and disposal.  Companies that adopt the code commit to having their operations audited by an independent third party and meeting all code requirements.

            “Following this week’s planning meeting, President Clinton will officially launch the Action Network on April 3 at the University of Miami, bringing together leaders from government, business and civil society,” according to a statement issued by the Clinton Foundation Monday.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Clinton Foundation is part of the Clinton Global Initiative, established in 2005 to address a series of global challenges. Another CGI affiliate, Direct Relief International, appeared on St. Thomas Monday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Representatives brought four cases of hospital supplies to the Schneider Regional Medical Center as a charitable donation. Donated items included infectious-waste bags, disposable gloves, hygiene products, syringes for use by diabetics, topical and oral antibiotics.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              It’s the fourth time since the passage of Hurricanes Irma and Maria DRI dropped by with gifts of supplies, said Shanique Boschulte, assistant to Schneider Regional Medical Center Chief Executive Officer Bernard Wheatley.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Affected island nations and territories included in the relief initiative include Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Antigua and Barbuda and Dominica. Barbuda suffered an estimated 95 percent structural damage in the wake of Hurricane Irma.
            </p>
            <p>
             Area targeted for long term recovery through the action network include health care, energy, education and  (((economic development))).
Getting there will not be easy, Clinton said. He based that comment on the eight years already spent in Haiti, trying to help the nation recovery from a catastrophic earthquake in 2010.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              “And everyone who cares about this, needs to be prepared to work for a few years on this,” he said. “In April, I’m going to have a conference in Miami, bringing in other people who know this is so, and we’re going to try and make a long term commitment across health care, education, economics, you name it.
