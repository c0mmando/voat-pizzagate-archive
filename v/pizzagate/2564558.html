<p>As the story of approximately 1500 immigrant missing children in the US is blowing up at the moment I found this article from November 2016 which paints a similar story in the UK.</p>

<p><strong>The number of trafficked and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children going missing from local authority care is a ‘national disgrace’ two charities have warned today.</strong></p>
<p>A new report from ECPAT UK and Missing People found more than a quarter of all trafficked children and over 500 unaccompanied children went missing at least once in the year leading up to September 2015.</p>
<p>The report – entitled Heading back to harm: A study on trafficked and unaccompanied children going missing from care in the UK – also warned that many local authorities were failing to collect consistent data on these children, leaving them vulnerable to re-trafficking and abuse.</p>
<p>Chloe Setter, head of advocacy, policy &amp; campaigns at ECPAT UK, said: ‘For too long, children who are at risk of exploitation, or who have been trafficked, have gone missing from care – sometimes repeatedly, sometimes forever. It is a national disgrace that this problem has remained neglected and these children rendered invisible by poor data collection and national coordination.</p>
<p>‘Heading back to harm has attempted to shine a light on this problem and, in doing so, has unearthed an alarming trend of our most vulnerable children disappearing; hundreds of them never to be found. We must not accept this as a reality any longer.’</p>
<p>The charities are calling for reforms to the child protection system including the introduction of a national independent child trafficking advocates scheme; child-specific training on child trafficking, unaccompanied children and missing; and better data recording by councils.</p>
