<p><strong>FATHER WILLIAM WASSON</strong>  (founder of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos (NPH), Spanish for Our Little Brothers and Sisters, which began in Mexico in 1983)</p>
<p>William B. Wasson, 82, a Catholic priest originally from Phoenix who spent more than 50 years caring for orphaned children in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, died Aug. 16 in Cottonwood, Ariz., of complications from a hip injury. 
<a href="https://archive.is/pG8mC">https://archive.is/pG8mC</a></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.is/Vy6JK">Father William Wasson already has 6000 sons and daughters and expect another 1000 soon</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1970, home for his “family” has been the Hacienda San Salvador, a 200-acre farm and campus 12 miles outside of Cuernavaca, 77 miles southwest of Mexico City. The hacienda (which survived the recent earthquake with little damage) is reminiscent of a south-of-the-border Boys Town, and though Wasson called his community Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos—”Our Little Brothers”—orphan girls have also been accepted since 1959. </p>
<p>He studied for the Roman Catholic priesthood at Conception Seminary College in Missouri. “I would have been ordained in 1948,” he says, but in his final year, his face, hands and feet swelled grotesquely. Wasson was treated at the Mayo Clinic for progressive thyroid deficiency. After his return to the seminary, he was shocked to learn that the bishop would not ordain him. “In those days,” Wasson explains, “they didn’t know whether the disease would recur, so if you had a goiter, you were considered finished. I was always very naive; still am, I guess. I’d thought there would be more understanding, more compassion.” <strong>He applied for ordination all over the U.S. but was refused every time</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1953, he was ordained in Mexico by <strong>Bishop Sergio Mendez Arcero</strong>

<blockquote>
<p>It is believed that Sergio Méndez Arceo\'s actions and views made him too controversial, to the point that it limited his ability to form collegiality with other Mexican bishops and the episcopate.

<p>It later become known that the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) produced a report on Méndez Arceo stating he was friendly to the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (Spanish: Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional) (FMLN) of El Salvador and the Sandinista National Liberation Front (Spanish: Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional)(FSLN) of Nicaragua, which took power in 1979 following the collapse of the Somoza regime. <strong>The FBI further alleged Méndez Arceo\'s diocese collected intelligence, bought and sold guns, and served as couriers for communist guerrillas of El Salvador.

             OH YEAH 100% You're not the only one. The Catholic Church is a disgrace (sorry if I offended anyone) but really just go back to the beginning of time and they are the ones who created Islam to get Jerusalem back... They lie and deceive. I mean really, the Vatican is one of the most evil places on earth (a secret not known to the millions of sheep who flock there). I wish people could all learn the truths of the world then we could all come together and really unite. Until then, it's divide and conquer as per usual at Illuminati headquarters grand central!!

            Nice post! Allow me to put this here, as I'm not sure what to make of it, and whether it deserves a thread of its own I have no idea. It does appear to be a beneficiary to a trust under Portcillus Trustnet, which has been involved in a bunch of scandals, however. Cook Islands seems to be a hub for tax evading, etc.

             Hi. This looks interesting but I'm not really sure what I'm looking at in the offshore website link.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is it basically a search engine that tells you if someone is connected to an offshore company?

            <p>
             When Rick Frechette became a Passionist priest in 1979, his goal was to minister to the spiritual health of humanity. Little did he know that one day he would also minister to the physical health of orphaned children and the needy.
Born in 1953, Frechette graduated from Assumption College in Massachusetts with degrees in math and philosophy. He next attended St. John’s University in New York and studied theology as a seminarian, and was ordained a priest in 1979. After a few years as a parish priest in Baltimore, he met Fr. William B. Wasson, founder of Nuestros Pequeños Hermanos™ (NPH, Spanish for “Our Little Brothers and Sisters”) and worked in Mexico in 1983 at an old hacienda that had been converted to a home for nearly 1,000 orphaned and abandoned children. As a priest and administrator, his next calling was to Honduras to help establish a second orphanage for NPH.
            </p>
            <p>
             He also founded the St. Luke Foundation which creates dignified jobs in social service fields including 29 street schools, water delivery to the slums, hospitals and clinics and burying the unclaimed dead from the city morgue.

             The aging white SUV that Solá was driving got stuck in traffic, authorities said. Though there are varying accounts of what happened next, two men approached the vehicle. At least one of the men shot Solá and a passenger in the front seat. The men took Solá's purse and fled. 
"Isabel's loss is immense," Fr. Hans Alexandre said at Sacred Heart Parish, where Solá's prosthetics ministry is based, Vatican Radio reported. "In doing this, they didn't just kill a person. They killed the hopes of so many." 
On Saturday morning, Fr. Enzo Del Brocco, a U.S. Passionist missionary, celebrated Mass at a chapel. In a homily honoring the feast day of St. Gregory, Del Brocco focused on the verities of faith, life and the eternal. But he also honored Solá and asked, "Who would kill someone who was helping the poor? Why?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Landry said Solá's prosthetic work was only a part of her mission. Solá had "managed to find donors to build schools in remote and disadvantaged areas," Landry said. "She worked in the training of teachers for these schools."
             <strong>
              Pope Francis mentioned Solá and her dedication to the people of Haiti at the canonization of Mother Teresa on Sunday in Rome.

             By the time we arrived in Haiti, after a stopover in Miami, we had missed three landing slots at the airport. Aid agencies — genuine aid agencies — from other countries were being turned away, refused permission to land. But we still got a slot straight away. The guy who ran our charter seemed to think that the Scientologists had some real influence with the US Government, who were assigning the slots.
