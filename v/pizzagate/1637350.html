<p>Here is a write-up by James Pinkerton about their art in the <a href="http://archive.is/jDoz8">Sensation</a> exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.  It is relevant to Pizzagate because not only did Hillary Clinton defended the museum from calls to stop funding it taxpayer dollars over the artwork she did it while facing reelection.  Ironically, the calls to defund the artwork were because of sacrilegious artwork (dung on the Virgin Mary) and not the mannequin child porn it contained and other creepy shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the real outrage is the work of Jake and Dinos Chapman. Their artistic oeuvre is naked girls. They have taken department-store mannequins of little girls, festooned them with penises, and then added vaginas and anuses--the kind you might expect to see on a blow-up sex doll--in random places over their faces and bodies. The wall cards attempt to explain all this away with folderol about the perils of genetic engineering, but these two artists were surely creepy before they ever heard of DNA. Indeed, the sci-fi stuff is just a cover for pandering to pedophiles, as the museum well knows. The caption for &quot;Tragic Anatomies&quot; asks the following: &quot;What would the world be like if we were freed of all sexual inhibition? Do we falsely deny the existence of sexuality in children?&quot; Why haven\'t the media reported on that? Is it because they\'ve been focused on the feces? Maybe, but I think there\'s another reason. The critics and commentators don\'t want the real raw truth about this exhibit to get out, because they know that even they can\'t publicly defend Hustler-type photos or kiddie porn. Moreover, now that Giuliani\'s likely opponent in next year\'s U.S. Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has declared herself against his effort to yank the museum\'s funding, pressies don\'t want to undercut her by describing precisely what she wants to keep paying for. So they discuss the dung briefly and then move on to safer discussions of the 1st Amendment.</p>

            Bullshit!  That quote is only about the sacrilegious artwork featuring dung on the Virgin Mary.  Hillary does not mention the creepy child porn artwork because even she knows she can't publically defend it.  Also she is a hypocrite because she wouldn't defend the right of anti-Islamic works like "The Innocence of Muslims" to exist while she will for anti-Christian and anti-Catholic ones.  Also several prominent people in her campaign are now shown to dislike Catholics so many of them would probably consider that "I don't like it" statement a lie anyway.  Don't expect us to buy the idea that Hillary Clinton is a defender of free speech.
           </p>
           <p>
            Errrrr, I linked to the exact Chapman article he said the quote in so it is hardly taken out of context .  It is troubling especially when he says the murder of a kid was a "public service" and has threatened female journalists.  Once again you have debunked nothing.  Try again, armyseer you dumbass.

            YBA's (funded by Charles Saatchi). Fucking useless, talentless, message less. Or maybe not, maybe their use was to destroy true art and their message was to promote the fucked up agend we see in the music industry etc. anyone who knows about James Bulger should know the subject isn't something to be trivialized by pop culture. Nor Myra Hindley. I hated them back in the day for their shit output, now there are possibly more reasons.

            My sincere apologies because this comment is not related to this post, and because of the rules, I can’t create a thread of its own here, but I don’t see any other solution to bring this topic to your all attention:
           </p>
           <p>
            The main subverse pizzagate is so full of threads that it is not possible for new members or lurkers (not to mention law enforcement people) to see what we have achieved so far. Even longtime members have difficulty keeping track of all the important threads with good evidence.
So we really need to have something that flags all the important threads, or to put them in a subverse of their own. Member

             @impulse110
            </a>
            and I have posted a similar suggestion in different subverses:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1632495">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1632495
            </a>
            Ok I feel like there is so much evidence and so many loose ends. A lot of this research is adhoc since there is no way to know what new piece of evidence is going to come up. But is there a utility we can use to link everything together and give a place for people with validated evidence to contribute. Is there something we can create with visual links and diagrams of all the leads and evidence? I am imagining a web of nodes and links with sub nodes and links with supporting evidence. There has to be a tool already available that we can use. I will be willing to contribute to it if it seems practical. So many people run into so many good leads but dont have the time and effort to go deeper into it and other people can jump in and go deeper into that specific lead. Right now its hard for new people to jump in without knowing everything else that has already been worked on. There is a lot of inefficiencies in this process. You cant expect people to follow and read into every post. and many people just want to know where they can get involved and jump in with their efforts.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods/1632250">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagatemods/1632250
            </a>
            More and more people are submitting postings, which is basically a good thing, of course. However, the subverse "pizzagate" is now more swamped than ever with all kinds of postings, and while they may all be related to Pizzagate, not all of them turn out to contain good evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since we want to attract more people to this investigation, newcomers (as well as lurkers) will find it extremely difficult to get an overview of what we have accomplished so far in terms of evidence. Hitting the "Hot" button doesn't help, of course.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I suggest a new subverse called, for example, "pizzagateevidence" where all postings with good (circumstantial or direct) evidence are stored - additionally to the normal pizzagate subverse.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that deciding which post delivers good evidence and which not may be difficult, but if you agree, I think we should give it at least a try.

               as a new reader i was confused at first by why there are not 3 different evidence levels in their own subs.. 1)direct evidence, 2)corroborating evidence, and 3)supporting evidence.. i was also confused as to why there wasn't a "To Do" list of where help is specifically needed... maybe i just haven't read around enough.. but, to the first-time and new observers, the overall effect is somewhat "white noise".

            It's like they are rubbing our faces in it.  Their perversions on full display with liberals fawning over them in magazines etc.  I remember my avant grade art teacher took us to see some sculptures and meet the artist circa 1980, her work was tableaux / rooms of horror, blood &amp; pain.  The pupils all produced work that mimicked this but I remember battling with this as it didn't feel right to me to produce work like it, I didn't connect with it thankfully.
            <br/>
            It may be worth the parents on here checking to see if art depts are trying to subvert the young by exposing them to this by trying to pass it off as cool &amp; edgy.  I honestly don't get why people fawn over Abromovich even without the spirit cooking, anyone carving pentagram on themselves should be committed - not being funded as art for embassies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do agree that this may be a good angle particularly as circumstantial evidence as to a persons character, and a front for purchasing kids etc.
