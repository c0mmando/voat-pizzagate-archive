<p>But in recent years, Hawthorne, located in the town of Mount Pleasant, began experiencing unusually high rates of teenagers going missing from its campus. Staff, law enforcement officials and advocates for children said they knew that some of the missing residents had fallen victim to sex traffickers. Many of the girls in the rehabilitation center had been placed there in the first place to rescue them from the sex trade.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the breadth of a pipeline carrying young women out of Hawthorne and into prostitution became clearer. Nineteen people were charged in a sex-trafficking ring that exploited young women and girls as young as 13 years old, federal prosecutors said.</p>
<p>At least 15 victims were in the child welfare system, including nine who were residents of Hawthorne, the prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The defendants named in a series of indictments unsealed this week face charges including sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy, which carry maximum sentences of up to life in prison.</p>
<p>The indictments do not name the residential center in Westchester County, referring to it only as “Facility-1,” but it is Hawthorne, an official at the center and two other people briefed on the matter said. Some of the defendants are in their 20s; the two oldest are 59, prosecutors said. None of the defendants were staff members of Hawthorne.</p>
<p>The charges were announced by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, the F.B.I. and the Police Department.</p>
<p>Some details of the alleged scheme were contained in the unsealed court papers.</p>
<p>One defendant, Hubert Dupigny, 34, recruited a 16-year-old girl from Hawthorne who worked for him as a prostitute until he was arrested in December 2016, prosecutors wrote. At that point, the girl went to work for his brother, Hensley Dupigny, 29, who posted advertisements for her on Backpage.com and collected most of her earnings, the prosecutors said.</p>
<p>A prosecutor said at a court hearing in August for Hensley Dupigny that the alleged conspiracy was “particularly egregious” because the defendants sought out minors in the social services system, often children with behavioral or emotional problems who had become wards of the state.</p>
<p>“These were especially vulnerable victims,” the prosecutor, Elinor L. Tarlow, said. “They didn’t have stable residences. They didn’t have family support. They didn’t have guidance.”</p>
<p>She said the accused traffickers capitalized on that vulnerability. “They approached victims as if they had a romantic interest in them,” she said. “They offered them a place to stay and then they pushed them into prostitution.”</p>
<p>As part of the investigation the government spoke to “multiple victims, who provided firsthand accounts,” Ms. Tarlow added</p>
<p>The Dupigny brothers have each pleaded not guilty. A lawyer for Hubert Dupigny wrote recently to the court, “Mr. Dupigny adamantly denies that he is guilty of any of the charges” or that he ever forced, threatened or coerced anyone to engage in prostitution. Lawyers for the two men either declined to comment on Thursday or could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Hawthorne, which had been heavily scrutinized for its failure to keep teenagers from running away, has been closing in phases all year, said Chris Giglio, a spokesman for the Jewish Board of Family and Children’s Services, which operates the facility. Mr. Giglio added that the nonprofit was cooperating with federal investigators.</p>
<p>Only six children remain and are expected to be moved to a new location by Tuesday, said Monica Mahaffey, a spokeswoman for the state Office of Children and Family Services.</p>
<p>The Jewish Board announced it would close Hawthorne earlier this year, following pressure from state legislators, severe sanctions from the state child welfare office and growing complaints from residents of Mount Pleasant about teenagers wandering the town, particularly as they headed to trains back to New York City.</p>

            The U.S. Attorney said Thursday that 19 New York City defendants are accused of recruiting a total of at least 15 minor girls in the child welfare system, with the indictments encompassing incidents between 2010 and 2018.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the Hawthorne campus, at 226 Linda Ave., there are three residential facilities. One is Cedar Knolls, which provides mental health, social and therapeutic services for at-risk girls ages 13 to 18 and boys ages 8 to 18 and has had its share of controversy over the years. Overseen by the state Office of Children and Family Services, the facility is set to close Tuesday, when the final six children will be transferred to a facility in New York City.
           </p>
           <p>
            The others are the Goldsmith Center and Mann Center, which are overseen by the Office of Mental Health and were to remain open. They serve youths with trauma, psychiatric and mental health issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            1 . The campus covers 128.75 acres in Mount Pleasant
Cedar Knolls, Mann and Goldsmith have been in separate buildings on the campus. The facilities were rarely at full capacity: Fewer than 200 youths lived on campus most of the time.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Security issues have been a concern
Over the years, issues have included residents going off campus without permission and getting into trouble in the community. Fights, arrests and false alarms on the campus and in the community have drawn concern from elected officials and town residents, some calling for changes or to close the facility
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Cedar Knolls stopped accepting new students last year
In May 2017, the state Office of Children and Family Services decided that Cedar Knolls would halt student intake indefinitely, after two runaways from the center were charged with robbing a woman at a train station. The decision applied to the residential treatment center, not to the Hawthorne Cedar Knolls "special-act" school district, which works in collaboration with the Jewish Board to serve other residents on campus and day students from the area.

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              And is shutting down
In January 2018, officials said Cedar Knolls would shut down this year and its services would likely be moved to a New York City facility. In June, word came that it was planning to lay off 107 employees as part of the closing and would work to relocate workers to limit layoffs The residential treatment center was slated to close down, in phases, ending on Aug. 31, but now the closing is set for Tuesday.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Youths were expected to return to their families
When it was announced Cedar Knolls would close, there were 54 youths staying there out of a capacity of 78. The youths were expected to go back to their families or be placed with foster families. The final six children are to be transferred a facility in New York City, a spokeswoman told The Journal News/lohud on Thursday

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              TAKE a close look at these terrifying faces. Your worst nightmare now moving into a suburb right next to you.
             </p>
             <p>
              Meet Charles Demarco, 50 years old. He raped a 42-year-old woman he’d never met, holding a gun to the terrified lady’s head.
             </p>
             <p>
              There’s Ronald Brown, 54. He got his thrills by sodomizing two little boys, ages 10 and 11.
             </p>
             <p>
              Kevin “Heavy Metal” Bynum, 43, raped a girl of 15 at the end of a gun. And Barry Ferguson, 48, crowns this pile of filth. He attempted to sexually abuse a little girl, just 7 at the time.
             </p>
             <p>
              These irredeemable creatures are of different races and backgrounds. But they have two important things in common:
             </p>
             <p>
              They are all hardened sexual predators, considered at high risk to repeat their vile crimes. And one night last month, these vermin were shipped from the rural facility where they’d lived in exile and sent to a new shelter in Valhalla just 200 yards from a children’s hospital.
             </p>
             <p>
              In their new home – which also shares the grounds of an adult hospital and a medical college, as well as a secure jail – the men are free to roam as they please from before dawn until long after dark.
             </p>
             <p>
              While authorities have distributed the men’s pictures to schools in nearby towns, including Greenburgh and Pocantico Hills, there seems little that can be done about the monsters in their midst.
             </p>
             <p>
              What the hell is going on in Westchester?
             </p>
             <p>
              Last year, the vast suburb’s predator crisis came into alarming focus, after a homeless man, Phillip Grant, admitted he murdered Connie Russo-Carriero in the White Plains Galleria mall – just because she was white.
             </p>
             <p>
              As it turned out, Grant was a homeless sexual predator, who lived at a shelter near the Westchester airport. Each day, he was bused to downtown White Plains.
             </p>
             <p>
              The county responded to the horror in a strange fashion. It closed the remote shelter. Before Christmas, it started relocating residents – a number of them Level 3 sex predators, the worst of the worst – in populated areas in the county.
             </p>
             <p>
              Late Tuesday night, the county dumped 43 homeless men on downtown White Plains in a different facility.
             </p>
             <p>
              The city’s deputy mayor, Paul Wood, told me, “At least at the airport, it was in a very rural environment. Now they’re downtown, less than a block from where the woman was murdered – within a one-mile radius of six schools.”
             </p>

              The White Plains homeless all have refused drug or mental-health treatment – and some won’t even give their real names, Wood said.
             </p>
             <p>
              But of the 149 residents dumped on the Grasslands campus in Valhalla, at least 13 are Level 2 and Level 3 sex offenders.

              Opponents believe County Executive Andrew Spano bowed to pressure from nearby civic groups.

              But after agreeing to take my call, Spano spokeswoman Susan Tolchin took off for a three-hour lunch. She never returned several calls from me.

             <p>
              Now, all residents can do is wait. And worry. And lock their doors and windows. And pray.

              DIRTY 13:
             </p>
             <p>
              These 13 sex offenders have just been moved to a new homeless facility in Valhalla near a medical center, a children’s hospital and a medical college.

            Another NYT article about Hawthorne and sex trafficking, published in 2017 -
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Dec. 6, 2017
            </p>
            <p>
             MOUNT PLEASANT, N.Y. — Nearly every day, a teenager is missing from Hawthorne Cedar Knolls, a rehabilitation center for emotionally troubled children that sits on a sprawling campus in this Westchester County town.
            </p>
            <p>
             Home to many young people who have been trafficked for sex, Hawthorne is supposed to help heal them and head off their return to prostitution and exploitation. But the center, run by a nonprofit group and intended to be a relatively open facility, has seen girl after girl, most of them from New York City, go missing.
            </p>
            <p>
             People who have worked in child welfare in and around New York City say there is a pipeline from centers like the ones here back to the streets, where children fall prey to the abuse that they were supposed to escape.
            </p>
            <p>
             Over the last 18 months, the state, which oversees residential treatment centers like Hawthorne, stopped sending children to Hawthorne and to the nearby Pleasantville Cottage School.
            </p>
            <p>
             Among the 51 centers statewide, Hawthorne and Pleasantville are the only ones to have faced such severe sanctions over missing children in recent years.
            </p>
            <p>
             By design and by law, conditions at residential treatment centers are less restrictive than those at many of the other programs for children with severe mental health problems. Residential treatment centers are not juvenile detention centers, and they are supposed to provide a homelike experience.
            </p>
            <p>
             Children cannot be locked down, and older children are encouraged to attend programs outside the campus and hold part-time jobs as part of their rehabilitation. But people who work with the residents said that a lack of rigorous, engaging programs, especially for victims of sex trafficking, had made their open atmosphere a liability.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hawthorne was recently drawn into a trafficking investigation after a teenage girl who went missing from Hawthorne ended up in the Bronx with a 25-year-old man.
            </p>
            <p>
             The man has been charged with sex trafficking, rape, prostitution and other crimes in a state case involving the girl, and he has been charged as a conspirator in a federal investigation of a Bronx drug-trafficking ring.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prosecutors have not accused Hawthorne or its staff of any wrongdoing in connection with sex trafficking. But the involvement of a runaway from Hawthorne in the Bronx case underscored the challenges confronting such programs and the risks faced by some of the girls who are in them.
            </p>
            <p>
             The investigation offers a glimpse into an underworld in which exploitation is hard to document and prosecute. Victims often fear retribution or are wary of law enforcement and refuse to cooperate with investigations, according to lawyers and social workers.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the exploitation is real, said Paul Oliva, the police chief in Mount Pleasant. “We had these girls leaving campus, hooking up with their pimps,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Instead of escaping sexual exploitation, some teenagers are recruited by their peers inside centers and group homes, said Ed Gavin, a former acting chief of staff at the Administration for Children’s Services in New York City.
            </p>
            <p>
             A piece of the pipeline in the region flows north to south, from the leafy, idyllic surroundings here to gritty “trap houses” run by twentysomething drug dealers, Mr. Gavin said. “People think of human trafficking as foreign. Human trafficking goes on right in the neighborhood. It goes on in the Bronx,” said Mr. Gavin, who now works as a private investigator and specializes in finding missing children.
            </p>
            <p>
             The girls at Hawthorne, who range in age from 12 to 21, have been sent there through the recommendations of child welfare agencies, Family Court judges and a special education panel.
            </p>
            <p>
             The majority of the children return to their homes or are sent to a foster home or other setting closer to their families in less than a year, said David Rivel, the chief executive of the Jewish Board of Family and Children’s Services, which operates Hawthorne.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many children continue to run until they feel safe at the center, he said. “Kids are not running away from the campus, they are running away from the trauma and abuse they have experienced, which we are encouraging them to face,” Mr. Rivel said.
            </p>
            <p>
             To prevent children from regressing, there must be a balance between tough love and tolerance of behavioral problems that stem from deep-seated pain, said Jonathan McLean, the director of Hawthorne.
            </p>
            <p>
             The town of Mount Pleasant has long been home to Hawthorne and Pleasantville, which is run by the J.C.C.A., formerly known as the Jewish Child Care Association.
            </p>
            <p>
             About two miles apart, the campuses opened more than a century ago to take in the orphaned children of Jewish immigrants.
            </p>
            <p>
             About 80 young people children live at Pleasantville, while about 50 live at Hawthorne. The overwhelming majority of the residents there are black and Hispanic children from New York City.
            </p>
            <p>
             Making children feel wanted is key to preventing them from going missing, said Jim Purcell, the chief executive of the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies, an advocacy group. “For some of these kids, it’s showing that someone cares,” he said. “Some of these kids AWOL to see if somebody is going to stop them.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Chief Oliva said his department, which has 45 officers, was stretched thin by helping to investigate sex trafficking cases involving missing girls, and by responding to calls from the centers and complaints from residents.
            </p>
            <p>
             To push the nonprofits to improve security, the town began charging them a fine of $250 last year for calls about missing children, he said. (As of October, the town had issued the fine 15 times.) The fines were instituted in part because residents had complained about crimes committed by children from the centers, but Mr. Oliva said it was important to remember that the children were being hurt or put in harm’s way.
            </p>
            <p>
             From July 2016 though June, about 73 percent of the 188 New York City children at Hawthorne were reported missing, a rate that was significantly higher than those for similar programs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr. Rivel said the numbers at Hawthorne had been skewed by the “overreporting” of cases in which children had gone missing for just a few hours, but he did not dispute that the numbers reflected a crisis and that elected officials needed to help. “We have a real problem here, a real challenge here,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Last year, the Jewish Board and J.C.C.A. hired directors of security, new positions for both nonprofits.
At Pleasantville, the J.C.C.A. added more cameras, new lighting and new two-way radios. At Hawthorne, the Jewish Board began following children in a van on the 20-minute walk from the campus to the nearby Metro-North Railroad station. The board also installed a six-foot-high fence that stretches 200 feet through trees and brush.
            </p>
            <p>
             The tactics have reduced the number of children who go missing, though the figure remains strikingly high at Hawthorne. Since the state allowed Hawthorne to begin accepting new residents in August, about 54 percent of the 79 New York City children living there have been absent at some point, according to city data.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the idea of using highly restrictive security measures is at odds with a strong belief by many experts that emotionally damaged children should not be criminalized.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Honestly, their goal is to protect these kids,” said Staca Shehan, the executive director of the case analysis division at the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children. “But at the end of the day, there hasn’t been a way to force services upon them,” she said. “The field as a whole really doesn’t have a consensus because running away from services is so prevalent.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Advocates said there was a need for more state funding for programs that engage children. “Those are the things that get lost in the shuffle when there’s no money,” Mr. Purcell said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi, a Queens Democrat who is the chairman of the social services committee, said Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has cut the operating budgets of the agencies that oversee troubled children by nearly 17 percent since fiscal 2012 to keep a vow to curb state spending.
            </p>
            <p>
             [Interesting]
            </p>
            <p>
             The state described the cuts as “cost savings” unrelated to the direct funding of treatment centers.
            </p>

             The state provides money to local districts that negotiate annual rates with the nonprofit organizations that run the centers — the Jewish Board receives $419.78 per day for each child, and the J.C.C.A. receives $431.36. The state could set higher rates for the next fiscal year because of the cost of the new security measures at Hawthorne and Pleasantville, state officials said.

             Shows our problems in the west are systemic.......this is similar to the catholic church just moving pedaphile priests rather than punishing them. DC, city of london and vatican are city states, do not have to follow law. Glad UN is looking into vatican and whether they should even be acknowledged there since queen over reached and had Kevin Annette detained at the Canadian border. He has been courageous in fighting the vatican/mafia. Most people are afraid to go up against them.

            I wonder why they were running away from that home in the first place.

            Also - could members of staff have been involved in the trafficking - this should be looked into.

             A prosecutor said at a court hearing in August for Hensley Dupigny that the alleged conspiracy was “particularly egregious” because the defendants sought out minors in the social services system, often children with behavioral or emotional problems who had become wards of the state.
