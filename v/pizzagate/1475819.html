            very true. Socrates -&gt; Plato -&gt; Aristotle: weren't some of the founders of western philosophical thought tied in a chain of man-boy love? They seem OK. But it seems like pedophilia nowadays is far more entwined with prepubescent children, human trafficking, systematic abuse, etc (although who knows, it probably was in the ancient world too).

            Mutual blackmail is a good point too

            If you were a practising pedophile, you'd want to go into government so you could form a network to protect your activities and those of your friends. This would be the most important thing to you, so you wouldn't care if the country went down the drain in the meantime.

            Well supposedly the FBI watched as over 5,200 people signed up for CP, cross-checked 3,500 names for Pentagon ties, 264 individuals were uncovered as being specifically Pentagon employees or contractors, including staffers for the Secretary of Defense, and then only 20 percent of these 264 people were completely investigated and fewer still were prosecuted. 1,700 alleged child porn customers still went unchecked.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that's just what the MSM was willing to admit to back then:
            <a href="http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1184433">
             http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1184433
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Quick search shows that "approximately 23,000 military and civilian employees and about 3,000 non-defense support personnel work in the Pentagon."
           </p>
           <p>
            So let's just give them the best benefit of the doubt we can and assume that it was only 264 staff members out of roughly 26,000. So that would be a but over 1% (1.0153846153846153% according to this site that does the math for me) of Pentagon staff definitely caught accessing CP. Although of course we can all probably safely assume it was more than that since thousands of cases were never even checked.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr Michael Seto, a clinical and forensic psychologist claimed in 2014 that he thinks that if we say that a paedophile is someone attracted to children aged 14 or less, then he estimates that you could reach the 2% figure, and that if we use a very strict definition and say paedophilia refers only to the attraction to pre-pubescent children [then it] is probably much lower than 1%. Dr James Cantor, a psychologist and sexual behaviour scientist claimed that it was 0.5%.

            so I think these kind of people seek out positions in society where they will be held in high esteem and viewed as moral leaders so they will be above suspicion.    I think that is why it often seems to be prevalent with politicians and especially priests.  now if you really want to get into dark conspiracies we could discuss how if a cabal of elite people were coordinating our Gov't and wanted to exercise absolute control over our politicians, they would find people with predilections for these kind of things, supply them with what they want most, and then use evidence of it as blackmail to control them... but we should probably focus on the things we can prove first.
