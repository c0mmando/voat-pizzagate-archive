<p>the director of the film seems to be the same Matthew Lessner on IMDB who\'s film synopsis was scrubbed and removed the phrase &quot;special pizza&quot; from the description.
Alefantis seems to have co produced this project, and with recent stories surfacing of Alefantis being somewhat of an art collector it makes sense he would work with independent film companies.</p>
<p>I did some poking around and apparently  Matthew Lessner has also worked with pro Hilary media figures such as the group &quot;the local natives&quot;</p>
<p>Whats interesting is in the comments a user makes a comment dated 2 years ago as follows </p>
<p>&quot;very inspiring work, spontaneous downloads are the unsung pearls of a late yuga! coincidentally(?) I just finished the cosmic serpent, a wonder to see it in a film together with the concept of CP, did you ever come across Robert Anton Wilson\'s use of the term? I\'m curious, of the woman with the snake either as mother (of ayahuasca and thus also DNA) behind the curtains of the event, or as an incline to sublimate energy from sexual upwards... or both? Anyway, great film that left me with a joy of artistic appreciation. Thank you very much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just finished the cosmic serpent, a wonder to see it in a film together with the concept of CP, did you ever come across Robert Anton Wilson\'s use of the term?&quot;
this sentence in particular being most important </p>
<p>I did some looking around and apparently Cosmic serpent is a book here is the wikipedia page on it
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cosmic_Serpent">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cosmic_Serpent</a>
the book deals with a psychedelic brew named Ayhuasca containing the chemical DMT, which is one of the most potent psychedelic drugs known today</p>
<p>he also mentions a name Robert Anton Wilson here is his Wikipedia page
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson</a>
Robert Wilson is apparently a writer and a mystic , he wrote a book named &quot;Illuminatis&quot; in 1977</p>
<p>Im not sure if the commentor is definitively referring to child porn, but he would seem to be tying in the drug use to suggested child porn</p>
<p>this is all a reiteration im sure, So here is where my question comes in, could anyone here refer me to where this end of the story broke first? what forum or site? this would be most appreciated and thanks to all</p>',

            Smoking DMT is like being sucked out of your body, out of this dimension, into another alien dimension where you are shown things like a history of art motifs of man and who knows what else, the secrets of the universe, telepathic communication with entities, experience death/rebirth/god, all to return back to your meatsack body within 10-15 minutes with only a half-assed way to articulate what just happened which becomes as if it were a fleeting dream seconds after you return to your body. Consuming the brew of Ayahuasca lasts 4-6 hours and is much less intense onset but you peak for a longer time and the experiences I have read are much less crazy, different themes gaia/jungle/art motif visions.

            It is really interesting to read even if you dont get to experience it -

            It has been used by indigenous shaman and people since before time. If you ask them how they figured out which of 1000's of plants to mix to get the effect, they tell you that the plants told them.

            I'm not sure what they are referring to as CP other than the movie title "CHAPEL PERILOUS" .
