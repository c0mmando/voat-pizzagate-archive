            Great idea looking for a lead here. You know the Clintons have their hand in the cookie jar there.
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I understand, the Clintons  were instrumental in propelling Tyson into the billion dollar corporation that it is today, those shipping rights didn't  come cheap, their boats and ports have to be where to look.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was also the little rumor that Tyson and the Clinton Cohorts where the ones to manufacture the h1n1 bird flu and scare to help eliminate a good portion of competition from the Chinese chicken market.

             Interesting....makes you wonder if Tyson was actually helping get h1n1 out in the wild so that this could be orchestrated...or even if clinton also has her hands deeper in the vaccine side of things:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/30/us/hillary-clinton-turned-1000-into-99540-white-house-says.html?pagewanted=all">
              http://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/30/us/hillary-clinton-turned-1000-into-99540-white-house-says.html?pagewanted=all
             </a>
             Clinton turns $1,000 to $99,450 on the stock market with the help of a Tyson top lawyer:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The White House insisted today that Mrs. Clinton received no improper financial assistance on the trades from the lawyer, James B. Blair, a close friend who at the time was the top lawyer for Tyson Foods of Springdale, Ark., the nation's biggest poultry company. Mr. Blair has said that he had suggested that she get into the commodities market, and that he used his knowledge of trading to guide her along the way.
             </p>
             <p>
              During Mr. Clinton's tenure as Governor, Tyson benefited from several state decisions, including favorable environmental rulings, $9 million in state loans, and the placement of company executives on important state board
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             and then Tyson has more bird flu found in their chicken last month
             <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-usa-idUSKBN16C0XL">
              http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-usa-idUSKBN16C0XL
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              A strain of bird flu has been detected in a chicken breeder flock on a Tennessee farm contracted to U.S. food giant Tyson Foods Inc, and the 73,500 birds will be culled to stop the virus from entering the food system, government and company officials said on Sunday.
             </p>
             <p>
              The U.S. Department of Agriculture said this represented the first confirmed case of highly pathogenic H7 avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry in the United States this year. It is the first time HPAI has been found in Tennessee, the state government said.
ADVERTISING
             </p>
             <p>
              Tyson, the biggest chicken meat producer in the United States, said in a statement it was working with Tennessee and federal officials to contain the virus by euthanizing the birds on the contract farm.

            In hindsight- and the new allegations of trafficking with tyson- back last year there was this:
            <a href="http://archive.is/W6hSm">
             http://archive.is/W6hSm
            </a>
            in regard to Tyson (among others in shipping) not in favor of a new rule that would have shippers verify the weight of containers. Generally, it was done with an estimation of weight....so now you have the human trafficking element added to that, and aside from the business cost there's also more chance of getting caught if you're adding extra weight of humans you're trying to transport...
Article link above- snippet:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Tyson Foods and other exporters say a rule requiring them to verify the weight of containers will raise their transportation costs
U.S. exporters are asking Congress for help in a dispute with ocean carriers over a new regulation on weighing containers that shippers say will raise their costs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ocean carriers have said they will reject any containers for which shippers have not submitted a “verified gross mass” come July 1. A number of U.S. ports have said they will not allow trucks to enter their gates if shippers haven’t complied.
            </p>
            <p>
             In testimony Wednesday at a Senate subcommittee hearing on the maritime industry, Perry Bourne, director of international transportation at Tyson Foods Inc., TSN 0.21%▲ said carriers’ interpretations of the weight requirement are too narrow and will disrupt U.S. exports, adding that the carriers have been unwilling to negotiate.
            </p>
            <p>
             U.S. shippers say they weren’t adequately consulted about the rule, which was adopted in 2014 as an amendment to the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, or SOLAS, by the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization. They say suggested methods of weighing laid out in the amendment are overly complicated and costly, and have proposed that carriers, which own the containers, help with compliance by providing the weight of empty containers themselves.
....
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Tyson, one of the world’s largest food companies, which shipped more than 40,600 refrigerated containers in 2015
             </strong>
             , has previously said that carriers’ proposed treatment of the new IMO measure could add millions of dollars to annual transportation expense.
Jeff Lawrence, executive director of the Ocean Carrier Equipment Management Association, an industry group representing carriers, said shippers should work individually with carriers to deal with exceptions, but any “ad hoc approaches” to weight reporting may cause port congestion and delays.

I seem to recall that Tyson foods use to dump their waste from their factories  in the rivers of  Arkansas and Bill would cover for them for their  for hefty donations .

            Look into Tyson Foods bringing in bus loads of illegals up from Texas. Many having fake ids and SS#s. Some as young as 10 was working. Tysons would allow them to work double shifts, for a few months at a time, no taxes taken out of paychecks, then allow them to go back to Texas. Then exchange ids SS#s and new ones would repeat the cycle.

            Why is it quite suspicious the Washington Post covered this?  It was an allegation in the VA governor's contest.
They didn't bring it up, Corey Stewart did.  Podesta?    Not even mentioned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you really expect the Washington Post wouldn't cover a local governor's race?   Stewart is an alt-right veteran of the Trump campaign.  How do you get to Podesta?  Does your mind stop working when you see the Washington Post?

            And for the record, Tyson Foods was not convicted and Gillespie did not work on that case.

            Tyson foods was part of Iran-Contra. Cocaine &amp; other drugs were stuffed inside Tyson chickens I believe by HRC &amp; CIA then transported across the country from Mena, Arkansas airport. Search all those locations and you will find documents.

             Yup. Tyson is a dirty company. They also abuse their chickens in disgusting ways. Never buy Tyson. Probably responsible for a great number of people dying of cancer.

                good to know, I've never posted there, but its amusing to observe...  The chaos!  abusive boys beating the shit out of eachother in a sort of electronic lord of the flies, and the one who demands the rest must sleep now. Hilarious. Do you have any idea how many regulars post there? I can't tell them apart.

            the story is general slave labor, not sex related or children, so that's probably okay with publishing at WPoo

             Very true its got red herring all over it in terms of PG. But still a shame not to cover it off with the community.

              I think it also helps in terms of the fact of how the shipping is occurring- the outlets, etc. in investigating overall...things to consider, things to look at deeper...  If it's done easily for one company for "slave labor", why would it not be any easier to transport children, organs, etc. or them or any other company?  Something to consider- especially in relation to PG.

              I agree that it is a little off center to have posted in here....BUT...may not be too far off.  Why?
An interesting note, since Scalise was shot and he has already been noted as being against human trafficking-
              <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveScalise/status/867843578265051136">

             </p>
             <p>
              Also involved in the shooting and was shot along with Scalise was a lobbyist for Tyson, Matt Mikka

             </p>
             <p>
              Could Matt Mikka also have have known something he wasn't supposed to? If indeed it was an attempt to take out Scalise, was Mikka also a target? Or maybe it's just a coincidence...
