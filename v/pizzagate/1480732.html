<p>1) I doubt that the evil deeds were being done in the middle of DC.  Organized trafficking of kids through the middle of such a heavily-monitored city is unlikely.
I doubt there was ever any kiddie sex parties going on at Comet Pizza.  I think it\'s a vile establishment, with Alefantis guilty as any, but it makes much more sense as a place to groom receptive families and vulnerable kids.  That explains all the &quot;all ages&quot; parties, the peculiar choice of art, bands that play, jokes made, etc.<br />
We do not, for example, know the location of the walk-in &quot;#killroom&quot; freezer.  We still don\'t know where the (possibly, but not necessarily) underground digging was being performed.  When supposed-Pizzagaters questioned Alefantis on video the other day, clearly they should have been asking questions that if honestly answered would either clear him or incriminate him, such as: &quot;can you show me where that walk-in freezer is?  can you show me where the digging was done?&quot; 
And this leads me to the next subject:</p>
<p>2) Offline investigation.  We need to get some real legwork done.  Not someone going all gung-ho, rushing into Comet Pizza with a gun (forgive me, but no, I don\'t think that was a false flag, just a guy who thought there might be kids locked in the basement... as if they wouldn\'t have been moved out), but more people calmly investigating the activities of people involved.  We must have followers from DC:  I\'m sure people have quit working at Comet after the death threats, so they must be looking for help -- someone want to try getting hired there?  What about someone from HI investigating the cheesybay / Island Distillery and Computer Warrior &quot;Hawaii Connection&quot; lead?  We know exactly where that property was.  (The HI lead could be nothing, it could have been LARPing from the start:  all we had in concrete evidence from the guy on the scene were a few photos and the location, and a long, albeit sound and plausible story).  We need hackers.  I\'m not dumb enough to advocate anything overtly illegal here, but we need the &quot;real&quot; smoking guns.  We need to find what people and computers actually have physical evidence of the crimes we know were committed.  Which leads me to my final point:</p>
<p>3) We need information that the FBI can actually build a case on.  That is the end game.  FBIanon showed us that if there\'s any part of the government sympathetic to our cause, to shining light on this evil, it is the FBI, and it\'s well-documented that there\'s quite a war going on in the intelligence community.  Not all the FBI will be trustworthy, but they\'re what we will have to depend on in the end.  (The other possibility is revolution, and I want anyone who considers that viable to consider the notable &quot;red team planner&quot; posts, or FBIanon\'s for that matter -- it would turn out bad.)  What I\'m saying is we need to be looking for things the FBI can use.  Specific people, caught red-handed.  Not tenuous leads of &quot;oh, I followed a series of 23 web pages, connecting this company to this company to this company to this company and look, here\'s a guy with a similar name who could be the uncle of this other guy who sent money to the Clinton Foundation&quot;.  I\'m just about wrapped up (sorry it\'s rambling), but while I\'m on the FBI/FBIanon subject, I want to add one further addendum:  remember FBIanon indicated that while the Clintons were only part of this scheme (and while significant, not at the center of it), the Clinton Foundation itself <em>was</em> at the center.  Digging deeper and deeper into the CF seemed to be the key.</p>

            Not a False Flag? How many times have you seen an enraged person bring a assault rifle to some place, fire one shot and then surrender peacefully? I haven't either.

            Great post. I've been brainstorming what we can do in the real world RIGHT NOW  to investigate and disrupt their business as usual in the hopes of saving even one child. I'm not close to DC but could possibly be boots on the ground to investigate Hollywood &amp; the film industry.

            It's definitely possible that CPP is more of a "you like kids? You
            <em>
             like
            </em>
            kids? Come hang out, let's get acquainted" sort of operation, I hadn't considered that angle.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as the shooter I'd be more inclined to believe it was just a nut had the camera not been moved a day or two prior.

             u lost me when you said that we're working for the FBI, there job is cover-up and protect the elite, R U working with them? yes or no?

            <hr/>
            <p>
             Nobody in the FBI can be trusted, they have a 100 year old history of SODOMY, recall that FBI in 1910 was called "American Bureau of Investigation", they renamed re-invented themselves in 1930 under HOOVER (SODOMIST)
            </p>
            <p>
             The FBI since creation was a national police force to protect the elite, from the GOV ( little people ) post ww2 deep-state took over and now everybodys job is the FUCK the 'little people'
