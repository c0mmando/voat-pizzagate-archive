            Here are two points of view from two blogs:
The first one does not like the McCann's hand picked Detective Dave Edgar at all
            <a href="https://themccanngallery.blogspot.com/2009/09/madeleine-mccann-is-in-secret-lair-and.html">

             http://archive.is/9Wm2b
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The other poses the question: Did she die days before?
"Did Madeleine McCann die on Sunday 29th April 2007, four days before she was reported missing? Strong evidence that she did."

            Excerpt:
           </p>
           <p>
            G Analysis of their statements, which inadvertently reveal many clues about what really happened to Madeleine
           </p>
           <p>
            H The huge involvement of the government and security services in this case, including Gordon Brown’s personal interventions in the Portuguese investigation at the request of Gerry McCann, and the involvement of MI5, Special Branch, and the government-backed Control Risks group. Tony and Cherie Blair also gave personal support to the McCanns, while David Cameron set up the five-year-long Metropolitan Police investigation into Madeleine’s reported disappearance. Operation Grange, which has cost around £13 million but has got absolutely nowhere
           </p>
           <p>
            I The appointment by Tony Blair of his most senior PR officer, Clarence Mitchell, the Director of the Media Monitoring Unit at the Central Office of Information, and responsible directly to the Cabinet Office, to head up the government’s PR initiative in support of the McCanns. This support continued even after the McCanns became the Portuguese police’s prime suspects when the McCanns were arrested and made official suspects on 7 September 2007. Mitchell once boasted that his job was to ‘control what comes out in the media’. He most certainly has done that in the Madeleine McCann case. (
            <em>
             note: Mitchell went to work for pedo Clement Freud, who teased about the cadaver dog, "What are they going to do? Put the dog on the stand? One bark for yes? Two for no?" tee hee
            </em>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            J The McCanns refusing to give their holiday photos to the police. Instead, they used the Head of Risks at PR company Bell Pottinger, Alex Woolfall, and their cousin, Michael Wright, to edit, crop and delete photographs from the McCanns’ memory cards before they were given to the police, on 9 May. They refused to hand over their photographs without first selecting exactly what they wanted the police to see and what they didn’t want them to see. In addition, the Portuguese police appear to have received the images on a black-and-white program which only reproduced them as grainy ‘greyscale’ images which made them very difficult to analyze.
           </p>
           <p>
            K Employing disreputable and dishonest private investigation agencies, such as Metodo 3 and Oakley International. Some of the men the McCanns employed were out-and-out crooks, like Antonio Giminez Raso from Metodo 3 and Kevin Haligen of Oakley International, both of whom spent four years in jail for crimes, respectively, of corruptly assisting a major drugs gang, and major fraud. In addition, Antonio Giminez Raso was caught bribing people in Morocco to falsely claim that they had seen Madeleine. These bogus stories were then fed to the media. In early 2009, Brian Kennedy, the Cheshire businessman who led the McCann Team’s private investigations, helped to create a bogus private investigation company, ALPHAIG Ltd. He did this to create the entirely false impression that two former police officers he employed for a period, Dave Edgar and Arthur Cowley, were lead detectives of a company called Alpha Investigations Group. This impression was wholly false.

           </p>
           <p>
            L Arranging two bogus week-long searches of a dam in Portugal, the Arade Dam, pretending that they knew nothing about this search, when in fact they had paid a lawyer, Marcos Aragao Correia and men form Metodo 3 to conduct the search.
           </p>
           <p>
            M Deliberately creating stories about claimed ‘sightings’ of Madeleine which they knew to be false.
           </p>
           <p>
            N Within weeks of reporting Madeleine’s disappearance, the McCanns planned events to mark her disappearance, far in advance. For example, on 3 June 2007, just one month after Madeleine went missing, Gerry McCann was planning a ‘big event’ to mark Madeleine’s ‘abduction’, telling the press: “We want a big event to raise awareness that she is still missing…It wouldn’t be a one-year anniversary, it will be sooner than that.” He wanted Elton John to front a major fund-raising concert. Less than a month later, on 28 June 2007, Dr Gerry McCann said: “I have no doubt we will be able to sustain a high profile for Madeleine’s disappearance in the long-term”. How very true, over nine years later, has that prophecy come true.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of these circumstances simply serve to confirm the alerts of the dogs and show that the McCanns’ account of events was not correct and that Madeleine was NOT abducted."  (read more in the blog...)
           </p>
           <p>
            See what I did there?  Yeah I'm suspect of the McCanns because of the dogs, and because of all their cozy ties with people in high places, including at least one known pedophile.  I agree with equineluvr below, perhaps accidental overdose of drugs, parents didn't want to get charged; they so happen to be members in "a club" where everyone looks out after one another and are sworn to secrecy...
Also a strange sidenote, the staff note regarding the dinner reservations, said the kids would be left alone in the room sleeping.  The island had incidences and the hotel itself had at least one, of someone getting into rooms and molesting kids.  Seems odd for the staff to be 'okay' with the situation of not encouraging guests to not leave unattended kids, especially so young, in the rooms.

            Statement analysis, aka forensic linguistics, reveals an embedded confession in the McCanns' statements.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conclusions:
Madeleine is dead.
Her death was unintentional.
Extreme sleepiness (drugging?) and a fall may have played a role in her death.
Her parents have hidden rather than disposed of her body.
Sexual abuse is very likely.

             I'm sure this very experienced man, who has been trained  in the art of deception, knows what he's talking about. I don't doubt him or the conclusions he's drawn from viewing recorded interviews of the mccann parents. However, I would like to submit this as possibility:  Madeline was planned for whatever reason, and the mccanns were chosen to be her temporary parents.  Knowing that they wouldn't be raising her, because she didn't actually belong to them, the parents had to keep their hearts closed to Madeline. Therefore, when this investigator says that the mothers words and actions actually prove that Madeline is dead,  I think what they really is prove is that Madeline was never really alive in this mothers heart.  The distance and indifference these parents show for their missing child is alot more logical if you look at them from the perspective of people who were just babysitting til the real parents came home.

              Something has always bothered me.  If I find that one of my three children has gone from a room and the windows are now open - i.e. she's been "taken" - my first instinct would be to gather up the remaining two before leaving that apartment again - but she doesn't; she leaves the other two there whilst she runs the same distance back to the tapas bar and back again to the apartment.  How can she be so convinced her other children were now deemed 'safe' to leave behind -even for that short space of time? Why was she so convinced she wasn't leaving the other two in the same potential danger of also being abducted from the same abandoned apartment?  It just doesn't sit well with me that she left those two alone when she ran to alert the others that Madeleine was gone.

              I absolutely agree that their not being the "real" parents  is a possibility.  I only
              <em>
               know
              </em>
              a few things:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               The parents know what really happened to her and have not been forthcoming.
              </li>
              <li>
               Parents have behaved strangely/oddly since this whole thing broke.
              </li>
              <li>
               Parents had hypersexualized Madeleine (see makeup and poses in photos).
              </li>
              <li>
               McCann = McCAIN (son of Cain).  Gerry is of the Cain bloodline and is a Freemason.
              </li>
              <li>
               McCanns had a weird lunch/meeting with creepy pedo Sir Clement Freud.
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
              What do the police (suppoedly) know? 
*  Blood in boot of car matched Madeleine's (cadaver dogs hit on).
*  Blood in apartment in Portugal had been cleaned up.
*  Refrigerator in apt. in Portugal was missing -- McCanns disposed of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Putting it all together, there is a strong suggestion that there was in fact some type of accident.  Nobody is saying that the two are mutually exclusive, either -- BOTH could be true, i.e. (1)  That they were her "temporary" parents; and (2)  That she died of some kind of accident in the apartment in Portugal.

            The   parents gave their kid to  the ring and likely  had  her for  this reason.   The  way they  talk and act and hung out with the pedo  says  it all.

            The thing that always puzzled me is why Madeline? She had siblings in the room with her. Why did they chose her out of the three? My thinking is that it would be too hard to take three kids. I cannot imagine the pain her mother feels.

            Completely agree with everything this detective is saying. I've always insisted that the parents had zero to do with it, that the motive was sexual, and that she is still alive ... and being abused.
           </p>
           <p>
            I so hope they solve this and get that child out of the hands of the monster who has her.

              They did nothing to try to search for Maddie in the 48 hours after she went missing, they partied and sunbathed and said nothing about it at all. I, the next 24 hours they had set up a limited company disguised as a charity to ask for funds to help their legal fees and then flew to the UK. A bit wierd. The weirdest thing of all is that the UK Government has blocked the files they have on the McCanns for 100 years, something which is not done except in matters of extreme national security. But why?

            This poor little girl.  She is absolutely gorgeous and reminds me of my own daughter.  The fact that she is being used in the sickest of ways completely breaks my heart.  I am just truly heart broken for her.  And what is really sad is that I don't know whether to feel sorry for the parents or angry at them!!! So much fucking confusion!! P.s. were the podesta brothers even investigated in this case?!? Because the kidnapping drawings are pretty fucking on point with their faces... sigh.... will this pizzagate pedogate shit ever stop??? 😢😢😢
