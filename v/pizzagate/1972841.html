            The only thing I can figure out, from this other poster's contribution, is that he meant female prostitutes and not children. Weiner seems to be interested in teens, and those slighty underage legally (was the youngest 15?), but not girls in the sense of 12 and under (ala Creepy Joe). What we here are really trying to stop is the abuse of children. For the longest time any male over 12 was considered to be an adult, and daughters were thought to have 'matured', however, and although their circumstances were sometimes varied,
            <em>
             frequently
            </em>
            protected until handed over to someone trustworthy with assets, if at all possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now whether they were/are not, actually mature enough, is another thing, and frequently schooling in America today doesn't get children ready to be adults until much later. If anything it retards their progress, creating and encouraging ignorance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Montana still has a handful of one-room schools. What remains of the culture still pushes accountability in the sense of self sustainability. A whole lot of people have moved in from Washington, California and other screwed-up states. And proceed to bring their liberal retarded nonsense here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Montana is mostly veterans compared to other states it is one of the highest per capita veteran population.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think one of the reasons why veterans come here it's because of the spaces so they don't have to deal with people as much. And part of the state's ethos is charting your own course. But at the same time the state is conservative. It's not a big gay pride rally.
           </p>
           <p>
            That factor above probably excludes traveling priests from being able to find prostitutes as much as he would in a city like Seattle, and California.

            I'm sceptical ....concluding Father Corapi "has fallen back into sin"....is a stretch.   There's been a lot of rumors swirling about Corapi, and the conditions under which he stopped public ministry.   Anyone who has ever listened to him knows he does not mince his words.  I personally doubt he would lie.   He and his superiors had a disagreement about how proceeds from his sale of books and videos were allocated.   Google EWTN CORAPI for his past talks.   He did hang with the Hollywood crowd, and was at the same party where John Belucci died of drug overdose.  I personally don't believe he would fall into depravity that the Hollywood elites pedal.
Also, there a plenty of people out there who would malign him, perhaps even Weiner.

            Probably a parody, fake account. No blue checkmark. Only 300 followers for being a "superstar". Someone replied on Weiner tweet in 2013 saying they don't think it's father's acc, doesn't sound like him.

             Probably.  He was super rich and threw big parties etc etc before becoming a priest.

            I'm glad that Pell is FINALLY being held accountable.  He got off so many times!  One time Australia law enforcement told the Vatican he needed to return to AUS for the investigation and the Vatican told AUS law enforcement that he was in no condition to fly!  Un freaking believable!!

            My husband and I were talking about how they move priests from parish to parish after a year so they don't form strong bonds and so they don't become "superstar" priests like fr Corapi.  He then told me that fr Corapi had fallen back into sin and away from the church.  I asked how far he fell away and he googled it and stumbled upon the twitter account while reading about him

            Here's a little timeline on wiener- 5 days before Corapi says wiener called, weiner announced his resignation from Congress because of his personal issues (the pics he posted on twitter etc).  Wiener's resignation announcement was on June 16, 2011.  Corapi says wiener called him and says the pizza in Montana sucks on June 21,2011
           </p>
           <p>
            So why did wiener call Corapi ?  Was Corapi really talking about pizza the food or pizza/prostitutes? Since he didn't say cheese pizza, was he talking about adults and not children??

              I'm not sure.  I noticed the priests in our parish have left after a year for the past 3 years maybe.  It could have started before that without my noticing though cuz we moved and we go to Mass at different churches depending on which time is most convenient for us.  (In South Louisiana there are around 10 Mass times to choose from)
