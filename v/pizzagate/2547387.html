            I have been thinking about the Sheriff and connection to the Morning Star Boys Ranch and did a little research.  Here is what I found.

            Paul Ingram was an Olympia Kiwanis Member and was the chief civil deputy for the Thurston County Sheriffs office, in the late 1980s, (under Kiwanis member and Sheriff Gary Edwards). Paul Ingram was an OKBR board member and was charged with rape and with accusations of satanic rites, and sexual misconduct "beyond any known human behavior".
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1989, Paul Ingram, a deputy sheriff in Olympia, Wash., received a 20-year prison sentence for sexually abusing his two daughters in satanic rituals. The trial sparked widespread debate about "recovered memory syndrome," covered by Ethan Watters in Mother Jones (July/August 1991, Jan./Feb. 1993), and later in his book, co-authored by Richard Ofshe, Making Monsters: False Memories, Psychotherapy, and Sexual Hysteria (New York: Scribners, 1994).
           </p>
           <p>
            Until Oct 1999, I believed that the Kiwanians and their friends were guilty of careless neglect or callous indifference. After hearing frightening audio depositions from some of the abused kids, I now believe that these Thur Co citizens were involved with an "active collaboration with evil." According to these depositioned kids, (which was not contradicted by Kiwanian attorney Don Miles), the OKBR staff was involved in long-term molestation and sadistic abuse of these helpless children. DSHS, Olympia, &amp; the Kiwanians criminally ignored the warning signs and then justified their inaction by claiming ignorance. Many of these inattentive judges, lawyers, &amp; politicians want your vote for re-election.

            Could this possibly be connected to Morning Star Boys Ranch?  Sheriff connection  DSHS  Olympia Kiwanis Boys Ranch

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Lucifer (/ˈluːsɪfər/ LOO-sif-ər) is a name that, according to dictionaries of the English language, refers either to the Devil or to the planet Venus when appearing as the morning star.[1][2][3]
           </p>
           <p>
            As a name for the Devil, the more common meaning in English, "Lucifer" is the rendering of the Hebrew word הֵילֵל‎ in Isaiah (Isaiah 14:12) given in the King James Version of the Bible. The translators of this version took the word from the Latin Vulgate,[4] which translated הֵילֵל by the Latin word lucifer (uncapitalized),[5][6] meaning "the morning star, the planet Venus", or, as an adjective, "light-bringing".[7]
           </p>
           <p>
            As a name for the morning star, "Lucifer" is a proper name and is capitalized in English. In Greco-Roman civilization the morning star was also personified and considered a pagan god.[8] At that time the distinction between capitalized and lower-case letters had not yet been invented.[9]

             Holy fucking shit!!! Wtf!!
Paul Ingram was a Satanist!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             First historical case of Satanism.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The Thurston County ritual abuse case was a 1988 case in which Paul Ingram, county Republican Party Chairman of Thurston County, Washington and the Chief Civil Deputy of the Sheriff's department, was accused by his daughters of sexual abuse, by at least one daughter of satanic ritual abuse[1] and later accused by his son in 1996 of abusing him from the ages of 4 to 12.[2]
            </p>
            <p>
             Ingram pleaded guilty and his confession grew increasingly elaborate and detailed, while Ingram's young daughters and their friends subsequently accused a sizable number of Ingram's fellow Sheriff's department employees of abuse.[citation needed] He now maintains he is innocent and alleges his confession was coerced. He tried to withdraw his plea and requested a trial or clemency, but his requests were refused. According to the appeals court, the original trial had conducted "an extensive evidentiary hearing on the coercion issue" and found that Ingram was unable to prove his claims of coercion, a situation his appeals did not change.[3] Ingram was released in 2003 after serving his sentence.[4]
            </p>
            <p>
             The case is often cited by proponents[who?] of the idea that satanic ritual abuse actually exists as proof because Ingram was found guilty; in reality, Ingram was never charged with "satanic ritual abuse" but with six counts of rape in the third degree, and received an unusually long sentence – rather than a maximum of three and a half years, he was sentenced to twenty years.[5] The "satanic" aspects of the case were dropped by the prosecution[6] although the appearance of Satan was integral to Ingram's confessions. The case has also been compared to the Salem witch trials.[7][8]"

              OK.  Found it.  We have had worse things on here.  Again it is from the  Wiki

              The Thurston Count Ritual Abuse Case
             </p>
             <p>
              Ingram was accused of sexually abusing both of his daughters over a period of years. Initially Ericka, his eldest daughter, claimed this abuse had stopped in 1979 but later his other daughter Julie said it had happened less than five years before. When first interviewed in 1988 by Sheriff Gary Edwards and Undersheriff Neil McClanahan about the sex abuse accusations, Ingram "basically confessed during the first five minutes" as McLanahan would later state.[11]
             </p>
             <p>
              As the case proceeded, the accusations increased in scope and detail. Ingram was also accused of participating in hundreds of satanic rituals including the slaughter of 25 babies. Ericka claimed she had caught a sexually transmitted disease from him, and had a baby aborted when near term.[12]

              Yep.  That's the way it seems.  But the similarities of DSHS and the Sheriff angle just is too much to ignore and the Boys Homes.  Also I saw some really graphic descriptions of other things that went on.  I did not include.  Could try to find again if you think I should.

            It's never ending.  At first I thought certain parts of the country seemed to have more pedophiles than other regions, but I am beginning to doubt it.  It would seem almost every state has a serious problem.  Sickening.

            Now if only the rest of the pedos would just turn themselves in...
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I know some teachers in WA. The general consensus among teachers in that particular school district is that DSHS (CPS for WA) is useles... not necessarily dangerous. I have been waiting for a story like this to come along and maybe help open a conversation, particularly with those teachers. Our reports about the corrupt child protective services may be painting things with too wide of a brush. Likely certain branches and offices are ‘infected’ but not all. If that’s true, we may find more whistleblowers coming forward.

Morning Star Boys’ Ranch, a longtime group home for troubled boys in southeast Spokane, became the target of numerous lawsuits by former residents alleging physical and sexual abuse. Ranch supporters and its former director say the ranch has been sullied by the abuse allegations, which they vehemently deny. They say the Catholic-based nonprofit organization has provided a safe environment for more than 1,300 boys with behavioral problems for more than 50 years.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first of 19 sex abuse lawsuits against the ranch went to trial early in 2010, and on Feb. 12 that year, a jury handed Morning Star a victory, ruling against plaintiff Kenneth Putnam, who claims he was molested while a resident in 1988 and ’89. Seattle attorney Tim Kosnoff’s law firm represents 14 other plaintiffs in suits against the boys’ ranch. Kosnoff said he intended to bring his strongest cases to trial first.
            </p>
            <p>
             Defense attorney Jim King said he intends to defend Morning Star and its former director, the Rev. Joseph Weitensteiner, in every case that goes to trial. Attorneys for the ranch have shown no signs that they would consider a settlement, in contrast to the Catholic Diocese of Spokane, which in 2007 settled with 180 plaintiffs claiming to have been sexually abused by priests.
            </p>
            <p>
             Allegations of abuse at the ranch surfaced in 2005, beginning with two former residents who accused ranch employees of sexual and physical abuse. More former wards of the ranch came forward with abuse allegations in the following months. The suits named Weitensteiner, defrocked priest and admitted pedophile Patrick O’Donnell, and several counselors.

             The state continues to place boys in the care of the ranch.

             Kenneth Putnam
Kenneth Putnam was sent to Morning Star Boys’ Ranch as a ward of the court in 1986. He has alleged that the Rev. Joseph Weitensteiner molested him when he was 13 or 14 years old on the priest’s boat, in his car and at his home at St. Patrick’s Parish in northeast Spokane. Also, Putnam says counselor Doyle Gillum, now deceased, molested him in a boy’s bedroom at the ranch on two occasions. Putnam has a criminal history dating to 1988 that includes felony theft, burglary, assault and drug convictions.

The Rev. Joseph Weitensteiner retired as director of Morning Star Boys’ Ranch in 2006. He began as a ranch counselor in the 1960s and was promoted to director of Morning Star after he was ordained a Catholic priest in 1966. Weitensteiner had admitted to administering corporal punishment to ranch residents but has steadfastly denied more serious allegations of abuse of boys, including sexual abuse.

               "Newly released documents reveal multiple allegations of sexual abuse at Morning Star Boys' Ranch in the past quarter-century and indicate that assaults have continued in recent years.
              </p>
              <p>
               By The Associated Press
SPOKANE, Wash. — Newly released documents reveal multiple allegations of sexual abuse at Morning Star Boys’ Ranch in the past quarter-century and indicate that assaults have continued in recent years.
State Department of Social and Health Services records obtained by The Spokesman-Review newspaper include five allegations of sexually inappropriate interactions between boys and adults associated with the Catholic home for troubled boys in the past decade.
The 871 pages of documents, released in response to a public records request by the newspaper, also include several accounts of molestation and rape among the residents from 1978 to this year.
Although the state edited the documents to protect the names of the boys and some adults, the reports provide the most comprehensive documented account of life inside Morning Star, which has been shaken in recent months by allegations of physical and sexual assaults that date back decades.
In addition to the allegations against adults, the documents include several accounts of violent or coerced sexual encounters among the boys. In one case, a boy said he learned to “just endure” the sexual attacks of an 18-year-old resident with a prior rape conviction.
Morning Star officials said they would not comment on individual cases, but insisted that the ranch has updated its policies to better protect boys, including offering residents locked single rooms and barring group showers.
Dan Kuhlmann, assistant director of the Catholic boys home, said Morning Star has “always taken a strong position that when we become aware of a problem or situation, we report it.”
In a statement released Friday, Morning Star said: “All social service organizations have some type of incident report they are NOT unique to Morning Star. Reports are used to identify and solve problems and improve practices over time.”
The documents included allegations that:
— In 1983, one resident held down a boy while another raped him. A Morning Star official told the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office that the boys had been involved in several other sexual assaults.
— In 1992, an 18-year-old resident whose psychological evaluation indicated he was “predatory” repeatedly raped a younger boy. The alleged perpetrator had a previous rape conviction and threatened the 15-year-old resident, who initially fought the older boy during the first three sexual encounters, but later “just endured it.” The 15-year-old resident then began “victimizing younger children.”
— In 1996, Morning Star failed to properly report a resident’s complaint that he had been fondled by a man during an overnight stay at the man’s home. The boy’s social worker and probation officer did not approve the visit, and Morning Star had not conducted a background check on the man. The boy’s therapist expressed concerns that a Morning Star official “may have attempted to discourage (the resident) from prosecuting” the alleged perpetrator, a charge the official and the resident have denied.
— In 2000, a 17-year-old resident reported that a Morning Star leader sexually assaulted him on a camping trip in Idaho. The group leader, whose name was redacted from the records, resigned but apparently was not prosecuted.
— In 2005, when a 13-year-old boy told a staff member that the home’s bike room was “creepy,” the employee responded, “If you think this is creepy, come inside, close the doors, and take off your pants.” The agency found that the staff member did make an inappropriate sexual remark to the child, and the employee resigned.
The documents show that Morning Star began to tighten its reporting standards in the 1990s after incidents of sexual activity among the boys and allegations of rape against a counselor.
An agency official told the newspaper the documents did not include all reported complaints, and that DSHS plans to release other earlier Morning Star documents once they are edited.
A state official who reviewed the file but asked not to be identified because top DSHS officials had not approved the conversation said investigators were concerned about a dearth of reports from the late 1970s.
While there have been five reports of inappropriate sexual interactions between residents and adults in the past decade, the state’s licensing agency received no such reports for the preceding 17 years, the newspaper reported.
Timothy Kosnoff, a Seattle attorney representing the men, said he was not surprised to learn the file contained no information on alleged sexual assaults in the early 1980s.
“I don’t believe for a minute that nothing happened from 1978 to 1995,” said Kosnoff, who had not yet reviewed the file. “If the anecdotal evidence is any indication, there’s been a serious problem of abuse of kids by staff members and by other residents dating back to the very beginning.”
Morning Star officials said they will consult independent child welfare experts to review the ranch’s policies and past incidents.
Though law enforcement investigated several incidents, it does not appear that any Morning Star staff members were ever criminally prosecuted. Morning Star officials declined to comment, citing confidentiality issues.
Since its opening in 1956, the ranch has cared for nearly 1,300 boys, including both private clients and children placed there by the state.

              Horrid, just horrid.  I only read half of my report when I posted and now I am in total disgust after reading it all.  I have read many reports done by Bishop's Account.  but this one really got to me mainly because of my anger at CPS.   I cannot believe they reinstated him, but this happens often.  No punishment.

             And how odd that he turn himself in. There must be more to the story.
            </p>

             Just speculation...

             Imagine there is a white hat dude in any particular organization. Maybe he’s solo. He’s diggin... he’s got dirt on some pedo higher ups. He’s tryin to find a way to blow the whistle...  but then his bosses get wind of it. They do their thing, startsandbaging him, threatening him, browbeating him. Finally, they plant the goods... maybe put CP on his laptop. Maybe they lean on some kids in their stable to point the finger at white hat. Now he’s neutralized.
            </p>
            <p>
             It’s tough to imagine what I would do if that’s me. Maybe I would turn myself in, idunno. I obviously have NO basis to asume that is happening here, but the detail that he turned himself in... that gets me thinking outside of the box. It’s a lateral move. It’s dicey, but unexpectable. If one had good allies, it could work. Just a thought. I am more than likely WAY off here, but I think it is a possibility that every LE white hat faces.

              You could be right.  It certainly could happen.  Dirty cops can ruin a person's life.  Also, I thought of how hard a decision when you have a family to support and you know darn well you would be out of a job.  It's easy for us to sit here, not being in their shoes.   Yeah, those guys play dirty.

               We need to be a refuge for any whistleblowers and victims that want to come forward. To do that, we need to avoid rushing to judgement. Though we are all repulsed by this sickness, we have been waiting a long time for justice. It behooves us to wait and consider the whole story, so justice is applied correctly. A lynch mob or a witch hunt won’t end this infection.

                Yes, but with these stories about CPS being more and more common, they certainly deserve the bad wrap.  Also the Morning Star debacle and consistent complaints also are highly suspect.  Most of those people are Freaking Guilty.  Now 1 may be a different story, but there is not much that can be done when you are fighting the Church and LE.  Certainly LE could plant anything.  And they do.
