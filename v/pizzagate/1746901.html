            I missed this earlier, glad I found it.  Thanks for this.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the record, I'd like to add that I put videos about our protest or video of the Dr. Phil show at over 20 seperate communities at Votable including Music, Sports, Pictures, Television, You Tube Content Creators, Jesus Saves, UK Politics, and on and on.  Prior to the protest my posts had 1000 seperate views, I'm sure Dr. Phil was seen by hundreds, and I had no negative remarks at all, and no forum took my posts down.  I did target the posts to each forum, so as not to be spamming.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the contrary, I recieved a lot of upvotes and a tweeter got on board and tweeted a lot of celebrities on our behalf.  The posts were also shared.
           </p>
           <p>
            Overall just having an action focuses us and builds momentum and strength.  I felt great about exposing a whole bunch of communities to what we are doing, and I have to admit, being able to throw up an engaging and well researched tv show like Dr. Phil's did make that job a whole lot easier and I think palatable to the audiences I aimed at.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you haven't downloaded the show try to do so.  I think it is going to be an invaluable counter-MSM propaganda tool as we move forward.  Is is still up here but has been taken down off You Tube a couple of times at least already.

            I was heavily denouncing the protests but it seems to have went off without destroying the narrative, it does seem like alex distancing himself from pizzagate is connected to the protest in timing, and a few other things seem to be reactionary to the protest, but ill admit it doesnt seem like any one individual has hijacked the narrative like i had feared.  seeing david seaman in CPP is going  a bit far if you ask me, i wouldnt eat anything from there, or have gone there at all.  but hey, to each his own

            Oh it's been debunked? Really? Oh gosh oh golly I feel so silly. We should close up this website and find a new hobby. We have wasted our time here we are such fools the Lamestream Fake News Media has spoken.

            They know the word is getting out. albeit slowly compared to their networks of lies.  Keep up the pressure, and press harder!  Kudos to all the folks who went out to demonstrate especially Neal(?) &amp; other organizers.

            People don't believe the news the way they use to.  I personally saw at least 10 people red pilled on twitter or other boards asking questions.  The media also told everyone 98% Hilary would win.  They are out of touch with people.  keep moving on with this movement, it's gaining momentum
