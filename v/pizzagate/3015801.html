<p>In the morning, when the doctor and his team arrived at their destination, he realized they were at “the Western Mountain Execution Grounds, which specialized in killing political dissidents.”</p>
<p>“When you hear a gunshot, drive around the hill,” he was told.</p>
<p>He asked why they were there.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to know.”</p>
<p>After the shot rang out, he drove where he was told, and saw “10, maybe 20, bodies lying at the base of the hill.” The police led him to one in particular, a man of “about 30 dressed in navy blue overalls,” and told him that this is the man Tohti would be operating on.</p>
<p>“‘Why are we operating?’ Tohti protested. ‘Come on. This man is dead.’ ”</p>

<p>Yeah, this globalist cabal thing just gets better and better :(  There is much more in the article.  They don\'t specify kids but I think it goes without saying that one could find them on the black market.  I don\'t even mean only the organ harvesting, but also the great \'art\' created from human bodies.</p>

              The March arrest in Mexico’s Michoacán state of Knights Templar cartel member Manuel Plancarte Gaspar on suspicion of organ trafficking has brought this under-researched and mostly overlooked form of human trafficking into the spotlight. Plancarte Gaspar is alleged to have been part of a cartel ring that would target people – particularly children – for kidnapping to facilitate the harvesting and sale of their organs. Perhaps it should come as no surprise that the Knights Templar cartel, which no longer counts drug trafficking as its primary source of income, has turned to organ trafficking. It is, after all, an incredibly lucrative trade, with trafficked kidneys selling for about $150,000 each and hearts pulling in as much as $1.5 million apiece.
The United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking has identified three potential ways trafficking for organ trade takes place. Firstly, traffickers sometimes force or deceive victims into giving up an organ. This is what Plancarte Gaspar and the Knights Templar have been accused of doing. Second, some victims will agree to sell their organs but are then taken advantage of – they are either not paid or are not paid the agreed-upon price. An organ trafficking ring broken up in 2013 that was operating out of a medical clinic in Kosovo engaged in these sorts of practices, promising their donor victims  £12,500 per kidney and then simply dumping them, fresh surgery wounds and all, at the local airport without paying them. Finally, some victims are given surgery for an unrelated – and possibly fabricated – ailment, during which time one or more of their organs are harvested without their knowledge.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to UN.GIFT, a host of offenders is involved no matter which method is used – the recruiter who identifies the potential victim, the staff of the hospital or medical clinic where the surgery is taking place, the doctors who are performing the surgery, the middlemen and contractors, the buyers of the organs, and the banks where the organs are stored. As a result, it is almost impossible to fully uncover the entire racket whenever an individual like Plancarte Gaspar is arrested for organ trafficking, meaning it is very difficult to stop this illicit trade.
             </p>

             Can't they just store organs at abortion clinic related facilities?  No ones allowed to pry in the sacrosanct abortion industry.

              "A rash of similar outbreaks in other countries has underscored that it is a global problem. Some rice-growing regions of Sri Lanka have their own epidemic, and the disease is rampant in sugar-producing regions of Mexico and Central America (Science, 11 April 2014, p. 143). It has also been reported in Egypt"

              "Farm workers in southern India are dying from chronic kidney disease, and no one knows what is causing it. But a rash of similar outbreaks in other countries, including Central America, Sri Lanka, and Egypt, has underscored that it is a global problem. Public health experts and researchers are alarmed and baffled. In Central America, which has been hit the hardest, the leading hypothesis is that this is an occupational disease, caused by chronic exposure to heat and dehydration in the cane fields. But in India, as in Sri Lanka and Central America, researchers are pursuing a wide range of ideas, including contaminants in drinking water, excessive use of over-the-counter painkillers, and exposure to pesticides.

              "Expatriates with kidney diseases will face being deported from Qatar, a senior medical official in the Gulf state told local media."
"The move will also reduce the strain on Qatar's health service, the official added. Between 250 and 300 new patients in Qatar require dialysis every year, said medical officials."
"A 2013 study found that 113 people living in Qatar had HIV or AIDs, one of the lowest rates in the world. Kidney disease, by contrast, is thought to affect around 13 percent of Qatar residents."

                The Clintons and their inner circle have historical connections to the KLA and continued relations with the former head of the KLA, Hasim Thaci, despite substantial evidence that the miltant group participated in organ harvesting, heroine trafficking and other criminal, 'mafia-like', activities. Meanwhile, the CIA supported and funded islamic terrorists in Afghanistan, who later supported the KLA in Kosovo and together allied with the US/NATO bombing campaign in the region. The Clinton administration seemed to have no problem working with al-Queda and the KLA as long as they achieved US objectives.

                Sweetheartt.. If only you knew how evil this world is.  Human trafficking can basically be boiled down to.. workforce (ie go labour in that field over there or house slave in the manoir.) Sex trafficking (adult and child) organ trafficking (starting to get out of control due to expontential raise in demand) human test subjects for pharmaceutical companies (they saw how much progress in so little time was made during the 40s in Germany).

                 The BBC related that Amnesty International had also published a report which described U.N. peacekeepers fueling demand for sex trafficking, as well as sometimes participating in sex trafficking networks in the Kosovo area. That groups like Amnesty International, UN internal documents, and Dick Marty via the Council of Europe would all raise such serious concerns is alarming. It paints a very clear picture, in light of the later Zoe’s Ark and Silsby scandals, of aid work and exploitation too often going hand-in-hand, with abuses taking place under the unfortunate protection provided by severe lack of accountability and sometimes diplomatic immunity associated with the UN.

                 Arche of Zoe..  France's "Laura Silbury incident".. 2007 - French NGO tried to steal 107 children from Sierra Leone during the Dafur crisis.
This is important to see the involvement of French President Sarkozy, working HARD to sweep everything under the rug and let's not talk about it again.
The reason?  His brother works for BioPharma
                </p>
                <p>
                 The 2007 Zoe’s Ark scandal was one of the first of a string of NGO related cases of misconduct which resulted in accusations from the President of Chad that the NGO had been intending to sell the children to human trafficking and organ trafficking networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The charity’s (Arche de Zoe) leader, Eric Breteau, soon turned the group’s attention towards conflict in Darfur.
The BBC reported that the children recovered from Zoe’s Ark were healthy, specifying that the children were not being treated for any serious illnesses or injuries. According to NBC News, Zoe’s Ark workers had presented the children as ill and injured by applying bandages to non-existant wounds. This suggested that Zoe’s Ark had intentionally faked injuries on the bodies of healthy children, possibly to hide their identity and origin.
Furor was heightened when it emerged that most of the children recovered from Zoe’s Ark  originated from areas not involved in the Darfur conflict. The vast majority of those children were between the ages of three and five years old.
Outrage surrounding the scandal intensified when it was revealed that the 103 children recovered from the charity represented only a tiny fraction of the total number the charity planned to remove under such controversial circumstances. According to the Berkley Center for Peace, Religion and World Affairs, Zoe’s Ark had intended to remove as many as 10,000 children from the area during the single operation in Chad.
Six Zoe’s Ark workers were charged with acting illegally as an adoption intermediary, facilitating illegal entry into France, and fraud in regard to hundreds of families who had expected to adopt children. Despite receiving Presidential pardons in Chad, members of the charity were eventually convicted on related charges in France. During these French proceedings, Zoe’s Ark leader Eric Breteau was described by a witness as a “powerful manipulator.”
In addition to legal charges, serious accusations were leveled at Zoe’s Ark by Chad’s President, Idriss Deby. He stated that some of the children would face a darker fate than being sold to French families in illegal adoptions. The BBC reported Deby’s statement: “Their aim is to kidnap the children from their parents, to steal the children from their parents and sell them to pedophile organizations in Europe, and even perhaps to kill them and sell their organs.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 Deby’s allegations echoed sentiments expressed by Haiti’s Prime Minister, Jean-Max Bellerive in the wake of the Silby scandal. Less than a month after Laura Silsby and her associates were arrested in Haiti on charges of child trafficking, Bellerive told CNN that organ trafficking of children and adults was taking place in the country due to demand for “all types of organs.” His statement specified groups participating in this activity included NGO’s taking children to the United States, a possible allusion to the Silsby case, in the same breath that he described organ and child trafficking.
The intervention of then-French president Nicholas Sarkozy on the behalf of  Zoe’s Ark only served to increase speculation surrounding the event. Die Spiegel reported that Sarkozy flew Spanish flight attendants and three French journalists back from Chad in his official jet on the same day Sarkozy met with Chad’s President. According to Time, those flown back to France by Sarkozy had been under investigation in Chad at the time of their repatriation. Sarkozy’s intervention fueled controversy in Chad; The Guardian reported claims that the Zoe’s Ark charity had enjoyed the backing of Cécilia Sarkozy.

When the famous case of L'Arche de Zoé broke out, President Sarkozy curiously enough, did not come to the rescue of child victims, nor abused families, but to the rescue of  child traffiquers.
Why ? 
To protect who? 
Why did Nicolas Sarkozy go to Chad to look for French journalists and Spanish hostesses? 
Why did the French president announce, loud and clear, that he would
                  <em>
                   go out and search for the members of the "Arche de Zoé" association, whatever they did
                  </em>
                  , thus turning a molehill into a mountain.  (my own note, from remembering watching it play out.. : The Chadians were just going to throw the members of Arc Zoe into prison for the rest of their lives and gratify the outrage of the Chadian people, whose children were being stolen..they didnt ask for Sarkozy to come swooping in)
Was it awkwardness due to the haste, or does the affair of "the Ark of Zoe" hide another matter even more serious, and much more gloomy, which would have precipitated the French president into making an international blunder ?
Would there be overlying interests between the traffiquing of Chadian children to Europe, and the pharmaceutical industry, and the business community?
Every passing day sees new questions. Why and how did the association L'Arche de Zoé benefit from Access All Areas with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defense or even the Ministry of the Interior? How was L'Arche de Zoé's association able to use Transal planes from the French army to transport its equipment from N'Djamena to Abéché? Why did the French Ministry of Defense know the Boeing's flight plan chartered by Eric Breteau, the president of l'Arche de Zoé?
The Boeing lands at Abéché, which is an airfield under Chadian and French military control, with some French officers in the control tower. It is from Abéché, that, the dirty and wounded children were to embark on the plane parked at the end of runway.
Is it possible that the quite amazing privileges and advantages which Zoe's Ark benefited from, cause President Sarkozy to become personally involved in the affair? Could it be related to the troubled financing of the association l'Arche de Zoé? This case raises so many questions, that some people are wondering if behind this bland humanitarian association, there 's hiding a case of a different magnitude, a pharmaceutical business experimenting on patients that arent at all voluntary.
The association l'Arche de Zoé is an initiative of a

                   French organization Paris Biotech Santé
                  </strong>
                  . It is funded by a pharmaceutical development company
                  <strong>
                   BioAlliance Pharma

                  , as vice-chairman of the supervisory board. Some people wonder whether BioAlliance Pharma, which conducts research on AIDS and performs therapeutic trials, would not have a connection with the case of Bulgarian nurses, whose release had already been negotiated by the Sarkozy family.

                 <p>
                  The company is developing drugs to treat diseases described as a thousand times more virulent in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa than here. To develop these treatments the company practices experiments on patients, as for example for Loramic, five hundred and forty patients spread over forty different sites around the world. Stéphanie Lefèvre, Secretary General of L'Arche de Zoé, is Deputy Director of Paris Biotech Santé. And François Sarkozy, the president's brother, is among the members of the evaluation committee of this body specializing in bio-medical research. Hence the issues that swell on the web. Would there be a relationship between these pharmacological societies, and the intervention of President Sarkozy in Chad. It is like how Alzheimer's disease, suddenly became the great French national cause, immediately after the election of Nicolas Sarkozy. This surprise statement would have something to do with the fact that his brother, François Sarkozy, sits at AEC Partners, whose main client is the American Pfeizer, world leader in the pharmaceutical industry, and specialist in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In 2011, Nigeria sued giant Pfeizer, who allegedly quoted me as saying: "Illegally carried out in 1996 the clinical trial of one drug, Trovan, out of two hundred children" end quote . The inventor of Viagra secretly used children as guinea pigs, to test new molecules, under the guise of humanitarian aid. Eleven children died during these tests. Others have suffered serious consequences: deafness, paralysis, brain damage, blindness. Nigeria is claiming $ 10 billion from Pfeizer. The Washington Post revealed the scandal.

It also provides an explanation of how the infection was spread more evenly between males and females in Africa than in the West and why there is less sign of infection among five to 11-year-olds in Central Africa.

                      Morphine was first isolated from opium in 1805 by German pharmacist, Wilhelm Sertürner.
In CHINA in 1839, the Emperor, Tao Kwang, ordered his minister Lin Tse-hsu to deal with the opium problem.  Lin requested help from Queen Victoria, but was ignored. As a result, the Emperor confiscated 20,000 barrels of opium and detained some foreign traders, many of whom were British. The Chinese believed that because their ceramics and silk technologies were superior to their British counterparts that their naval ships would also be. They were wrong. The British retaliated to this interference with their drug  trade by attacking the port-city of Canton.
This was the beginning of what would become known as the 'First Opium War'. It was launched by the biggest, richest drug cartel that the world has ever known; the British Empire.
When the Chinese were defeated, they had no choice but to sign the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842. They were required to allow the trade of opium, to make large payments to the British, and even to open five new ports to the foreign drug trade. They were also forced to give Hong Kong to Britain
In 1856, the Second Opium War began and ended, with the Chinese being defeated once more. By the end of the nineteenth century, an estimated quarter of the male population of China was addicted to the enhanced opium.
In the United States, many of the early Americans cultivated their own opium. Thomas Jefferson cultivated opium at his garden in Monticello.
Warren Delano worked for  Russell &amp; Company and was instrumental in importing Opium to instigate an Opium dependance on the Chinese population.  In 1851 he settled in Newburgh, N.Y. There he eventually gave his daughter Sara in marriage to a well-born neighbor, James Roosevelt, the father of Franklin Roosevelt.
In 1874, an English pharmacist, C. R. Alder Wright had boiled morphine and acetic acid together, producing diacetylmorphine. Diacetylmorphine was synthesized and marketed commercially by the German pharmaceutical giant, Bayer. In 1898, Bayer launched the best-selling drug-brand of all time, Heroin.

                      "The White House was equally unaware of the bill’s import when President Barack Obama signed it into law, according to interviews with former senior administration officials..
Michael Botticelli, who led the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy at the time, said neither Justice nor the DEA objected to the bill, removing a major obstacle to the president’s approval...
“We deferred to DEA, as is common practice,” he said.
The bill also was reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget.
“Neither the DEA nor the Justice Department informed OMB about the policy change in the bill,” a former senior OMB official with knowledge of the issue said recently.
The DEA’s top official at the time, acting administrator Chuck Rosenberg, declined repeated requests for interviews.
Loretta E. Lynch, who was attorney general at the time, declined a recent interview request.
Obama also declined to discuss the law. His spokeswoman, Katie Hill, referred reporters to Botticelli’s statement.

                       Questions raised by the Zoe’s Ark and Silsby scandals regarding human and organ trafficking were fueled by connections in both incidents to Bernard Kouchner. In the Zoe’s Ark incident, French Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Human Rights, Rama Yade, oversaw aspects of the case and served at the time under Kouchner. The Guardian reported that Kouchner also personally contacted Idriss Deby during the Zoe’s Ark debacle to express “solidarity with the children.”

Ce dernier aurait déclaré à l’époque: «Votre projet de sauvetage des orphelins du Darfour est intéressant, il va sans doute provoquer une crise internationale et une réunion du Conseil de sécurité de l’ONU, ce qui donnera une nouvelle légitimité au ministre Kouchner de s’exprimer sur le sujet du Darfour après le fiasco du “corridor humanitaire”» que l’ex-French doctor avait évoqué"

                       "Au-delà des responsabilités juridiques qui pèsent sur les acteurs de l’Arche de Zoé, y a-t-il une responsabilité morale dans cet imbroglio ?
Oui. Elle repose sur les épaules de ceux qui, forts de leur statut intellectuel et de leur présence sur la scène publique, ont installé l’idée que tous les enfants de cette région étaient à court terme condamnés à mort et qu’une guerre génocidaire était en cours. C’est d’ailleurs ce qu’on peut lire sur le site de L’Arche de Zoé : « 800 000 enfants vont mourir avant la fin de l’année… » Des enfants broyés, démembrés, jetés dans les puits : ce sont des images évoquées par des gens comme Bernard Kouchner et Bernard-Henri Lévy qui se réclament d’une expérience de terrain et qui, de retour à Paris, mobilisent afin d’élever le niveau de conscience en vue de provoquer une intervention armée internationale au Darfour."

                      <p>
                       CNN reported in 1999 that a UN human rights official stated that human rights abuses had occurred “in the presence of UNMIK,” which Kouchner headed when he served as head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) during the conflict. The CNN report was based on statements made by Dick Marty, who called for further investigation into claims that the KLA under Hashim Thaci’s leadership had participated in organ trafficking.
The Guardian wrote in 2010 that: “Kosovo’s prime minister is the head of a “mafia-like” Albanian group responsible for smuggling weapons, drugs and human organs through eastern Europe.” These strongly worded claims were made in a Council of Europe report that relied in part on information from the FBI and other intelligence sources. NBC stated that Kosovo had responded to the publication of the report with threats of legal action.
The Guardian also discussed an internal UN document that described UN forces in Kosovo committing illegal acts and recruiting from the KLA, which as we have seen, was reported to have been a “mafia-like” group with connections to organized crime. They wrote: “The U.N.’s own damning verdict on its newly created civil defense force is fresh evidence of the failure of Special Representative Bernard Kouchner.” Once again, such admonishments of UN forces even by the UN’s evaluation, sends a clear message that current levels of oversight in humanitarian efforts are severely lacking.
The KPC under Kouchner was a UN-backed, UN-funded civil defense corp. It was manned by many high ranking members of Thaci’s KLA. This was exemplified by General Agim Ceku, formerly a senior commander in the KLA who then served as the leader of the KPC. Ceku was personally accused in a internal U.N. document of supervising a “forced prostitution racket” among other abuses.  The Guardian wrote that the KPC had received a “£30 million aid budget for Kosovo” from the UN. Such blurred boundaries were implied again when Serbian media reported that Kouchner reacted angrily to accusations  from police officials claiming that Kouchner “must have had knowledge” of documented organ trafficking.
Even with UN-backing, the KPC was accused of participation in serious human rights abuses. The Guardian reported that the KPC had participated in mafia-like activities including murder, torture, and sex trafficking networks, particularly those perpetrated by UN peacekeepers and paramilitary groups hired by the UN such as Dyncorp.
To this day, no charges have been brought in the Kosovo court.  The Schwendimann dude has just been replaced by Jack Smith.

                       Kouchner was also known for his testimony offered in defense of  Michael Sounalet, who was eventually convicted on charges of pedophilia. Media reports described Kouchner’s “vigorous” defense testimony provided on Sounalet’s behalf against pedophilia charges in Romania. Despite Kouchner’s testimony, the 67-year-old humanitarian aid worker was eventually convicted on charges of sexual perversions and corruption of minors.
Kouchner’s defense of Sounalet provides another concerning the murky boundaries between aid groups and allegations of  abuse. Sounalet served as a humanitarian worker with Doctors Without Borders, the group which Kouchner had co-founded. French Media outlet Liberation reported that Kouchner had called Sounalet’s work a “model for international bodies.” This raises serious questions as to delineation between NGO’s, those who participate in such groups who are accused of abuses, and the intercession for the accused by prominent political figures who often have close ties to the NGO’s in question.
Sounalet’s history prior to the pedophilia accusations in Romania was also alarming. Le Parisen reported that Sounalet spent 35 years of a life sentence in French prison after being convicted on charges of armed robbery. French press also reported that while incarcerated, Sounalet made contact with a Columbian drug trafficking cartel. Despite this history, Sounalet had participated in “humanitarian efforts” in locations including Rwanda, where he “looked for survivors of the families of two hundred orphans,” organized the placement of those children, and photographed them. Sounalet was reported to have also expressed admiration for Jean-Louis Machuron, who served as the first President of Doctors Without Borders until 1996. Kouchner’s defense of a convicted pedophile who had worked for the NGO he founded raised serious concerns regarding why such a person was allowed to work for an aid group in the first place, much less defended by its co-founder.
Machuron was not only President of the NGO Kouchner co-founded which hired an employee convicted of sex crimes against minors. Machuron had worked with Bernard Kouchner as a consultant at the French Ministry of Health, leading several missions for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, notably in Albania and in Kosovo in the late nineties, where he worked with the French military and international corps. This took place at the time that Kouchner served as the personal representative of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Anan as head of UN efforts Kosovo.

                       <p>
                        I havent found anything relating her directly to Dyncorps sex trade, organ harvest in Bosnia and Kosovo and Croatia.. but she was in the circles of power at that place at 2002, in Belgrade, Serbia.. acting as liason to major donor countries and she interacted between embassies and international organizations representatives....
I find it difficult to believe that she wouldn't have known what was going down...
Following section for context : some info about the horrors of the UN mission in Bosnia..backed up by Dyncorp..
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The OSCE Mission in Kosovo (OMIK) was established in supoprt to the UN UInterim Mission (UNMIK).  The 500 American mebers of the UNMIK police were Dyncorp employess under contract from the US State Department..DynCorp; Vinnell, a subsidiary of TRW; SAIC; ICI of Oregon; and Logicon, a unit of Northrop Grumman
For information reasons..
                        <a href="https://newspaperarchive.com/european-stars-and-stripes-nov-03-1998-p-1/">

                        </a>
                        The OCSE chose WHO got sent to Bosnia/Yougoslavia..Resumés were collecterd and studied and only the finest pedophiles were sent..
In Bosnia, employees of DynCorp were found to be operating a sex-slave ring of young women who were held for prostitution after their passports were confiscated. In Croatia, local forces, trained by MPRI, used what they learned to conduct one of the worst episodes of "ethnic cleansing," an event that left more than 100,000 homeless and hundreds dead and resulted in war-crimes indictments. No employee of either firm has ever been charged in these incidents.
After Bosnia.. Boell Foundation in Washington..
The Boell Fondation does a lot of work with human trafficking especially in eastern countries.
They also finance studies like this :
                        <a href="http://www.gaatw.org/books_pdf/Human%20Rights%20and%20Trafficking%20in%20Person.pdf">
                         http://www.gaatw.org/books_pdf/Human%20Rights%20and%20Trafficking%20in%20Person.pdf
                        </a>
                        Which are very good works.. They can also be used to synthetize what the current real situations are and show what legal tools are, which are being employed to combat the traffic..  certainly interesting info for someone involved in human trafficking either as a participant or someone who's fighting against it...
                       </p>
                       <p>

                        <p>
                         (side note - Whenever you see someone claiming to be a philanthropist, you should be seriously considering the possiblity that they are a Satanist.  They dont really care about humans, but they care a lot about themselves..and their Kharmic balance... they dont want to reincarne as a dung beetle to pay for all the horrible things they do.. so they open charities and give money to themselves.. err.. needy people in need of help..)
take Ms Bianca Jaggar for exemple : Why would someone who's so involved with fighting against Human Trafficking be going to a Scissor Sister concert with James Alefantis..of course, everyone is free to hang out with anyone they want..

                          "The little-known Haiti Development Fund, an LLC incorporated in Delaware in August 2010, was created by the Clinton Foundation with an initial endowment of $20 million from shady Canadian mining mogul Frank Giustra and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim."
The for-profit Fund was managed by Jean Marc Villain, who was going through a bankruptcy in 2010 when he was working for the Clinton Foundation.

                          "“This cries out for an audit or an investigation,” said Ken Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center a Virginia-based watchdog group. “Its director was in bankruptcy and there’s almost nothing in the public record showing what happened to the millions of dollars it supposedly was going to use to help poor Haitians.”"

                          Charity involvement in child and organ trafficking is a concerning issue; these concerns were repeated in 2010, this time in Haiti with the Laura Silsby child debacle.
The accusations mirrored similar comments made by the Prime Minister of Haiti in an interview with CNN where he accused American NGOs of removing children for the express purpose of selling them to pedophilia and organ trafficking rings.

                          (Also.. The current debacle began with the revelation of sexual abuses by  Oxfam’s Country Director in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake devastated the island nation. The allegations eventually led to the expulsion and banning of Oxfam Great Britain from the country.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti

                          This is not the first time that a member of Oxfam would be swept up in a highly publicized sex abuse scandal. British press reports indicate that Caroline Thomas, who became Chair of Oxfam in 2016, previously served as an executive at BBC during the emergence of the Jimmy Saville pedophile revelations.
(I could go into a long thread about pedophile politicans like Cyril Smith, Edward Heath, Lord Brettan, Jimmy Saville was friends with the Royal Family and part of the P.I.E. network..maybe later)

                          Sarkozy’s intervention in the Zoe’s Ark debacle was echoed by Bill Clinton’s intercession in the Laura Silsby scandal. Silsby was caught in 2010 in the midst of an attempt to remove children – many of whom were revealed to have had living relatives-  from Haiti under the guise of  ‘charitable’ efforts with The New Life Children’s Refuge. Clinton was acting as the U.N.’s special envoy to Haiti at the time and his intervention in the Silsby incident was one of his first official acts after arriving in the country.

    Hasty deportations of unaccompanied Central American minors violate international children’s rights.The United Nation’s Convention on the Rights of the Child outlines these child-specific rights and legal protections for anyone under the age of eighteen. Further, the current position of Congress and the Obama administration – to overhaul the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and deny fair trials that recognize refugee, asylee and trafficking victim statuses – is unacceptable for a nation claiming to lead the global fight against trafficking in persons.

                           one of Monica's last messages that she sent to a friend..
"I can’t say to what extent, but there is human trafficking happening through the Clinton’s Caraol Complex. And mining has always been historically linked to trafficking, slavery, and labor exploitation. I’d like to go see for myself who’s laboring at Morne Bossa, but I would hypothesize that the Dominicans are doing the contractual oversight of the mining, while marginalized Haitians are being exploited for low or no cost labor in dangerous mining conditions.  That’s two huge human trafficking scandals, an environmental degradation scandal, a social displacement scandal, a Presidential election scandal, a scandal with billions in unaccounted for earthquake aid… all leading directly back to the Clintons racist cronyism in Haiti.”

(Clinton went to Paris in March 2011 to meet with Mahmoud Jibril the Libyan Rebel Leader.  1 month after Gaddafi had massacred 1000 civils in an uprising earlier that year, she also met with Sarkozy as well.  Where they probably planned the overthrow and assassination of Gaddafi.. (Gaddafi may probably escaped if his convoy hadnt been explosed by Drones and French Rafale Jetplanes..)

During late March, 2011 these stocks were moved to SABHA (south west in the direction of the Libyan border with Niger and Chad); taken from the vaults of the Libyan Central Bank in Tripoli.....valued at more than $7 billion. French intelligence officers discovered this plan shortly after the current rebellion began, and this was one of the factors that influenced President Nicolas Sarkozy's decision to commit France to the attack on Libya."

                            Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham, was a board member of a North Carolina mining company that enjoyed prime access to Haitian gold deposits in the wake of post-earthquake relief work organized in part by former president Bill Clinton through the Clinton Foundation.
Another board member of the firm, VCS Mining, was former Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, who co-chaired the charitable Interim Haiti Recovery Commission with Mr. Clinton.

                             Kouchner also showed great interest in serving in Haiti in a U.N. role. Shortly after the Silsby scandal, a 2011 email exchange between Hillary Clinton, Melanne Verveer(Previously, Verveer served as the Chair and Co-CEO of Vital Voices Global Partnership, which she co-founded with Hillary Clinton in 2001,She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission and the World Bank Advisory Council on Gender and Development)  and Cheryl Mills (remember she got immunity from FBI for the Clinton Email investigation under COMEY....) published by Wikileaks stated that Kouchner was “considering” a position as UN Special Representative to Haiti. The exchange reads, in part

                             I saw him at the memorial and he has expanded since that he's told Ban ki Moon he will take the job of UN Special Rep

                             for Haiti IF he can work on a common strategy and platform with you, your husband and Paul Farmer.
 He wants to meet with Prez C in NY and is willing to come to DC whenever suitable for you to discuss with you.
                            </p>

                             Kouchner and Farmer know each other well..

                             The role Kouchner considered in Haiti would have mirrored previous humanitarian service in Kosovo.
Kouchner is not only a prominent political figure with close ties to the Clintons and their associates; he has personally co-founded NGO’s and charitable organizations including Doctors Without Borders, again illustrating the blurred boundaries that are associated with humanitarian aid.

              Organ transplants: The gap between supply and demand

              "Research by the World Health Organisation (WHO) has found that only one in ten people in need of a new kidney, the body part most in demand, manages to get one. In the poorest places, of course, a complex transplant—which in the American health system costs $500,000—is unthinkable for most people anyway. But the gap between supply and demand for organs affects the poor too, by creating a market in body parts where abuses are rife."

              "The cross-border passage of criminal money is facilitated by the global shadow financial system comprising tax havens, secrecy jurisdictions, disguised corporations, anonymous trust accounts, fake foundations, trade mispricing, and money laundering techniques. This is precisely the same structure that enables the movement of the other two components of illicit proceeds—the corrupt and commercially tax evading money. We cannot succeed in curtailing part of these flows while at the same time facilitating other parts of these flows. "
"Across the Atlantic, in October 2010, 11 people were arrested for alleged organ trafficking between Syria and Egypt"
"In short, for the developing world, there are very few redemptive aspects to the illicit organ trade. Donors are paid next-to-nothing relative to the overall trade, while the huge profits of the middlemen disappear into the shadow economy, further promoting the self interest of criminals and others who would profit from poverty and state weakness. Also, the shortage of legitimate donor organs is not only a problem for developed nations. By making human organs available to the highest bidder, traffickers prevent the poor from having access to the organs that they too so desperately need."

              What you'll have to take into account is that there is also a lot of disinfo spread by Falun Gong (sp.?), a sect that is prosecuted in China. Imo they are behind outlets like 'TheEpochTimes', and sometimes I don't know whether they make things up about Chinese organ trafficking, or whether the info is legit.
             </p>
             <p>
              So difficult so discern what is legit, and what might be sensationalized, although I think there is really dark stuff going on in China. Never forget they are a dictatorship, not a democracy.

              On a side note, Jeff Bezos of Amazon is now running prisons in China where Muslims are sent for 're-education'.

               What do you know about Falun Gong (hadnt heard of them yet) Im asking because Qi Gong is essentially all over the Phoenix program and mind control (from original VC side, not the Nazi experiment side). Also related to telepathy and psy.  Well.. lots of woowoo stuff that doesnt need discussing here.  Im compiling on organ trafficking recently (essentially rearranging links to show increase of organ trafficking (some countries have over 3000 percent increases in organ failure traitements..  I might have to start looking into why... (studies saying obesity hypertension....)   Anyway.....  Qi Gong..very very important..What is Falun Gong?  They use Jainism symobology.

                What? I never heard about that - do you have links maybe? If so, that would be huge! I'm interested in any details about it that you may have! :-)
               </p>
               <p>
                The Wikipedia articles about Falun Gong are all written by its members it seems (lol), I will take some time today to find more unbiased info, and post it here.
               </p>
               <p>
                As I suspected, 'The Epoch Times' was founded by members of the Falun Gong movement in the US.

                 Although there are indeed no physical proofs (ie a selfie photo of a doctor as he's taking the heart from one identified victim for exemple....those sneaky bastreds.. :))  However there is enough circumstantial evidence and 'blocking techniques' put in place to safely assume that something happened.. and waiting lists for organs that count in weeks and days (2 weeks for a liver..) rather than months (compared to Canada where you've got 32-35 months..) do imply.. a steady supply...Although it also appears that they(chin. gov.) were using prisoners as chop suey...

            THE NAME RUSSELL AND SHANGHAI: The opium connection
This is the origin of the current NEW WORLD ORDER

           <p>
            "William H. Russell (Skull &amp;Bones co-founder-1833) cousin Samuel Russell formally established Russell &amp; Co. on January 1, 1824 for the purpose of acquiring opium and smuggling it to China. Russell &amp; Co. merged with the number one US trader, the J. &amp; T.H. Perkins "Boston Concern" in 1829. By the mid-1830s the opium trade had become "the largest commerce of its time in any single commodity, anywhere in the world." Russell &amp; Co. and the Scotch firm Jardine-Matheson, then the world's largest opium dealer working together were known as the "Combination." George HW Bush (S&amp;B 1948) was born in Milton, Massachusetts not far from the historic home of Robert Bennett Forbes, a Russell partner. Many great American, European and Chinese family fortunes were built on the "China"(opium) trade. Yes, they sold porcelain, tea, silks and other items at home in the US, but they "needed" the trade in opium for silver to pay for the desired goods and—opium smuggling returned "handsome" profits Opium smuggling didn’t just make money. At times, opium was money. Opium built empires and had a hand in financing much of the world’s infrastructure."
           </p>
           <p>
            "From Carl A Trocki’s excellent book, Opium, Empire and the Global Economy(1999):
           </p>
           <p>
            "The trade in such drugs usually results in some form of monopoly which not only centralizes the drug traffic, but also restructures much of the affiliated social and economic terrain in the process. In particular two major effects are the creation of mass markets and the generation of enormous, in fact unprecedented, cash flows. The existence of monopoly results in the concentrated accumulation of vast pools of wealth. The accumulations of wealth created by a succession of historic drug trades have been among the primary foundations of global capitalism and the modern nation-state itself. Indeed, it may be argued that the entire rise of the west, from 1500 to 1900, depended on a series of drug trades.""

             Great info thank you!  Looking forward to digging into the article and details.  A while back I had posted regarding Bush family and Nazi Germany, I looked it up and Samuel Russell is mentioned in there too.

            </a>
            A good overview of history and gruesome organ harvesting techniques of Communist China.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember Dr. Dobson talking about this in the '80's on his Focus on the Family radio show.
           </p>
           <p>
            And yes, DiFi and hubby Blum should be looked into regarding their China/Nepal/Tibet activities.
