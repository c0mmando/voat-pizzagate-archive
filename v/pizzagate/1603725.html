            Wow that sounds really interesting! I'm an aspiring writer myself, so I'd definitely be interested in reading anything you have written!
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I just realized the last two replies I've sent were both to you on two of my unrelated threads, which is kind of funny considering what your show is about.

            Yeah I agree it's really messed up how much entertainment revolves around that kind of stuff. I think certain examples of it are to enlighten, though, rather than to appeal to people's gross fascination with it.

            I couldn't agree more with the recent analysis going around of True Detective Season One. We live a multi-dimensional experience, and every so often these creations emerge from pop culture that seem to be speaking to both our physical and spiritual selves. Trying to wake us up... trying to shake us out of our complacency... The Matrix is one of the greatest examples of this. There are grand and divine truths in it, whether the Wachowski's intended it or not. Sometimes these creators are not consciously aware of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            As Twin Peaks was also referenced here, David Lynch has always held true to the idea that the source of his creatively is the unified field of shared consciousness - that our ideas are not always just own own, but pulled from the cosmos. There is natural spiritual understanding to this idea that I believe is also rooted in quantum physics and science.

             Beautifully said. I feel that unified field of consciousness is what will save this cruel world, and as long as we're in touch with it then we'll be ok.

            I wouldn't have believed it was so wide spread back then, only some offside churches in the south. For some reason seeing the weird podesta emails and the comet ping pong photos opened up my mind to see the big picture leading to everything else. This show could be a good redpill prep for people.

            I think this show is a great example of how there are people out there making art that is trying to get the message out about what is going on in the world. I know some people think that things like this are just the elite creating fear, signalling to each other, etc; but I definitely think painting an entire industry with a broad brush is a mistake, because there will always be individuals who, even if they get sucked into the system, will try to rebel, and, historically, subversive art intended to illuminate the masses has always existed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also think the show Twin Peaks did this exact same thing over twenty years ago, and that the show is full of important societal and spiritual information.

             Question:
            </p>
            <p>
             How can we ask actors like mcconghey who were in this show if they had discussions with the writers, producers, etc about the symbols and what they meant as if to say they were trying to warn... or if they were "boasting in plain sight" when there are too fucking many instances where people say the Hollywood pedo ring is so big, yet we have never once heard of anyone other than, say, Cory Feldman and smaller actors coming out against it.
            </p>
            <p>
             If true blood (and notice they talk about "true blood" as if to reference "pure/virgin/child blood") as the PG scandal alleges) was really against RSU, then there should be some more blatant efforts to expose...
            </p>
            <p>
             Unless this is bragging - or they are fucking scared, and must be subtle... but how to confirm?

              I'm not sure, good question. My guess would be they don't talk openly about it because they know the danger, so they only communicate this stuff through their art.
             </p>
             <p>
              In my opinion, there are actually both light and dark forces working in secrecy; the dark keep their practices secret because they use it to profit off of an unsuspecting public, while the light keep their practices secret because they are outnumbered and face death if they go public. I believe there are a lot of Gnostics out there making art, some good and some bad. People like to accuse all Gnostics of being satanic but if you actually look at the texts they study, it explicitly says not to use hidden information for your own gain, but for personal and worldwide liberation from tyranny.

             <p>
              So the ones who use occult practices to get rich and promote consumerism are in the majority, while the others use more love-centered practices to educate themselves and try to help people. This is the situation now, and this was the situation in ancient Rome when the Catholic church was secretly doing dark rituals while they murdered true Christian Gnostics for trying to spread this information.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, while I understand why people have a negative reaction to seeing occult symbolism in art and assume its there for programming and manipulation, I think it is dangerous to do this in every case. The PTB want us to react out of fear to anything influenced by Gnosticism so that we will never learn how to free ourselves. If enough people read this I'm sure someone will call me satanic for speaking positively about Gnosis, but I really think it's what we need to both know our enemy and free the world from their grasp.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, ranting aside, I think there is no way to confirm which is positive and which is negative except to trust yourself and be able to recognize something you know in your core vs a kneejerk reaction that has been instilled in you by society.
             </p>
             <p>
              EDIT: And I think the most important thing is to not allow fear to control your actions. The dark occult rituals are supposed to make us scared, but as we know, fear is the mind-killer, so don't be afraid of something just because other people tell you it is satanic, mind control, etc; think for yourself.

               True... original Gnostics were about as un-satanic as it gets. Gnostic Christianity is the closest description I can think of to what Jesus was teaching, before it was co-opted by groups that came along later.
