            Yes the vote was rigged for Jones but Moore is such a scumbag no one of any official importance with legal authority is going to expose this fraud to put Roy Moore in the Senate it won't happen. Moore is a religious fanatic a crazed Christian so forget about him liking teenage girls that's normal nothing wrong with it but he thinks homosexuality should be outlawed and he thinks Muslims should all be put in prison camps. He was the wrong candidate to nominate if they had run a normal Republican he would have won or he'd be a good guy to use to expose the rigged Democrat voting machines. You have to choose your battles and fighting to overturn this crooked election to put Moore in the Senate is not worth fighting for.

             Glad you saw something in it. My posts of late have been getting a lot of shit. I am absolutely open to the idea of Trump and Republicans being corrupt, however the evidence I see in front of me points to Trump trying to take down the pedo elite - or at least some proportion of them - so that's what Im gonna post.
            </p>
            <p>
             As soon as any Republican steps out of line, any many of them have, you'll hear it from me.

            Could it possibly be that since Alabama just had a Republican Govenor have to step down because of a proven affair (his wife made recordings) and financial benefits given to the woman he was having the affair with, that Alabama voters have a bad taste in their mouth for Republicans who are hypocritical and enough got motivated to go to the polls and vote against Moore and any more scandal.

             Then-First Lady Dianne Bentley, suspicious that her husband, Governor Robert Bentley, was having an affair with his senior advisor, Rebekah Mason, on multiple occasions pressed “record” on her cell phone, left the room, and captured the governor having intimate conversations with his mistress.  Included in those recordings, which were obtained by Yellowhammer News, is overwhelming evidence that Governor Bentley and Mrs. Mason had an intense emotional and — based on their discussion of past events — physical relationship with each other.

            First we blame machines for democrats losing, now we blame machines for democrats winning. Hanging chads. hackability. stuffing ballots. It would probably be easier to vote online with a unique user code to verify citizenship. Then again the government would royally fuck that shit up in about 2 seconds. The fed is retarded and bloated.

            Interesting article claiming felon votes (many who only registered to vote in last couple of weeks - similar shenanigans with Al Franken's election victory) but not military absentee votes were counted. Also African Americans in Mississippi were allegedly encouraged to cross the state line to vote illegally. Some commenters talk about ineligible voters bring bussed around to different polling stations (as alluded to in Project Veritas DNC expose)

             Think it could have anything to do with the fact the Republican candidate liked to date HS girls?

             What you are talking describing is all about turnout.   First off you can't compare the numbers to the presidential year.  You have to compare to an off year election.  Secondly, Alabama Democrats were motivated to come out than they have been in years.   They knew they had a real shot to win this and had a good candidate.  They turned out.  The Republicans had a bad candidate, they did not turn out.   Look at all the write in votes.  Those are Republicans who didn't want to vote for Moore.  Lots of Republicans just stayed home.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not only was a Moore a bad candidate, he was invisible in the last week.   People were saying he might not even be in the State.   He didn't wanted to answer any pedophile questions so he was avoiding the press.  The Republican Senator from Alabama came out and said he was not voting for Moore.   Obama did a get out the vote robocall for Doug Jones.   Jones got more votes than Obama did.  Why?   Democrats in Alabama knew their state was going Republican anyway.

               If you were mailing your ballot and voting for Moore or Jones, you could just pick Moore or Jones, you don't have to write them in.

               There were reports in press of write in campaigns, for Republicans would wouldn't vote for Jones, but couldn't vote for Moore.  How many votes do you think Nick Saban will get?

              Elvis dated a 14 year old Priscilla in 1959 and married her at 22 in 1967.  Jerri Lee Lewis married his 13 year old cousin in 1958.  If Moore dated older teens with their parents' permission with the goal of finding a spouse, it was not considered out of the norm for those times forty years ago. Plus the young women were of legal age and marriage immediately out of high school was common.

              Local reporters reported record turnouts.  Republican votes were supposedly less than half of those that previously voted for Sessions or for Trump in prior elections.  Democrat numbers for Jones were less than those cast for Hillary.  Where are the missing votes?

               Which are giant numbers in an off year election.  You seem to be comparing a record turnout in an off year election to turnout in the Presidential election.

                But more than 1.3 million of Alabama's 3.3 million voters participated for a turnout of 40.4 percent, according to unofficial results from Merrill's office.

               Missing voters?   Democrats turned out like it was a presidential year and Republicans did not.   They stayed home because they didn't like their candidate.  23,000 folks wrote in someone else.  In fact, it looks like some educated Republican voted for Jones.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Over all, there was a clear relationship between the change in a county’s turnout and its educational composition. 
In Alabama’s two best-educated counties — Madison County and predominantly white Shelby County — turnout surged 30 percent above 2014 levels. These are two Republican-leaning counties, which would seem to suggest that Mr. Jones was winning and turning out Republican-leaning voters, not just benefiting from low G.O.P. turnout or high Democratic turnout.
                <br/>
                <strong>
                 Mr. Jones won 18 percent more raw votes in Shelby County than Hillary Clinton did in 2016, and it is not plausible to suggest that he did so by tapping into Democratic voters who didn’t turn out in the much-higher-turnout presidential race.
                </strong>
                The pattern repeated itself across well-educated metropolitan areas and enclaves, including college towns like Auburn and Tuscaloosa.
               </p>
               <p>
                There was no such turnout surge in white, working-class Alabama. In fact, turnout was lower than it was in 2014 in many of Alabama’s mostly white, working-class counties. In Alabama’s least-educated, predominantly white counties, the turnout was often far lower than it was in 2014. In Fayette County, where just 13 percent of voters have a college degree, turnout landed at just 69 percent of 2014 levels.

              You know, I really don't follow Q, so I don't keep a running list. There was one ridiculous claim about arrests and martial law being imposed. First it was one date and then he moved it back to the holidays ... maybe around Thanksgiving? I believe that's the case because Liz Crokin and others were going crazy and saying that it would be easier to arrest Hillary and declare martial law around the holidays. Some whacked out YouTuber even tied in troops arriving with it being true, but they were there to put on a show or demonstration.
             </p>
             <p>
              There was a time before that ... think in October. It might have been another promise of arrests. It was the first time I'd heard of Q and whatever was promised didn't materialize. Then he started with Hefner being the white rabbit and I was like, this guy is making this up on the fly.

              Anybody is that tries to persuade pizzagaters to trust deep state Freemasons is not doing pizzagate any favors. Pizzagate is the largest independent elite pedophile hunting organization on the planet. Mixing it with trusting the deep state freemasons will pollute the movement.

             You're absolutely correct. Who's to say that not Republicans were involved in the rigging process? After all, and I repeat this a lot, but Trump said he only likes 30-40% of Republicans in total.

              Not a chance bro. Have you seen this Zionist shill nonsense? The deep state are now the good guys. Pizzagate is being bleached by zionists and naive gullible people.

              It makes me want to ban the cult of trump from pizzagate for life. The Republican zionist deep state are now the good guys. Pizzagate is dead on arrival if this continues. Soros is probably the head warlock for New York now that Rockefeller croaked. I will believe he is taken out when I see him wearing orange. These fucking trumpers are killing pizzagate.

                The deep state is the unseen (to the public) controlling force in our country. This force is the collective power of occult Freemasonry and the misunderstood financial networks that rob our country and keep Americans hoodwinked. Sometimes referred to as the Military Industrial Complex. Both parties are included in the hoodwink which makes them both participants and facilitators of the deep state machine.
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                Somebody that posted an op said that "there is an intrinsic link between Q and pizzagate" and I totally reject that definition of an anon from an image board asking questions. If Q  is what people think he is that means this person is an organ of the state. The state is controlled by the deep state.
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                Looking to an anonymous member (maybe) of the state for guidance and something that seems to be bleeding into leadership goes directly against what the pizzagate movement was founded on. Pizzagate became a movement because it rejected the state and it will die if it trusts and accepts the state. This is fundamental because trusting an organization of Freemasons and giving the Freemasons a chance to co-opt our movement is not an acceptable option for the survival of pizzagate.
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                Our newest members cannot be trained to do something that the founders of our movement strictly refused to do, which is to trust deep state Freemasons. If we lead our new members down that path our elite unit of pedophile hunters will die before it is two years old.
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                We are the largest, most effective, most skilled, and decentralized group of pedophile hunters on the planet right now. Being lured into a situation for us to be co-opted is not acceptable.

            Very interesting perspective. I like the sound of this. I am neither a Republican or Democrat and didnt wan't Roy Moore to win anyway. I thought it would be dumb of the Republicans to allow such a burden to their agenda at this time. Definitely gonna keep up with this one.

           <p>
            For more than 50 years now, Americans have been voting on "hack-able" electronic computers
-- voting computer came in about 1967 ... large computers used by MSM about 1965 --
which immediately began delivering very odd and unbelievable right wing results.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sununu seems to have taken the lead in restoring GHW Bush to an acceptable number 
of votes in the primaries to keep him in the game.
At that time it was done over telephone lines.
           </p>
           <p>
            So -- 50 years of rigged elections for the right wing.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's the only way the right wing can rise to power ...
           </p>
           <p>
            It's being said now that the computers can be controlled even from satellites at this point.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, for decades now the Koch Bros./John Birch Society and other large corporations
have also controlled the Democratic Party via the DLC funded by Elites.
For decades now the DP has been controlled by the right wing ...
           </p>
           <p>
            That further explains why we barely see even a handful of Dems speaking out for
democracy and liberal values.
           </p>
           <p>
            It also explains the Bernie Sanders' primary stolen by Hillary Clinton.
The nation supported Bernie Sanders campaign -- this is a liberal nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again -- BOTH national parties are controlled by the right wing destroyers ...
moving us to New World Order/Globalism.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was never a "Southern Strategy" -- there was only ever Hack-able Computers ... for 50 years now.

              If you mean Clinton family you're bark up the wrong political tree.
Wake up to the reality that BOTH national parties are owned by the right wing.
Unless you consider Koch Bros./John Birch Society and large corporations to be liberals.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is the right wing which will murder to destroy democracy, liberty -- preferring enslavement of all.

             <p>

                 The rest of us normal folks, who know that political incorrectness never hurt anybody, know all about the Bolshevik purges and the Killing Fields in Cambodia and the Great Leap Forward in China and the Holodomor and the death camps of the National Socialists and the other mass murders that invariably accompany any leftists' rise to power.  The rest of us don't need 'proof' provided to us, when we can literally find out all about it ourselves, with a few clicks and taps.

                  OK -- so you think Stalin evidently was a "liberal" ... ???
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Stalin ran a dictatorship -- not a democracy.

                 <p>
                  Pol Pot and the Khymer Rouge ... you also think was a "liberal" movement?
Also add in CIA/Nixon involvement (right wing) -- Here's a search page on it ...

                 <p>
                  Unless you somehow think that the CIA is "liberal"?
Or that the Nixon administration was liberal?
Watergate also involved prostitution and pedophilia according to NYPD.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And, you also think that China was a liberal nation?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Would take a thorough brainwashing to have anyone think that Russia or China
were left wing countries!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "Socialist" in any title is NOT a sign that there is "liberal" thinking or policies.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For instance ...
Hitler took over what was once a LIBERAL organization -- the NAZI party.
That party at that time was liberal and supported issues such as Unionization, Labor,
Health Care for Citizens, and other socially responsible programs.
After Hitler took over the party, it's goals were turned upside down.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And, please note, NO ONE anywhere has actually ever practiced communism.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And there is a very strong rumor that the US actually invented Communism.
Not much I can report on that yet -- but PLEASE note that the Vatican does seem to have
created Islam.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It would have been impossible for Capitalism to exist without an "enemy."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And same for "Christianity" ... there must always be FEAR -- there must always be an enemy.

              You have only to look at the Bernie Sanders primary to know this is a liberal nation.

             <p>
              However, Elites have always run their own polls not necessary disclosed to citizenry ..
and what it has always showed them is that they had to control all media -- any bit of
truth that gets out destroys their myths -- shatters them like a stone hitting a mirror.
             </p>
             <p>
              And that's what they've had to do.
Also see:  Operation Mockingbird a more organized and overt disclosure of their work run by CIA.

             <p>
              Political scientists?  You mean people who get paid by Elites?

            The comments in this are an interesting read. Without question, the left is becoming more and more afraid and we are seeing huge evidence of that today.
It is worth pointing out that the theory of Jones winning so the democrats misdeeds can be exposed exactly fits the pattern of how our President plays this game of chess. If I am right, we are going to see some powerful evidence of that. Here's hoping!

            This is how they get around stuff. There are articles denying that Soros owns voting machines but here is how they skirt the issue:  The chairman of Smartmatic is Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, who sits in the British House of Lords and on the board of George Soros’s Open Society Foundations. He was formerly the vice-chairman of Soros’s Investment Funds and even the deputy secretary-general of the United Nations when he worked as chief of staff to Kofi Annan.

            Election Fraud can be committed with software that is inside the Early Voting Machines.  They can be controlled from the parking lot just outside the Polling Place.  I have researched this quite a bit.  Check out Clint Curtis video.  He went to Jail:

            AND here is a vid that my friend sent me last year that explains how votes can be switched later on.  If you think this is a boring subject this will make it somewhat funny.  It is My Favorite on Election Fraud.

              This should Set Off Alarms.  This is a def sign something fishy is going on and a sign that there was probably Election Fraud.  I was  an Election Judge for 10 years, was a Poll Watcher and  have witnessed a couple of audits.  "By granting the stay, the court effectively told the state that it does not in fact have to preserve the digital ballot images - essentially digitized versions of the paper ballots voters fill out at the voting booth - created today."  IMO, THIS REEKS TO HIGH HEAVEN.  All Voters should Be Up In Arms!  This will set the pace for Future Elections.

              Thank You!  This has been a personal interest of mine for quite some time.  Last year really Woke Me Up even after years of suspecting what was going on.  I did not realize How Deep it really went.  I am always ready to pass it one.  Election Fraud is what is committed by the Govt.   Voter Fraud is what is committed by the Public

                As well that I appreciate you.  I am grateful for all the people do on here, no matter how little or much time they spend.  We are all here to fill a need.  We are both here about the same time, 1 yr.  Amazing.

               If nothing happens, what do you think the odds are that Roy Moore's accusers will keep on? I say that story is over on their part.

                Yes, my husband and I have discussed this.  He thinks there are too many to it must be true....but he does not read and see what I do, which causes much desperation.  I am waiting to see. what will happen.  I am guessing they would have to continue or it will make all their accusations a lie.  I really believe something is very strange about their stories, especially with all the researching we have done on Gloria Allred.

               The one that woke me up was the hanging chad deal in Florida in the 2000 election. Of course it was in Jeb's state. So yes, I believe in can occur with either party.

            The cult of Trump is NOT redpilling anybody or training young new pizzagaters for the future. In order for pizzagate to survive it has to have young new members to continue it's future. The cult of Trump is training our new members to be Republican cheerleaders.

             Republican party is full of blackmailed pedos too.

            All these politicians are

               Amazing,  love it.  I just wanted to personally thank you for the work you are putting in here.  I have been following your comment history and I support you 100%.  It drives me crazy sometimes seeing the collective Right vs Left thought process as it relates to Pizzagate.  Folks!  Please wake the Eff up! This is not about Repubs vs Democrats,  it is the State vs Us!  WAKE UP!!!

              Great. That is cool. I like it. It won't get the pedophile cult jailed though. Freemasons are not allowed to harm one another. Until the public learns why D.C. is allowed to operate with impunity in both parties shit will not change. Fuck politics. The public has to be trained in the facts. Pizzagate is only a thing because people were smart enough to tell both parties to fuck off.

               Only way that anyone would ever remotely go to jail is to have a champion that is in the presidency heading executive branch. So happens the current president is very much hated (100%) by Democrats and mostly hated by Republicans (60%).

               This is going to be as far outside the two party system you're ever going to be able to hope for in your life time. He's all you realistically have whether you like it or not because you can amass all the Pizzagate evidence in the universe but unless you have someone wielding the ultimate police power in the country that might be disposed to pay any attention to it, it won't matter jack shit.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you don't accept that simple reality and work within it, then you're not aiming to really achieve anything about Pizzagate crimes.

                I hope he does if he is strong enough, but if he is strong enough he can do it without us. We don't have to redpill the public so that our government can act, we redpill the public because they refuse to act. Why waste our time, and train our team, to cheer for somebody that will probably not do anything about it anyway? If he fails we still have the redpill team. If we train people to cheer for him then that is what they will learn to do, and if he fails we lost the skills of the team. Makes no sense to screw up the team.

                I understand and I like Trump. My main point is why ruin pizzagate by teaching new pizzagaters who are just learning the ropes to do something the founders of pizzagate would cuss people out for doing? Anybody that even suggested trusting the deep state was called a shill and told to GTFO because it is the deep state we fight.
               </p>
               <p>
                Why screw up a good movement by stopping posting strictly about pedophilia, and polluting the movement with a bunch of political commentary? People change with time and if people start following and trusting freemasonic political parties that is what this pedophile hunting orgainization will turn into. A group of republican cheerleaders that promote trust in a political parties that think they are pedo hunters.
               </p>
               <p>
                Makes no sense. Let the political parties do their thing. They will anyway. Why let them infiltrate and co opt pizzagate?

               This is a serious question. Is it possible for someone who was once a Freemason to decide on his own that he no longer wants to be part of it, lIke a former atheist turining to Christ? Could Trump have found God and turned away from his former faith like the apostle Paul?

                We would be looking at a turn around that would involve the entire globe because this pedophile blackmail ring is global and protected by NATO. People at this level never get to fully walk away most likely because they are spied on for the rest of their lives once they hit a certain stage.
               </p>
               <p>
                Most importantly we should not be training new young pizzagaters to follow and look to the deep state Freemasons for training, help, and guidance. It would spell the end of the movement. Pizzagate is the most elite unit on the planet for outing pedophiles. It grew because it was decentralized and nobody could co-opt it. Now after just one year people are being tempted to follow the Freemasons (even though they don't realize it) and if this continues it will be the end of a free and independent group of elite pedophile hunters.

                I'm glad Trump is president because he does not push Marxist Socialism which is what we would have had with Hillary, the social justice warriors, vagina hats, and hating all white men. Israel is the Zionist capital of the world. There are many Talmudists in the Israeli government and population. These people despise the teachings of jesus because the teachings of Jesus are a blueprint for freedom. Zionists do not believe in freedom for all.
               </p>
               <p>
                The long range goal is to have the spiritual capital of the world be in Jerusalem. Jerusalem is perhaps the most holy place in Christianity because of it's ties to Jesus. Jerusalem was given to the Israelis as their capitol city. Considering that they despise Jesus this was an anti-christian move.
               </p>
               <p>
                The long range goal is to mix Christianity with Judaism which is happening now as Judeo-Christianity, which really like oil and water. Someday they envision Christians worshipping "God's Chosen People" as God's on earth.
               </p>
               <p>
                Our government, including Republicans, are in support of this move in Israel and the Zionist Democrats are tickled with this decision. My take is that Trump is probably not a serious Christian.

                 I have wondered about him. I hope he is just a new Christian who will grow in faith and boldly - like Paul- confess his sins... even the Freemason ones. Have you looked into the Trump Prophecy? I think that is where my hope comes from, but I do agree that there are no parties anymore only evil vs righteousness. What do you think of Trey Gowdy?

                  On the surface he seems like a good guy. Like everybody D.C. he can only do what he is allowed to do by the shadow government. What we see is a show for our consumption. They never let the news media broadcast things they do not want us to hear. D.C. runs on fuel and that fuel is a treasure box of pedophilia blackmail material in both parties. This makes it almost impssible to tear down because it would bring down our government as we know it. Nobody in D.C. wants to see the party end because they would have to quit stealing taxpayer money and actually get a real job. And about 70% of them would be in jail.

               The ONLY WAY TO REDPILL IS THE J.Q. because in addition to the advantage of being the truth every human instinctively understands that other tribes may attack them as a matter of course.  The sodomy-magic is frankly superfluous and to be mentioned with care.

                That is why you are the person that carries the message that has ALWAYS been mired in religious squabbling and always will. Zionists use the "oy vey" plot as a shield. You carry their shield nicely too. You are better than a jew shill and they love you. People like you will always keep pizzagate fucked up which is why serious people don't follow you. In case you didn't notice.

                  capitulation to their narrative even for strategic reasons is the exact opposite of truth/victory and in any case YOU ARE THE COWARD which is why you won't deny the Holohoax, which as a monumental historical event is an instant redpill.

             We ran outta popcorn a long time ago in my world.  The word on 8chan (seen here:
             <a href="https://8ch.net/cbts/catalog.html">
              https://8ch.net/cbts/catalog.html)
             </a>
             ) is that this was intentional to expose the theft of elections by those so desperate to retain control and, thus, continue to keep the shocking facts of Pizzagate, etc concealed.  Lotsa great research being done over on 8chan, and they are doing a great job keeping the shills that over ran the threads at half Chan out of there. I have been posting research they are and I encourage others to do the same. Some of it I will cross over back here. Bottom line. Keep up the good work, lads!  These criminal abusers must be stopped, once and for all.

                 Ah, reductio ad absurdum, the approach of the media. No, I believe that Trump isn't part of the deep state - or at least not with the same people as Hilary - and I think that Q has been right on enough occasions to constitute a reliable source. But I guess only time will tell, and you can continue to freak out over the death of PizzaGate if you want, but after 20 years I would expect a little more determination.

                  I am determined to impress upon people not to succomb to the virus of trusting a political party. Its not a freak out. Its commonsense and how pizzagate became a movement.

                    My rule is not to trust my fate to Freemasons. I can make bank on that all day. There is no reason to dilute the pizzagate movement with Freemasonic noise. Pizzagate is the only elite pedophile outing independent movement on the planet. Polluting it by training new members to follow the lead of Freemasons makes no sense to me.

                      I really don't care about Q being a larp or not. I care about keeping pizzagate seperate from a deep state freemasonic party. Its important.

                You distance yourself from us. It's like you're not part of us and won't be ever. Very convenient that you make an account and your first comment is aimed at pushing us backwards. Yeah, I believe that you've been with us from the start, I may as well take your word for it considering how much credibility you've just showed me!

                  I have no allegiance to either party - I'm not even from the states and it has no impact on my lifestyle or pride. That being said, Trump has done a lot to try and subtly redpill the masses and I have seen it on his Twitter and whatnot. Do you not remember him tweeting out
                 </p>
                 <pre><code>&gt;Why did Obama doing spend $65,000 of the taxpayer's money on hotdogs and pizza?

                 <p>
                  He's also recently been harassing Podesta over twitter and alluding to the emails and PG, making John flip the fuck out.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It also wasn't long ago that he retweeted several articles from a website named MAGA Pill, and one of those articles contained the information leaked by Q.

                  trust the government, but Trump has showed us that he is a different breed over and over. I just can't ignore it. And as for Q, well, if you really care about the truth you can have

              On some days I almost want to give up trying to save pizzagate from the Republican Cult but I persist. If you guys do not learn how Freemasons are obligated to operate you will destroy pizzagate. Its already happening. What do you not understand about the fact that Freemasons are not allowed to harm one another? Read the following link and think about it. This is the sort of stuff that makes me get sick and tired of The God Known As Q. This is the most bizarre shit I have ever seen in pizzagate.

                Me too. At least the Republican's are not a hive of SJW's. But I never forget that the Republican party is a Zionist party and the Zionists control the pedo blackmail racket and practically invented it. This seems to stress some people's cognitive dissonance to the max but to ignore this fact is pizzagate suicide.

                Pizzagate is only a thing because pizzagaters told both parties to fuck off and changing that stance is suicide.

            Fraid I don't know much about voting machines, but I know enough: they were made by a pair of Jewish brothers named Urosevich from Omaha.  That fact alone is the "enough."

             DomKeyhote interesting you should mention the Urosevich brothers.  They are actually fundamentalist Christians of the Christian Reconstructionism persuasion (largely post millenialists).  They are Republican and and many think they helped Bush get elected.

               Well apparently you didn't know that the brothers supported George Bush in the election that he stole.

               Jesus was a Jew BTW.  Capital letters and name calling just prove that you can't support your claims with anything other than online bullying

                Pay attention woman to see the folly of your womanly thinking:

               <ol>
                <li>
                 Bush family is like all these elite families either crypto-Jewish or white/Christian cabalists, it makes no difference.
                </li>
                <li>
                 Jesus and the other prophets being Jews doesn't mean anything. I'm not a Christian so appealing to my sympathies wont work.  God never needed to impregnate a woman to send messengers, so that's just dumb imo.
                </li>
                <li>
                 Caps is like shouting and you wouldn't claim shouting discredits a message.

                 PROMINENT ARMENIAN-AMERICANS ARE IN FACT HEAVILY IMPLICATED IN PIZZAGATE -- for example if MORMONISM IS A FREEMASONIC CULT SO IS RECONSTRUCTIONISM PROBABLY.  OR NOT, DOESNT MATTER.
                </li>
                <li>
                 Theocracy would be great.  You're just brainwashed by kikes to think e.g. abortion is a privacy right when it's clearly murder.
                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                Lots of evil people of all races willing to join pedophilic cults.  It just so happens that the cult and many global institutions are run by Jews.  Ask the Jews to leave and it stops.  It's really that simple.
