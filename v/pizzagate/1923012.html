<p><strong>THE CLINTONS</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THE LIBRA GROUP</strong></p>
<p>Greek shipping magnate Michael Logothetis has four sons, George, Constantine, Nicholas, and Leon. Michael started <a href="http://archive.is/QGpHt">Lomar Shipping</a> in 1976. George joined Lomar in 1993, and in 1995 he became Lomar\'s CEO. In 2003, George founded <a href="http://archive.is/vdJkT">Libra Group</a>. His brother Constantine is Executive Vice Chairman, and his father Michael is senior advisor. According to <a href="http://archive.is/VTIKW">their website</a>, the Libra Group is a privately-owned international business group that controls 30 subsidiaries active in 35 countries across six continents. It is focused on six core sectors: <strong>aviation leasing</strong>, energy, financial services and <strong>diversified investments</strong>, hotels and hospitality, real estate, and <strong>shipping</strong>. You can find a list of all of their subsidiaries <a href="http://archive.is/dVG05">here</a>. BBC wrote an <a href="http://archive.is/YZLqf">article</a> about the family and the transition from Lomar to Libra. <a href="http://archive.is/Ss0Ev">George Logothetis is on the Board of Directors</a> for Obama\'s <a href="https://www.mbkalliance.org">My Brother\'s Keeper</a>, which &quot;expands opportunities for boys and young men of color.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Nick and George Logothetis are mentioned multiple times in Wikileaks. According to the emails, they contributed heavily to the Clinton campaign and had meetings with various campaign officials, including John Podesta.</p>

<p>This 2006 PLUSD telegram from Nigeria Abuja to the CIA says George Logothetis owns a company called Bionica Technologies, based in Lagos, Nigeria. The telegram states that multiple attempts were made to constant Bionica with no success. I don\'t understand the telegram fully, so if someone could shed some light on it, that would be great: <a href="http://archive.is/KHpez">https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06ABUJA2262_a.html</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://archive.is/C525m">website for Bionica Technologies</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BIONICA specializes in integration of high-tech innovations including non-intrusive inspection technology, ICT infrastructure platform systems, surveillance and intelligence monitoring systems.
BIONICA provides services and solutions to government agencies, military establishments, airports, seaports, embassies, banks, power stations and major corporate organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CONCORDIA</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, Nicholas Logothetis and Matthew Swift (who <a href="http://archive.is/yjWTS">graduated from Georgetown University</a>) formed <a href="http://archive.is/7lept">Concordia</a>, which hosts an annual international summit (similar to the Bilderberg conference) and &quot;promotes effective public-private collaboration to create a more prosperous and sustainable future.&quot; <a href="http://archive.is/9qyqR">Stratfor was invited to attend one of these summits in Wikileaks.</a> Previous attendees include Bill Clinton, George Bush, Joe Biden, David Silas (CEO of the Obama Foundation), <strong>Frank Giustra</strong>, José Manuel Barroso (a non-executive chairman from Goldman Sachs), and many other prominent politicians. Concordia is partnered with Penn Biden Center, founded by Joe Biden, and the Radcliffe Foundation, founded by Frank Giustra (who also founded Lions Gate Entertainment). <a href="http://uploads.concordia.net/2017/06/05021601/2017-Concordia-Europe-Summit-in-Athens_6.5.2017.pdf">Here is a PDF from the recent Europe Summit, held June 6-7, 2017 in Athens, Greece</a> (use caution when opening PDFs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FRANK GIUSTRA</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/PC8vr">Frank Giustra</a> has donated literally millions to the Clintons:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/evWSU">Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/DI2lQ">The Clintons, a luxury jet and their $100 million donor from Canada</a></p>
<p>He\'s also partnered with them to form the <a href="http://archive.is/Teo4t">Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the Radcliffe Foundation was founded by Guistra. From the <a href="http://archive.is/MjKUS">foundation\'s website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Radcliffe Foundation works with the International Rescue Committee, the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, the International Crisis Group, Streetohome, and other partners to support international causes ranging from the refugee crisis and poverty alleviation in the developing world to local issues such as homelessness and mentoring at-risk youth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THE RADCLIFFE-LIBRA CONNECTION</strong></p>
<p>The Libra Group works closely with Greek refugees through their <a href="http://archive.is/w62Cs">HOME Project</a>. At the Concordia Summit that just concluded, Libra and the Radcliffe foundation (along with IKEA and Coca Cola) announced the <a href="http://archive.is/GuZIH">Ascend Initiative</a>, which will provide &quot;humane shelter for displaced people with a focus on <strong>unaccompanied minors</strong>, community programming including provision of food, medical care, <strong>psycho-social services</strong>, and vocational training for refugees and Greeks struggling with the ongoing economic crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BUT WAIT...</strong></p>
<p>Giustra\'s Radcliffe Foundation is the parent company of <a href="http://archive.is/vMrIY">Elpida</a>, a home for Greek refugees, where a <a href="http://archive.is/qhk9M">Voater found the Boy Lover symbol</a> (<a href="http://archive.is/DRg0z">archived image from post</a>) that was changed (just like Besta Pizza and Terrasol changed theirs) <a href="http://archive.is/PAdKA">2 days after being discovered</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>FINAL REMARKS/QUESTIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jerry Sandusky (Second Mile), Larry King of the Franklin cover-up (Boys Town), and Jimmy Savile (Open charities)  all utilized their &quot;charities&quot; to have access to a constant supply of children, to both abuse and pimp out to other abusers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could Giustra be using his various charities for access to unaccompanied minor refugees?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could Libra be providing the shipping and/or money laundering services?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="http://archive.is/6zwZ2">State Department document</a> released in 2009 (while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State) regarding human trafficking in Greece says &quot;the number of dedicated police officers focusing on human trafficking continued to decline due to severe budgetary constraints stemming from Greece’s financial crisis.&quot; This is just one example of how continuing the financial chaos in Greece could work in the favor of human traffickers. Considering the role they\'ve played so far in Greece\'s financial crisis, could the Clintons be attempting to continue the crisis to continue in order to ensure a continuous flow of easy trafficking victims?</p>
</li>
</ul>

             released in 2009 (while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State) regarding human trafficking in Greece says "the number of dedicated police officers focusing on human trafficking continued to decline due to severe budgetary constraints stemming from Greece’s financial crisis." This is just one example of how continuing the financial chaos in Greece could work in the favor of human traffickers. Considering the role they've played so far in Greece's financial crisis, could the Clintons be attempting to continue the crisis to continue in order to ensure a continuous flow of easy trafficking victims?

            Frank Guistra or Giustra has his hand in all kinds of nefarious activity involving "charities". What kind of man who is so busy with his businesses and his own two kids goes out of his way to "volunteer" with underprivileged boys on a regular basis going to hockey games and hanging out with them "mentoring" them? It's just too suspicious, especially the pedofile logo on his Elpida (el pedo) boy lover charity where he's pictured proudly in front of the logo smiling thumbs up then mysteriously changes the logo overnight when it's called out. NO COINCIDENCE. He's a Freemason and hell bent on globalism and destruction of societies. Check out his Loins Gate movies for instance.

            J&amp;T Podesta and the Paule Carres cousins inherited a property in Greece. I don't much about this but it was in the emails, so there is definitely a Greek geographical and family connection with them.  Great post!

            Great research!  I would say whenever the Clintons are involved in anything, it is for nefarious reasons. I can definitely see them creating chaos in Greece in order to take advantage of it.  Haiti was a naturally occurring chaos in which  they could find benefit.
            <br/>
            But what do they do when there are no naturally occurring ones?  They create them!

             Warren Flood - a character in the George Webb saga - related to the Awans acquiring low-lying land in Pakistan and then flooding it to get disaster relief dollars - is thought to be a CIA made-up fictional character - a play on the words "WAR and FLOOD"

             Reality Winner, George suggests, is another made up character - Geo reports rumors that there was an audition process to select the best "actress" for the part.

              I always found it kind of strange that both Laura Silsby and Bill Clinton were in Haiti shortly before the earthquake happened, and then two weeks after it hit, Silsby and her team were down there ready to get kids for their "orphanage". Idk, maybe it's just me.

               Kissinger is normally the harbinger of war.  A visit from Biden always looked like bad luck.  Once you hit on the technique of causing a war for profit, some people will look around for similar play-books.   Create a virus to sell a vaccine.  Create a hurricane to cause a fresh supply of blood and body parts and sex slaves and desperate drug dealing youth.

               David Icke has been pushing his Problem - Reaction - Solution Theory, but I am beginning to see problem - reaction - profit as the MO.

                Good point, but I think it's probably a mix of the two; Problem - Reaction - "Solution" that doesn't actually fix anything - Profit as long as the problem continues. This leads into all of the "fight human trafficking" charity fronts these people have (like Thorn, for example) that actually just help it continue.

              "president of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that the U.S.’s High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP) was responsible for the devastating floods in Pakistan"

             Whenever I post, I try to play devil's advocate and debunk whatever it is that I'm posting to make sure that it holds up. When I did that for this post, I considered the idea that all of the parties involved (the Clintons, Libra, and Giustra) were acting morally and legally. Then I remembered the Clintons were involved and hit 'Submit' 😆
