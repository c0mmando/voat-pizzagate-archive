<h2>United States Holocaust Memorial ‘Days of Remembrance’ Event</h2>
<p>Friends, Members of Congress, Ambassadors, Veterans and, most especially, to the Survivors here with us today: it is an honor to join you on this solemn occasion. I am deeply moved to stand before those who survived history’s darkest hour. Your cherished presence transforms this place into a sacred gathering.</p>
<p>Thank you, Tom Bernstein, Alan Holt, Sara Bloomfield, and everyone at the Holocaust Memorial Council and Museum for your vital work and tireless contributions.</p>
<p>We are privileged to be joined by Israel’s Ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer. The State of Israel is an eternal monument to the undying strength of the Jewish People. A fervent dream that burned in the hearts of the oppressed, is now filled with the breath of life – and the Star of David waves atop a great nation arisen from the desert.</p>
<p>To those in the audience who have served America in uniform: our country thanks you. We are proud and grateful to be joined today by Veterans of the Second World War who liberated survivors from the Camps. Your sacrifice helped save freedom for the world.
Sadly, this year marks the first Day of Remembrance since the passing of Elie Wiesel.</p>
<p>His absence leaves an empty space in our hearts, but his spirit fills this room – it is the kind and gentle spirit of an angel who lived through hell, and whose courage still lights the path from darkness.</p>
<p>Though ELL-EE’s story is well known, it is always worth repeating. He suffered the unthinkable horrors of the Holocaust. His mother and sister perished at Auschwitz. He watched his father slowly dying before his own young eyes in Buchenwald. He lived through an <strong><em>endless nightmare of murder and death</em></strong> – and he inscribed on our collective conscience the duty we have to remember that long dark night so as never to repeat it.</p>
<p>The Survivors in this hall, through their testimony, fulfill the righteous duty to never forget – and engrave into the world’s memory the Nazi Genocide of the Jewish People.</p>
<p>You witnessed <strong><em>evil beyond description.</em></strong> Many of you lost your entire family – everything and everyone you loved. You saw mothers and children led to mass slaughter. You saw the starvation and the torture. You saw the organized attempt at the <strong>extermination of an entire people.</strong> You survived the ghettos, the Concentration Camps and the Death Camps. And you persevered to tell your stories. You tell of these living nightmares because, despite your great pain, you believe in ELL-EE’s famous plea, that <strong><em>“For the dead and the living, we must bear witness.”</em></strong></p>
<p>That is why we are here today. To remember and to bear witness. <strong><em>To make sure that humanity, never, ever forgets.</em></strong> The Nazis massacred 6 million Jews. Two out of every three Jews in Europe were murdered in the genocide. <strong><em>Millions more innocent people</em></strong> were imprisoned and executed by the Nazis without mercy.</p>
<p>Yet, even today, there are those who want to forget the past – worse still, there are even those filled with such hate that they want to erase the Holocaust from history. Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to its evil, and <strong><em>we will never be silent in the face of evil again.</em></strong></p>
<p>Denying the Holocaust is only one of many forms of dangerous Anti-Semitism that continue around the world. We’ve seen Anti-Semitism on university campuses, in the public square, and in threats against Jewish citizens. Even worse, it’s been on display in the most sinister manner when terrorists attack Jewish Communities – or when aggressors threaten Israel with destruction.</p>
<p>This is my pledge to you: 
We will confront Anti-Semitism. 
We will stamp out prejudice. 
We will condemn hatred. 
<strong><em>We will bear witness. 
And we will act.</em></strong></p>
<p>As President of the United States, I will always stand with the Jewish people – and I will always stand with our great friend and partner, the State of Israel.</p>
<p>So today, we remember the 6 million Jewish men,** women and children whose lives and dreams were stolen from this earth.**</p>
<p>We remember the millions of other innocent victims the Nazis so brutally targeted and killed.</p>
<p>We remember the ***survivors who bore more than we can imagine.</p>
<p>We remember the hatred and evil that sought to extinguish human life, dignity, and freedom.</p>
<p>But we also remember the light that shone through the darkness.***</p>
<p>We remember sisters and brothers who gave everything to those they loved – survivors like Steven Springfield who in the long death march carried his brother on his back. As he said, “I just couldn’t give in.”</p>
<p>We remember the brave souls who banded together to save the lives of their neighbors – even at the risk of their own.</p>
<p>And we remember those first hopeful moments of liberation, when at long last the American soldiers arrived in camps and cities throughout occupied Europe – waving the same beautiful flags before us today, speaking those three glorious words: “you are free.”
It is this love of freedom, this embrace of human dignity – this call to courage in the face of evil – that the Survivors here today have helped to write onto our hearts. The Jewish people have endured oppression, persecution, and those who have sought and planned their destruction. Yet, through the suffering, they have persevered. They have thrived. And they have enlightened the world.
We stand in awe of the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish People.</p>
<p>I want to close with a story – enshrined in the Museum – that captures the moment of liberation in the final days of the war.
It is the story of Gerda Klein, a young Jewish woman from Poland. Some of you know her. Gerda’s family was murdered by the Nazis. She spent three years imprisoned in labor camps – and the last four months of the war on a terrible death march. At the end, on the eve of her 21st birthday, her hair had lost all of its color, and she weighed a mere 68 pounds. Yet she had the will to live another day.
Gerda later recalled the moment she realized that her long-awaited deliverance had arrived. She saw a car coming towards her. Many cars had driven up before. But this one was different. On its hood, in place of that wretched swastika, was a bright, beautiful white star. Two American soldiers got out. One walked up to her. The first thing Gerda said was what she had been trained to say: “We are Jewish, you know.”</p>
<p>That American soldier paused. And then he said, “so am I.”</p>
<p>It was a beautiful moment after so much darkness.</p>
<p>As Gerda took this solider to see the other prisoners, the American did something she had long forgotten to even expect: he opened the door for her.</p>
<p>In Gerda’s words, <strong><em>“that was the moment of restoration of humanity, of humaneness, dignity, and freedom.”</em></strong></p>
<p>But the story does not end there. Because as some of you know, that young American soldier who liberated her, and who showed her such decency, would soon become her husband. A year later, they were married.
In her words, “He opened not only the door for me, but the door to my life and my future.”
Gerda has since spent her life telling the world of what she witnessed. She, like those Survivors among us today, has dedicated her life to shining a light of hope through the dark of night.
Your courage strengthens us. Your voices inspire us. And your stories remind us that we must never, ever, shrink away from telling the truth about evil in our time.
Evil is always seeking to wage war against the innocent, and to destroy all that is good and beautiful about our common humanity.
But evil can only thrive in darkness.
And what you have brought us today is so much more powerful than evil. You have brought us hope. Hope that love will conquer hatred, that right will defeat wrong, and that peace will rise from the ashes of war.
Each Survivor here today is a beacon of light – <strong>and it only takes one light to illuminate even the darkest space.</strong> Just like it takes only one truth to crush a thousand lies, and one hero to change the course of history.</p>
<p><strong><em>We know that in the end, good will triumph over evil. And that as long as we refuse to close our eyes, or to silence our voices, we know that justice will ultimately prevail.</em></strong>
So today we mourn. We remember. We pray. <strong><em>And we pledge: NEVER AGAIN.</em></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.
Donald J. Trump

          <p>
           I want to close with a story – enshrined in the Museum – that captures the moment of liberation in the final days of the war.
It is the story of Gerda Klein, a young Jewish woman from Poland. Some of you know her. Gerda’s family was murdered by the Nazis. She spent three years imprisoned in labor camps – and the last four months of the war on a terrible death march. At the end, on the eve of her 21st birthday, her hair had lost all of its color, and she weighed a mere 68 pounds. Yet she had the will to live another day.
Gerda later recalled the moment she realized that her long-awaited deliverance had arrived. She saw a car coming towards her. Many cars had driven up before. But this one was different. On its hood, in place of that wretched swastika, was a bright, beautiful white star. Two American soldiers got out. One walked up to her. The first thing Gerda said was what she had been trained to say: “We are Jewish, you know.”
          </p>
          <p>
           That American soldier paused. And then he said, “so am I.”
          </p>
          <p>
           It was a beautiful moment after so much darkness.
          </p>
          <p>
           As Gerda took this solider to see the other prisoners, the American did something she had long forgotten to even expect: he opened the door for her.
          </p>
          <p>
           In Gerda’s words,
           <strong>
            <em>
             “that was the moment of restoration of humanity, of humaneness, dignity, and freedom.”
            </em>
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           But the story does not end there. Because as some of you know, that young American soldier who liberated her, and who showed her such decency, would soon become her husband. A year later, they were married.
In her words, “He opened not only the door for me, but the door to my life and my future.”
Gerda has since spent her life telling the world of what she witnessed. She, like those Survivors among us today, has dedicated her life to shining a light of hope through the dark of night.
Your courage strengthens us. Your voices inspire us. And your stories remind us that we must never, ever, shrink away from telling the truth about evil in our time.
Evil is always seeking to wage war against the innocent, and to destroy all that is good and beautiful about our common humanity.
But evil can only thrive in darkness.
And what you have brought us today is so much more powerful than evil. You have brought us hope. Hope that love will conquer hatred, that right will defeat wrong, and that peace will rise from the ashes of war.
Each Survivor here today is a beacon of light –
           <strong>
            and it only takes one light to illuminate even the darkest space.
           </strong>
           Just like it takes only one truth to crush a thousand lies, and one hero to change the course of history.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            <em>
             We know that in the end, good will triumph over evil. And that as long as we refuse to close our eyes, or to silence our voices, we know that justice will ultimately prevail.
            </em>
           </strong>
           So today we mourn. We remember. We pray.
           <strong>
            <em>
             And we pledge: NEVER AGAIN.
            </em>
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.

            I wouldn't compare Pizzagate to the Holohoax as the latter is unequivocally bogus.

            FAIL.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Holohaux was a PSYOP.  It was handled like a psyop (flying in Hitchcock and Wilder to direct the "camp liberation" films, having local villagewomen stop by to shock and awe them and then film them sobbing hysterically on camera, then disseminate that footage around the world) because it WAS a psyop.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "6 million" figure dates back to
            <strong>
             <strong>
              1915
             </strong>
            </strong>
            .  Hitler wasn't even in power yet, and there weren't even that many Jews in Europe.  See this video of actual news stories dating back to 1915, claiming that "6 million" European Jews were being "holocausted."  YES, THEY WERE PLANTING THE MEME 33 years BEFORE HITLER CAME TO POWER.
           </p>
           <p>
            [6 Million 1915-1938]   (
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dda-0Q_XUhk&amp;t=6s">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dda-0Q_XUhk&amp;t=6s)
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            Then, of course, are MODERN day reseachers -- some Jewish -- who have gone to Europe and concluded that there is NO WAY events transpired at the camps the way we were told.  Ernst Zundel hired the best in the world for his defense team in his expensive, lengthy Canadian trial.  Then there are JEWISH researchers like David Cole, who had to go into hiding after receiving death threats from Jews after an appearance on the Donahue Show.  Engineers say there IS NO WAY they could have cremated that many bodies, even if they had burned all of them 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.  The crematoria had limited capacity and were of finite number.  Additionally, there is ZERO evidence of Zyklon-B residue at the purported "gas chamber" locations.
           </p>
           <p>
            300,000 to 500,000 died in those camps secondary to starvation and disease (most notably, typhus).  No materiel was coming in once the Allies began bombing the shit out of Germany.  There were TENNIS COURTS and SWIMMING POOLS for the "prisoners" to use.
           </p>
           <p>
            The evidence goes on and on and on.  There is entirely too much to post here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The HOAX was pulled off to create the state of Israel.  The entire staged event was critical to their success in WWII, which continued the plan begun in WWI.  And the results lead us directly into WWIII.
           </p>
           <p>
            They got away with pulling off the biggest hoax ever, which then emboldened the bastards to fake the Apollo 11 moon landings, OKC bombing, 09/11, Sandy Hook, etc.  After decades of practice, they know exactly how to do it and get away with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unlike the HoloHAUX, PizzaGate is REAL.

            Read this and cried. That is rare. Have been fighting for victims and witnesses who are trapped in severe PTSD because of being silenced by the powers that be. Hunted &amp; gangstaulked into suicide. Soldiers &amp; L.E. who took s stand and were shut down and worse.

            Helpless children who no longer had a voice. Trauma survivors who turned to quiet rooms of darkness because sunlight caused pain. Many of them have been posting here for the past few months hoping to God DJTrump as impert as he might be as we all are would courageously take a stand!

                Even if there is no hope, which you so certainly imply, it is exactly that bleak negativity which spreads itself over our population, which you are helping spread, that keeps us locked in our prisons of inaction. And I for one will not be part of it. You can bitch about possibilities, but the fact of the matter is you know as little as the rest of us. Yet you assume the worst, or become convinced of the worst, and as more ignorant people like you descend into negativity, the worst becomes reality.
You could assume the best, and strive to do your part, encourage others to do their part, fight for good. It's a choice. Or you could bitch and drag the rest of us down too.

                So I don't believe he has been compromised because there is not substantial evidence thereof. If you say he can't be president without being corrupt, then I say, why have you not rebelled yet, you pussy?

                  Haha it's hilarious that you're talking down to me like you know anything more than anyone else, but I've been "here" as in awake, since 2001. Believe me, sitting behind your computer screen doing nothing is certainly not the effective "radical rebellion" you think it is. You typing cheap words does nothing in the way of rebellion.
