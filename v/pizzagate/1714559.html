            I just connected the dots for you on Johnny Depp. Specifically through the victims own words and a dead child actor all the way to the symbolism and attempts to quiet the 2009 whitehouse Halloween party. Yes it involves Satanism &amp; pedophelia. Do you want me to draw you a picture. Might you consider there are many people out in the world who have the documentation they would not share with you.

             Those Depp/Whitehouse posts were shit based on a mind control propaganda video, bad or false evidence and basic shillery.  Give it up, either your campaign failed or you are the one person convinced by it.

            You are not a mod so you have no authority to tell people how to post. If somebody wants to tell other people to do research if they doubt the claim, then that is what they should tell them. I agree with your method, but you come off as pushy and demanding. Not that there is anything wrong with it....

            I'm just throwing this out there - I've lately been thinking pizzagate should keep human trafficking awareness and facts separate from an exploration of the Satanist aspect.   The human trafficking side would be strict adherance to proof based evidential arguments, the Satanist arena could be anything goes.

            I get your point but I didn't mind the Johnny Depp post.
            <br/>
            I've always found him extremely creepy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also - 1 point to   notdivided who said
"If readers of this sub are mere blind chicks with beaks open, waiting to be fed the next regurgitated source what is the point of any of this?"
           </p>
           <p>
            My comment: 
There are days when readers have the time and energy to dig  and days they do not.  That's just the way it is.  After all, this thread is one of the better places to come with "beak open" to get updates.
            <br/>
            Isn't part of "the point" of this thread to help spread awareness?
            <br/>
            Apart from spearing Trolls, there is something to be said for displaying a little bit of compassion here.
            <br/>
            This work is exhausting among other things ...  (throw-up sickening, etc)
           </p>
           <p>
            In spite of seeing Pedo symbols everywhere, with the help of google, tracks remain well covered.
            <br/>
            I've spent tons of hours and have yet to present an earth shattering post.
In addition, watching these arrests go un-done is nothing short of bewildering.
            <br/>
            Let's not take project frustration out on each other.

               I don't mind fighting it when I choose to - someone has to draw a line in the sand and it does make incremental differences. I just wish there either were some more reasonable people here or they would use their downvote more freely.  thx.

            That really got a good foothold with all the breathless "NEED HELP! CODED STARS = SATAN!!" posts.  It set a tone that is essentially a misunderstanding of what the forum's purpose is.  It was a specific group, possibly less active right now, that upvoted each other and changed names regularly, but others would then follow their bad example, treating the main page like a whiteboard to throw up a list of links on anything that gave them a "hint of evil" and then collectively group search to find more 5 pointed stars for example in people's Instagrams, rush back to post just about anything and everything without discretion, discernment or much analysis, and then collectively finger point at all the "evil doing" they had found.    I'm hoping they have basically exhausted themselves.

              Don't be disingenuous.  You know I'm talking about irresponsible posts like the one faekitty had to delete out of embarrassment about Alefantis' associate who went to dinner at American Girl and had stars or swirls whatever.   That could have caused an incident, you all are just lucky she got away with it and it wasn't held up by the media as the kind of harrassment that they are looking for.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, I don't care to argue.  Let's focus on moving forward.

                lol - let's face it, this place has a lot of tripe thrown up, and the decisions about what stays up or doesn't is mostly arbitrary and hapless despite the so called "rules".   It's okay, it's all a CIA limited hangout anyway.  It's like prison, it isn't supposed to be nice.

                it was a chapter, the stuff I complain about.  Its mostly over.  The group got much more responsible esp after the faekitty incident.

              Funny thing is, all these stars Americans are decorating their barn doors and christmas trees with come from catalogs and stores that source from China, so Hong Kong is ironically the source of all this SATANISM!
             </p>
             <p>
              A mound of circumstantial evidence is exactly that - an argument - but just a portion of that gets put up and then every hair brained mary in the congregation hunts through every instagram they can find and throws up 300 comments - LOOK MORE STARS - CONNECTED BY STARS HERE EVERYBODY STARRRRRRRZZZZZZZZZZ ...
and on and on it goes with swirls, twirls, triangles, pyramids and with whatever the symbol de jour happens to be.
             </p>
             <p>
              This stuff would not be used in a court of law.  It is for finger pointing and condeming and saying "THEY ARE FLAUNTING IT IN OUR FACES" a hundred times.
             </p>
             <p>
              And then the anger ANGER ANGER when anyone questions this crowd's conclusions - The memorable phrase "go neck yourself" was created by Yoichi S. for any skeptic of this god-given trove of pure awakening.  How can you question when we KNOW WE KNOW it is pure evil, etc. YOU must be illuminati, a shill, a priest, a pedo, a politician, Alefantis or Satan Himself.

             Not all of them. Sadly, some are intellectually deficient people. Let's face it, there are some in every group. What we're engaging in here is intellectual activity, and many people who are looking into this are not normally intellectuals. They don't understand why evidence is important or what constitutes evidence. They think if you say it on the internet, it must be true. The joke exists for a reason.

              The fact that even spam posts that are clearly titled with false claims and depend on false evidence only get flaired for accuracy and then remain on the front page for upwards of 2 days with only about 5 or 6 downvoats from the community should give you a pretty good idea of the amount of reasonable people active here.  Either that or there is a bad actor on the mod level that manipulates what stays on the front page, which is certainly not an impossibility.

              BTW- I still think your post is a good reminder.   I am actually surprised it hasn't been taken down.  good show.

               You echo my sentiments perfectly on many of the ludicrous threads that remain on top. That being said, what is there to do unless the upvote/downvote system is disabled? It seems to be the best defense is to upvote the most significant and informative posts, and to ensure that they're well documented for veracity.

                the only thing to do is get people to downvote as well as upvoat, since the mods only selectively enforce the rules.  I just think there are that few of us on a regular basis now, outnumbered by shills and multiple shill acounts by 4 or 5 to 1 or even more.   Doesn't mean there isn't any value to the forum.   It is a good place for topical breaking news, a community message board like for the protest, and an archive.   Here and there something of interest surfaces.

                I'm just saying, asking people here to write better posts is like asking a bunch of orcs to please not eat the hobbit.

            ; this is a great point, but (rather ironically) as an unsourced discussion post itself, it belongs in

             I don't think one link is a good representation that this is an actual problem and not just spin by the OP. This sub has over 10,000 subscribers surely there are more examples if this claim is true. Notice his comment in vivo doesn't have any traction, maybe that is proof it is not a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not to mention there are other claims in the post that are not sourced including some kind of specific "process for convincing people"
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              :That's how the process of convincing people of something you believe works.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             and the claim that uncited comments are "noise" "unwanted here" "not contributing" "stupid" "bullshit", when I am a member of this sub and couldn't disagree more. OP is setting up a strawman instead of dealing with facts.

             Link added. That said, I think discussing this sort of phenomenon, as well as the largely positive response to the reminder, is evidence in and of itself that the phenomenon is well known to those active on the forum.

            A lot of what you're referring to here is actually shill bots putting out deliberate disinfo to muddy the waters...  But there are real people who do this. I know someone personally who believes in reptilian shape shifters and says "look it up" when asked for evidence.  Some people legitimately do not know how to make an argument.
           </p>
           <p>
            That actually reminds me of an ex-con I met here in Mexico-  This guy was convinced Obama was the anti-christ.  His supporting evidence was that he saw a picture on the internet of Obama sitting on a throne in the White House.  He said "look it up'  Well, I wasted 2 minutes of my life to "look it up" and the image was obviously photoshopped.  And there went his credibility.  Gone forever.
           </p>
           <p>
            Never, ever tell someone to "look it up" on the internet.  That generally means "I'm a dumbass with no evidence"

             I have never believed in reptilian shape shifters. Then, I watched this 6 min vid about the architecture of the Pope's Vatican Audience Hall and was absolutely stunned.

             If you're serious about keeping an open mind looking at some evidence, i hope you'll take a minute to watch this. What does it have to do with pizzagate? Everything.

             <p>
              Do you have any critical thinking skills?  Why, in your mind, does a building shaped like a snake translate to,"Shape-shifting reptilians MUST be real!"

              I saw that video too - gobsmacked.  Don't know if the reptillians actually shape shift, but there is some serious reptillian worshipping going on with the Vatican, obviously.

             So I guess rule 2 of this site is virtue signaling, according to you:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Rule 2: EVERY claim that is made as part of your post needs to be sourced. If you are asking a question, give a brief summary of what led to your question, and provide sources for those elements. If you are giving an explanation of how your content relates to Pizzagate (satisfying Rule 1), and you need to connect a few dots to do so, please provide sources for your "dots". If you wish to ask general questions about Pizzagate, please do so here.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             If you're too stupid to read the rules, you're too stupid to post. But then, you prove that with each additional post you make.

               Is that a statement, or a question? Answer: it's a statement ended with a question mark because you're insecure and want validation from someone else. It's a millennial tic and indicative of idiocy.

               As to the source, it's called the sidebar. Move your eyes to the right side of the screen. Apparently you're fucking blind.

            And you're falling into the trap of rehashing old stuff every time a concern troll starts 'doubting'.  Credibility of a claim is a two way street in a place like this.  If there's no evidence, you're an asshole for saying it.  The end.  If there is evidence and you don't want to explain it again and a newbies feelings are hurt, who cares.
           </p>
           <p>
            But nice self righteous diatribe.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm glad I'm reading this as opposed to possible evidence that i have to painstakingly parse and verify myself.  That would totally suck and I'm sick and tired of it.  Less that more this!! Now!!! Everyone who disagrees isn't wanted around these parts and is about to get cuntpunched.

             If you think that posting a link in one thread means that you're no longer required to back up what you say when you make your claim in every other thread, you're mistaken. You're expecting people to be omnipotent of your every post and to search through your history every time you make some claim. That is the kind of arrogance I'm talking about. The purpose of this site is to INFORM people. If you're unwilling to do that, you don't have any reason to be here.

              people take a lot of time to make very detailed posts with sources. It is unrealistic and stupid to expect every reply would read like a post. Get a clue. PEOPLE SHOULD search what they don't know- not expect everyone else to be their personal info courier. jesus fucking christ the shills be strong in these parts.

                then it should be just as easy for the ignorant person to search for themselves. Let this sub rise to the greatest common denominator- not the lowest.

                Frequently there is more than one source for a claim anyways so people who only follow the trails provided only get part of the story. I suppose then based on your "INFORM" criterion we must all not just post a source, but every possible source and angle. Do you see where this is going?  wading through all this repeated and repeated and repeated info would be tedious as hell and not actually that informative at all. I bet you want to open a global center to counter disinformation and propaganda so the "facts" are carefully promoted according to the narrative of your states interests and your allies interests. familiar much?

                 It's not their responsibility to search to see whether you are lying or not. It's your responsibility to say things that are true, and to show that they are true. If not, you're not informing anyone. You're just spreading rumor which may or may not lead to verification, and let me tell you, people give up fast when they start looking up claims only to find them to be bullshit. That's a real good way to drive people away from Pizzagate.

                 Rule 2: EVERY claim that is made as part of your post needs to be sourced. If you are asking a question, give a brief summary of what led to your question, and provide sources for those elements. If you are giving an explanation of how your content relates to Pizzagate (satisfying Rule 1), and you need to connect a few dots to do so, please provide sources for your "dots". If you wish to ask general questions about Pizzagate, please do so here.

                 If you can't read the rules, fuck off. Even an idiot like you should be able to understand that. Well...maybe.

            What if you can't find an article you know you've read before? There is a difference between claiming you've solved pizzagate and asking the community to help you out after recalling a relevant article or video you can no longer find!

             There's nothing wrong with asking people to help you find a source. This kind of community is probably the best place for that.
            </p>
            <p>
             What would be wrong is answering someone who challenges the veracity of your claim with a demand that THEY find the source for it. That's not their responsibility.

              there are also shills requesting proof for every claim that has already been sourced and documented. If we have to post a bibliography for every response that bogs down the conversation and discourages focusing on new research. I've been participating since the reddit days and newbies (or shills) "demanding a source" about established facts are turning this place into stalled out echo chamber.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ultimately YOU are personally responsible for verifying any claim that is made to you- not the other way around.
             </p>
             <p>
              If readers of this sub are mere blind chicks with beaks open, waiting to be fed the next regurgitated source what is the point of any of this? Learn to think people. Learn to research. Stop wasting your time arguing about asinine things. Anyone who cares so little about the truth that they only care for it if it's hand fed to them and would never use their own energy to seek it for themselves is a waste of time in this forum to begin with.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just because someone provides a source doesn't necessarily mean their claim is true. Just because someone does not provide a source doesn't necessarily mean their claim is not true. If YOU research a claim and it is true then you should suppose it is true. If YOU research a claim or source and find problems then you should suppose it is not true. If YOU take any claim or source without personal verification you are a tool.

               There are also new people who have only just now heard or started researching Pizzagate. If you are unwilling to explain what is known to others, then how can you claim to be helping the investigation? Are you prepared to say you can tell the difference between the enormous amount of people that will be coming to find out more as more comes out, and the shills? I'd like proof of that.

               No, this is flatly wrong. Whatever claims you make, you bear the responsibility for convincing others they are true. If you refuse that responsibility, it's the responsibility of rational people to treat it as nothing more than rumor. If you expect strangers to go around researching every crazy thing that comes out of your mouth, you're presumptuous as hell.

               Really doesn't matter if they can't prove their claim. That's why our rules of evidence exist in our justice system. This is about finding information to take down the perpetrators of Pizzagate, not to give them more credibility with unverified fantasies about alien cults.

               You're talking like the mainstream media, blaming your audience for you telling them things that are untrue and then laughing at them for believing it. People do not have the time to go around debunking every lie in the world, because the mainstream media keeps them plenty busy on a daily basis just with their shit. Then they have to debunk all the politicians' lies, and the lies of advertising, and the lies in their workplaces, etc. As I said, the world is full of bullshit. This place is a place for truth, for informing people, and for increasing awareness of information that others want obscured. Get off your pretentious high horse and accept that you have a responsibility to show that what you're saying is true. If not, don't get bent out of shape when people say your unverified claim is bullshit. We have enough. Don't add more.

                I am so glad you took the time to write that. Line by line exactly what NOT to do. so I take it you are the audience and I am the researcher? You consume curated facts and I find them for you? BWHAHAHA.

               <p>
                And your shtick about MSM- WOW just WOW. You really don't feel personally responsible for verifying what you believe? As long as someone else convinces you it is on them?
               </p>
               <p>
                See the thing is I didn't tell anyone anything that is untrue and i'm only laughing at the people who are supposedly interested in a buried scandal, and yet don't expect to lift a finger discovering the facts. I think it's pretty clear you don't give a damn about the truth. The great thing about this sub is there is an archive- if you are new go back and read it don't harass legit researchers and bog down posts with your ignorant questions that are easily searched and addressed.

                and that is how we know you care 0% about the truth. an unverified claim is not bullshit and a rational person would never say so. It's unverified. It's only bullshit to consumerists like you who only take your news "approved" and regurgitated from others. The exact type of people who have no business weighing in on the veracity of a claim or source.

               <p>
                Besides I don't really see anyone getting bent out of shape about people accepting or not accepting their claims- more like just a bunch of concern trolls asking for sources on accepted facts bogging down the threads.

                    the truth exists in spite of your persistent &gt;refusal to engage.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    you OP this post, made your own claim. You invited a response by engaging. what evidence do you have? what source? obvi your post is bullshit. any rational person can see that on it's face. you expect us to listen to this crap without providing ANYTHING to verify your claim? I've had to repeat this a disturbing amount of times, so let's review how investigations work.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You have an idea that some sort of activity is happening, perpetrated by a person or persons. In order to demonstrate this to others, you search for and document evidence to support your idea. You then present this documented evidence to others in order to convince them that your idea is correct.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That's how the process of convincing people of something you believe works.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It is NOT where you throw out an idea with no evidence whatsoever, and then tell people to go find the evidence on their own.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That's called bullshit. There's plenty in the world already. Don't dump yours here.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I'm sorry to have to sound like an asshole here, but I'm fed up with the amount of assholes on this site that seem to think that their bullshit is contributing to Pizzagate. It isn't.

             You are definitely not the sort of person I'm addressing here. If you were citing some obscure website's article that contained zero citations, or some person's YouTube video that consisted of nothing more than some person claiming something but providing no evidence to back it up, it wouldn't even be fake news; it would be merely bullshit. If you're citing sources to back up what you say, you're doing EXACTLY what we need to do. Keep up the good work.

              Sometimes I will post my "bullshit" claim first because it seems to get more attention when it's just a claim. Then I start dropping sources once people's eyes are on it. Sourcing immediately seems to get limited response so I make the wild accusation wait for them to circle and then hit them with information. Not sure if it actually works but it seems to get people to at least notice

               Well that's a fair approach. You're basically doing the Breitbart/Project Veritas style of "drip drip" reporting. Again, nothing wrong with that as long as you're providing evidence of what you're saying at some point.

              <p>
               Those I'm addressing respond with "Google it" or "Go find it, I'm not doing your homework". From what you've said so far, it's clear you're not one of them.

                That must be why leftits think I read Breitbart 24/7 I didn't know that was their M.O. The"Google it" approach will never work even if people did go ahead and Google it the first ten stories that come up will be the ones discrediting or some hack job/disinfo garbage. Fuck this world is such a pain in the dick

                 Let me specify: I was referring to the man, Andrew Breitbart, who did the "drip drip" style of reporting. This would often involve dropping one piece of info that would cause certain people to react with a predictable lie; the next piece of info would prove that said people were lying. This could go on for weeks with really disingenuous people.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It has nothing to do with the shithole that now bears Breitbart's great name. I feel confident he'd have nothing to do with the site were he still alive.

                  I see. It always seemed to me that it's best to corner people into a position and then hit them. He was a true hero from what I'm learning sad the real ones always wind up dead. I don't read Breitbart much at all good thing.. Fuckers hijacked it after they killed him by the sound of it

                   I doubt the people behind the website had anything to do with his death. I just think extremists have been living off his reputation for a while in order to keep traffic going to one of the most horribly designed websites in existence.

                   I'm still thinking Obama and Co. are the ones with his blood on their hands. It is possible his death was natural since Bill Whittle said he had a history of heart trouble...but...something within me says "they knew that and took advantage of it". It's been public record for decades that the CIA fakes heart attacks to kill people:

                    I recall hearing someone asking Breitbart how he thought they would kill him apparently his response was "heart attack". The ice man killer used a heart attack weapon not sure if it was a gun I think it was a needle at the time. I'm sure they've definitely evolved that technology
