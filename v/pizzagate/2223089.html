<p>Wearing lambskin is a very specific attire used by the Gadianton Robbers in Mormon Literature. </p>
<p>So the following quotes are all from the Book of Mormon about the Gadianton Robbers. The Book of Mormon presumably talks about a group that settled in the Americas just after the Tower of Babel fell. Now, i beg you please try to ignore all religious preconceptions you might have, and just read this quotes which speak about a Secret Society that formed during their times called the Gadianton Robbers which made a deal with Satan and that they provoked a great war which destroyed their civilization.</p>
<p>I believe the Illuminati, the Cabal, The Gadianton Robbers, The Satanists, they all share the same hidden objective which resurfaces every now and then in the history of Mankind. I leave you to make your own personal assumptions as to why and from where these hidden objectives come from. My personal belief is that there is indeed an evil force which seeks the fall of humanity, but you do not need to believe the same in order to interpret the following quotes.</p>
<p>Book of Mormon</p>
<p><strong>This is from Ether 8</strong>
And Akish did administer unto them the oaths which were given by them of old who also sought power, which had been handed down even from Cain, who was a murderer from the beginning.</p>
<p>16 And they were kept up by the power of the devil to administer these oaths unto the people, to keep them in darkness, to help such as sought power to gain power, and to murder, and to plunder, and to lie, and to commit all manner of wickedness and whoredoms.</p>
<p>17 And it was the daughter of Jared who put it into his heart to search up these things of old; and Jared put it into the heart of Akish; wherefore, Akish administered it unto his kindred and friends, leading them away by fair promises to do whatsoever thing he desired.</p>
<p>18 And it came to pass that they formed a secret combination, even as they of old; which combination is most abominable and wicked above all, in the sight of God;</p>
<p><strong>The following quote belongs to Helaman 6.</strong></p>
<p>22 And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea, their secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they might distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band, who had taken this covenant.</p>
<p>23 And thus they might murder, and plunder, and steal, and commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of their country and also the laws of their God.</p>
<p>24 And whosoever of those who belonged to their band should reveal unto the world of their wickedness and their abominations, should be tried, not according to the laws of their country, but according to the laws of their wickedness, which had been given by Gadianton and Kishkumen.</p>
<p>Hope you read it all. Every details i believe is pertinent. I am preparing another work which will further elaborate my theory and findings.</p>
<p>These relates to Pizzagate because i believe the ulterior motives behind the Cabal or organization to which Podesta/Clinton/Abramovic belong to are shared by this specific group called The Gadianton Robbers.</p>',

            Great find about the lambskin! I have a bunch of these quotes on my website too because I think they provide such great insight into how this world really operates.

love robbery, love lewdness, hate your masters, and do not speak the truth." Pes. 113b.

             naaahhhh, obviously you didn't get picked to be part of the "in" crowd :) They have invaded all religions but Mormonism has a pretty strong history. They also founded The Society Of Jesus but that doesn't make all christians satan either.
