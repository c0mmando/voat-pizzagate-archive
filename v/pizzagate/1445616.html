            So he added yet another group of mods with absolutely no history on voat. Way to go kingkong, you're TOTALLY showing people the change they asked for. See my point now

            THOUSANDS of voat users, and he picks two more new people. More of the same. Could even be the same fucking people for all we know. This is why no one trusts him, at all.

             Hey you're right, I am new to voat, but does that inherently make me bad? You're kinda acting like a Hillary supporter protesting in the streets. Why don't you wait and see how I actually turn out, and if you have a problem with something I do, you can call me out publicly. That's the great thing about voat, it's all out in the open.

             Yes, they're 5 day old accounts because that's when the migration took place, and if the alternative is someone like you, I'd try a new username that has contributed.

              Good thing I don't care about your opinion. Why don't I have a "good head on my shoulders?" I have a family, I own a successful business (my third), I have a college degree, I spend my spare time riding motorcycles and taking my dog hiking. Anything else you want to know?
             </p>
             <p>
              So because someone makes a post about something means they can be trusted to run a sub on a free speech platfrom? You can not like me all you want, but I and others stand up for free speech, regardless of content. You can keep shilling for kingkong all you want. I see your post. You are blind and short sighted. You opinion on the matter is irrelevant because you keep excusing away very poor behavior and keep dismissing peoples criticisms of it.

              Ok thanks for the clarification. To be honest I'm kinda glad you did this. Because it bugged me that the sub had so many (new) mods. And a lot of other goats felt the same, that's why all those pizzagate alternative subverses sprouted.
             </p>
             <p>
              The action of removing those other mods increased my trust in you. I remember you from the pizzagate subreddit. I was the one inviting you guys to come over to Voat. They told me to start a pizzagate subverse but you were quicker. So either you are a very professional shill that infiltrated us from the get go or you are legit. But if you were a shill you would never consider giving the power of this sub to someone else like you did when all this started. For my part I trust you and I'm glad you removed all those other guys.

               haha no i grabbed it to stop the wrong people getting it. thats why I've been trying really hard to vet mods. hopefully the new guys I've invited will help. I'm not interested in being mod for too long, the reddit ban took me by surprise and the whole sub turned into the biggest shitstorm.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now that it's all settled, I'm hoping some of the guys I've messaged will be keen to take over my role.

              was new they kind of bugged me because I figured that subverses should all just be run however their creators saw fit, even if they wanted to be terrible mods. I think the chaos of unrestrained freedom on a website is fun, but as the community discussed what Voat should be, our good ol' benevolent dictator took the prevalent view that there should be a certain level of order within our free speech community. I respect him and the community and I really like what Voat has become. People who want to urgently force "educate" everyone like the very energetic Amelek and the too rich or too greedy for their own good folks paying shills or utilizing bonnets, I'm sure get frustrated with our efforts to "restrict" their free speech, but on the whole, we're still a pretty wild and enjoyable community overall.
             </p>
             <p>
              And if Amelek is listening without me explicitly calling him, we all see your posts and comments even if most get buried. We look at the buried stuff, honestly honestly. Most of us even kinda like you, you're just a bit too intense man, ya gotta bring it down a bit. ;-)

            So tell me, what's your guys' plan? To just hold this out until people become bored of looking up pedophilia? I'm genuinely curious how you plan on stopping Gab.

             I was likely made a mod because of my post connecting the DC tunnels to Alefantis, Oliver Miller, and James Huckenpahler. Feel free to check it out if you want to vet me for being a shill, or ask me whatever questions you want. I don't know anything about what the original mod said. There is no "your guys' plan" I am just a guy who came over here from reddit after

             got banned. Can you ELI5 what you mean by gab? Maybe then I can comment on it.
