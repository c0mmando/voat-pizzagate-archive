DAVID SEAMAN\'S LIFE IS VERY MUCH IN DANGER.</p>

<p>Quite simply, Joe,</p>
<p>We are allowed to prove or disprove any theory we want to
under the 1st amendment.  It is not &quot;fake news&quot; - what we are all
about is research, connecting dots, and putting forth a well-documented
theory.  No one has said &quot;this definitely has happened&quot; regarding pizzagate
And - you miss the entire point about pizzagate.  we don\'t know what or if
any child abuse happened THERE, at Comet Pizza.  we don\'t have any
footage of any video.  What we do have is a very very long list of dots
that are connecting, with very strange child porn pics, missing children,
and code words that are already known by the FBI to be pedophilia words.
Pizzagate is only the tip of iceberg as far as our fight against pedophilia.</p>
<p>We are:  well educated, filter facts through our own minds, and have a will
to, yes, SAVE THE CHILDREN. that is ALL we want.  we want corruption
to end.  We are not white supremacists.  that is very laughable considering
people who helped raise my own kid are African American and most of
my colleagues are Indian and Asian.  very funny indeed.  
</p>
<p>We are: anti-corruption.  
</p>
<p>Back off of David Seaman.  He\'s already been poisoned.  If he is
dead soon we will know, without a doubt, that the pedophilia network
called government and hollywood and MSM is all true.</p>
<p>One more thing.  Bet you didn\'t know a ton of child porn really was
downloaded from COMET PING PONG???  delivered to the DC
police?  Oh but DC police chief Newsham also supports child
rape (see his past) and stands with Alefantis.  Do you research.
We have.  DC police have done nothing with that info.<br />
marcus.stevens@dc.gov has sat on it since Dec 5th.  But, you
didn\'t know that did you while you assassinated Seaman\'s
character.  And did you even look at the band Heavy Breathing
or Sex Stains, that play at comet pizza?  &quot;all ages welcome&quot;?
and the sick Podesta art?  did you?  if you didn\'t, then do not
assassinate people\'s GOOD CHARACTER. </p>

            Personally, I'm sick and tired of hearing about all these "personalities" trying to make money and careers on the backs of us.  That includes disgusting Milo and his blood bath and "get your d***s out" at LSU, Seaman the self-promoting, Bitcoin-shilling dramaqueen "journalist" who steals info with zero attribution, and AJ the fat man with his hyped up BS about alleged lawsuits (get a clue:  A manilla folder is not EVIDENCE of ANYTHING).  HoneyBee is awesome and a couple of others, but frankly most of the PizzaGate videos aren't well done.  There is a ton of misreporting and lack of attribution.  I wish we would stop wasting time posting about, debating, and defending these characters and just stick with research.

            You contradict yourself completely.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seaman reported on the alleged JA victim, which you claim is disinfo.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are just 2 problems with that:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              This alleged victim's story won't convince anybody is a "conspiracy nutjob". The story does not contain any outrageous elements.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Seaman did't really push the story in the first place. Your shill-plan just does not work by doing one video and never bringing it up afterwards.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I fully agree that some things (like flat earth) are pushed to discredit us. But alledged victims of JA coming forward does not discredit anybody.

            Y'know, he sure does invent a lot of bogus drama around himself while advocating on the behalf of the rest of us? I dont like that. That whole bullshit poisoned story yesterday, too, and now all this? Every day another fabricated "look at me, the sploogeman" story on vote. These are in place of what should be legit reports or updates by him, but he does this in their stead because thats his shtick. He would protest gravity if it meant people were throwing bucks and bits at him.

              Seaman was only capitalizing on the horrible Evil known as pizzagate. 
I knew the first time I heard him. Seaman never investigated, and he only repeated the info already out there.
Milo, is another one. 
Was they threatened? Possibly
Was they getting the word out? Yes, but their motivation was not genuine!

               Pizzagate does not need any more investigators, there are plenty of those.
              </p>
              <p>
               What Pizzagate needs is high profile people that repeat the (interesting) info out there - using their real name. They should not bore the people but just point the finger to the best and most graphic evidence - which is still the Podesta emails and the JA Instagram pics.
              </p>
              <p>
               Seaman is doing the most important work - and that is exactly why he is so viciously attacked.

                 First of all you have no rational argument of him not being genuine. (your discredit theory does not with the JA victim allegations- it would work with aliens/ flat earth etc)
                </p>
                <p>
                 Second, Seaman's history does not support your theory (he talked about Hillary's health right before the election, at a time when it did the most harm to HRC)
                </p>
                <p>
                 Third, he is no spokesman and never claimed to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Fourth, I do recognize that he is a drama queen, but that does not change the fact that he did red-pill a substancial number of people. That is very important for success.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Fifth, do you realize that you have called EVERY high profile pizzagater a shill here? In your worldview as soon as somebody comes out and uses his real name, he immediately becomes a disinfo agent in your eyes. And that is of course EXACTLY what they want.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Somebody who has come out already is dangerous because he can sue people (you can't sue people when you want to protect your anonymity).
                </p>
                <p>
                 Somebody with a public track record like DS is even more dangerous because he cannot be so easily ignored.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To sum up, your whole argument does not make any sense and you attack exactly those people who can be most effective.

            Just stay your position neutral if you want people to stay tight. We can ignore content if we don't like. Stop being aggressive against anti-pedo people. If you are truly craving for destroying pedo-ring, you cannot ignore main stream voice. Keep it cool.

            Stop defending Seaman! No proof his life is in danger! Second, Seaman is a scam artists! 
Watch this video to the end!
Just like Beck, Milo and Jones, Seaman is in it for the attention and sponsors! 
Yes, the idiot called out Lynn RC but hey Seaman was already in knee deep of his scam, and let's admit Seaman is a few fries short of a Happy Meal!

            One fact this Buzzfeed brings forward which is true -- YouTube harbors the darkest side of the web, only it's the pedos on youtube, not Seaman. For every Seaman vid, there are a thousand pedo vids. So if you want to scream about pedophilia on YouTube and how something needs to be done about it, you can cite Buzzfeed. "YouTube Serves As The Content Engine Of The Internet’s Dark Side" -- Joe Bernstein@Buzzfeed. Let's get pedos off YouTube.

            Have you not noticed yet that regardless of how the thread begins, if it mentions David seaman in any way, the comments section becomes a cruel, sophomoric shill fest out for David's blood? Don't post anything related to David on Voat if you care about him.
           </p>
           <p>
            These same fucking retards are slobbering over Alex Jones as we speak, defending his every move.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hear by denounce my association with Voat, in case Daily Beast or some assholes are watching these threads for their next PEDOS DONT EXIST IN DC  journalistic masterpiece.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not everyone who contributed to Voat accepts Alex jones as a serious person, and not everyone sees David as WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD
           </p>
           <p>
            But I'm sure this comment will be ignored and the narrative will be that pizzagate researchers follow infowars.

             Yeah I got excoriated for saying we need to stick with each other and not berate each other because we are on the same team. You'd think I committed a crime they came after me so bad. We need a safe forum to share info without the trolls beating you down. I won't even mention his name anymore.

                <p>

                <p>
                 "If", "some", "thing", "changes", "then", "that thing", "is changed", "by", "another."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Does anyone here not know the meanings of any of these words?
                </p>
                <p>
                 "If a thing is changed by another", "then either there is an", "infinite regress", "of", "changed changers", "or", "there is an", "unchanged changer."

                 Speak up. Any of these words controversial? Feel free to say which ones.

                  Those words have generalized meaning in English, but lack the specificity to perform any kind of formal logic operations on them.  Also, your domain is undefined, and your operators are as well.  I know that this shit gets passed around a lot in the religious community as "proof" to those with no formal education, but that whole argument is quite literally meaningless because it's based on the premise that you can use formal logic on English words representing unspecific concepts.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Anyways, don't take my word for it.  Go find a professor of mathematics specializing in formal logic and see what he tells you.  Then, after he's told you the exact same thing I have I may accept an apology.  Fuck Jesus Christ.  Moron.

                   You can't use logic on English, teehee! What a silly idea! People just communicate in grunts and memes! Even lawyers and philosophers. Grunts and memes. Impossible to mix logic and English. Unpossible.

                    You can absolutely mix logic and English, just not when you're trying to do a formal proof.  The whole point of a proof is to prove something.  If 90% of you variables are undefined then by the time you get to the end all you've proven is that you have no idea what you're doing.

                    In any case, I'm done arguing with you.  You lack the education - and likely the intelligence - to understand what you're talking about, and you're also incredibly rude.  I hope that as you mature you gain a desire for knowledge, but in honesty I suspect that your mind has been too damaged by the ludicrous teachings of your pathetic dead Christ for you to ever recover.  Fuck Jesus Christ, may his teachings rot to dust in the same way his pox addled brain did.  Have a good day :)

                     Wow so edgy!!!!!! Because the prime mover argument means Christianity!!!! Teehee!!! Learned so much in one year of seminary school!!!! Guess at opponent's religion to insult instead of address the argument AT ALL!!!! Clever clever!!!!

                      When someone refuses to put in any effort at all (i.e., simply telling you to fuck off), it's hard to confirm that they're dumb.

                 omg. Look at this guy!!
                </p>
                <p>
                 I give the dude an argument. He dismisses it outright and says literally nothing about it. Then he tells me that he told me already, and that I'm an idiot! Also, he demands mathematical rigor, just like for all of his other beliefs in life! (Sar, is that how I sound when I demand argument over direct revelation?)
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's okay, because he has a year at seminary school.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, look, he put argument in quotes, which means the prime mover argument is not an argument!

                  I did tell you already, idiot, but I will repeat myself:  that entire argument is entirely meaningless because you have not defined your variables, your domain, or your operators.  Perhaps your Christ-addled brain has trouble with things like understanding words?  This is why we want to destroy Christianity:  it produces cretins and imbeciles like yourself.

            Enough about Seaman. He does no research. He disseminated disinfo and he always has drama about money or the cops watching him or being poisoned. If he is gone I haven't noticed because I learned nothing from him.

            I sent him this:
           </p>
           <p>
            What's up Blockhead Joe,
           </p>
           <p>
            So, you've gone and done a hit piece of David Seaman. Why am I not surprised? I mean, after all, this is coming from the same amazing mind who said that Sam Hyde was "hiding swastikas" in his television show, which is completely made up. Just like everything you've said about Seaman -- completely made up. You are a tool, Joe. You are a tool of the elites; the sick, disgusting, pedophile elites. They think of how you protect them, and they laugh as they zoot cocaine up their noses and continue to fuck children in dungeons.
           </p>
           <p>
            You protect these "people," Joe. Good ole Blockhead Joe. Instead of protecting little children from being raped, you cover up for them, and shit all over the people attempting to protect them. How many times have YOU been to Comet Ping Pong, eh Blockhead Joe? You hang out with Jimmy Alefantis and his crew; did they get to you? Is that how you were compromised? Or is it just out of your own sick self-interests, your lust for power and influence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like Sam Hyde said to you, you will NEVER be anyone important, Joe. You're a piece of shit. You'll never work for a "real" publication, and soon BuzzFeed probably won't even exist anymore, once the God-Emperor Trump stamps you out of existence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Enjoy your spot in Hell, Blockhead Joe. You are a pedophile-enabling sack of dog shit.
