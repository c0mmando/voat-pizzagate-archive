The more I think about it the more it makes sense. </p>
<p>They close the estate down as a private residence turning it in to a &quot;museum&quot; as to keep prying eyes away from the family and the happenings there. I mean this is the largest STILL privately owned residence in America and as we know these sickos love their memorabilia so why would they shut down a place that would hold so many memories for them? It doesn\'t add up. But what does add up is.. That as the times slowly changed the family needed to hide their nefarious acts from public eye and with so much taking place at this estate what a brilliant idea it would be to &quot;close&quot; it down as a private residence, thus making the public look away as to what the family is doing there. </p>
<p>So in checking when the Estate was built <a href="https://www.biltmore.com/visit/biltmore-house-gardens/estate-history">according to the Biltmore History site</a> between 1889-1895</p>
<p>The Estate was opened to the public in 1930 right around the same time as the ol automobile was becoming popular and just before the digital age started to dawn . And to tie in with that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Vanderbilt_III">Cornelius Vanderbilt III</a> had a big role in helping improve the fuel efficiency in locomotives and freight trains and to top it off they also constructed <a href="https://www.history.com/news/grand-central-terminal-an-american-icon-turns-100">the first Grand Central Depot</a>.</p>
<p>Why is this relevant? Well I believe that it would only make sense for them to have constructed their own private railway, or at least tunnels which could later be converted to rail, under this Estate. This would make for the perfect way to bring in their &quot;guests&quot; at night.</p>
<p>You follow the white rabbit down the hole which takes you to the train you board to &quot;Wonderland&quot;..</p>
<p>Alice in Wonderland is based on a girl named Alice who ventures in to a fantasy land where everything is backwards to her real world. What is an amusement park? A place where kids go to have fun, laugh, enjoy life and the adults mostly get dragged around bored. What is a backwards amusement park? Wonderland! A place where the adults have &quot;fun&quot; killing and torturing kids, dragging them around.. </p>
<p>Like we have come to know these satanists invert everything, meaning they create a backwards world where evil rules and fun for them is hurting and killing others. Just like the story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland tells</a></p>
<p>To add to the Alice theory, there was a Vanderbilt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Claypoole_Vanderbilt">named Alice</a> who was married to Cornelius II, he built his mansion on the corner of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Vanderbilt_II_House">1 west 57th street NY</a>. This is the house <a href="http://archer.wikia.com/wiki/Tunt_Manor">depicted in the Archer series</a> BUT the pool depicted in the same <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Ij5Ovwg">episodes</a> is the pool at Biltmore Estate. AND to add to the speculation about what the Archer series has to do with all this, I have just found a clip <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/6fcf15be-fb73-42dd-8d8c-3dec83dcfbe4">from Archer</a> that states &quot;The Conservatory&quot; ( which islocated at Biltmore) is home to the <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/2bad9a27-4f21-4f80-a309-8624b028237e">worlds second largest collection of CARNIVOROUS plants!!</a> this get\'s more bizarre as it goes along..</p>
<p>The creator of Archer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Reed">Adam Reed</a> was born and raised in Asheville, the same town as the Biltmore Estate is located.</p>
<p>{Thanks to <a href="https://voat.co/user/Piscina">@Piscina</a> we have this statement that has purportedly been said:</p>
<p>&quot;We skinned that baby alive to the scream of \'hail, Satan!\' We then draped it\'s intestines around the candlesticks of our altar. I cut the baby up into pieces, and each person ate some. Later, I took the skull and remains home. I forced the remains down the garbage disposal to conceal evidence from the police, and then burned a candle to Satan on the baby\'s skull.And when the mother, my girlfriend, felt bad about giving up her baby for sacrifice and went tot he police, we decided to make an example out of her as a warning to the rest of the coven:</p>
<p>&quot;We took her up the side of one mountain overlooking Asheville...we laid her on that altar, and the sacrificial dagger was placed in my hands. I took that dagger and cut her open from neck to groin, and she was sacrificed. To this day her parents don\'t know what happened to her.&quot;</p>
<p>The jewel of Asheville, NC, is the famed &quot;Biltmore Estate, &quot; former home of the the great Illuminati Satanist millionaire, George Vandebilt! In his Illuminati mansion, one large room contains a coven\'s table, with 13 seats on either side. On the door is a plaque with the words, &quot;Assemblage of the Gods.&quot;</p>

<p>Where have we seen people with their young babies and kids before? Good ol Jimmy Commets IG had pleanty of pictures of his friends with their young children and babies, my guess is for this sick reason.</p>
<p>{And thanks to <a href="https://voat.co/user/exposethecriminals">@exposethecriminals</a> we have this statement:</p>
<p>One reference states that Cornelius Vanderbilt, the original Vanderbilt who made it rich, made his large sums from blackmail (Minnigerode, Meade. Certain Rich Men. New York: G.P. Putnamâ€™s Son, 1927, pp 112-113.)</p>
<p>Source: Bloodlines of the Illuminati by Springmeier }</p>
<p>So.. In saying all this what conclusion have I come to? Seeing that Asheville is the apparent <a href="https://beforeitsnews.com/v3/alternative/2013/2719802.html">mecca of Santanism</a> and also <a href="http://www.cultofweird.com/americana/seely-overlook-castle-asheville/">described here</a> it would only make sense to have their Alice in Wonderland &quot;amusement&quot; park here. Where wealthy people can come and pay large sums of money (into the millions i\'d say) to go back in time and torture and kill babies, children and even adults that they have specially chosen from the list. What if CPP and all these other locations that we have looked in to are NOT where these rituals take place but are the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/KLoASpH">locations of stations</a> on the way to Biltmore? Think in all this research ALL these places have had a similar theme, they have all apparently had TUNNELS under them.. What if they are not tunnels but a rail network? Alice\'s adventures are UNDERGROUND in the story, soooo they venture underground to get to &quot;Wonderland&quot; a place that is backwards for us normal people but the perfect playground for these sickos. And the perfect opportunity for the family to make even more $$ by blackmailing their guests, as the place is already fitted with surveillance so no need to worry about setting up cameras. They put plastic over the areas they use as to not leave evidence and if there was anything, all the areas are roped off anyway so there is no need to worry about visitors seeing anything left behind.Just like we see LLoyd Kaufman doing <a href="https://imgur.com/a/IlNvwqi">here</a>. </p>
<p>I\'ll let you decide your opinion and if anyone can link CPP to the family PLEASE add in the comments as I feel this would give the theory so much more strength and almost go as far as confirming it.</p>',

           it would only make sense to have their Alice in Wonderland "amusement" park here. Where wealthy people can come and pay large sums of money (into the millions i'd say) to go back in time and torture and kill babies, children and even adults that they have specially chosen from the list.

               Well, 'Q' said that the location has been confirmed, but Q has been wrong in the past (didn't get the place of a Rothschild estate right, wrong first name of Marina Abramovic etc.)
              </p>
              <p>
               So I'm afraid that isn't a valid confirmation at all. Please note that the tiles are different. (Personally, I still think it's hightly likely that this is the location that inspired the artist, especially since she also used tapestry as background patterns of her paintings that almost look like the tapestry in Biltmore.)

            , your first thesis, that the BD paintings point to the Biltmore as a twisted playground for the rich, fulfills our submission requirements okay. Your second thesis -- that "they travel underground straight in to the Estate and it is all taken care of at Wonderland" via tunnels and underground train tracks -- not so much.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Why is this relevant? Well I believe that it would only make sense for them to have constructed their own private railway, or at least tunnels which could later be converted to rail, under this Estate. This would make for the perfect way to bring in their "guests" at night.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Your only evidence supporting this thesis appears to be that the Vanderbilts built railroads. There doesn't appear to be any evidence at all for the thesis that Comet Ping Pong is a "station" in this hypothetical railroad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore, you have included the idea, which was very heavily shilled during the beginning of our investigation and turned out to be disinfo, that people go to Comet to choose from a "menu".
           </p>
           <p>
            Since we have a separate subverse for purely speculative material and our submission requirements clearly state posts to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            should be research posts that are backed by linked source material only, I will say that this thread looks like an attempt to give credence to the MSM narrative that Pizzagate and QAnon are crazy, ridiculous conspiracy theories.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I'm going to give this the benefit of the doubt for the moment and give you a 24 Hour Grace flair, so that you can edit to provide sources for the things lacking evidence and remove the disinfo and pure speculation. You can speculate in the Comment section, of course.

             All good, I edited some out and added a link that shows the route from grand central is almost identical to the route from CPP.. I only made this post to get people looking in to this more as I Am sure Q didn't post the Bitmore pool and BD art for no reason. I feel we need this sort of speculation atm as there has really only been articles shared, everyone has gone cold on a lot of trails and I feel there's more to this family/estate that we don't yet know. Everything was only speculation until people looked in to it more and came up with bits and pieces to tie it together.

              <em>
               evidence
              </em>
              in order to let the post stay here on the main sub.

             <p>
              I'd suggest to repost as is to

            By the 1940s, the equivalent of 40 percent of the U.S. population traveled through Grand Central every year, and during World War II millions of servicemen passed through Grand Central on their way to and from the frontâ€”so many that the U.S. government opened a special branch of the USO inside the station. Considering its high profile and vital importance to the U.S. war effort, its perhaps not surprising that Grand Central was the target of Nazi sabotage during the war. In 1942, four German spies snuck on to Long Island with plans to destroy key logistical locations in the northeast, including Grand Central. They were quickly apprehended, but if they had made their way to the stationâ€™s secret subbasement, known as M42, they would have been met with an awesome sightâ€”a platoon of armed soldiers, who monitored the super-secret outpost. To this day, M42 has never appeared on any maps of Grand Central, and behind its doors remain the controls of New Yorkâ€™s transportation network. Find out more about M42 here.

            Secret sub-basement proves there are Secrets.  This area was never on any maps of Grand Central.  What were they hiding?

            Track 61
           </p>
           <p>
            Itâ€™s likely that many a commuter has wished for a short cut that would whisk them to their destination without the hassle of Grand Centralâ€™s bustling, rush hour crowds. For one native New Yorker, that wish was a reality. During his time in office, President Franklin Roosevelt utilized a secret rail line, Track 61, which provided an underground connection between Grand Central and the nearby Waldorf-Astoria hotel. There was even a large freight elevator at the Waldorfâ€™s end of the track, big enough to fit the presidentâ€™s Pierce Arrow limousine, which allowed FDR to travel to and from New York in secrecyâ€”quite handy for clandestine missions as he led the U.S. war effort during World War II.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a pic of this Track 61 but we should not be fooled.  It may very well still be in use after renovations.

            <p>
             Since the mid-19th century, stories have been told about shanghai practices in Portland. Not only men but women, too were warned to take care against being drugged or kidnapped and hauled off for sale. Women were allegedly shanghaied for use as prostitutes rather than shipâ€™s laborers. Although other ports along the West Coast including San Francisco are said to have been centers of shanghai activity, Portlandâ€™s underground tunnels are claimed to have made the practice much more manageable and wide-spread than in other areas.
            </p>
            <p>
             During Prohibition, it is said that bars moved their operations underground, as well, making it easier than ever for unsuspecting victims to be shanghaied. Some researchers estimate that as many as 1,500 people a year were shanghaied through Portlandâ€™s Underground. Entire scenarios about the practices and experiences of the shanghaied in the tunnels have been created and elaborated on over the years.

             Detroit loves its booze (yeah, Strohâ€™s!), and itâ€™s perfectly logical that many of Motor Cityâ€™s speakeasies had escape tunnels during that stupid time when booze was illegal. One notable example is Tommyâ€™s on 3rd Street. Their secret passageway leads to Fort Street Presbyterian Church (across the street) and was also likely part of the

             What is known officially as the Michigan Central Railway Tunnel and its tracks were built in 1910 for $8.5 million by the Detroit River Tunnel Co. for Canada Southern Railway â€” financed ultimately by the wealthy Vanderbilt family of rail barons via its New York Central Railroad. The Vanderbilts opened the Michigan Central Station three years later at a cost of $2.5 million.

             The tunnel is approximately 1.6 miles long and it cost over $8 million to build. The New York Central Railwayâ€™s engineering vice president, William J. Wilgus oversaw the construction. In 1906, the tunnel was operated by the Michigan Central Railroad. It has since changed hands many times throughout the years. Currently, the tunnel is owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway and Borealis Transportation.

             You probably wonâ€™t be able to get close to the tunnel itself. The land around it is off-limits to the public and is routinely patrolled by the Homeland Security, the Canadian Pacific Police Service, CN Police, and the Detroit Police Department.

             I am not sure, but could this be connected also to the Purple Gang that was helping the Bronfmans of Canada during the Prohibition Era?  The Purple Gang morphed into the Jewish Mafia and I can't believe they weren't involved in something this slimy.  The played big time in the Detroit area as well.  Which is right over the border of Canada.  Possibly they used the tunnels to deliver their booze and took part in the trafficking as well.  There is no end to their Evil.

             Well howdy fuckin do, would you look at that.. Now do we connect the dots? The dots being places like CPP and Voodoo, see if we can have some sort of station link up, I'd say it would just run in a loop for the estate, around the outside of the country, those being the main stations, then there would be smaller stations inland that maybe connect to the main route.

            From Laurel Canyon (I'm currently reading the late Dave McGowan's
            <em>
             Weird Scenes Inside The Canyon
            </em>
            and it seems that LC was an utter cesspit of paedophilia and child pornography, with an extensive tunnel network underneath the sprawling 'Log Cabin' where the hippie movement was created, not to mention numerous inexplicable house fires) to the McMartin Preschool to CPP, there seems to be a recurring theme of tunnels which would ostensibly serve no practical purpose, given the nature of the properties under which they lie.

             Yep, recurring theme throughout all of this is the tunnels aka rail network.. I mean what a better place to have a station that a place like CPP where it wouldn't seem weird with a lot of people entering there or even "closed" for a private function. Looking at it all now it doesn't seem to add up that they would have actual rituals at a place like CPP or bucks, BUT it does add up that these places are stations and also provide the menu for the trip to those that are in-the-know and ask for the "special" menu.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                The basements of many downtown bars and hotels were linked to the Willamette River waterfront through the tunnels, allowing supplies to be moved from ships docked there directly to basements for storage. Although many residents used to doubt it was true, the catacombs snaking beneath the city do in fact exist.
               </p>
               <p>
                Since the mid-19th century, stories have been told about shanghai practices in Portland. Not only men but women, too were warned to take care against being drugged or kidnapped and hauled off for sale. Women were allegedly shanghaied for use as prostitutes rather than shipâ€™s laborers. Although other ports along the West Coast including San Francisco are said to have been centers of shanghai activity, Portlandâ€™s underground tunnels are claimed to have made the practice much more manageable and wide-spread than in other areas.
               </p>
               <p>
                According to those theories, victims were either drugged, kidnapped while intoxicated or simply knocked out, then dropped or dragged into the tunnels through trapdoors called deadfalls. Once in the tunnels, they were locked in specially designed prison cells and held captive until they were shipped off as slave laborers.
               </p>
               <p>
                During Prohibition, it is said that bars moved their operations underground, as well, making it easier than ever for unsuspecting victims to be shanghaied. Some researchers estimate that as many as 1,500 people a year were shanghaied through Portlandâ€™s Underground.

            Very well done. This is an essential insight:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Think in all this research ALL these places have had a similar theme, they have all apparently had TUNNELS under them.. What if they are not tunnels but a rail network? Alice's adventures are UNDERGROUND in the story, soooo they venture underground to get to "Wonderland" a place that is backwards for us normal people but the perfect playground for these sickos.

            Is this from an Archer episode?  It's almost like the whole series is based on someone's story or stories.

            "We skinned that baby alive to the scream of 'hail, Satan!' We then draped it's intestines around the candlesticks of our altar. I cut the baby up into pieces, and each person ate some. Later, I took the skull and remains home. I forced the remains down the garbage disposal to conceal evidence from the police, and then burned a candle to Satan on the baby's skull.And when the mother, my girlfriend, felt bad about giving up her baby for sacrifice and went tot he police, we decided to make an example out of her as a warning to the rest of the coven:"

             <p>
              Asheville, North Carolina. I have personally done many years of hands-on research, often dangerous, in and around the city of Asheville, NC. Asheville is known as the satanist/pagan mecca of the east coast. Nestled in the mysterious Blue Ridge mountains as they descend from Virginia, such remote mountains and valleys have long been the desired sites for bizarre and often violent cult rituals, many culminating in human sacrifice.
