            Not a rant...just need to bring some sanity to the discussion.  Yes, adult being involved in Milo's orgy=wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            Adult male attracted to post-pubescent females= biologically normal, but morally wrong, totally illegal and very creepy.  Something is wrong with you if you don't gravitate towards age-appropriate females.  Needs to be in jail if acts upon it if female is not of legal consent age.
           </p>
           <p>
            Adult male attracted to pre-pubescent child:  Should be shot on sight.

            Well, I guess it depends on how old the other members of that interracial orgy were before I condemn it as wrong.   I can't count how many guys I heard saying Brittany Spears was a really talented singer at 17 years 11 months, but then a hot MF'er at 18 years old.  That is weird and illogical.   Again, there is a whole world of difference between lusting after pre-pubescent children that have nothing sexual about them and a post-pubescent male or female.  In Milo's case, do you think he would be photographed with minors in an inappropriate manner?   No...this is a shill thread to talk shit about Milo....by your logic, as long as they are of legal age it is cool no matter how young they look, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            I saw some epicallly nice titties on a 7th grader that I gave a back massage to (at her request)....but I was also in 7th grade...I still vividly remember them though because they were the first real ones I saw.  Nice full c-cups.   Then, I dated a blow job artist from grades 10-12...we were in the same grade.  Does that make me a pedophile or abnormal somehow? No, it does not...what I am saying is that there is a world of difference between those who lust after children, like the famous "It doesn't get better than this email" vs. a 19 year old that bangs a 16 year old thinking she is 18.  Is he a pedophile?  Please explain if yes.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a shit thread lamely trying to bash Milo that has nothing to do with pizzagate and should be deleted...and oh yeah,I am a  cis male heterosexual who is also a huge Milo fan.

             Yes it's okay if you bang someone who looks young but aren't since y'know they're a bloody adult and it isn't against the law. Older looking teens and younger looking adults isn't some apples and oranges thing. I'm also a fan of milo I think he's hilarious and makes good points but that doesn't mean you should just shrug off what he said in the link above.

             well it does shine a light on Milo's position. I remember him not talking about pizzagate because of washingtonian prevention, but this makes me wonder if he was trying to whstleblow or normalize. This is worthy background information and pizzagate related. Your emotional rant about your escapades is however irrelevant to a 5-some with an adult at age 12/13

            What exactly are you trying to say?  I was full-grown (skeletally) by the time I was 14.......and at 14, Milo would have been way too old for the kind of pedophiles we are seeing.   Having sex with a post-pubescent male or female that is not of legal age (while still illegal) is not even in the same ballpark as fucking a pre-pubescent child.

             In the eyes of the law it is. By not giving out the indentities of these people involved in his own personal experiences whom he ADMITTED are paedophiles by having sex with an under age child, he's part of the problem. Oh so if someone looks old enough it's okay? What about being emotionally and mentally mature enough to properly process having sex. That's the problem these days people have this attitude well if they look mature enough physically I guess they can handle it, are you seriously saying there's nothing concerning about a 13 year old losing his virginity in an interracial orgy? How about him saying he was at a party with very young boys who were on drugs and alcohol? Get the fuck out of here

            In another segment he admitted that HE was the predator at 14 (implying he was able to consent at that age, perhaps saying consent can be given if under 18). Additionally, he said he was at a Hollywood party with some "very young boys". Maybe not involved in pizzagate or controlled oppo either but not going to lead the cavalary to fighting these monsters, instead he is prodding this for selfish fame.

              The figurehead of the "alt-right" being outed in amongst all this hopefully won't give pizzagate any less credibility in the eyes of the gen pop. If the media get stupid enough to jump on this there will be no stopping pizzagate going mainstream.
