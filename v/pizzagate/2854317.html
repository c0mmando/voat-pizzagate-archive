<p>(1988) Should Anencephalic Infants Be Used as Organ Donors?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The frontiers of organ transplantation and its scientific and ethical-legal aspects have advanced to the arena of pediatrics. The technical advances bring with them the problem of organ procurement, with estimates that the discrepancy between supply and demand for pediatric organs will be even more pronounced than in adults. In partial response to this anticipated shortage, it has been proposed that newborns with anencephaly be used as organ donors.&quot;</p>
<p>Each year, approximately 1,800 babies are born in the United States with anencephaly.4 Available data suggest that 25% to 45% are live born and at least 95% die within the first week.5 Apart from their fatal neurologic malformation, their organs are presumed suitable for transplantation.4 Moreover, prenatal α-fetoprotein and ultrasonographic screening can identify almost all anencephalics with a high level of certainty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anencephaly is a central nervous system abnormality that is characterized by congenital absence of the forebrain, skull and scalp. Some rudimentary forebrain tissue may exist and a functioning brainstem is usually present. Most anencephalic infants die within days or weeks without life-supporting interventions (2,7). One infant, ‘Baby K’, lived for 2.5 years as a result of aggressive life support.</p>
<p>Use of anencephalic infant organs for transplantation gained widespread publicity in the late 1980s after the Loma Linda Medical Centre reported a successful newborn heart transplant using a Canadian anencephalic infant, ‘Baby Gabriel’, as the organ donor. </p>
<p>In 1989, Loma Linda reported a study (6) of 12 anencephalic infants who were supported with intensive care measures for one week to facilitate declaration of brain death. Successful organ donation did not occur from any of the infants. The study authors concluded that anencephalic infants could not be used as organ donors without legal and medical changes to regulate brain death and organ donation. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In early March [2016], at the annual meeting of the British Transplantation Society, some National Health Service (NHS) transplant surgeons suggested a plan to alleviate the shortage: harvest organs from newborns who have no prospect of survival.[3] One group in particular drew their interest: children with anencephaly, a disorder that can be identified at about the twelfth week of pregnancy. Anencephalic children are missing a major part of their brain and skull, and are said to have “no chance of survival,” although such babies have been reported to live as long as one,[4] two, or even three years.[5] The surgeons further reasoned that since these babies could never experience consciousness, they would not suffer.</p>
<p>The proposal draws an ethical line by stating that, at least initially, no woman carrying an anencephalic baby would be approached until she had made a decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. If she continued, she would be “supported” in unspecified ways for the full nine months. At birth, the baby’s body would be supported by a ventilator—contrary to current NHS protocols, which prohibit life-sustaining technology for anencephalic newborns. The baby’s organs would be harvested once he was declared dead, but while his heartbeat and breathing were being maintained artificially, and before he met the legal and medical criteria. </p>

            2.5_ AMA Journal of Ethics Brain Death: At Once "Well Settled" and "Persistently Unresolved" Robert Truog, MD

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Bioethicist Alexander Capron began a recent article on the subject of brain death by noting that "
             <strong>
              If one subject in health law and bioethics can be said to be at once well settled and persistently unresolved, it is how to determine that death has occurred
             </strong>
             " [1]. The "well settled" aspect is easy to understand—thousands of deaths are diagnosed daily on the basis of cessation of pulse and respiration.
             <strong>
              A much smaller number are diagnosed on the basis of neurological criteria—so-called brain death
             </strong>
             .
             <em>
              Brain death requires the patient to be comatose, to have no detectable brainstem reflexes, and to have no neurological drive to breathe
             </em>
             , even when high levels of carbon dioxide are allowed to accumulate in the blood (as happens during the required "apnea test"). Following the
             <strong>
              diagnosis of brain death
             </strong>
             , patients may be taken to the operating room while their body is still being perfused by a beating heart for
             <em>
              recovery of organs like the heart, lungs, and kidneys.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             The "persistently unresolved" aspect of death is more subtle, and becomes apparent only on closer inspection of the definition of brain death [2,3]. According to laws in the United States, brain death requires the "irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem" [4].
             <strong>
              Currently accepted guidelines for diagnosing brain death examine many, but not all, testable brain functions [5]. Not surprisingly, the closer one looks at brain function, the more one is likely to find. One brain function that is often present
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem, in sum, is that
             <strong>
              current testing for brain death focuses on tests that have been selected because they are straightforward and easy to perform at the bedside, rather than focusing on functions that are essential to physiological integrity and that would truly answer the question of whether there is "the complete absence of all functions of the entire brain," as required by law.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Given all of these problems with the concept of brain death, what are possible solutions?
             <strong>
              The current approach is simply to ignore all of these problems and inconsistencies
             </strong>
             . Surprisingly, perhaps, this approach has much to recommend it.
             <em>
              Our primary strategy for organ procurement and transplantation relies heavily upon the diagnosis of death by neurological criteria.
             </em>
             Any serious disruption in the transplantation enterprise could jeopardize opportunities to save the lives of those in need of vital organs. As epitomized in the name of the old game show "Truth or Consequences,"
             <strong>
              sometimes it is better to sacrifice devotion to the truth in order to optimize important consequences
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             [Reform] would require
             <strong>
              a complete restructuring of our ethical and legal approach to organ donation
             </strong>
             . This is unlikely to happen, as long as the "persistently unresolved" issues discussed above remain quietly ignored in relation to the "well settled" aspects of the diagnosis of death and the procurement of transplantable organs.

            , this is missing a couple of key pieces of information. First, where is the source that supports this statement?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Now, parents are even encouraged to carry their children to term so they can be harvested.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Second, you say this is related to PG because "the biomedical industry is legally abusing and harvesting the organs of living children" yet the supporting link you provide for the AMA statement on this is decades old and also refutes the claim, stating:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Courts have said that anencephalic babies fall under the purview of the Americans With Disabilities Act, deserving all the medical care that society can provide.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You're missing any information at all about the current position of the AMA or what the current legal situation is, and your three last links of actual tissue donations all emphasize how difficult and rare it was for parents to attempt to donate their children's organs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate as defined for this sub is an organized attempt by a corrupt group of wealthy, globalist powermongers who use the abuse of kids to keep their chokehold on power. You've demonstrated no connection between that and parents who want their terminally ill kids' lives to help other terminally ill kids. It's certainly likely that biomed profiteers would try to take advantage of such parents, but that is speculative. This thread needs to be posted in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I'll give this the 24 Hour Grace flair in case you have more evidence that actually establishes a connection to PG.

             5_ You've demonstrated no connection between [Elite] and parents who want their terminally ill kids' lives to help other terminally ill kids. It's certainly likely that biomed profiteers would try to take advantage of such parents, but that is speculative.

             A. The BBC article clearly states that organs are not going to just "terminally ill kids". They are also going to adults.
            </p>
            <p>
             A newborn baby, who lived for less than two hours, became Britain's youngest-ever organ donor last year. Doctors at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, carried out the pioneering surgery three minutes after Teddy Houlston died on April 22. His kidneys were then used to save an
             <strong>
              <em>
               ADULT'S
              </em>
             </strong>
             life in Leeds....
             <strong>
              Teddy's kidneys
             </strong>
             - which
             <strong>
              were unaffected by the rare brain disease he had - will be able to grow inside another living body, making them
              <em>
               suitable for donation to an adult
              </em>
             </strong>
             , as well as a small baby. Teddy lived for 100 minutes after he was born. After he died, doctors would have moved quickly to perform the rare and intricate operation to remove his kidneys and use them to save another life.
             <strong>
              His case puts the focus back on neo-natal organ donation as a way of increasing the number of organ donors in the future.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             B. The other articles clearly state that the ORGANS harvested went to Biomedical Profiteers. This isn't speculative. It's happening already.

              Also, you are swimming upstream with the "definition of brain death" claim. You will have to explain exactly what the definition is now, how they are trying to change it, and who exactly is pushing for it. No generalities. If it's just a few people who are members of the AMA, no dice. The kids you are focusing on in this thread are literally born without most of the brain. In practical terms, many people using common sense will see them as born "brain dead" whatever the legal definition, and see allowing their parents to donate their organs to save the lives of other kids and even adults as the opposite of "abuse."

               Not true. Both the public and parts of the medical community pushed back because it's literally redefining life &amp; consciousness so we can feed the organ donor and biomedical industries need for  Neonatal organs, tissues, and blood. So they temporarily caved, and now they are again pushing...
              </p>
              <p>
               It's pushing abortion outside of the womb, to infanticide once the child is born, and it violates the Hippocratic Oath of "do no harm" to the patient.

            <p>
             Yet the medical associations have been talking about it since the 80's. It's rare &amp; difficult compared to conventional organ donations, but it is rapidly increasing in prevalence. These Mainstream articles are Propogandizing the practice and don't mention the extensive 30+ year medical legacy of the practice. Also they all mention that the parents are now "spreading awareness" or "education" to increase the practice, and that a few of these parents are involved in the medical industry themselves.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             This article was published in 1995 by the American Medical Association. Since then, no US court has ruled against an anencephalic child's organs being harvested. (although surprisingly Canada has). And like i posted, multiple anencephalic kids have been used as organ donors in the US.
            </p>
            <p>
             The AMA is the largest association of physicians in the US. The AMA also publishes a list of Physician Specialty Codes which are the standard method in the U.S. for identifying physician and practice specialties. Doctors use these "ethical guidelines" to cover their ass. Similarly, as the largest medical body in the US, AMA statements inform Judges and Legislators.

             “wanted”—-their-organs
            </p>
            <p>
             The American Medical Association (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs dealt with this problem by recommending suspension of the “dead donor rule” if the parents consented and various safeguards were put in place. In sharp contrast, the policies of the Canadian Paediatric Society (1990, reaffirmed in 2005) and of the American Academy of Pediatrics (1992) stated that anencephalic infants were not appropriate organ donors, and held firm to the prevailing legal and medical criteria for brain death.[6]
             <strong>
              The AMA changed course, and its current policy now also affirms the “dead donor rule,” but it does allow mechanical support to keep the organs viable until death is declared.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Now that sounds good right? The AMA backtracked and says the baby has to be dead. But how do they define death?

             <p>
              In the context of prospective organ donation from an anencephalic newborn, physicians may ethically:
             </p>
             <p>
              (a) Provide ventilator assistance and other medical therapies that are necessary to sustain organ perfusion and viability until such time as a determination of death can be made in accordance with accepted medical standards.

             <p>
              (b) Retrieve and transplant the organs of an anencephalic newborn only after such determination of death, and in accordance with ethics guidance for transplantation and for medical decisions for minors.

            <p>
             Thus, the AMA created an exclusive category for Anencephalics so they can more easily &amp; quickly declare "brain-death". Yet these infants are kept on life-support through this declared "brain death" (like Terry Schiavo) so that the organs don't fail. Basically, the body is alive, and the brain is maintaining organ function, but the infant is still declared brain-dead. During this living "death" the organs are harvested. They have to keep the child's body alive, and harvest quickly, otherwise, the organs fail.

             <p>
              According to these links, the AMA does not currently allow harvesting of organs from any donor prior to brain stem death, precisely because proposals from some members advocating the idea over the years were deemed too dangerous to medical ethics.
             </p>
             <p>
              After carefully perusing the massive dump of links you have added, I have to conclude that yes, there is an element in the AMA that is pushing for child organ harvesting. But the evidence you've presented shows the medical community overall has told those people no. Your title claim that "Anencephalic Newborns are kept alive while their Organs are Harvested" is therefore factually inaccurate, per Rule 2. The kids must have loss of brain stem function (brain death).
             </p>
             <p>
              One reason the community has repeatedly affirmed the current submission rules is to prevent attempts to cover up accurate exposure of how and why the global elite abuse kids with click-baity fake news claims that discredit accurate research with a morass of provably "wacked conspiracy claims." We can't allow inaccurate stuff.
             </p>
             <p>
              You've definitely turned up evidence that there are members of the medical establishment that would like to harvest anencephalic infant organs and even redefine "brain death" in order to do so. Unfortunately, you haven't done so in an accurate manner we can leave up on the board. I would recommend you choose the most salient, accurate links supporting that and rewrite this in a less click-baity manner. Don't try to tell people what to think -- present the facts and let people do their own thinking.

                Yet you are trying to claim these babies "are kept alive while their Organs are Harvested" as if that was current, established policy. Your entire post is misleading, and based on this latest comment of yours, this is likely a complex attempt to force moderators into a position to remove a post on a legitimate, possibly relevant topic of concern by deliberately making a submission that violates the rules, burying relevant supporting links, characterizing links as showing one thing when they actually show the opposite, and then trying to cite those links as evidence mods are being unfair in the hopes users will be too lazy to spend the hours you forced mods to waste vetting the post.

                 You are citing a 1992 FLORIDA STATE COURT RULING saying anencephalics can't be used for organ donations because they are breathing and their heart is beating. IT EXPLICITLY REJECTS BRAIN DEATH as being a valid justification for organ harvesting. NO RULING HAS EVER REAFFIRMED THIS. AND IT ONLY APPLIES IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA under "Florida Common Law"

                <p>
                 How hard is that to understand? The 92 Florida ruling used the cardio-pulmonary standard of death. Now the current AMA NATIONAL GUIDELINES use "brain-death", instead of
                 <em>
                  heart-death
                 </em>

                <p>
                 I am citing a 1992 AMA decision that has been consistently REAFFIRMED NATIONALLY, which confirms "BRAIN DEATH" as a valid standard. EVEN WHILE THE BABY IS BREATHING AND THEIR HEART IS BEATING.

                 <p>
                  "The new opinion stated that the newborns could be kept on ventilators and provided other treatment to sustain "organ perfusion and viability until such time as a determination of death can be made in accordance with accepted medical standards and relevant law."

                <p>
                 They say "determination of death" which includes the loosely defined "brain-death". The 1989 decision required
                 <strong>
                  proof
                 </strong>
                 of

                  "neurological devastation"
                 </strong>
                 . The 1992 decision relaxes the standard to "death" which is a lower standard and doesn't require complete neurological devastation. The doctor can simply declare "brain-death"

A lead nurse has also been appointed to co-ordinate efforts to educate NHS staff about talking to parents about such a sensitive issue. Under the proposals, midwives and other NHS workers are to be educated about the possibility of using babies’ organs in transplants."

                  Where did you cite a case where a child who still had brain function was cut open and their organs removed, resulting in their death, Nomo? You are claiming kids are being parted out while they are still alive. You have to back that up -- and not in a way that is buried under six tons of stuff that doesn't actually show that happened.

                   Because no Florida statute applies to the present case, the determination of death in this instance must be judged against the common law cardiopulmonary standard. The evidence shows that T.A.C.P.'s heart was beating and she was breathing at the times in question. Accordingly, she was not dead under Florida law, and no donation of her organs would have been legal."

                Indeed. And again, I note this is one guy's opinion, it is discussing proposed changes, and concludes redefining brain death to allow greater leeway in organ harvesting is unlikely to happen:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 One approach, which I have explored in more detail elsewhere [3],
                 <strong>
                  would
                 </strong>
                 reexamine the ethical requirements for organ donation. We currently require all organ donors to be diagnosed as dead, but as shown in the discussion above, diagnosing death is not as straightforward as it may first appear. Alternatively, we could allow patients and their families to request to be organ donors only in circumstances where the death of the patient that would follow the procurement of vital organs would be seen by the patient and family as a small loss in comparison to the opportunity to give life to others. Obviously, this would only be the case for patients with extremely profound neurological damage or patients within moments of death from cardiac or pulmonary failure. The main advantage of this approach is that it would "uncouple" the ethics of organ donation from the problematic determination of death. The main disadvantage of this approach is that
                 <strong>
                  it would require a complete restructuring of our ethical and legal approach to organ donation. This is unlikely to happen, as long as the "persistently unresolved" issues discussed above remain quietly ignored in relation to the "well settled" aspects of the diagnosis of death and the procurement of transplantable organs.
                 </strong>

                  Given all of these problems with the concept of brain death, what are possible solutions? The current approach is simply to ignore all of these problems and inconsistencies. Surprisingly, perhaps, this approach has much to recommend it. Our primary strategy for organ procurement and transplantation relies heavily upon the diagnosis of death by neurological criteria. Any serious disruption in the transplantation enterprise could jeopardize opportunities to save the lives of those in need of vital organs. As epitomized in the name of the old game show "Truth or Consequences," sometimes it is better to sacrifice devotion to the truth in order to optimize important consequences [7].
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On the other hand, WE COULD take a fresh look at the foundations of the ethics of organ transplantation. One approach, which I have explored in more detail elsewhere [3], would REEXMINE the ETHICAL REQUIREMENTS for organ donation. We currently require all organ donors to be diagnosed as dead, but as shown in the discussion above, diagnosing death is not as straightforward as it may first appear. Alternatively, we could allow patients and their families to request to be organ donors only in circumstances where the death of the patient that would follow the procurement of vital organs would be seen by the patient and family as a small loss in comparison to the opportunity to give life to others. Obviously, this would only be the case for patients with extremely profound neurological damage or patients within moments of death from cardiac or pulmonary failure. The main advantage of this approach is that it would "uncouple" the ethics of organ donation from the problematic determination of death. The main disadvantage of this approach is that it would require a complete restructuring of our ethical and legal approach to organ donation. THIS IS UNLIKELY to happen, as long as the "persistently unresolved" issues discussed above remain quietly ignored in relation to the "well settled" aspects of the diagnosis of death and the procurement of transplantable organs.

             Fetal Harvest: Anencephalic Babies Are Now “Wanted”—For Their Organs
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              For although about 4,000 babies with anencephaly are born in the US each year,[9] in the UK, only about a dozen are born every year. The rest—at least 230 annually—are aborted. Yet British transplant surgeons anticipate that, under their proposal, at least 100 anencephalic babies annually will become organ donors.
              <strong>
               This means that all ten or twelve women who will carry their babies to term regardless would need to consent to donation, while another 90 or so women who would otherwise abort
               <em>
                must be persuaded
               </em>
               to carry their babies to term for transplant purposes.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              But how can the latter goal be reached if a woman cannot be approached about donation until after she’s decided against abortion? No need to worry:
              <strong>
               <em>
                the surgeons are already discussing whether to amend their proposal to allow them to offer the woman the option of organ donation at the time the diagnosis of anencephaly is made.
               </em>
              </strong>
              If this is done, and if it motivates a woman to carry her child to term and give birth, would she be doing so because she loves her child, or only for the sake of some other family’s child? Wouldn’t the latter amount to treating the anencephalic baby merely as a medical resource, an object to serve “the greater good”?
             </p>
             <p>
              It is no secret that under the current regime in both Britain and America, women who are carrying a child with a disability are often pressured to terminate their pregnancy. I have been told about more than one pregnant woman being taken aside and quizzed by the nurse, “Is your husband forcing you to continue this pregnancy?” Frequently, the only option she is offered is abortion.
              <strong>
               It is ironic, to say the least, that these brave women’s refusals to abort are now being lauded rather than scorned—but only because the utilitarian goal posts have shifted toward “using” their babies’ organs
              </strong>

             From experience an anecheplic child can never survive long after birth. A few days maybe a few months at max, so doctors normally give an option to terminate pregnancy. They're placed on life support from birth, as far as organ harvesting/donating, I was told not possible but that was in 1999.

As Dr. Edmund Pellegrino, a virtuous physician by any standard, reminds us in the context of organ transplantation, “No person should be sacrificed for the good of another.”

            Pretty horrific stuff...as usual.  I haven't seen Gosnell yet, but I've heard it is shocking without being graphic.Nice write-up OP.

            I had an anencephalic child, and this is very disturbing to read. Sick people.
