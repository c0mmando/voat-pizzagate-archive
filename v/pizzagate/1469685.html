            He's being reprogrammed. Simple as that.

            Best thing he ever could have done is give up the fame and talk to us. The audience that saw him as "an entertainer" might not have listened, but we would have.

            For now, I just watched the 5 first minutes and he already catch me about the "utopia world" subject.
           </p>
           <p>
            He is totally right about it, whenever I have talked with people about our world could be different and better than it is, their first instinct is to trying to find a breach to discredit the "utopia" instead of finding a way to contribute to the idea.
They are relying on the idea that the world is what it is, that it couldn't be different or that if it was different, it would be worse (well, it's fair from them, as europeans or americans, our "prison cells"/lifes are pretty comfy and if people has a worse situation, it's not our problem right ?). 
And the people I've been talking about this are not damn stupid redneck, they are fucking engineers (but it seems that for a majority of the people, the only interest of life is to get money and a hot sex-partner, a thing I think induced by our society and medias but too long subject to abord it here).
           </p>
           <p>
            Although it seems that he is thinking a lot before speaking in a natural way I encounter a lot when people talks about something that they care a lot but that they are not used to talk about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doesn't seems like shill to me, need more digging about him, maybe compare previous interviews to this one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you know when this interview occurred ? Why ? (with reliable source ofc)
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit : seen the whole video, doesn't seems like a crazy person at all to me, even a lot more human like than a lot of politicians/celebs I've seen those days. 
Though he really seems to be a bit anxious, thinking a lot for a person used to media and interviews (maybe he is really concerned about something and his unconscious bring it in regularly whereas he try to avoid it).
Don't have time now to dig previous interviews, is it a regular behavior for him ?

            I really fucking hate Kanye, but as soon as I heard him ranting about JayZ crazy illuminati shit I'll admit I got worried.  Super hopeful someone here can figure something out. It's extremely likely that he knows something.
