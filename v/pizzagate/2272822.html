            It is happening and all will fold into taking out many elite pedos along the way.  How do you think they have gotten away with this Crime Cabal for so long? Because of blackmail and compromise.  They set up the brownstones with the kiddies and then video did the rest. They could continue to keep these politicians silenced and in compliance their whole adult lifewith the threat of exposing them.  So when these assholes in power are taken out will we hopefully, see things swing the other way.  Will it remove all the pedos, no, but enough for a good start.

             I believe it was FBIAnon who said in 2016 that the draining would see the big names go down for corruption but if we want to expose their pedo cults we need to redpill and get the average joe talking about it. It makes sense to me. Once they are convicted of corruption, it makes that rabbit hole a lot bigger and easier to climb down. If the clinton foundation is found complicit in dodgy dealings, it will only lead to further investigations i.e. Epstein would be the next port of call for the MSM after that. Especially now with the information coming forqard regarding the deal he took.

              It is worthwhile to go back and read the FBIAnon posts knowing now about Uranium1.  The child rapists and murderers are true monsters, but they're also the ones selling fissionable material off to rogue states.

              So, there is some grousing about this thread being in PG Main, and that's fair.  It probably does belong in PGW or some other sub, but the connection to Pizzagate is clearly there.

            From Imperator Rex:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <ol>
             <li>
              Oh, man. If I’m looking at things right, this OIG report is going to stun the nation. This is going to be MASSIVE.
             </li>
             <li>
              POTUS may already have this report, given his tweets over the last 24 hours. Trump certainly knows about it. Even he seems shocked.
             </li>
             <li>
              Forget Watergate. Forget any scandal you have ever heard about, researched or read about in your lifetimes. The scale of what is going to emerge in the next days and weeks will be unlike anything you have ever considered possible.
             </li>
             <li>
              In the frame - the entire network that enabled Hillary Clinton’s corrupt campaign is about to be exposed &amp; routed. This is the same network - but not all of it - that enabled Obama’s corruption, as well. But there's so much more that will probably be revealed.
             </li>
             <li>
              Here’s the full original statement by the Office of the Inspector General dated Jan 12, 2017 -
              <a href="https://oig.justice.gov/press/2017/2017-01-12.pdf">
               https://oig.justice.gov/press/2017/2017-01-12.pdf
              </a>
              … In this thread, let’s just consider the specific allegations they mention in the statement.
             </li>
             <li>
              'Allegations that Department or FBI policies or procedures were not followed in connection with, or in actions leading up to or related to, the FBI Director’s public announcement on July 5, 2016, /..
7./...and the Director’s letters to Congress on October 28 and November 6, 2016, and that certain underlying investigative decisions were based on improper considerations;’.
             </li>
             <li>
              Targets : Comey, Lynch, Bill Clinton, McCabe, Strzok. Anyone involved in the fraudulent clearance of Hillary Clinton by James Comey on that fateful day in July, as well as the farcical shut down/cover up of the Human Abedin email trove (November) is about to be nailed.
             </li>
             <li>
              Those not exposed have either flipped on a plea deal, or WILL be exposed. All of them. Speculating - but I now suspect Strzok &amp; perhaps Lisa Page flipped and were ‘recruited’ by Mueller into his SC, in order to tell the OIG everything they knew.
             </li>
             <li>
              Next - 'Allegations that the FBI Deputy Director should have been recused from participating in certain investigative matters;’ Targets - Andrew McCabe &amp; Comey.
             </li>
             <li>
              This will expose McCabe’s links to the Clintons, especially his accepting some $700,000 as a bribe from the Clintons to cover up the investigations into her classified material. As well as any other shonky conduct he has been up to over the years.
             </li>
             <li>
              Next - 'Allegations that the Department’s Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs improperly disclosed non-public information to the Clinton campaign and/or should have been recused from participating in certain matters;’
             </li>
             <li>
              Target - Peter Kadzic. This will expose Peter Kadzik’s role investigating &amp; working with Comey / McCabe to shut down the Human Abedin email trove:
              <a href="https://twitter.com/JTF_News/status/793189989370720257">
               https://twitter.com/JTF_News/status/793189989370720257
              </a>
             </li>
             <li>
              And also Kadzik's general collusion with the Clinton Campaign itself (note - this email was sent from his gmail to Podesta):
              <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/793831278382428164">
               https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/793831278382428164
              </a>
             </li>
             <li>
              Next - 'Allegations that Department and FBI employees improperly disclosed non-public information;’ This will expose the LEAKERS. But also the entire Comey/ McCabe/Kadzik network within the FBI &amp; DoJ may be in the frame here.
             </li>
             <li>
              Note that this is about to drop just after
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/GenFlynn">
               @GenFlynn
              </a>
              quietly departs the scene. Thomas Wictor’s important analysis has revealed Flynn’s masterful role in identifying these individuals.

              </a>
             </li>
             <li>
              Next - 'Allegations that decisions regarding the timing of the FBI’s release of certain FOIA documents on October 30 and November 1, 2016, and the use of a Twitter account to publicize same, were influenced by improper considerations.' Oh boy. This is EXTREMELY interesting.
             </li>
             <li>
              On October 30, 2016
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/FBIRecordsVault">
               @FBIRecordsVault
              </a>
              , a twitter account that had been inactive since 8 October 2015, suddenly exploded into life again. There were TWENTY tweets released on October 30, 2016.
             </li>
             <li>
              These included innocuous tweets about Eric Trump, the father of DJT:
              <a href="https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637173937807360">
               https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637173937807360
              </a>
              … And Nikola Tesla :
              <a href="https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637181944672256">
               https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637181944672256
              </a>
              … But there were other tweets, as well.
              <a href="https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637181944672256">
               https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637181944672256
              </a>
             </li>
             <li>
              About General Petraus, whose career was ended by Obama for mishandling of classified information :
              <a href="https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637194917728256">
               https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637194917728256
              </a>
             </li>
             <li>
              And about a certain infamous politician who had committed far more serious breaches, but always seemed to skate - Hillary Rodham Clinton :
              <a href="https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637192392679428">
               https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637192392679428
              </a>
             </li>
             <li>
              On 1 November, the same twitter account tweeted about FBI investigations into a certain infamous President who always seemed to skate, as well - Bill Clinton:
              <a href="https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637192392679428">
               https://twitter.com/FBIRecordsVault/status/792637192392679428
              </a>
             </li>
             <li>
              Quote - 'The bulk of these records come from a 2001 FBI investigation into the pardon of Marc Rich (1934-2013), aka Marcell David Reich, by President Clinton in 2001.'
             </li>
             <li>
              Targets : Bill Clinton, Eric Holder (the Assistant AG who cleared Rich) &amp; John Podesta (Bill Clinton’s Chief of Staff). Oh, another thing.
             </li>
             <li>
              Following the pardon, the same Marc Rich helped Bill Clinton set up his Foundation, which used the front of a charity as cover for a massive criminal enterprise involving pay to play, money laundering, /...
             </li>
             <li>
              /..racketeering &amp; tax evasion - at the very least. Crimes Rich had a particular expertise in:
              <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Rich#U.S._indictment_and_pardon">
               https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Rich#U.S._indictment_and_pardon
              </a>
              …
             </li>
             <li>
              The final sentence of the OIG statement is often overlooked, but VERY important. 'Finally, if circumstances warrant, the OIG will consider including other issues that may arise during the course of the review.'
             </li>
             <li>
              This essentially authorizes the OIG &amp; DOJ to investigate anything they want arising from the above, which is pretty much everything the Clintons &amp; perhaps even Obama himself, have been up to.
             </li>
             <li>
              Folks, I’m going to say it : #TheStorm IS ABOUT TO HIT. And it's unlike anything we have ever seen before. BUCKLE UP. The end.
