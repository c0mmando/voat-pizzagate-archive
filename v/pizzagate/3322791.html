<p>An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. </p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old wealthy hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on &quot;dozens&quot; of victims as young as 14.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein’s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,&quot; the statement said. </p>
<p>&quot;Staff, supporters of the foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein’s New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. </p>
<p>He’s not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and he has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.”</p>

<p><strong>On Saturday evening, Christine Pelosi, a Democratic National Committee official and daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, warned conspicuously that it is &quot;quite likely that some of our faves are implicated&quot; in the &quot;horrific&quot; sex-trafficking case.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This Epstein case is horrific and the young women deserve justice,&quot; Pelosi tweeted. &quot;It is quite likely that some of our faves are implicated but we must follow the facts and let the chips fall where they may - whether on Republicans or Democrats.&quot;</p>

            Strange lights have also been reported in the skies in New Zealand - including Kaikoura - before earthquakes, known as earthquake lightning.
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA trove cites the Kaikoura incident, which was referred to in a publication called the Journal of Scientific Exploration in 1987.

            "The New Zealand UFO sightings of December 31, 1978, are unique among civilian UFO reports because there is a large amount of documentary evidence which includes the recollections of seven witnesses, two tape recordings made during the sightings, the detection of some unusual ground and airplane radar targets, and a 16mm colour movie."
