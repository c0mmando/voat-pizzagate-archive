<p><strong>Subud Cult and Connections to CDAN piece about Monica Petersen/Chris Cornell Suspicious Deaths, and Possible Connections to a Haiti-based Child Sex Ring</strong></p>
<p>Considering that the 5 Arquette kids literally grew up on a Subud compound, according to completely mainstream sources, I think it’s time to turn attention to another of the Arquette kids who also grew up on the Subud compound: <strong>Alexis Arquette.</strong> Alexis Arquette (formerly Robert Arquette), was an actor like the rest of the Arquette’s, and was a transgender activist who received sex reassignment surgery and identified as female. <strong>Alexis died in 2016, according to the official story, from a cardiac arrest that was attributed to her poor health due to being HIV-positive</strong>.</p>
<p>As I’m sure a lot of people on this subverse know, there was a Crazy Days and Nights (CDAN) <a href="https://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2018/07/blind-items-revealed-40.html">blind post</a> back in July 2018, (link here to a <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2620180">Voat post </a>about it) <strong>claiming to link the suspicious death of human trafficking investigator Monica Petersen to Alexis Arquette, as well as to Chris Cornell</strong>. For those who don’t know, Monica Petersen worked as a researcher for the Human Trafficking Center (HTC) at the University of Denver, one of the few graduate programs in the country that focuses on researching human trafficking. According to her own obituary, Monica also had a Masters degree from the Josef Korbel School of International Studies, also at the University of Denver. (See this Voat thread for the most comprehensive research thread I could find on Voat about Peterson’s death). Monica Petersen was in Haiti in 2016, when according to the December 2016 Washington Post article about Petersen’s death, she was working as an English teacher and “…committed suicide but the circumstances weren’t clear.” The WaPo article attributes the statement that Petersen’s death was due to suicide, specifically to the Director of the Human Trafficking Center, Claude D’Estree. However, there have been many claims that Petersen’s death was due to her investigation of a human trafficking ring in Haiti, specifically a child sex trafficking ring. </p>
<p>I think it’s worth digging into the major claims made in the CDAN blind about Monica Petersen/Alexis Arquette/ Chris Cornell:</p>
<p><strong>According to the CDAN blind, Monica Petersen along with her NGO (presumably the Human Trafficking Center (HTC) at U of Denver), were asked by the FBI to investigate a child sex ring</strong>. Monica Petersen was herself apparently getting multiple “tips” about men involved with this alleged child sex ring.  This alleged child sex ring, which Monica was supposedly receiving information about, allegedly produced huge amounts of child porn for the Dark Web. And supposedly the ring was responsible for producing (recently, at least as of 2016) the 50,000 images of child pornography that Glee-actor Mark Salling got arrested for. This was before Salling’s own death after his arrest, officially by hanging.</p>
<p><strong>For reasons not explained in the CDAN blind, the investigation (being led presumably by members of the FBI, Monica Petersen, and possibly other HTC members) into this child sex ring, lead to Alexis Arquette as some kind “person of interest.”</strong> Alexis Arquette very much wanted to help the investigators, and told them about an unnamed former romantic partner, another Hollywood actor. </p>
<p>Alexis Arquette told investigators that this former romantic partner bragged to her about having access to kids for making child porn. Supposedly, Alexis’s unnamed romantic partner also told her the names of other people, who she herself did not know, who were allegedly also involved with this child sex ring (whether they were victims or abusers, is not clear). Alexis Arquette then got in touch with Monica Petersen, who she supposedly was already a long-time personal friend of. Alexis got in touch with Petersen to pass along the names of these people who were all allegedly connected with this child sex ring, to aid Petersen in her investigation. Within a month of doing this, if the CDAN piece is to be believed, Alexis was murdered, and her already-poor health condition due to her HIV-positive status was used as a cover.</p>
<p><strong>According to the blind, Monica Petersen went to Haiti, because Alexis Arquette told her the “people” connected with the alleged child sex ring were located in Haiti</strong>. (Again, it is unclear if the “people” mean abusers, victims, or both). Presumably, at least according to the blind, Monica was working with members of the FBI and (possibly) members of the Human Trafficking Center from the University of Denver, during her investigation in Haiti. Petersen supposedly kept backing up the evidence she was gathering in Haiti by sending it to family members out of the country, who then backed up Monica’s info on USB drives. If the blind is to be believed, once in Haiti, Petersen started to seriously investigate and ask questions about the alleged child sex ring. Shortly after, Monica was then allegedly murdered because of it. Petersen officially passed away Nov. 13th, 2016 in Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. </p>
<p>A few months after Monica Petersen’s death, <strong>Chris Cornell was apparently in touch with an unnamed woman who had some kind of (unexplained) personal connection with Monica Petersen</strong>. This unnamed woman supposedly was in touch with Petersen right up until before her death. She also was in possession of a USB drive containing at least some of the evidence Petersen had been sending out of the country, as part of her alleged investigation in Haiti. The unnamed woman claimed to Chris Cornell, that one of the last things Monica wrote about before her death, related directly to Chris Cornell. This unnamed woman was supposedly living in the same town where Petersen was living before her trip to Haiti. Since Petersen was working in Denver, at the University of Denver, as a researcher for the HTC right before her trip to Haiti (at least as late as June 2016 according to the WaPo article about Petersen’s death), I would assume the town the woman was living in, would have to be Denver or somewhere in the surrounding area. </p>
<p>Again, according to the blind, the unnamed woman, presumably living in Denver, offered to give Chris Cornell the actual USB drive with Monica Petersen’s investigative info, presumably including the info related directly to him. Chris Cornell allegedly told the unnamed woman that he would be in (presumably, Denver), “in a couple weeks”, and that he could pick up Monica’s USB drive from the unnamed woman then. <strong>A couple days before he could go to meet the unnamed woman, Chris Cornell was then allegedly murdered</strong>.  Chris Cornell died on May 18th, 2017 (only about 6 months after Monica’s death), officially also due to suicide from hanging, in a hotel room in Detroit. </p>
