<p>There is much negativity on the web surrounding this man, and the jury is still out as far as I am concerned, but one thing is for certain - he has dedicated decades of his life fighting for others and comes across as an intelligent, well-educated, kind, and rational individual who has stood his ground no matter what.  Annette has been called every name in the book, yet perseveres.  Negative criticism about him far outweighs accolades.  This post serves to provide more substantive info about this man than what has previously been reported on this forum.</p>
<p>Kevin Annette comes across as a sincere man on a spiritual mission to correct the grave injustices in the world - particularly the abuse of the weak, namely children.  His drive and mission go way beyond the legal aspect.  He is primarily involved in accelerating an awareness process - by pointing out rights that people naturally have, averse to authority or hierarchy, and by encouraging people to reclaim these rights.</p>
<p>Annette, 57- years old and a Canadian, graduated from the University of British Columbia with a BS in anthropology and political science.  He then graduated from the Vancouver School of Theology with a Master of Divinity and was ordained.  From early in his ministry, he was puzzled by total absence of indigenous people from church and set out to discover why this should be.  Going down this road proved disastrous.  His marriage and family were torn apart which rendered him destitute.  
</p>
<p>A few of the stories that Annette circulated about the indigenous:
Back in the 1930\'s, a team of German doctors arrived at the Kuper Island residential school and began conducting strange medical experiments on children by injecting them with some sort of toxin.  Several children were killed as a result.  In the 1950\'s and 1960\'s, aboriginal children at a Vancouver Island medical research facility were tortured with electrodes implanted in their skulls.  At the Hobbema and Saddle Lake Indian residential schools in Alberta, children were incinerated in furnaces.  At St. Anne\'s Indian residential school in Ontario, children were executed in an electric chair.  At McGill University in Montreal, there is a mass grave containing the bodies of aboriginal children killed in experiments undertaken by CIA\'s MK-Ultra program.

<p>Welcome to The International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State (ITCCS), founded by Kevin Annette on June 15, 2010.  Their mandate is:
(1) To lawfully prosecute those people and institutions responsible for the exploitation, trafficking, torture, and murder of children, past and present, and
(2) To stop these and other criminal actions by Church and State, including the disestablishment of those said institutions.</p>
<p>On April 15, 2018, Annett has announced that a global campaign will commence to halt child trafficking and other genocidal actions by the Vatican, other churches, governments, and corporations.</p>
<p>The ITCCS website reveals it was founded with a twofold purpose: to unite across borders all those who have been harmed by church and state and to stop the crimes of these institutions, especially those inflicted on children, human liberties, and planet Earth.  
</p>
<p>Annette claims the ITCCS  arose from among survivors of those crimes with the understanding gained from bitter experience that a new international ethos and legal system is required to confront and expatriate crimes committed by institutions of church and state, especially those historically immune from prosecution, like the Church of Rome. </p>
<p>Resulting from the above,  The International Common Law Court of Justice (ICLCJ) was founded as a lawful Citizens\' Tribunal of Conscience on September 15, 2012 in Brussels.  The ICLCJ was established as the legal and judicial arm of the ITCCS with the help of legal experts, judges, and survivors of church terror and imperial genocide in more than a dozen countries.</p>
<p>The first case on the docket of the ICLCJ comnenced on November 6, 2012 and addressed deliberate genocide of indigenous children in Canada by the Vatican, the Crown of England and other parties.  In a final verdict on February 25, 2013, the Court and it\'s 58 sworn citizen jurors successfully indicted and prosecuted 30 defendants for perpetrating or concealing this genocide.  Those defendants included then Pope Benedict, Joseph Ratzwinger, former Cardinal Tarcissio Bertone,  Elizabeth Windsor, &quot;Queen of England,&quot; and Prime Minister Stephen Harper.</p>
<p>After an &quot;exhaustive&quot; presentation of evidence and a refusal by defendants  to respond  or refute the evidence, all of the defendants were found guilty of criminal conspiracy and genocide and were sentenced in absentia to 25 years in prison and the forfeit of all the wealth and property of their estates and institutions.  Citizen arrest warrants were issued and on August 4, 2013, the Vatican and the Crown of England were declared to be transnational Criminal bodies under international law and were lawfully disestablished.</p>
<p>Crazy, huh?  But you cannot deny the passion and perseverance behind it!

<p>Kevin Annette became discredited.  Through Alfred Webre, Annett had a steady platform to share his findings on a regular basis.  Through frequent interviews, he was able to publicize the progress the ITCCS made, however, by the end of 2014, Alfred Webre dropped Kevin like a rock.  Alfred accused him that the ITCCS court had never existed and that the alleged lawsuit against the Vatican and British government had never taken place.  Furthermore, he insinuated that Annette operated alone like a Wizard of Oz while pretending to be part of a large organization.  Annett denied Alfred the names of the involved judges, prosecutors, and jury members.  He was concerned they would lose their anonymity.  Webre broke all ties with Annett, smeared his reputation, and discredited the entire ITCCS.  
</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that Annett has operated solely all this time.  He had been the victim of a smear and slander campaign for years.  It appears that the break with Webre was the final blow.  An interesting fact is that Webre revealed he had a Jesuit background but had broken from them and that a family member of his held a high position with the

            Hi 13Buddha, I am very glad you have made this post. I've been hoping for months someone would do a deep dive to determine whether this guy was nuts, a disinfo agent, or what. I have to give you the 24 Hour flair, though, because you need links supporting each of the major elements you've included here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully some others can help dig up more information about Annett. Due to his disingenuous practices (running multiple websites that appear independent to comment on his activities and buttress his claims, posing as a legal authority, etc.) I fear he is exploiting victims for the purpose of advancing the deep state psyop that citizen child advocates are all loons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do reply to this comment and let me know when you've added all the links to where you got this information, and I will promptly remove the flair. :-)
