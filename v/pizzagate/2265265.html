<p>Joe even joked about her death on the Imus radio show:  Imus said, &quot;Don\'t be afraid to be funny, because you are funny. I asked you why you aren\'t in Congress. You said that you had sex with the intern, and then you had to kill her.&quot; Scarborough laughed and replied, &quot;Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?&quot;</p>

            Long-time lurker. Created an account to address this entry.
           </p>
           <p>
            I met Joe Scarborough in 1993 and volunteered to work in his Congressional campaign. I also worked in his District office, in his campaign office and at the weekly newsmagazine, The Florida Sun, he started up in Pensacola.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1995 or '96, I started work in the Congressional District Office in Pensacola, and worked there until 1998, when I'd had enough of up-close politics. Not long after that, Joe called and ask me to help him launch a weekly tabloid newsmagazine in Pensacola. I did help with that, and he hired me to work at the The Florida Sun during its first year. That's where I was working when Klausitis died. I did not know her. I had never seen her, had never even heard of her before that, as she was not yet hired when I resigned.
           </p>
           <p>
            The last few weeks of Joe's term before he resigned, he asked me to help transition the office to the new Congressman, and to help Lois, the office manager in Ft. Walton, whose work took her out of the office a lot. I drove to Ft. Walton two or three times a week. I sat at the desk that had been Lori's.
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't know much about that situation at the time, and haven't been sufficiently curious to dig into it deeply. though I've seen things on the Internet (all the stuff people are digging up now has been there for years). I do know that someone else (probably Lois) hired Lori. Joe rarely visited his district offices when he was in Florida (they were our workplaces, not his; his was in D.C.). Lois told me that Lori always got sort of disappointed when he had a town hall meeting or other event in the district that his staff also attended, and he didn't recognize her or remember her name.
           </p>
           <p>
            There does appear to be quite a bit of disinformation about this case, beginning with article after article calling Lori an intern. She was not an intern. I think some people know better and call her that in order to create "similarity" between this case and the Condit/Levy case. She was a district staffer, not an intern. (Also, it turned out that Gary Condit did not murder Levy.) From my limited information about the case, it appears the ME on this case was incompetent.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm a staunch conservative, and I never saw a vote Joe made that I disapproved of, and I used to have a cordial relationship with him. But his to television shows, Scarborough Country and Morning Joe, have chronicled his movement to the left; and I quickly lost interest in them. But the way he has sprinted to the left, and joined in the media's daily, relentless grinding away at the President, I have lost all respect for Joe. The histrionics he and Mika put on (the groans, the heavy sighs, the faces of phony bewilderment or outrage) irritate me to no end. When husband's breakfast surfing lands on MSNBC, I can't watch without exploding.  I don't have an ounce of respect left for him.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I will say this. He is an adulterer -- possibly a serial adulterer -- but he is not a murderer. If Lori's death was not an accident, somebody else is responsible for it, not him. I knew him back then; knew his wife, his kids, his parents and siblings ... and frankly, though he has turned into a total sleazeball, I don't think he would be capable of murder now.

             Good info thanks. I think there is no doubt there was a cover up going on but I never even entertained the thought JS might have actually murdered her himself.
            </p>
            <p>
             He said he was in DC at the time and that should be easy to check. But he must have been involved because he told everyone who wanted to know Lori was in bad health and it was an accident only hours after the news breaking.
            </p>
            <p>
             His 180 turn in political terms afterwards also seems suspect to me. It looks a lot like David Brock's.
            </p>
            <p>
             In any case Lori was either murdered, or there was a concerted effort to push the accident angle for other reasons.
If you have the time please read the relevant chapter in Fisher's Forensics Under Fire. I'm curious what you make of it.

             Inicidentally, Trump probably doesn't know more than anyone else what happened to Lori, and it could be considered out of line for him to tweet about it. But Joe has been setting himself  up for a ker-pow! from the President ever since he was sworn in. He is apparently happily complicit in the media's daily relentless grinding attacks on Trump. He should have paid attention to what Melania said about her husband way back during the campaign,  "As you may know by now, when you attack him he will punch back 10 times harder." Ha.

            "There were

             four congressional interns
            </strong>
            that sat in on a meeting where

             9/11 planning

            was discussed:

             Chandra Levy, Lori Klausutis, Christine Mirzayan and one more name I can't recall

            . I believe she was Asian-American.
           </p>
           <p>
            All four ended up dead during the summer of 2001, just weeks before the false flag event."

             millennial_vulcan, can you give a thorough recap of that godlike productions message? I don't like websites that make me sign up just to read. I used to be able to access that website and read, and I found most of the "information" there to be ... not credible ... to say the least.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would like to comment and ask some questions about what you have posted here at this point:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               Lori was not an intern.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               What is a "9/11 planning meeting"? Is godlike productions claiming that Congressmen planned the 9/11 attacks and had their interns sitting in on the planning? I'm sorry, that is too fantastic for belief.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Where was the meeting held? Washington? If so, does the article explain why  a Congressman would have a district staffer (NOT an intern) fly up to DC for the meeting that apparently had nothing to do with her job of constiuent services.  Scarborough had plenty of staffers in D.C. who would have been more appropriate -- one ex-military, one the son of a judge, others who majored in poly-sci...
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Thanks for your help. Needs to be a lot more information posted about this meeting for those who can't access that website.

               When I click the link in your comment, it takes me to a screen that says, in part, "You are attempting to enter a private internet forum. ... Entrance to this private establishment requires membership but not an account." I guess I'll have to forego reading the comment myself. If it really happened, I would love to know more about it. Anyway....
member or not, you have to sign in to read, and I don't like sites that make me do that.
              </p>
              <p>
               "Staffer" is a term government staff members often use to refer to themselves and each other. The press would not likely use the term. My business card from my employment in the district office identified my position as "Staff Assistant." Whatever official job title Lori had, and whatever term the media uses, she was an employee.
              </p>
              <p>
               You originally posted,  "There were four congressional interns that sat in on a meeting where 9/11 planning was discussed: Chandra Levy, Lori Klausutis, Christine Mirzayan and one more name I can't recall. I believe she was Asian-American....All four ended up dead during the summer of 2001, just weeks before the false flag event."
              </p>
              <p>
               But then you said, "I don't think the GLP commentator meant there was a specific 9/11 planning meeting, LOL...more, they were probably all privy to nefarious + incriminating chatter."
              </p>
              <p>
               It's in quotation marks like it's a direct quote.  And  "...sat in on a meeting... " is quite clear and specific.
              </p>
              <p>
               In any case,  instead of ending up dead "just weeks before" 9/11, one of them died about 3 yeas before 9/11 and one of them 2 years amd 9 months. And none of them were Congressional interns.
              </p>
              <p>
               Christine Mirzayan --  d. Aug. 1, 1998
She was not a Congressional intern. She was an intern with the National Research Council, the working arm of the United States National Academy of Sciences and the United States National Academy of Engineering (Wikipedia)
              </p>
              <p>
               Joyce Chiang -- d. January 9, 1999
She was not a Congressional intern. She was an attorney with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (Wikipedia)
              </p>
              <p>
               Chandra Levy -- d. May 1, 2001
She was not a Congressional intern. She was an intern at the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Washington, D.C. She was having an affair with a Congressman, but she was not his intern.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lori Klausutis -- d. July 20, 2001
She was not an intern. Klausutis worked on his (Scarborough's) staff the last two years he was in office, according to the Tampa Bay Times (Washington Post)
              </p>
              <p>
               Quote "All four ended up dead during the summer of 2001." If that means they all died/were killed during the summer of 2001, that's mistaken. Mirzayan died in 1998, Chiang in 1999.

              Mary Beth Grismore, 26 years old, was strangled May 3, 1978 in Ohio. Her body was found in the trunk of a car. Mary Beth was known by her friends as Pixie for her sunny disposition. Patrick Ralston came under suspicion after he admitted to having a romantic affair with Pixie. Both Pixie and Ralston were married to someone else at the time, but decided to have a farewell get together and end their relationship. This meeting took place at the Holiday Inn in Cloverdale, Indiana on February 16, 1978.

            Trump is upping the ante now. There is an article on Zero Hedge about this, youtube has muted a clip / soundbite where Scarborough is joking about the girl's death.

            So I took up the call and investigated this today.
Probably said before but the coroner in this case was Michael Berkland, who had lost his license in Missouri due to malpractice, and was arrested in 2012 for keeping human remains in a self storage unit. Real weirdo, on whom any agency must have had a lot of goods - yet he is currently once again practicing pathological anatomy.. His supervisor at the time, Gary Cumberland, resigned on corruption charges two years after the murder.
            <a href="http://archive.is/e5Fjj">
             http://archive.is/e5Fjj
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Likely not said before is that the 'detective' helping him in this case was a 'crime scene investigator' called Dusty Rhodes, ex-Air Force special ops, who according to the article cited had been retired for four years at the time of Loris' murder. Now why would they have called an LEO  out of four year long retirement all the way from Tennessee? Fun fact: Dusty Rhodes also 'saw Elvis die'.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Note that while the witness Bergmann said Lori was found near the chair, not the desk, Berkland 's report said there were blood and hairs on the side of the desk.
In fact the 'investigation; was so botched that it became famous in forensic circles. Jim Fisher dedicated a chapter to Lori in his "Forensics Under Fire". It's well worth a read.

            This has letter agency collaboration written all over it, and Trump knows. He's not just digging at Murdering Joe. An agency, probably CIA is involved too.

             Lori's desk was parallel to the side wall of the office. There was a chair with it, presumably for her to sit in at the desk. (That's what I used it for when I sat at that desk). If she was next to the chair, she was next to the desk, and vice versa.

             Still it was a mean thing to say, could have been rough on the old code talkers I'd guess. Forced to smile because your on camera and not sure what got said, I've been there.   Not every Navajo is a Republican Trump supporter.  Lots of disgruntlement to be found on all the reservations.

              The one on the left made a tweet and thought it was funny. I don't think it was offensive and i have American Indian in me. I think that he was respectful to the men. She's the one that lied and said she was Indian so she could get a job at Harvard or whatever.

               I grew up playing Cowboys and Indians. I was always an Indian. I tan easily and was good with a bow and arrow.   Eventually I found I'd never fit with the Indians group.
              </p>
              <p>
               Instead I chose to remember that wherever my ancestors came from, they'd been natives at some point.  We all come from Mother Earth.  I've not done a 23 and Me DNA test.  I might someday.  Would be fascinating.

             Maybe this is an example of Trump's intention bungling of details in order to bait the MSM into correcting him and pointing out exactly the facts that they would have attacked if he said them himself. I've seen him use this tactic before, so maybe they'd say in this case "No, the woman was found in his DC office" (boom, brings the story back up and gets people asking 'wtf?') and maybe even add new details about something in Florida at the same time? Just thinking out loud, haven't looked into the details of any of this yet.

             Dr. Fahmy Malak was the Medical Examiner from Arkansas under Clinton who signed off on countless, unambiguous homicides as other-related-cause of death.
This, particularly the murder of many teenagers in that area, enabled the Clinton crime spree to continue unfettered.

             This my own thought on that. He was storing them to inject bad/falsified autopsy results. (Smuggled it in his Peter Pan lunchbox with the special thermos) He probably was a supplier to other guys in the business who like to make lots of quick cash. Things went sour and he had to leave when they left him on the hook because they are Satanists after all. They also thought Hillary would win. Love to hear everyone's theory. One quick question. Where is this creepy guy right now?

             Is this guy still around working somewhere .?  It can't be legal storing undocumented body parts in a storage shed.  He sounds like an easily compromised individual subject to control.  Florida is a mess, especially the Pensacola area.

               William Binney and Admiral Rogers - along with General Michael Flynn - will come to be recognized as amongst the greatest heros in the history of the country.
Likewise, when the full story of Ed Snowden emerges, he will be seen to have been a white hat operating with support the whole time.
A five minute watching of ex NSA Russ Tice being interviewed on RT displays how deeply entrenched, long running these blackmailing operations have been.

               Fight Club.....watch the movie again.....think of the movie being a project paid for by patriot americans......it was a military training manual for how to start a secret revolution....watch the end....the target was the banks......they did this in real life....they went from person to person and showed them secret stuff.  Showed each other the Jew plan to kill us all.....and the patriots planned.....long and hard.  They failed with JFK and Reagan.....George Bush was responsible for both shootings of two presidents.....now his family will reap the whirlwind.....

                I’ve never seen the movie but I’ll check it out now, it’s been quoted many many times. Being that truth is turning out to be stranger than fiction, who knows. Maybe some genius pitched the idea of the NSA collecting every phone call and every electronic interaction to the elite with the promise of ripping off the small guy when in reality it was the goal all along to use it against TPTB

            This like claiming that Freddy Trump was killed by Donald.  It's completely false.    I love how people are calling a "skeleton in the closest" even though they know nothing about the case.  Funny to see Trump repeated the same lie Michael Moore was called out for previously.

            Scarborough said he met this woman only three times.  She did not work at his main office and that he was never alone with her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the local new report on her.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A congressional aide in Fort Walton Beach told people she was feeling ill the day before she was found dead, according to a police report.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Fort Walton Beach Police Department report says Lori Klausutis, an aide to Rep. Joe Scarborough, told a co-worker on July 19 that she was not feeling well, but did not elaborate. She made a similar comment to a mail carrier.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was found dead in Scarborough's district office the next morning by two people who came to seek help with an immigration case.
            </p>
            <p>
             Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Berkland has said Klausutis, 28, of Niceville, lost consciousness because of an abnormal heart rhythm and fell, hitting her head on a desk. The head injury caused the death, Berkland said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The report, which was released Monday, quotes friends and relatives as saying Klausutis was happily married and was known as "Little Miss Mary Sunshine."
            </p>
            <p>
             They said she was under moderate stress in the days before she died. She had two assignments due for college courses. She and her husband had recently moved into a new house, and she was looking for a new job because Scarborough recently resigned from Congress, effective in September.
            </p>
            <p>
             Relatives told police she was upbeat about a job possibility at a local radio station and had recently received a $6,000 raise.
            </p>
            <p>
             Relatives said she had been taking medication for acne and that she suffered a head injury in a traffic accident when she was a teenager that left her in a coma. When she recovered, she had signs of short-term memory loss.
            </p>
            <p>
             A mail carrier who came in the office on July 19 said she appeared nervous. He said Klausutis told him she did not feel well.

                Working hard on the biggest tax cut in U.S. history. Great support from so many sides. Big winners will be the middle class, business &amp; JOBS

                There's a few different lies there, but of course, the whopper is about who benefits.  The big winner is not the middle class, but the rich.  They are not getting the most by whole numbers (60% of the entire tax cut goes to the top 20%), but they are seeing a higher percentage of of taxes than the poor or the middle class.

                 You are full of shit.  The reason you are calling BS on the tax cut is because you probably don't make enough to pay taxes.  If you've plugged numbers into either the House or Senate bill, you'd see that the richest of the rich see taxes raised a point to 49%.  The lower middle class sees a significant benefit.  The poor see nothing because they don't pay anything to start with.

                  This is incorrect.  This plan will cost 1.4 TRILLION over the next ten years (only if they don't extend expiring provisions, otherwise it's 1.9 Trillion.)  The group that sees the biggest benefit are those making from 200,000 to 999,999.  The plan changes over time, so you have to look at multiple years
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In 2021, this bracket would see a large tax increase.
 $20,000 to $30,000........ $3,029 13.4%
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  While this one would see a nice tax decrease
$500,000 to $1,000,000.. -$23,954 -8.6%
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  By 2027, everyone making $74,999 would see their taxes rise, while those over $75 would see their taxes increase.

                  What on earth are you talking about?  Where do you get 49%?  If you are talking tax brackets, the top tax bracket will be 38.5%.  However, if that is how you analyze the plan, that is incredibly superficial.

                    Also it absolutely does not apply to the "richest of the rich,".  He describes as a bubble tax, that bubbles on some people.  And if you look at the chart on the page you just cited, they make that clear.  See how as income goes up the bubble drops.

                    It also only applies in certain uncommon situations.  Families with no kids and between 1 and 2 million dollars in taxable income where all income comes from wages, no business income, no interest, no capital gains.  Most super rich people's income DO NOT come from wages.  If you remember Romney, his tax rate was much lower than mine because his 14 million in income came from investments and not wages.

             ZOG weapons manufacturers love the new Republican administration. Weapons manufacture is a Zionist enterprise. Kushner is a Supreme Zionist and Trump appointed him as right hand man. What we are witnessing is a power scuffle between people people who want a bigger piece of the taxpayer money so that it can be squandered.
            </p>
            <p>
             One week before the Saudi "corruption" purge Kushner went to Saudia Arabia. Not long before that Trump did a huge weapons deal with Saudia Arabia.

             I don't see any red pills in there anywhere. They got on the wrong side of Trump's ego and its payback time.

               I agree. Not recognizing that the new Republican administration is the weapons manufacturers best friend, a Zog enterprise, is obtuse.

               She was a Congressional staffer coordinating constituent services. That meant helping constituents who had problems with federal agencies (SS disability claim being ignored, for example). I was a Congressional staffer, too, in the Pensacola office. My position handled constituent problems with Social Security and Disability, Immigration and Naturalization, and the State Department (i.e. passports). Other staffers in Pensacola handled problems with other federal agencies -- military, etc.  Lori probably handled problems Okaloosa County constituents had with all federal agencies, because she was the only staffer in that office. There was also an office manager who no doubt helped, but she had her own responsibilities.  Also, interns don't get paid. Staffers are on the payroll of the Clerk of the House and get a paycheck and are entitled to benefits (retirement plans, etc).  Lori was an employee, not an intern.
