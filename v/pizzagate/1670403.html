            Why am I suspicious of another study -- another pile of money -- another organization. Then we discover that the person in charge is a suspect themselves. Clean out the prisons of non-violent marijuana offenders and you will have the room to put these people away. It is a form of kidnapping and assault, and should get long prison terms.

            Wont accept "profit" talk. Don't want it or need it. Want patriots, citizen investigators to be recognized and the "profiteers" to get no government contracts. Private charities exposed who are complicit. New charity rules open all the "Foundations" 
All Lobbysist getting paid with foreign money or taxpayer money that are corrupt drained out of the swamps. Seize asserts of complicit parties &amp; give money to victims. Let's start there!

            I can't. I only know she is/was in TN. I was only allowed to have HER call me. One call....and that was it. I was honored to be able to question her. She was used since 8 yrs. old. She was put in an arranged marriage. 
They now have taken her 8 yr old twins and putting them through mkultra training with sex torture. They use many small airport hangers she told me. She also expressed it was more important for me to understand how the money and orgs work, and not so much the politicians. She doesn't know them all like me. But she knew those three. Dodd was her rapist. She said he was the worst of them. She said he had the worst breath. She stated he picked up a bedside lamp, held it over her and while chocking/fucking her, he screamed, "you know I can kill you!".  She told me the guard at the door said, "no you cannot, you didn't pay for that, and this is not that room". Guards watch I asked?  Of course she stated. She said they flew them to Atlanta to a nearby Airport Marriot where they shot the 'still porn' to blow up and hang around the areas of the mansion. The girls worked in the area of the home, where their federal districts were represented, and also with the whores. She stated they run it this way, black op money, shenanigans, just as they group of noted federal district dollars. The fed state groupings. 
Example: FL, GA, KY, TN, AL,.  They run these ops the same way. To keep everything in order as they do actual accounted dollars. Why could she talk to me? She said I am programmed to expire myself, by I don't know when. They said I will die early, if I keep looking for my kids. She said the CIA put the kids in nice clothes, sat them on the tile mosaic floor of the cia and took a picture. She said that is their 'record' of them. She said it would be the last time we speak. So I'm really sorry I could not help her. I have worked and taken risk in this topic for 12 years. Risked my career, and cannot find work. You question why I have done 'nothing' You....are very quick to assume. And, you are mean. I share all that I know. What have you to share???

             Same here. Seem's like a joke to me, that Ashton and Ivanka are going to save the day.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope I'm wrong, but we all know what a sesspool Pedowood is. So if Ashton is legit, why hasn't he gone after anyone in Hollywood? At best, he's cutting out the competition and placating the liberals, imho. But what this really is, is a scheme to censor the internet under the guise of fighting child trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, I'd be interested to find out what happens to these kids after they are "rescued"  by Ashton's elite team of pedo-fighters.

              As we've seen with PG, all these agencies tasked with helping children are involved in trafficking. You're wise to be suspicious.

            A slave outed Corker down in Atlanta at a party. A mansion with jet air stips referred to as The Dream House. 
I don't trust Corker and no one would know this, accept the slave and whomever else she told.
I hope Trump sees this...and all are aware. Others in attendance she knew of were Dodd, and Thomspson. The latter is dead, and she said that Fred sat at a table and marked the 'ledger' of cash coming in the door, in 'pencil'.  Corker is a rapist. I can only share a conversation a slave agreed to have with me.

             PS. I also raised money and brought Noreen Gosch and her body guard, (now her husband) to a city to speak to a bunch of political operators that I knew around the state. That was Sept. 15, 2005. I was told Jeb Bush would have me killed as he was the governor in that state at the time. I said "BRING IT ON". I did it quietly, to not show off, and only had leaders who could then decide what they wanted to share. Some were afraid to leave the building in the dark afterwards. I had it at a church that I asked for 'sanctuary' first. Not to cancel it due to any time of pushback they would receive, as plane tickets were purchased, etc. I gave them all the printout on this stuff that I had, as to not hide what I was going to have discussed, and told her to take 24 hours and read them, and if they would still allow the event, I would come and sign the contract for the space the next day.  She emailed to come and sign. When I got there, I asked the church administrator who was leaving that day for a six week maternity leave, stated, "YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING". She told me the board met that night but would use the smaller sanctuary on the property they used, until the larger one was built. My event ran late, and the ministers and board members came running in, happy we were still there....they all wanted to meet Noreen Gosch and purchase her book!  I have done a lot, to educate the democratic workers which I came from. It's taken a long time,.....but the slumber and constant edu and proof is working. I'm grateful for VOAT, I don't feel so alone. But please don't ask why I did nothing to help her. We cannot 'help' her.  She does not want us to 'help' her. She wants/needs us to educate the masses. We are. Would you speak to someone connected like this on YOUR phone?  Many won't. You take a risk. When Noreen left at the airport, she hugged me and said, you do understand now, once we leave, we cannot help you or do anything for you, if they come after you for working with me. I said I understand. And, I do. You just have no idea who you are insulting, "and I've done nothing". This woman also tried to go to court to get her kids. Then she found out her lawyer WAS ONE OF THEM. UGH! So she went to court alone. Then the judge walked out....ONE OF HER RAPISTS!  She was shown she has NO recourse. See how all roped up our judiciary is in all of this?  Just look at DOJ and Lynch! All set up. We cannot help her. She will not allow it. What she wanted is what I am taking the time right here to do, and that is share.

              My own very limited experience with most people is that they're groomed to accept it as okay and will even defend it, and the perps. 
This seems true of any situation across the board.
This is the base reason cops say the most dangerous meetings are domestic disputes because they'll turn on you and defend the other person the other person.

            No private sectors or government contractors better get paid to now get jobs cleaning up the bodies. How about offer PG investigators paid jobs to help since we all exposed it.
