<p>So Here is a pic of this guy with Luis and Jennifer Argueta (reference sub to see connections to Podesta (I also need to start a new sub on the ARGUETA FAMILY of criminals)</p>
<p>PIC- Jon, Luis, Jennifer in Stamford. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LuisArguetaDirector/photos/rpp.218066865060937/360403114160644/?type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/LuisArguetaDirector/photos/rpp.218066865060937/360403114160644/?type=3&amp;theater</a></p>
<p>I am positive we have a dirty pedo cop here.</p>
<p>The thing that is interesting about this is he works with a.. <strong>AUGUSTO PODESTA</strong> and they work with Sourth American children/art/child services. That is a sidlinen I am digging into and will ad once I verify.  many community / child based projects in Stamford.</p>
<p>**sideline- Another Podesta relation ---I think Augusto is another Podesta &quot;adopted&quot; child. more on that in the new thread but this stuff is coming quick and I want to capture until I can compile. I am doing it here for now.</p>
<p>The Police Chief appears to have murdered his predeccessor (that is my deduction, it is possible this guy really committed suicide but I doubt it) </p>
<p>Article:. Former Stamford police chief found dead in apparent suicide Louis DeCarlo lead the department from 2001 to 2004</p>

<p>and  Jon \'personally\' handled this case himself. How convenient. Here is the quote:
&quot;There\'s nothing I can fathom why this happened or why it would happen to anyone,&quot; said Police Chief Jon Fontneau who was personally handling the investigation. &quot;It\'s very sad and we just have to watch out for his family at this time.&quot; Fontneau served under DeCarlo in the department\'s Youth Bureau and reported directly to him as commander of the midnight division</p>
<p>So Fontneau served under this guy in the Youth Bureau in the \'midnight division\' and then this guy suddenly comes up with a suicide that Fontneu so generously claimed he would PERSONALLY handle. Clearly this guy knew too much. I also believe that the above quote is a warning to the family of DeCarlo. its \'sad\' \'we just have to watch out for his family at this time&quot; what does that even mean? I see veiled threat but perhaps its a stretch. I just know this guy killed him.</p>
<p>Fontneau was with Division of Family Services\' Youth Bureau before becoming uniform commander for the midnight shift. Finally, he joined the Narcotics &amp; Organized Crime division <a href="http://patch.com/connecticut/stamford/jon-fontneau-ready-for-the-reigns">Meet Jon Fontneau</a></p>
<p>Here is an article when he was first announced. He said he would like the department to become more involved with after-school and truancy programs that would enable police officers to work more with youngsters.
&quot;I really feel we have to invest in our kids. And that is what we have done for years here, and I think that is one of the reasons why our crime rate is so low,&quot; Fontneau said. He really wants to expand \'family based policing&quot; whatever the fuck that is.</p>

<p>I have more.. much more... but these are BAD COPS. They are connected with Luis Argueta and children. It is a dirty police department - there are so many examples of corruption with youth in just a simple search.  We have 3 cops to nail.</p>

<li>Jonathan Fontneau</li>
<li>William Garay</li>
<li>Robert Macari</li>

<p>Lets get these guys. I believe they are a hub for trafficking in CT along with Luis &amp; Jennifer Argueta and Agusto Podesta (I believe another Podesta adoptee from South America.)</p>',

            Should I delete this and repost with the title adjustment? No word from Mods on how to edit the title header. I made a mistake and want it fixed. Anybody?

            "Let's get him" is a very foolish choice. I won't support such nonsense at all.

              Glad to hear it. If I had to guess, you probably got worked up and totally pissed while writing this and I think any moral person can relate to that. Resorting to violence as a means to get the final answer about this guy is also wrong and morally unjustifiable. It's very good of you that you're willing to step back and check yourself here. Nice job.

               yup. that is what happened. I have deleted and reposted. Lesson Learned. Its just all so upsetting. I have SO MUCH on this guy and Luis &amp; Jennifer Argueta along with Stamford CT. Its crazy. I have to verify more before I post the rest. My mind is blow... its around every corner and in every crevice.
