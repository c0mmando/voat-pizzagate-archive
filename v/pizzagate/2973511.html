<p>Way back when we were digging on the connection between the art world and human trafficking I had wondered about Santa Fe, NM.  I mean it is THE art mecca of the Southwest; sits high in the dessert, is home to many wealthy people, and well, it just strikes me as a place where a lot of nefarious behind-the-scenes things could take place under the guise of an artsy city.  Plus it is called the City Different.  
</p>
<p>Here\'s a 2009 article about the wealthiest in Santa Fe:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sfreporter.com/news/coverstories/2009/09/08/wheres-the-money/">Where\'s the Money?  SFR Hunts for Santa Fe\'s Wealthiest</a></p>
<p>Then of course we have Jeffrey Epstein\'s  Zorro Ranch just a stone throw\'s away in Stanley, NM. 
Here is a link about all of his properties, including Zoro Ranch, which, by the way, can be checked out easily on Google Maps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.curbed.com/2015/1/9/10004040/jeffrey-epstein-property-real-estate-holdings">Every Property Owned by Sleazy Financier Jeffrey Epstein </a></p>
<p>For those who may not know, one of Epstein\'s victims asserted  that she was abused at the Zorro Ranch:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.abqjournal.com/521794/sex-slave-suit-nm-was-a-location-used.html">Sex Slave Suit: NM was a Location Used</a></p>
<p>So I dug a little further last night and came across a few things that piqued my interest.  One was this bio of Epstein that makes him sound like a brilliant Mr. DoGooder.  Funny that the date on this article seems to change to the date one is viewing it, not the date it was written:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edge.org/memberbio/jeffrey_epstein">Jeffrey Epstein Financier &amp; Science Philanthropist</a></p>
<p>From that article\'s reference I checked out the Santa Fe Institute.   It appears to be some sort of scholarly think tank devoted to scientific pursuits -- some of them weird pursuits, in my opinion, but I thought maybe  a good front for money laundering -- speculation only here. Plus if you scroll down to the very bottom of the home page, there are four symbols that could be interpreted as a familiar pedo symbols, albeit with a Southwestern/Native American twist. Speculation here.  Had no time to dig further. 
<a href="https://www.santafe.edu/">Santa Fe Institute</a></p>
<p>Then I don\'t know what compelled me, but I went back to Google Maps and did a little sightseeing of Santa Fe proper, where its Scottish Rite Masonic Lodge building caught my eye.  There are two other Masonic lodges within several blocks of this one, by the way, which I found odd in and of itself, but the Scottish Rite lodge seemed especially intriguing, probably due to its architectural magnificence:
<a href="http://www.santafescottishrite.org/">Scottish Rite Masonic Center</a></p>
<p>BUT THEN I clicked on the &quot;events&quot; link and viewed the &quot;Fantome Blanc Halloween Party&quot; for October 2018 and saw creatures/people dressed in white animal costumes which reminded me of the furry animal pedo parties we\'ve heard and read about.  Really bizarre pics and description of the &quot;fun.&quot;   Made me wonder about the type of people who would actually want to attend.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.santafescottishrite.org/save-the-date-fantome-blanc-halloween-party/">Fantome Blanc Halloween Party</a></p>
<p>So, that\'s as far as I got with that little dig of mine.  I work two jobs and honestly won\'t have the time to dig further anytime soon.  But just thought I\'d drop this here in case anyone is looking for a new dig.   Take it and run with it if so inclined.     I hope I didn\'t violate any of the &quot;rules&quot; in posting this.  God only knows I seem to be good at that.  : )</p>',

           Way back when we were digging on the connection between the art world and human trafficking I had wondered about Santa Fe, NM.

           Then of course we have Jeffrey Epstein's  Zorro Ranch just a stone throw's away in Stanley, NM.

            <p>
             The building was designed by Sumner P. Hunt and built in 1893.[3] It was originally an experimental kindergarten and has also been used over the years as a prestigious college preparatory school for girls, an inn and restaurant, a military barracks in World War II, the headquarters of L.

              Alhambra's last flowering of Islamic palaces were built for the last Muslim emirs in Spain during the decline of the Nasrid dynasty, who were increasingly subject to the Christian Kings of Castile. After being allowed to fall into disrepair for centuries, the buildings occupied by squatters, Alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of Napoleon, who had conducted retaliatory destruction of the site. The rediscoverers were first British intellectuals and then other north European Romantic travelers.

              The more precise characterization and specific definition of Romanticism has been the subject of debate in the fields of intellectual history and literary history throughout the 20th century, without any great measure of consensus emerging. That it was part of the Counter-Enlightenment, a reaction against the Age of Enlightenment, is generally accepted in current scholarship.
             </p>
             <p>
              In philosophy and the history of ideas, Romanticism was seen by Isaiah Berlin as disrupting for over a century the classic Western traditions of rationality and the idea of moral absolutes and agreed values, leading "to something like the melting away of the very notion of objective truth",[32] and hence not only to nationalism, but also fascism and totalitarianism, with a gradual recovery coming only after World War II.

primary discourses, identified as: (1) discourse for ancient knowledge, (2)

natural sciences and materialism, (4) discourse against modern spiritualism, (5)
discourse for system and (7) discourse for universal brotherhood.

              ... Yet, some thinkers continued the attempt to bridge the spiritual and
material domains, as it had earlier been done in magia naturalis,
927 and fought
for their continued interrelation under the pressure of the new intellectual and
cultural conditions. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century this
spiritual bridging, in an increasingly secular and naturalistic milieu, formed part
of the counter-Enlightenment current of Romanticism and Naturphilosophie, and
from the middle of the nineteenth century continued in the modern spiritualist and occultist movements.

               Just a few excerpts from the first few pages of the thesis re 'modern spiritualism'.  I will read it through when I have time:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Olcott’s first encounter with Blavatsky, documented by himself, not only came to have a bearing influence on the development of Theosophy and later accounts of it, but also captured some of the early distinctions between Theosophy and modern spiritualism. Especially, the idea that modern spiritualism was somewhat ‘materialistic’ and even dangerous became a common argument among many theosophists as well as the notion of latent powers in man that can be awakened to control spirits—rather than man being controlled by them in order to produce psychical phenomena.
               </p>
               <p>
                ..From 1848 and onwards the reformulated esotericism of Swedenborg and Mesmer combined into modern spiritualism.941 Spiritualism itself was a diverse modern religious movement, which, in the light of the increasing materialistic scientific climate, became popular by claiming scientific proof for its seance phenomena. Again religion, including the domain of the transempirical or spiritual, was linked to the realm of the empirical or material at a time when the distance between the two domains seemed wider apart than ever.943 The spiritualist movement was at the origins of modern occultism in the eighteen-seventies, around the formation of the Theosophical Society (1875) and to some extent it was the constituent paradigm for the emergence of the occultism that Blavatsky and others developed.
               </p>
               <p>
                4 Blavatsky’s dislike of ‘materialism’, under which she often included positivism, naturalism and agnosticism,1035 furthermore originated from the evasive influence of naturalists such as Huxley and Tyndall.1036 Her major concern was that, if something were not done soon on behalf of the spiritual dimension in man and cosmos, materialism and material interest would become the master of all human endeavours and thereby destroy the last sense of spirituality—just still present in her time.
               </p>

              <p>
               I have begun to think that Blavatsky might have been a Russian psyop.. Lol.

            <p>
             In her essay on Hunt's early work, Karen J. Weitze notes that he may have been involved in the design of Sidney Haas's Moorish- and Mission-revival designs for the California Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.
             <strong>
              Hunt adopted the Mission Revival style for the Froebel Institute, also known as Casa de Rosas (1893)

                What you're doing is nothing new to me. The fact of assuming some ridiculous false accusation with zero evidence to back them up, then holding that delusion religiously while being completely immune to any evidence proving the contrary is a common practice here. I can give you dozens of examples.

                  That's a prime example of the same flawed patter of thinking that you use.  You know which I previously talked about, of pulling ridiculous false accusation out of your ass then holding them religiously while being completely immune to reality?

                    I think you need to use more than 0.5 neurons in your brain. However, didn't expect any other kind of response from someone like you when faced with reason and arguments.

                        First of all, there's more chances at convincing a brick wall of anything than a pizzagater by using reason and arguments. I always cringe when you pizzagaters use words like reason and evidence and pretend that you're opened to be convinced of anything. I had nightmares in the past on this site trying to use logic, so I mostly stick to trolling.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I spent my time in the past arguing with all sorts of religious people, conspiracy nutjobs and people believing all sorts of wacky things. I have never seen anything that came close to the level of detachment from reason and reality and that brought me the same level of disgust and indignation that this whole pizzagate shit and this forum has brought me.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Second, regarding the reason and arguments that I used as a response to you accusing me and being convinced that I'm MI5 or whatever. First of all, I pointed out that pulling out accusation out of your ass then holding them religiously while being completely immune to anything that proves the contrary is a flawed way of thinking, and a common practice here.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In the courtroom you're innocent till proven guilty.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        From a backwards thinking perspective you're guilty till proven innocent.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        From a pizzagater perspective(including you with your MI5 bullshit) you're guilty(of whatever the pizzagater feels like it) while the pizzagater is completely immune to any evidence that proves the contrary. That's backwards thinking with an extra step.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I also stated that I can provide dozens of examples of this, and provided one of someone using the same flawed pattern of thinking, accusing me and being convinced that I'm someone I'm not, strutting around like I actually am and claiming that thanks to him I'm in jail. All the while being completely shut to any form of evidence that shows the contrary.

                       <p>
                        X here claims and is convinced that I'm Robert. Y here claims and is convinced that I'm Alefantis. Z here claims and is convinced that I'm Podesta etc. Obviously you can't all be right. Only one of you can be right, or all of you can be wrong.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        So, if X is pulling out accusations out of his ass, is convinced of them while not being open to any evidence to the contrary...and is wrong,

                        maybe you shouldn't use the same flawed pattern of thinking.

                        Now I bet all of my effort in exaplining this was in vain. You will probably glance at this then come up again with something that has nothing to do with the reality we live in.

                         Spelling mistake there. Anyhoo, your effort was not in vain.  Reading through your text , looking at your speech patterns and the points you concern yourself with, has confirmed in my mind who you are.

                        First of all, there's more chances at convincing a brick wall of anything than a pizzagater by using reason and arguments. I always cringe when you pizzagaters use words like reason and evidence and pretend that you're opened to be convinced of anything. I had nightmares in the past on this site trying to use logic, so I mostly stick to trolling.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I spent my time in the past arguing with all sorts of religious people, conspiracy nutjobs and people believing all sorts of wacky things. I have never seen anything that came close to the level of detachment from reason and reality and that brought me the same level of disgust and indignation that this whole pizzagate shit and this forum has brought me.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Second, regarding the reason and arguments that I used as a response to you accusing me and being convinced that I'm MI5 or whatever. First of all, I pointed out that pulling out accusation out of your ass then holding them religiously while being completely immune to anything that proves the contrary is a flawed way of thinking, and a common practice here.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In the courtroom you're innocent till proven guilty.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        From a backwards thinking perspective you're guilty till proven innocent.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        From a pizzagater perspective(including you with your MI5 bullshit) you're guilty(of whatever the pizzagater feels like it) while the pizzagater is completely immune to any evidence that proves the contrary. That's backwards thinking with an extra step.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I also stated that I can provide dozens of examples of this, and provided one of someone using the same flawed pattern of thinking, accusing me and being convinced that I'm someone I'm not, strutting around like I actually am and claiming that thanks to him I'm in jail. All the while being completely shut to any form of evidence that shows the contrary.

                       <p>
                        Long story short:
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        X here claims and is convinced that I'm Robert. Y here claims and is convinced that I'm Alefantis. Z here claims and is convinced that I'm Podesta etc. Obviously you can't all be right. Only one of you can be right, or all of you can be wrong.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        So, if X is pulling out accusations out of his ass, is convinced of them while not being open to any evidence to the contrary...and is wrong,
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        and If Y iss pulling out accusations out of his ass, is convinced of them while not being open to any evidence to the contrary...and is wrong,
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        maybe you shouldn't use the same flawed pattern of thinking.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Now I bet all of my effort in exaplining this was in vain. You will probably glance at this then come up again with something that has nothing to do with the reality we live in.

            Do you know who is a Scottish Rite Mason?  Will Draper - the financier of the 'Hampstead cult' and former husband of Ella Draper (Gareeva).  Interestingly, she then said fairly recently he was not involved (long after he and his wife had been named and even listed in the police report)....maybe after all of the information and posts about him began to come out.  The Tavistock/MI5
            <em>
             agent provocateurs

               I think the children are legit, but Draper and her partner are also fishy in some way. Not like their enemies allege (torturing the children into making the allegations), but certainly fishy.

                There WAS always something about those two I couldn't quite put my finger on as well other than their oddity from the cannabis and like you said it wasn't the 'torturing' aspect of the children, even though I do agree that Gabe could have taken a different approach filming and questioning the children. Although he wasn't  a licensed psychologist he did what he had to do.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think they both had some peripheral involvement and knowledge of some of those involved (other than Dearman of course) near the cult which made them so odd and paranoid that they themselves could have put on film but did not.

                 I'm following along with this supposition that Draper, being a Mason, financed the Hampstead Children op as an MI6 operation but that really doesn't hold up in my own view. I doesn't make any sense that a mason, Tavistock and MI6 would compromise their own operation. They would obviously know about a child abuse ring operating out of one of London's most prestigious old churches, how could they NOT be part of it and/or running it entirely?

                  Maybe Ella and her new partner were connected to the group, as we assumed, but then left, and it was a revenge thing. Or they tried to blackmail them, and when they didn't get any money, they published the video.

                  Wasn't it her new partner's brother - a policeman - they went to?

                  Maybe we should look more closely at her partner's family.

                  My point is that maybe even though Draper was the one who introduced everyone to each other in that circle to begin with because he is a mason it doesn't mean that Ella and Abe were IN the cult.. It follows through then that it could be quite possible the oddities we mentioned were due to their own shoulder bumping with real cult members.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  OR, that feeling could be completely right and Abe was simply just trying to expose the cult without bringing Ella's past complicity into play and she very well could have been a willing participant at one time, which would explain the nervous oddities. These are things we might never know if this thing never flares up again. LOTS of unanswered questions in this saga.

                   I tend to think the latter - that at least Ella was part of the cult as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Remember, he was violent. A man with this type of personality would never accept a partner who wouldn't be involved as well. These guys have control issues, and when she was part of the cult that would have been the best way to control her.

                   That's what 'they' were hoping for and why the mention of new information causes such agitation.  However, I don't think 'they' can stop the truth from coming out.  The operatives who were on the David Icke forum gave away (unknowingly and unintentionally) too much of their modus operandi.

                  I think they both had some peripheral involvement and knowledge of some of those involved (other than Dearman of course) near the cult which made them so odd and paranoid that they themselves could have put on film but did not.

                 Yes, exactly. And tbh (but this is mere speculation) Draper's partner alerts my spider senses for having a possible violence issue. Not necessarily regarding children, but maybe a domestic violence issue. Women in abusive relationships often choose new partners who are also violent. Not sure in this case, though.

                   What I noticed when researching old cases in England recently is that google really pushed blog posts into oblivion. They are still there, but when you are too lazy to read more than ten pages of google results (like me, lol), it gets frustrating.

             The Four Seasons is a New American cuisine restaurant in New York City located at 42 East 49th Street[1][2] in Midtown Manhattan. Until 2016, it was located at 99 East 52nd Street, in the
             <strong>
              Seagram Building
             </strong>
             in Midtown Manhattan.[3] The restaurant is owned by the Bronfman family, Alex von Bidder, and Julian Niccolini.
            </p>
            <p>
             In June 2015, Aby Rosen, owner of the Seagram Building, announced that the restaurant's lease would not be extended.[7] The Seagram Building location closed after dinner service on July 16, 2016.[8] In August 2018, The Four Seasons opened at a new, smaller midtown location at 42 East 49th Street.

              The artist Mark Rothko was engaged to paint a series of works for the restaurant in 1958. Accepting the commission, he secretly resolved to create "something that will ruin the appetite of every son-of-a-bitch who ever eats in that room."

            Former Santa Fe Opera board of directors member Dubin founded the investment firm Dubin Clark &amp; Company, based in tony Greenwich, Conn. He also was a director of CompUSA. Despite the blue-blood cred, Dubin has a foothold here. A former caretaker of his Santa Fe estate—whose duties are to care for “the art collection, manage vendors, maintain budgets and supervise staff”—described it as “three residences on 8.5 acres,” according to The Santa Fe New Mexican. Dubin’s daughter, a People magazine staff writer, was married at Loretto Chapel in 2001.

              .  You are quite the digger!   Yes, I also think looking into the board of directors of the Santa Fe Institute might lead to more leads.  Follow the money, as they say.  I'm not very good at that, or else I wouldn't be working two jobs. ; )  Thank you for connecting some major dots!
