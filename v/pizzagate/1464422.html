            A lot of you all have come over to Voat recently (Welcome!) so try not to judge a post by the length of the user account, try to judge the post by the merit of their argument. Yes there are cointel shills among our recent influx but you should try to make that decision based on logic not duration.

            Resolution is a bit low on this video, couldn't really see the eye in the plates but did see the 5 pointed stars. And from what I could see of the owl, it might have been a kitty too. Unsure.
           </p>

            Either way, all of these set decisions are made at the level of the production company and are only signed off on at the corporate level after the first edits are made. Even if there is some pedophile crap in here it was probably a decision from Hollywood and we all know what Hollywood is like.
           </p>
           <p>
            No confirmation until you can produce a list of set decorations approved by Pizza Hut Corporate which included these items. Sorry.
