             Sure man, not sure what the difference would be (not a tech autist like some of you may be), I can only take them from my phone. My hard drive on my mac is destroyed, but I found a loophole where I am still able to access the internet (only certain sites) through the "Get Help Online" option on the main menu when your hard drive crashes. So, If anyone else wants to see proof of this, hollar at me.

            You have only yourself to blame for still being using Reddit after all that happened over the last few weeks. That's what you get for closing your eyes about censorship.

              There is nothing wrong with it. The people who want us to ignore reddit's audience don't realize (or they do, because they are shills) they are falling precisely for divide and conquer tactics. From my comment here (

               They've separated us into little boxes and thusly, people have compartmentalized themselves amongst each other...unable to see the forest for the trees...

             <p>
              Don't get separated into yet another box. Also, might I ask which mods banned you, if you know? You don't have to reply with their full names...I'm familiar with them.

               Ok let me see if I can dig the guys' name up. And great post by the way, I agree with you.
              </p>
              <p>
               EDIT: Guys name is "sabramesh". Thanks to whoever posted this thread on
               <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
                /r/conspiracy
               </a>
               for me.
              </p>
              <p>
               He must be on here, becuse he posted this today:
              </p>
              <p>
               <em>
                For the record
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/djklbd">
                 /u/djklbd
                </a>
                was banned for repeatedly calling other users who didn't share his views about pizzagate, "pedophiles" and "idiots" (Rule 4) and he also called several PG dissenters "shills" (Rule 10). He doesn't fit the normal profile of a banned user because he posted some good content, but this is good demonstration that even if your heart is in the right place, if you repeatedly abuse other users on this sub, the mods will lose patience with you.
Furthermore, reddit site rules stipulate that if a user has been banned from a sub, they are not allowed to simply create a new username and start posting the same stuff to the same sub. This is known as ban evasion and the admins can and will block your IP address if you try it.
Finally, if a mod bans you on
                <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">
                 /r/conspiracy
                </a>
                , you have a right of appeal to the mod team as a whole. If you have previously demonstrated that you offer something of value to the sub, and you make your case reasonably, you will get a fair hearing. Thus far
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/djklbd">
                 /u/djklbd
                </a>
                has not bothered to do this, despite me telling him earlier that this option is available to him.
               </em>
              </p>
              <p>
               Is there anyway an appeal would be possible? Would anything come from it?

                I mean, yes, I would still try to appeal if I were you. You simply shouldn't slander other users without proof that they are pedophiles or whatever. It's disingenuous and as a whole, will detract from your argument. People will be less likely to believe you if you come across as a name-caller. That's all. There are ways to make your argument without losing your head.

             Well think about it dude, Pizzagate is getting a lot of attention over there on some of the subs. There are well over 400,000 subscribers there and at least 800 people online at all times. And sometimes, pizzagate posts reach
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/all">
              r/all
             </a>
             , which is an even larger audience. I'm just taking advantage of all the people coming in and out of that place, all the newcomers, trying to at least plant some seeds. It's worth a shot.

              Reddit is not the only place.
They don't deserve the attention .
I'm not dogging you . Voat is becoming more popular GAB is as well.
You Tube can't  keep up with all of the Pizza Gate videos.

            They're hoping to push your buttons, you know. Did you notice the false flag? Select an individual, develop a profile, push all the right buttons, emotional overload, next thing you know you've got a crazed gunman at Comet Ping Pong. See how that works? We can't have websites broadcasting Russian propaganda signals into local vicinities in the United States anymore, though. Always remember, God is watching You.

               This is fucking bullshit. I like to post pizzagate shit on reddit because there is a WAY bigger audience over there with 400,000 subscribers. These guys are fucking up, is there anything that can be done about this? It's not a HUGE deal, but it's very annoying. I could care less about my "karma", but i started a new account and I have to wait 10 minutes between posts to post or comment again, and I think they shadow banned my new account, so I can't accumulate enough karma to break past that "10 minute" post barrier...
              </p>
              <p>
               Fuck reddit, but it's a shame to let that sub get taken over by CTR. I just don't want to let that happen, so i'll probably make a few new accounts and just use them or something....I dunno.
