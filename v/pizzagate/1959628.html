            Hello All, as I've said before, I'm not a lawyer. HOWEVER, no one needs a license to gain the knowledge nor to practice "common law" in ANY court to represent yourself or to help another by being "next of friend". Both federal and state courts are common law courts - these courts are SUPERIOR to any other type of court. If you are an attorney, it is said that this is one of the first things you learn (but quickly forget - because you will be practicing in "admiralty court" which use codes, statues, and rules, etc.).
           </p>
           <p>
            Beware: Like #PizzaGate, there are A TON of "useful idiots" or paid "shills" online that are trying to paint those lawfully practicing (or attempting to practice) common law as "terrorists", "sovereign citizens", or blah blah blah...
           </p>
           <p>
            Since regular folks have been becoming proficient in common law, the courts have:
- scrubbed their websites over the last few years of ANY mention of common law;
- scrubbed their records of any pleadings made referencing those practicing common law;
- unlawfully put innocent people in jail for practicing common law;
- and failed to enforce rulings made lawfully under common law.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is this important for any one of you to know? For starters:
- neither judges nor attorneys have ANY power in common law courts.
- only the jury and the adversarial parties themselves have any power to decide the outcome.
- any ruling from a court of common law caries the highest weight in any court in the US (even the US Supreme Court - as I understand)
- the common law court is FREE
           </p>
           <p>
            The aforementioned is DANGEROUS to know (like who murdered #SethRich), in part, because "We The People" should be able to prosecute those responsible for #PizzaGate / #PedoGate under common law.
           </p>

            If you are already known, or tied to the mentioned hashtags and therefore have doxxed yourself already.  Let me remind you of some OPSEC basics, specifically to Voat:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Verify all links posted here.  No CP has been linked for months, but there are definitely disturbing images.  If you worked in/around CPS, nothing here will shock you.  Also, watch for phishing sites:
           </p>
           <p>
            2) I'll assume you are already on a TOR and VPN and know all of the security basics.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Airgap everything you do here from your real presence.  You may not care, but some people slip up if they don't have their game down.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) There are about 5-10 known shills on this site who are active.  You will recognize them by their attempts to persuade you/others to their argument, which is all Jews are evil and must be exterminated.  They are vocal, but only represent a small minority of the serious researchers on this site.  These are the pajama boys/girls who will yell at you like a petulant child in all-caps.  Others are a little more smooth in their tactics.  I'll let you decide which ones they are. They are the ones who jump your shit when you hit a nerve. This is the BierHaus Loser Table, essentially - the ones who washed the Nazis clothes and cleaned their boots so they weren't shipped off.  Best tactic is to ignore.
           </p>
           <p>
            5) If you haven't already, read the "For Newcomers" section and "Submission Rules".  This will help you avoid issues.  Always cite relevance for any post, no matter how obvious.

             About the only hash tag I am "tied to" I guess is #FamilyCourt. I've seen others like #PizzaGate, #PedoGate, etc. That being said, the last few years has opened my eyes to the connection between Family Court and Child Trafficking. I don't click on any images as I've seen enough to last me forever. My main focus is helping to bring Civil and Criminal actions against people that would harm children and families. Yes, I use Tor over VPN. I use the typically used "OpSec" protocols. I also don't pay attention to people that do not speak to the issue at hand or bring up nonsense - on other platforms, they are immediately blocked. Thanks for all the advice - I appreciate it.

              Also - be careful about cut and paste between what you may write in the real world and what you write on Voat.  It's very easy to dox yourself that way.
             </p>
             <p>
              CPS never ceases to disappoint.  I think the whole thing is tied in to the Deep State and includes juvenile detention facilities, the foster/adoption services, State/Peace Corps/US Aid and NGOs.  One big giant human trafficking infrastructure.

            You'd have to define "properly vetted" as I will always remain Anon when discussing #PizzaGate #PedoGate - If discussing #FamilyCourt, I am pretty vocal and known throughout the National reform movements. Please don't send me pictures of dead babies - I've seen enough of that to last a life time.

            Anyone doing REAL / ACTUAL work has been Anon. I give props to those that stick their necks out but, to me, that is just asking for trouble. Also, third-party verification methods can be used to "ID" persons. I think in terms of "Trustless Networks". And, I'm brand-spanking new to this platform - but old to the fight against #FamilyCourt corruption. I have spoken directly to enough mothers and fathers to know that #PedoGate is REAL. Although I talk quite a bit online about #FamilyCourt, I do NOT discuss #PizzaGate / #PedoGate online without being Anon.

            Welcome to the fight, and beware of the shills (lol, some have been very quick to already try and welcome you with open arms). Look up voater profiles to get a feel for who these people are. Certainly don't be afraid to speak your truth as it will always be the most precious gift you can give.
