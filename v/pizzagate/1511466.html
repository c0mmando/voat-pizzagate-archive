<h2>Portugal and the inter-generational Satanic incest cult</h2>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/Ljh6ja.jpg">SLiMG Image</a></p>
<p>As for the item at Lulu, the link here is merely the similarity of names: Ronald Wolf and Ronald Charles Wolf. We know that Ronald Wolf is the stage name for Jeff Schmid of Heavy Breathing, while Ronald Charles Wolf is the author of the book <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/ronald-charles-wolf/the-satanic-cult-of-mafra/paperback/product-535264.html">The Satanic Cult of Mafra</a> (<a href="https://archive.fo/kTGlS">https://archive.fo/kTGlS)</a>), the author\'s sole work published September 24, 2007. From the book description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Portuguese village of Mafra there is an 18th Century Convent Palace. According to historical records, the construction of this magnificent work of marble and stone was due to the vows of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_V_of_Portugal">Portuguese King D. João V</a> (1689-1750) whose wife finally bore him an heir. But is this historical fact true? Is it possible that King D. João V was a mere royal profligate turned conduit for a scheme conceived by Satan who profited from the King’s worship of flesh and pleasure? The history of Satan’s plan, his earthly messengers, the formation of an incestuous cult in Mafra, its members and their family histories, are revealed in a story which begins in 1830 and ends in 1968 with the arrival in Mafra of an American, purportedly to visit his Portuguese cousin but who is in fact his sister. The novel culminates in a scene of wild sensuality as the siblings feverishly embrace the Satanic cult of Mafra.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, one can reasonably assume that Ronald Charles Wolf is a pen name, just as Ronald Wolf is a stage name. In any event, Ronald Wolf in Heavy Breathing predates Ronald Charles Wolf\'s tale of incest and Satanism in Portugal\'s royalty in the 18th century and stretching to 1968 America and mentioning actual historic figures. (Interested researchers may wish to <a href="http://pastebin.com/m7nENxw8">read this text in its entirety</a> and report back). Curious how a musician with a penchant for the occult, Satanism, and children shares a stage name with the author of a book about inter-generational incest in a Satanic cult in Mafra, Portugal.</p>

<h2>Coloboma and Heavy Breathing</h2>
<p><a href="https://i.sli.mg/pOlFLf.png">https://i.sli.mg/pOlFLf.png</a></p>
<p>From the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7256513.stm">BBC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Referred to as the &quot;mark of Madeleine&quot; the blemish on the four-year-old\'s right eye has played a key part in the campaign to highlight her disappearance, emphasised in posters and videos.</p>
<p>It was at the centre of the latest possible sighting of her. Dutch student Melissa Fiering says she saw a girl who looked like Madeleine McCann at a service station in the South of France.</p>
<p>She believed it was the youngster, who went missing from the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz last May, because she had a dark smudge on her right iris. However, police examining CCTV evidence have determined it was not the missing girl.</p>
<p>THE ANSWER</p>
<p>Colobomas are extremely rare - about 0.007% of the population</p>
<p>It\'s not the first reported sighting of Madeleine, but a spokesman for the McCann family said it was &quot;more worthy than most&quot; because of the eye defect.</p>
<p>The blemish is called a coloboma of the iris. Its precise incidence is not recorded in the UK, but figures suggest it occurs in about 0.007% of the population. A 1989 study in China found two cases in a survey of 26,512 children under 12 years of age. That would mean a prevalence of 7.5 per 100,000.</p>
<p>In the UK, cases of coloboma are lumped in with two other congenital eye defects - microphthalmia and anophthalmia - says the Micro and Anophthalmic Children\'s Society (Macs).</p>
<p>&quot;There are about three to seven babies every 100,000 live births, born with any one of these defects,&quot; says a spokeswoman for the society, although &quot;coloboma is more common than the other two conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>A coloboma occurs when the eye fails to develop fully while the baby is in the womb. It leaves part of the structure missing, creating a gap. </p>

<p>Here\'s another creepy video from Heavy Breathing (as The Apes) with lots of subliminal creepiness.

<p>What are the odds that the year of the kidnapping of Madeleine McCann in Portugal , the Apes would later that year include an example of an extraordinarily rare eye condition shared by McCann in their video (and instrumental in the case) and a man named Ronald Wolf (same stage name of Jeff Schmid of Heavy Breathing/Apes) self-publishes a book about a Satanic incest cult in Portugal?</p>',

            Hey, been lurking for some time and decided it's finally time to act. I don't particularly like the more "pop culture" investigations as I find them easier to suffer from confirmation bias, but any info directly referencing the Portuguese language, people, country, Law, etc. I can get privileged information. Anything just DM me. I'll be more available in one month time. Keep digging.

            Alright found it, it is also called:
           </p>
           <p>
            Shaken Baby Syndrome in Dutch. But Abusive head trauma in english.
           </p>
           <p>
            By shaking the baby at ages 0-1 and sometimes till 4 the pupil can break and it can cause this coloboma.

            I've looked at all these images and many others.

           <p>
            I have also examined 1000's of eyes; I have a medical education and years spent professionally in ophthalmology research.
           </p>
           <p>
            None of the images of these people in the post show iris coloboma.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one mentioned here, on reddit, or on the chans besides McCann has shown iris coloboma to my knowledge. I have looked at many of these images over the last month or so.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many conditions that affect the appearance of the pupil and iris. Please educate yourselves before posting more "coloboma conspiracy" images.

            FWIW Jeb Bush may in fact have an iris nevus, a fairly common and usually benign finding.

            The child identified as Caris Cummings in various social media photos does not have iris coloboma.

             It doesn't matter whether it's true colobama or not, they believe in signs and magic and not real science, so if someone looks like they have it, they're in. I got special treatment from a Greek family because I looked Greek to them. I'm not Greek, no one is in the last 8 generations of my tree, but I was cool in the pocket because I looked it. Got invited to all their Greek functions and parties. It's a clique mentality.

             These Satantists believe having sex with kids gives them magical powers. They're not necessarily playing with a full deck.

            One of the Apes songs mentions hairlips, so possibly any incomplete closure of a fetus tissue development might be for some reason of interest to these people. A lot of the "colobomas" people are seeing are actually iris nevi "freckles".Who knows maybe it's just the appearance of the pupil and not the cause that interests these people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd like to cast doubt that the lawyer Wolf wrote 'Satanic Cult of Mafra". It's very primitively written,  much more like the Apes lyrics than the scholarly books the lawyer Ronald Wolf wrote. It is interesting that the lawyer lived in NY, maybe he IS the father of the Apes Ronald Wolf.

            So from what I gather, the fact that all these people have the same defects indicates that they're blood/genes are similar so they can use the kid's blood for injections/drinking that makes them younger or for organ transplants? still a bit unclear on this fact

            Marina Abramovic had a weird sickness as a child. When her first tooth fell out, she ended up bleeding constantly for days and was hospitalized. It ended when she got her first period. Symptoms were like hemophilia, but it wasn't that, her parents didn't have it, no genetic link. The doctors never figured out what it was.

              Not Russian, Serbian (she's originally from Yugoslavia so I don't know why you'd think it'd be in Russian. It's not even Cyrillic). It's interesting but there isn't much specific info.

            The Majestic Ape in the video and shown in close up at the link

            is definitely a female - lip gloss, more curved mouth and definite dip on upper lip - VERY UNLIKE several pictures of a Majestic Ape with the very identifiable (and creepy) smirk of Alefantis.  Seeing these photos makes it clear that Kleinman's mouth is fairly easily identifiable and Alefantis does indeed step into the "Majestic Ape" role at times, which has been a subect of quite a bit of speculation.

            Well, one of the most famous portuguese novels is about the incestuous relationship between a brother and a sister (

             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Os_Maias)

            ). Don't know if it's helpful to your research. I can help you if you have any questions about the portuguese culture.

             I see many Portugese people in Central California and they seem to age better than any other people. They usually look 20-30 years younger than their age. Is this true in general of Portugese or just a quirk of the small amount of farmers I see?

              Well, we do age quite well. Currently, 20% of our population (~10 million) is 65 years old or older. This number is really big, since Portugal is quite small comparing it with other European countries. This, coupled with a small birth rate has led the country to face a crisis in terms of rejuvenating its population.
              <br/>
              Back to your question, portuguese people are quite resilient. I would say that resilience is a consequence of our eating habits (our diet consists of both meat and fish) and the fact that our lifestyle is really simple. Don't know if this would translate into the immigrants you have contact with, but some immigrants I know that live in France or Switzerland would fit in the description I gave you. I'd say Portuguese people would maintain their identity anywhere they go.

              I can say that heavy drums, bass and psychotropic music can very much mess with your brain wiring, heart beat and other sympathetic nervous system functions.  Being shocked by imagery and symbols can also cause real effects on the body and brain.  Combined they can be extremely powerful agents of mind control even without the use of psychotropic drugs.  WITH LSD, exstacy or what have you, people would literally enter the world of the music and video, ugh imagine doing that under force!  True soul destroying torture.

              Tibetan monks use a very deep kind of vibrational humming to change their consciousness and have for centuries, you can google their music I'm sure.  Also interesting is how the CIA is known to already have used music in torture sessions for years

              Black magic is an act of willful trespass, whether it can be effective or real or not is not important.  As far as feeling fearful and messed with (not actually kidnapped or taken) you can simply decide that you are not going to allow any trespass on your soul your brain, your house, body or family, and tell any negative energies they are not welcome and must leave you completely alone now and never return.  Dark energy may fight, but it cannot trespass where it isn't allowed in.

               I don't really see this part as evidence for black magick's existence, I imagine it has more to do with repetition than the songs themselves. The rest is pretty convincing, though.

               I was just reminded of the movie Irréversible, where the opening scene is deliberately made to make you feel sick, using a combination of nauseating camera movements, very deep, low tones and violence/gore.

               Interesting i always tell myself this b4 and after watching official heavy breathing videos. I went down a pizzagate rabbit hole and watched a invocation of a demon vidoe that was way to real. Had to cleanse that shit out of my head just in case

              Black magick is real unfortunately. Music is a window to the soul and has been used for centuries to induce hypnotism and demonic possession.

             Not sure why chakras in general would be problematic. If they were emphasizing the sacral or base chakra, or third eye potentially, it could signal something else, but nothing stands out to me as indicative of chakric activation.

              Quite interesting indeed. Studied psychology 1949-1953 (an interesting time, just after the war), before going into law.

              How old are people when they begin a course of study. Let's be generous and say he was 16 (a child prodigy). So guesstimate year of birth as 1933, probably earlier.

              Relocating to Portugal (according to VieBleu's) no earlier than 1968, which would be at an age of at least 35 - prime of the career (on second thought, it may be quite early in a law career).

              Hard to say what motivates a successful American lawyer to emigrate with his family to a relatively foreign European country. His features on the LinkedIn profile seem like he may have some Portuguese ancestry, although his name does not suggest that. Maybe he fell in love with Portugal.

              ]   He is a globalist lawyer that specializes in advising on joint ventures, and he has written a book on the subject.  Is he a NY establishment globalist advisor with an interest/avid fantasy life regarding in Satanic worship and the old religion as practiced in Portugal?  He lives in Portugal and first went there in 1968, but he still has ties to the US -

              "Dr. Ronald Charles Wolf is a native of New York City, possessing a B.A. (NYU), Juris Dr. (NYU), and M.Phil in law and sociology. (U. of Manchester, UK). After many years of commercial law practice in New York City and then in the State of Vermont, in 1968 he came to Lisbon, Portugal, from Montpelier, Vermont, with his wife Marilyn, of Boston, Mass., and their family."

In parallel, Dr. Wolf has maintained throughout his professional life a strong academic interest in the sociological aspects of law. In June, 2001, the U. of Manchester conferred upon him the degree of M. Phil. for his thesis on “The New Law Merchant and International Arbitration: Western Law and Social Order in Transition.” There was published in 2004 by Ashgate Publishing Ltd., Aldershot, England, the title “Trade, Aid, and Arbitrate: The Globalization of Western Law.”

              Is it possible that the Heavy Breathing band member is his son?  He would be the right age, could have gone to schools in the Northeastern US and gotten into the "band" that way, as Amanda has described on her blog.   (I put "band" in quotes because I have theorized that The Apes are a cover for an MK-Ultra production unit - someone has to make those mind control videos and music.  Kleinman calls herself "puppet" and Alefantis considers himself an artist, after all.  I could also speculate on the idea that all the band members are mind controlled to some degree and Alefantis is their handler.  Charles Wolf in a mask onstage being the "real" identity of the guy, and in real life he uses alt identities/names).

             A video of a girl having coloboma and is blind from on eye... she tells about her experiences.

            </p>
            <p>
             Why are these people so obsessed with coloboma? Is there something we don't know about it?

             Huh? Maybe it has something to do with blood type? They need people with their rare blood types. Another thing to note is most of the people you listed have had organ transplants.

               They love to sprinkle their shitty movies with a little truth. I think all this being lied to for my entire existence, has made me extremely good at discerning what is true and what isn't. This is a game I've been practicing for my whole life.

             Not to mention people like George Soros, Dick Cheney, Jacob Rothschild, George Bush Sr, Henry Kissinger, Diane Feinstein, Andrew Sorkin.. have it too. With as rare as it is it's quite interesting how many evil politicians just happen to have it. There are more I just can't remember them all.
