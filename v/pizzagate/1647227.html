<p>Looks like a very high profile NY lawyer has teamed up with a &quot;Jane Doe&quot; to file some kind of <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/20440254/v_Epstein_et_al">suit against Jeffrey Esptein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Lesley Groff, Sarah Kellen, and Natalya Malyshev</a>. They have all been issues summonses to appear in court and there will be a pretrial conference March 9, 2017, in NYC.</p>
<p>Appears to be an ADR type case, which basically means it\'s a complaint that is being handled privately through mediation or arbitration rather than in public courts.

<p>Very interesting that such a high profile lawyer is on the case. It\'s David Boies, belonging to firm Boies, Schiller, &amp; Flexner: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Boies">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Boies</a> </p>
<p>I think there\'s a very strong chance that the suit regards some kind of sexual misconduct, hence the private nature of it. The victim, perhaps, want some semblance of payback, but doesn\'t want their name all over the news and just wants to get on with their lives. Is there a way to investigate this suit without threatening Jane Doe\'s privacy? I may call the lawyer and see if he can offer any further information on the nature of the case, etc. But in the meantime, maybe we should look into who those other defendants are? Perhaps they rode on the Lolita Express or other strangeness can be found regarding their history/activities (PLEASE NO DOXXING OF ANY KIND. I just had to say it).</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>',

            I don't think it's a surprise that this case has snagged the attention of a high-profile attorney. Epstein is worth billions.

            Nice post and this definitely deserves more digging into the named players. If this Jane Doe was wronged/abused in any way, I do hope she receives justice.

            Well, besides the extreme leniency of Epstein's punishment and the incredible absolving of any guilt for any involved third parties there was the issue that the deal with Epstein should have been approved by the victims.

            In Ghislaine's Wiki:  A 2011 Vanity Fair article on Maxwell and Epstein's relationship by Vicky Ward spoke of Maxwell's sociability stating that "She is always interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I've spent hours talking to her about the Third World at a bar until two a.m. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is curious. Her Rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even Rupert Murdoch’s. She is very well read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton, with whom she is close friends." Yeah, that must be some Rolodex, Madam Ghislaine.

             Wow!
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
             '“Backpage is owned by a Netherlands company that runs a web of nefarious Web sites. One is called Cracker. Backpage is mild compared to Cracker.”
“Have you gone on Cracker, David?” Mazzio asked.
“I have not,” he said. “I’ve had people go on it.” He added, with barely tempered outrage, “I don’t know of another organized-crime group that’s as sophisticated in their corporate structure.”'
