<p>This Washington Post article is not available by conventional Google Search, but it proves that Hastert and Tony Podesta\'s relationship runs deep. Not only that, but Dennis Hastert\'s son actually worked for PodestaMattoon (an earlier incarnation of Podesta Group) in the early 2000s.

            Great digging connecting Podesta to Colombia. Let's also connect FARC:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Colombian government argues that the armed groups now roaming the countryside are drug traffickers with no political agenda. And it says it is investing resources and manpower to dismantle them.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the FARC and left-wing groups insist that these bands are the successors of right-wing groups from the 1990s and early 2000s that defended the the interests of large landowners and mining corporations.

            Wasn't blue dress a misdirection from Whitewater? If the impeachment outcome was a foregone conclusion, somewhere in there might have been the beginning of the next cycle of the intentional sliming of American consciousness.

             A misdirection?  No.  Whitewater involved no crimes by the Clintons.   The previous prosecutor was ready to wrap the whole thing up in 1994 before they put Ken Start in.  Lewinsky was a way looking like they hadn't wasted years.

            It's not odd at all that Hastert partook in the Clinton impeachment debacle. So did Ken Starr, now a confirmed Clintonite pedocultist.

            And of course Hastert and the Podestas go way back

            The impeachment kabuki was just that: theater. These people have known each other, dined together and fucked and tortured children together for over 40 years.

            Plan Columbia like literally every single measure the Clintons/CIA took was a sardonic, competitor-destroying scheme disguised as an anti-narcotics/humanitarian effort. There's nothing new there either.

            But, I had not read that rather telling quote and article. So nice work. I'm sure everyone involved has known exactly who John/Skippy is for a long long time.

             Yea lol so weird almost as if Hastert were originally selected for office because he was an insatiable pedophile and never gave a shit about conservatism. I for one am outraged
