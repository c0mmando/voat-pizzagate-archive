<p><strong>Gerry Kelly, hailed as Miami’s Nightlife Guru</strong>, will celebrate his annual Birthday X-Travaganza by paying tribute to Studio 54, the biggest Disco Party in the World. The celebration will take place at Trio on the Bay, located at 1610 79th Street Causeway, on Saturday, June 11 beginning at 10:00 p.m. </p>
<p>Gerry, who is loved and admired, has played a fundamental role in placing the Miami Nightlife on the world Map. His mind-blowing events and productions are legendary. From the stage shows, concerts and fashion shows at Level Nightclub, including the worldwide phenomena Janet Reno Dance Party, to his incredible, out-of-the box parties at Bash and The Shelborne, to his famous SuperBowl events at The Fifth, to his tremendous opening at MIVI, to packing night-after-night every nightclub he has owned and operated throughout the years; Gerry Kelly truly is to the Miami Nightlife what the Queen of England is to Royalty. You never know who will walk in at one of Gerry’s X-Travaganza’s; friends such as Vivica Fox, Jamie Fox, Eve, Jay-Z, Lil’ Kim, Beyonce, P. Diddy, Busta Rhymes, Jada Kiss, Cierra. Carlos Ponce, <strong>Hugh Rodham Clinton</strong>, Senator Frederica Wilson, Dwayne Wade and more, have all been a part of his events and nightclub scenes. </p>

            Gerry, who is loved and admired, has played a fundamental role in placing the Miami Nightlife on the world Map. His mind-blowing events and productions are legendary. From the stage shows, concerts and fashion shows at Level Nightclub, including the worldwide phenomena Janet Reno Dance Party, to his incredible, out-of-the box parties at Bash and The Shelborne, to his famous SuperBowl events at The Fifth, to his tremendous opening at MIVI, to packing night-after-night every nightclub he has owned and operated throughout the years; Gerry Kelly truly is to the Miami Nightlife what the Queen of England is to Royalty. You never know who will walk in at one of Gerry’s X-Travaganza’s; friends such as Vivica Fox, Jamie Fox, Eve, Jay-Z, Lil’ Kim, Beyonce, P. Diddy, Busta Rhymes, Jada Kiss, Cierra. Carlos Ponce,

             The New River Tunnel, officially known as the Henry E. Kinney Tunnel, is a highway tunnel that carries U.S. Route 1 underneath the New River and Las Olas Boulevard in downtown Fort Lauderdale. The tunnel replaced the Federal Aid Highway Bridge, a drawbridge opened on August 26, 1926 and closed in 1958. Upon its completion in 1960, it was the only operating public tunnel in Florida, until the completion of the Port of Miami Tunnel in 2014, though two private tunnels exist at the

              Marc Bell and his wife, Jennifer, opened their home to 70 foster children who had nowhere to stay after Hurricane Irma
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              On Monday when the power went out at one of the hurricane shelters in Boca Raton, Florida, the sheriff asked everyone to leave. That’s when the panic set in for the staff of the SOS Children’s Villages Florida. They had been staying there with 70 foster children and didn’t know where else to go. That’s when the executive director called Marc Bell.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bell —
              <strong>
               a former executive for the adult magazine Penthouse
              </strong>
              , who sits on the board of SOS — knew his home, a $30 million, 27,000-square foot mansion, could handle a big group. And, he and wife, Jennifer, felt they had to help these children.
             </p>
             <p>
              “They were traumatized before the storm,” he said. "Now, they were traumatized because they had no place to go."
             </p>
             <p>
              After the children arrived, the Bells ordered 20 pizzas and made sure everyone bathed and had clean clothes — which only took 36 loads of laundry. The couple asked their friends for help and over the next 72 hours about 100 pitched in. It felt like a real sleepover with sleeping bags piled in every room but the Bells made it even more fun than the average sleepover. They invited clowns, balloon artists, athletes, and ice cream trucks to entertain the children. With the help of friends and family they served over 800 meals in 72 hours.
             </p>
             <p>
              “We had an army of volunteers who selflessly gave up their time,” he said.
             </p>
             <p>
              “There was an abundance of love. All these kids were getting one-on-one attention, which they never get. All the little kids were being held by someone and the older kids were getting one-on-one conversation,” he said.

             Marc Bell is on his 2nd wife. This one can't keep putting her hand on his lap or stroking his arm during the interview. He can't keep his interest fixed during the 50 minute interview, yawning at the end or smiling at his wife (duping delight?)
Marc Bell is linked with Lockheed Martin as chairman and founder of Terran Orbital, military intelligence nanosatellite provider

             Marc and Jennifer Bell. You do know that “Jennifer” Bell is a tranny right? Born male. These two were constantly being trashed on an old website years ago called TheDirty and they threatened to sue many times every time they were posted. Jennifer doesn’t like being outed. These two are beyond ODD and alarming they were helping children. Makes zero sense they had a bunch of children rescued from the storm with no parents. Alarming to say the least.

              That's what I thought when I watched the video.  I think that that whole episode with the children was bizarre. A  former executive of Penthouse , a mansion full of toys, the partner is transvestite and he sits on the board of a children's charity.  Not good.

            <p>
             There is no justification for this kind of market cap ($110 Billion now?) for a company that literally has no appreciable assets, no reason for its customers to not switch to cheaper or better alternatives. It should have flat to negative forecasting, not these baloney numbers it comes up with. Whoever buys this stock as an investment obviously has NO EXPERIENCE WITH SOFTWARE. Anybody who has worked in the industry knows: the more software you add to software, the bulkier and more complex and expensive it gets to manage. You’re not paying for the “software” you’re paying for the “service” of waiting in line to get service. Anybody using CRM is literally paying that company to manage its own unwieldy complexity. Customers are paying what is probably a 50X premium for something that doesn’t deserve a 50X premium.

             A San Francisco coffee company turned down a $40,000 contract to serve drinks at a Salesforce conference because of the tech company's financial ties to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
            </p>
            <p>
             Salesforce, a cloud computing company, announced in March that it was helping CBP "modernize its recruiting process" and "manage border activities."

            <p>
             Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) said that while Salesforce was not directly contributing to the separation of migrant families under President Trump’s zero tolerance policy, the company is nonetheless supporting CBP's ability to implement the policy.

Her museum gives her board the ability to send certain artwork (including massive, cumbersome structures) overseas.

The building is both owned and operated by Southwest Key Programs. According to a 2015 study,* Southwest Key Programs receives 98% of their revenue through government contracts, and millions in private donations.

             I think this info is important to the big picture of pizzagate, which is the attempt to subvert culture to the point it accepts pedophilia.

            So, in a previous comment a link was established between the school in Broward county and Habitat for Humanity via Tim Dobbins (

             Remember Sandy Hook, Newtown? Connections with NXIVM, Cerberus/Dyncorp, the Lucis Trust, and United Nations Agenda 21. Yup, looks like they're all connected..

            <p>
             The United Way of Western Connecticut, which established the Sandy Hook School Fund shortly after the shootings, has received many such calls in the past week, according to a statement released Tuesday by the organization.
            </p>
            <p>
             Officials with the United Way said a Google technical error made it appear that the online form created to accept donations for the Sandy Hook fund was posted three days before the shootings occurred.

              Thank you carmencita. I believe in 'staying the course'. Fatigue is what TPTB rely on. I'm sure that many excellent researchers are not too far away.  :-)

            <p>
             Kennedy authored and co-sponsored the Positive Aging Act, the Foundations for Learning Act, which established a grant program to improve mental and emotional health for school children through screening and early intervention, the National Neurotechnology Initiative Act, Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act; the COMBAT PTSD Act; the Nurse-Family Partnership Act, the Alzheimer’s Treatment and Caregiver Support Act, and the Ready, Willing, and Able Act
            </p>
            <p>
             He was a founder of the Rhode Island Chapter of the National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse and chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for two years (1999-2001).
            </p>
            <p>
             Kennedy founded The Kennedy Forum in 2013, a behavioral health nonprofit, of which he is CEO, with the mission of leading the national dialogue on transforming mental health and addiction care delivery by uniting mental health advocates, business leaders, and government agencies around a common set of principles, including full implementation of the Federal Parity Law.[11] In 2018, Politico termed Kennedy "the unlikely go-to player for companies seeking to benefit from the Trump administration’s multibillion-dollar response to the opioid crisis".

            In 1996 he was made

             Grand Officer of the Order of Prince Henry, Portugal

             ..What if Nunes realized he might be compromised by emails or calls or INTEL he sent to Portugal and is now trying to save his own sorry ass⁉️Funny how the least likely congressman rose from a milk maid dairy farmer 🐄 to Head of US Select Intel..

            <p>
             Devin Gerald Nunes (/ˈnuːnɛs/;[1] born October 1, 1973) is an American politician serving as the U.S. Representative for California's 22nd congressional district since 2003. A Republican, he serves as chairman of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and was a member of President Trump's transition team.
            </p>
            <p>
             In March 2017, the U.S. House intelligence committee, which Nunes chairs, launched an investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. On April 6, 2017, he temporarily stepped aside from leading that investigation while the Office of Congressional Ethics investigated allegations, which Nunes denied, that he had improperly disclosed classified information to the public.[3][4] In December 2017, the United States House Committee on Ethics closed its investigation without taking any action against Nunes.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2017, he received the  Commander of the Order of the Star of Romania

            There is supposedly a CIA friend of Cesar's from his Military school days who Cesar is congratulating.
It's in this thread at

            I don't know how the poster connected Enrique "Ric" Prado to Cesar's congratulation.
Don't now if Cesar knows this guy or not or if it is just someone he went to school with.

            In the pic of Sorenson and Glassman I don't know about anyone else, but Sorenson's eyes are very dark underneath.  I have seen this in a few other pics as well.  If you look at his pic about his own twitter, the one with his family, the children have puffs under their eyes too.  Just Sayin.

              I agree. The wife could be on to what is happening IF he is abusing those Children. If his eyes are they eyes of a pedo then I seriously worry for those children.  The older girl's eyes are worse.  But his, well really sick.  We have not talked about these eyes for quite some time on here

               I've lurked the pizzagate boards for years and I remember reading someone saying that the bags under children's eyes are from internal pressure their small bodies experience during, and from, the repeated sexual abuse. My heart breaks and my skin  crawls!

                Yes, those eyes can be indicative of sexual abuse.  It is heartbreaking to look at and to think about.  It's been awhile since I have seen eyes as bad as his.

             Then there was the speculation that Kasky was connected to Nellie Ohr of Fusion GPS:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              First off let’s start with Cameron Casky. One of the overnight stars that boiled to the surface after the Parkland shooting.  Seen here with his grandma.  That’s not Nellie Ohr BTW. It was a hoax by
              <strong>
               Shareblue
              </strong>
              to poison the well.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Shareblue is David Brock.  Where have we seen that tactic before?  But given what we know about Cameron's father.. there may well be a Fusion GPS link and that stunt was to divert researchers away.

              Jeff Kasky is the father of Cameron Kasky, one of the students at Majory Stoneman Douglas High School calling for gun control after the shooting that occurred there. Jeff Kasky is notable to Pizzagate because he was vice-president of One World Adoption Services in Florida.
             </p>
             <p>
              In conclusion, I believe there is strong evidence of predatory adoptions and human trafficking being rampant in Florida and Jeff Kasky is merely one example and egregous case.

               ROKU TV Streaming: What Parents Need To Know!!!
              </a>

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The adult entertainment industry has latched onto Roku with a vengeance!  While most require subscriptions there are a number of adult channels that are completely free, just like online porn sites.
              </p>
              <p>
               And this is where our kids can get into trouble: They find out about these channels and install them!  Parents would only know about their installation if you looked at all your installed channels via the Roku box, or if you monitored your account via the MANAGE YOUR ACCOUNT section, online.

              I had a feeling the Awans might be included in this if DWS was especially since she had an affair with Imran and used him to do a lot of her dirty work.  Kasky, I wondered as well and now I know what a slimeball and perverted scumbag he is.  No wonder he turned out a son like that.  The grandfather is no prize.  Apple feel pretty close to the tree.  The Autism aspect is really sickening.  They use these poor Children and get people to believe they are actually doing good.  Disgusting beyond words.  Disney thrown in for the heck of it.  I remember seeing that video of his son before and it is beyond gross.  Yuck.  Thanks so much for looking into all this because I so wanted to expose Kasky again.   And Brock?  That would be a lark.

            Despite his claims to be an “independent voice,” Ben Sorensen funded his 2014 State House race with thousands of dollars from special interests and political committees. According to campaign treasurer reports, Sorensen received $1,000 contributions from Disney companies including Walt Disney Travel, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Disney Photo Imaging and Magic Kingdom, Inc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Would an “independent voice” defend south Florida over the needs of Orlando after taking so much money from Walt Disney companies?
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorensen’s campaign is using these contributions to pay for services from a Jacksonville firm with ties to the Republican Party. Sorensen has paid nearly $12,000 to The Whitson Group for consultation, palm cards and yard signs. The Whitson Group (aka TWS Technologies) usually works for Republican candidates such as State Senator Jack Latvala.
           </p>
           <p>
            So he has ties to Disney, the Clintons, and Republicans.  Also I question if he knows Sheriff Scott Israel the Sheriff of Broward County who

              In tat first link of the museum you see Celine Handbags.  They are highly expensive.  We have researched the fashion ind. before as being involved in trafficking and also the museums with the money laundering aspect.  That's what I think is going on there.  Especially since we know Sorenson is involved with the Clintons and the rest of the cabal of the Dem. &amp; Rep. parties.   OH GEE.  As I mentioned in another comment, Sorenson has Disney connections as well as with Chris Dodd i see, who left the Congress to work for a faction Disney and Malia O got a job with them as well.

                Bingo! These people are all connected to each other on and off.  Why, because they are so evil the elist cabals use them over and over.  They know they have them with blackmail and know they will keep doing their dirty work.  Possibly Disney is a bigger player with this group than thought.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In 2014, Sorensen was a Democratic Party candidate for the Florida House District 100 seat serving Hollywood, Hallandale Beach and parts of Miami.
             </p>
             <p>
              Would an “independent voice” fight expanded gambling in Fort Lauderdale after taking contributions from the casinos in Hallandale Beach?
             </p>
             <p>
              Coincidentally, Communities First, the group BrowardBeat reported was behind pro-Sorensen ads, received thousands of dollars from the same insurance agents groups.
             </p>
             <p>
              How does an “independent voice” get hooked up with shadowy PACS funded by special interest groups?
             </p>
             <p>
              As Buddy Nevins reported three years ago, Democrat Ben Sorensen has a knack for getting money and support from Republican sources. In the 2014 Democrat primary, Sorensen was endorsed by right-leaning groups such as The Florida Chamber of Commerce, a builders political committee and a pro-school vouchers group.
             </p>
             <p>
              “We need someone who is able to have their door open to other ideas,” Sorensen told Nevins. “We need someone who is not a line-in-the-sand Democrat. Someone who will talk to the other side.”

              Thanks for that!  I had to leave &amp; knew you wouldn't miss it!  This is turning into another Rat Line False Flag.  A movie with a cast of thousands perhaps?  I can't believe people can't find this stuff themselves and wake up.  I am not a techie. If I can do it so can they.  Frustrating to know that they still believe in Don Lemon.  Sorenson is a snake in the grass like Randy Wilcox.

             In my experience as a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve,
             <strong>
              I serve as an intelligence officer at the Pentagon
             </strong>
             . Often times when considering an issue with national security implications, a red cell is employed to identify the weakness of a plan or tactic. Following the work of the red cell, their findings are shared with decision makers to implement an even better plan or tactic. Incorporating a very different perspective is vital to our national security decision making.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a life-long Democrat I have worked for Senator Bob Graham to improve our schools and have seen first hand his ability to move Florida forward. I believe that we, as Democrats, can lead with conviction while also finding common ground with others to positively affect the people of District 100 and all Floridians.
