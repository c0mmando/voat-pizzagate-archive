            Like everything Clinton/Soros related, 'Too Small to Fail' falls under promotion of Marxism/Alinsky/Clintons' push for global communism by indoctrinating kids from an early age, examples of which we have no shortage.  I say this because 'Too Small to Fail' is a program of The Opportunity Institute, a clearly SJW politicized NGO.  They partner with CF for TSTF so no wonder Chelsea is giving them publicity.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The work of The Opportunity Institute cuts across issue silos to address the complex barriers to social mobility at critical junctures in people’s lives. We focus broadly on educational opportunities, beginning with infant and toddler development and continuing to PreK through grade 12 schooling, higher education completion, pathways out of incarceration, and into early career and family support. Our signature projects include Too Small to Fail, Partners for Each and Every Child, and Renewing Communities.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The organization is pure Soros agenda driven, seeking  to recruit and train comrade SJWs before they can walk, so that Open Borders regime never runs out of disgruntled protest groups fodder or new SJW talking heads.

              Madeleine McCann Abduction Investigation receives extended funding with a “new lead” on a suspect. Madeleine McCann’s abduction from Praia da Luz, Portugal made worldwide headlines in May of 2007. When the McCann’s became persons of interest, their PR Agent stepped down from the case, and Clarence Mitchell, stepped away from his position as Director of the Media Monitoring Unit at the British Government’s Central Office of Information, to represent the McCanns. He also signed on to work for Freud Communications, run by
              <strong>
               Sir Clement Freud’s son, Matthew Freud.
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Sir Clement Freud’s son, Matthew Freud, is the great-grandson of “father” of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud and is doubly related to the “father” of public relations, Edward Bernays. A former BBC Journalist, Matthew Freud was married to media-mogul Rupert Murdoch’s daughter, Elisabeth Murdoch.

              Both Matthew and his late brother, painter Lucien Freud had close relationships with Jacob Rothschild. Rothschild’s 50 year friend and American counterpart, the late David Rockefeller, funds the Partnership for Public Service through his organization, the Rockefeller Brother’s Fund.

              The Partnership for Public Service publishes the Presidential Transition Guide, which instructs the President elect how to act as President.

             In all actuality, the kids are the ones who pay for it.  That is probably a great place to pick up a few kiddos when the Haiti, India or  S. African ratline is short on shipments because too many of them died in the shipping containers coming over.  They have orders to fill for all the pedo pervs out there. So what a perfect place to pick them up.  Remember Trolley Park by Pegasus Museum?

               I'm old enough to remember when Chelsea Clinton moved into the White House as an innocent, impressionable, sweet, young girl.  Back then, in the days before social media,  sheep like me wrre unaware that the media was skewing the truth and feeding us piles of steaming bullshit.  Now, almost 30 years later, I know the truth.  And I'm sick to my stomach to see what a tool of the Pedophile Elites Chelsea Clinton has become.  I can't defend her, because she's an evil mouthpiece of her sick mommy and daddy.  But, in times of reflection, I'm actually quite sad that innocent children -- even Chelsea Clinton, who did not choose these cretins for patents -- are as vulnerable to psycho adults in their lives as they are.  Sigh.

                The narc pathology is created by neglect the core and spoil. At this junction, Chelsea has consciously chosen to engage in shady. Part of the propaganda publicity is to paint her as a innocent girl. Compare and contrast the news of her past teen pal, Ivanka. On twitter, Chelsea boldly tweets affiliations with top government and corporate/npo; including CDC. SEE the history of the family she married into. This is one dangerous B, who will continue to cover up and vye for power. Read the site, narc.site to see how narcs operate.

                 .  Oh yeah, Web Hubbell.  If I remember correctly there are pics all over the internet comparring Chelsea to him.  They both have a fat, bulbous, protruding lower lip and a cro magnon forehead.  A special kind of "homely" all their own.
