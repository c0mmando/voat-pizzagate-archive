            What is sickening me the most are the everyday people I know who always seemed 'normal' but I hear defending the 'new norm'. Let little girls dress sexy. They ALL do. Let little boys talk dirty. They ALL do. That should terrify every parent out there!

             My mom has 10 grandkids. All of them from ages 1 to teens. They talk and dress respectfully. They donâ€™t hav access to too much TV or internet. The older ones are home schooled. Family values still survive in rural America.

              Fact: Put two families in a room. One home schooled kids. The other,  not. Guaranteed every time, the home schooled kids will be obviously brighter, kinder and exhibit a higher moral standard. Anyone can see the difference. The government doesn't like home schooling. It creates children with more potential. Your Mom deserves to be very proud.

               As someone who had friends that were home schooled but was not homeschooled myself, homeschooling is something you really want to avoid. Multiple families we knew that homeschooled, only one of these families had kids brighter than the norm, the other families kids were significantly/noticeably less intelligent. ALL homeschooled kids were fucked in the head socially, even the "advanced" ones. You aren't doing your kids any favors by home schooling them, you really aren't. They're going to have to learn to sort the truth from the BS on their own one day anyway (you think you can hold their hand forever?) regular schooling is perfect for that. Just teach your kids to be respectful and think for themselves.

                As someone who worked at a large facility that catered to home schooled children and public schooled children in a highly populated area...as someone who has many friends who home school and many who do not...as someone who has followed the posted evidence for years, I am very curious where you live. The national average in the USA is that home schooled children are in the top ten percentile of ALL students. They get along better with all children. They are more respectful to adults. They react much much much more efficiently in emergency drills. They learn much more quickly in large group situations. They are more creative. They need to ask less questions and get better scores. I worked with these kids for several years and could go on all day as could many people I know. So fortunately, here in the US, we experience no problems such as you are describing. The only way the kids score low is if their parents don't do their part. And even at that they score higher than the public school kids.

                 NM, you probably work at some testing facility. 
I don't really want to argue with you. I think we'll just have to agree to disagree.

                 A large facility that caters to both? What might that be, I wonder? I'm having a hard time even guessing what that could be. Now you've got me curious. I've lived on both the east coast and west coast US, my experience with this is not confined to a single area. East coast schools are better, period. Home schooled kids in both locations showed the disadvantages I've spoken of, but the single instance of sharp home students were east coast. I think you're suffering from confirmation bias. We all do it, nothing to be ashamed of. BC a quick search shows me plenty of articles supporting your points, also plenty of articles that support my own. My own experience tells me, in a completely unbiased way (my own folks wanted to home school us so it's not like I'm jealous or anything, quite the opposite bc after meeting results of those horrorshows enough times I begged them not to) that home schooling is overall a bad thing. The kids are all "weaker", unable to think for themselves or interact normally with others their own age. They are unburdened with even a rudimentary diplomatic ability, completely lacking any real self awareness BC they're always surrounded by family members. Even the sharp ones were weird. Very weird. Oldest boy would try to make out with you all the time. I'm male and I actually DON'T believe he was gay/bi, just totally fucked in the head with no idea how to behave around new, non-adult, people. These were the sharp ones, mind you.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Good luck in your own endeavors. Hope that if you try it that it works out better than what I've seen. I can't imagine that much hand-holding is good for most children, but then I suppose it'd ultimately depend on both the child and the one holding their hand.

                Research mind control. Common core schooling. I think they got rid of that just a month or so ago. Delve  into multiple topics here on Voat. All lead to schools being a source of controlling our children until they are adult robots. Home schooling saves these kids. Every child deserves better than public/private school. They deserve a real education. Only available at home. Good for you for encouraging your wife.

                 Rural towns, and a few states are holding the line. That common core stuff was recently exposed in a veritas sting, you probably saw it. Itâ€™s an all out assault on whatâ€™s good. We r in the upside down, good is bad, bad is good.
