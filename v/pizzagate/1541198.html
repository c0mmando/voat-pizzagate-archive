<p>Basically it talks about pedophilia in Hollywood and how many people, especially in powerful positions, make sure that these cases do not see the light of day.  This got me thinking that there could be link to James Alefantis to Hollywood or at least some connection to producers of crew members who have been associated or convicted of child related crimes.  He does have and IMDB and has been a producer on a couple movies and I know this is him because a credit is given to him on The Kelly File as himself.  I\'m going to start looking more into this but his most famous movie was titled Me at the Zoo, which follows Chris Crocker (YouTube personality) and it seems pretty weird.</p>
