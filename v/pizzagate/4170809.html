<p>PuttItOut, the sole admin of Voat, has decided to close up shop (see <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/4169936">the global sticky, above</a>). It apparently is not an issue of money, as thousands of users have offered that. My guess is that Putt could no longer stand up to the globalist cabal whose evil deeds we have so diligently documented here. Truly, it\'s a wonder he wasn\'t Epsteined long before now.</p>
<p>The good news is, <a href="https://SearchVoat.co">https://SearchVoat.co</a> is a completely separate site and will not be going offline. He has 99% of everything completely backed up and <a href="https://voat.co/v/SearchVoat/4170146">explains how to access it here</a>, which I have stickied. Your research, in both submissions and comments <a href="https://voat.co/v/SearchVoat/4170476">will not be lost</a>. Also, our unsung hero <a href="https://voat.co/u/MadWorld">@MadWorld</a> has made sure [everything is backed up to archive.is and archive.org, as described <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/4170450/26902996">here</a>. So rest your hearts. Our ammo is secure.</p>
<p>In addition, you can always find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/Vindic8tr">https://twitter.com/Vindic8tr</a>. My protonmail is Vindic8tor@protonmail.com (though I don\'t check that regularly). My Twitter DMs are open, and I receive notifications on my phone. So I want any of you who need to talk in the coming days to feel free to reach out. I worry about some of you. This community has been a great source of support for many survivors.</p>
<p>You should know that over a year ago, I learned some things that made me shift my focus from research and shill-warfare to spiritual warfare. I have never posted my research on that here, though many of you already know the gist of it. We are fighting demonic forces, here. That requires prayer, sacrifice and sanctity, so I began a rigorous prayer and fasting regimen in support of our efforts here. Within about a month of that, the two most dangerous shills here, Kevdude and EsotericShade deleted their accounts. And in that time, despite Covid1984, we\'ve seen our work become <em>common knowledge</em> to everyday people, seniors, Zoomers -- they\'re all talking about globalist pedos who sacrifice kids. Just in the past two weeks, we\'ve had several of our major perps arrested. I have GREAT HOPE for the future.</p>
<p>I want you to know that I will continue praying for our work, and for YOU. Your courage and resilience has humbled and sustained me more times than I can count. I will never forget. The loss of this community sucks. I do not have time or the personal skills to set up an alternative site. I know some of you dislike Q, but I think our best bet is to stick with <a href="https://voat.co/u/Crensch">@Crensch</a>, since the majority of pizzagate researchers moved to GreatAwakening years ago, and <a href="https://voat.co/v/GreatAwakening/4170606">they are planning a migration</a>. I\'m happy to hear other options, too. We can discuss that, below.</p>
<p>That this is happening I believe is the most profound acknowledgement of the damage we\'ve done to the evil, corrupt, child-murdering rapist elite. The toothpaste is out of the tube and they will never, ever be able to put it back in, whether Voat goes dark.</p>
<p>Only a few of you know why I chose the name Vindicator. It is a reference to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+19%3A25-27&amp;version=NABRE">Job 19:25-27</a>, which reads as follows in the NABRE translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for me, I know that my vindicator lives,</p>
<p>and that he will at last stand forth upon the dust.</p>
<p>This will happen when my skin has been stripped off,</p>
<p>and from my flesh I will see God:</p>
<p>I will see for myself,</p>
<p>my own eyes, not another’s, will behold him:</p>
<p>my inmost being is consumed with longing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a Vindicator. He foiled the plans of the devil by running a covert operation, by making himself small and sneaking into history as a little baby born to a poor family who grew up to challenge the corrupt elite so effectively they murdered him. By taking the life of the Author of Life, freely laid down in love, they inadvertently paid off all the debt the devil held the title to. I\'ve come to understand, thanks to our work, that the devil desires the rape and slaughter of children due to his rage over this event at the hinge of history. </p>
<p>In 2010, I was able to see with my own eyes, up close, the inexplicable image, the blood, and the dirt stains on the knees and feet, preserved on the Shroud of Turin, the most scientifically studied artifact in history. </p>
<p>I know my Vindicator lives. My own eyes will behold him. My inmost being is filled with longing.</p>
<p>I chose this screen name so that each time you pinged me you were secretly honoring our Lord. How glorious it\'s been, especially in the mouths of the haters! :-) Do not give up. Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, what God has planned for those who love Him.</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me serve here. It\'s been a profound honor.</p>

            Thanks everyone for your work, this sub is tremendous example of how people can organize in order to find truth, hopefully all of us will keep fighting the good fight elsewhere too. It's very sad but to say something positive - not end of the world, it's bad news but we're still here, we are motivated - because we have reason to be motivated and internet is not 100% controlled so hopefully we will organize elsewhere and grow to community like this once again.

             Yes. Thank you darkknight. Folks just need to beware: we have no idea who runs that board. I signed up to Ruqqus yesterday as Vindicator and subscribed to that guild. Be wary, though.

            Putt joked about having his (middle) fingers cut off in an accident. I am not sure if he was trolling us in the chatroom or some kind of threatening encounter.

             Would have been a way to show they were nt joking.  Cut off his fingers, then say, shut it down, but its your culture, so do it your way.  Joke about your dick or something because thats next.  Id shut it down too.  No one can brave out getting Kashoggi'd.

             Yeah, hard to know with Putt. I found his ref to the Twelve Apostles a bit weird. Thought maybe he was talking about a jury.
