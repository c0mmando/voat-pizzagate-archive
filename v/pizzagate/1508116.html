<p>Out of curiosity I looked this guy up.</p>

<p>DeLay\'s website concludes by saying that the former congressman and his wife &quot;continue to be outspoken advocates for foster care reform and are actively involved in a unique foster care community in Richmond, Texas, that provides safe, permanent homes for abused and neglected kids.&quot; Rio Bend, a &quot;Christ-centered&quot; community which the DeLays founded, opened in 2005</p>

<p>So at this point I\'m thinking, is this all just some smoke and mirrors shit? Are there actual children involved in any of this? Critics claim DeLay used the charity as a fraudulent front to get money for other stuff, but this site is never mentioned on his wikipedia page, but rather (and without accusing it of being a front) the Rio Bend Community is mentioned. </p>
<p>But other sources are saying that the charity money went <em>towards</em> the Rio Bend Community.</p>

<p>&lt; A foster care community designed to resemble a small neighborhood so that foster families can support each other and raise children in a stable setting was officially opened Monday in Fort Bend County.</p>
<p>&lt; The Oaks at Rio Bend, the brainchild of U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, and his wife, Christine, is a privately funded effort that will eventually be home to 192 foster children.</p>
<p>&lt; Iva Powers is a foster parent who has already moved into one of the houses. She said having other foster parents for neighbors will be a huge advantage when seeking advice, comfort or help.</p>
<p>&lt; Rio Bend is on the north side of Richmond on 50 acres of land donated by the George Foundation, a philanthropic group.</p>
<p>&lt; &quot;It (Rio Bend) is just like a regular neighborhood, there is one big difference, everybody on the street and the streets to come will be foster parents,&quot; she said.</p>
<p><strong>Who are these people who are volunteering to move into these houses in a special neighborhood where only foster children and foster parents live?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What happened to all of those children? What is going on in the community now? Why is the Rio Bend webpage so fking bizarre?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lutheran Social Services of the South will be responsible for administering the day-to-day activities of Rio Bend such as interviewing, training and supervising foster parents.</p>

<p>Confused about mission, non existent corporate support and top management until the employee achieves the goals set out by C suite, then summarily dismiss the employee. Not caring, compliance and finance issues. Have created a culture of fear for top managers and unaccountability for supervisors and line staff. Butts in beds mentality toward adoption and taking children from their parents.</p>
<p>Upper management does not care about all of the lower paid workers. They do not manage by example but by instilling fear in the employees.</p>
<p>Management refuses to listen to staff. This is a dog eat dog agency, don\'t let the name fool you!! History of violations....outlook for company not good!</p>
<p>This agency is driven by individuals solely interested in their own careers and making money for the agency. There are very few individuals working here who are actually interested in making a difference for children. This agency threatens to fire their employees daily and rules by fear. </p>

<p>Department of Family and Protective Services officials decided to quash a possible agreement with Lutheran Social Services of the South, Inc., after reviewing recent problems at the Austin-based nonprofit’s foster homes including “inappropriate discipline, abuse and neglect, and unsafe environments,” according to the newspaper. </p>
<p>Lutheran is “the largest provider of children’s residential services in Texas with 455 foster homes caring for more than 791 children daily,” according to its tax filing for 2010, the most recent year available.</p>

           So at this point I'm thinking, is this all just some smoke and mirrors shit? Are there actual children involved in any of this? Critics claim DeLay used the charity as a fraudulent front to get money for other stuff, but this site is never mentioned on his wikipedia page, but rather (and without accusing it of being a front) the Rio Bend Community is mentioned.
          </p>
          <p>
           But other sources are saying that the charity money went
           <em>
            towards
           </em>
           the Rio Bend Community.

            Congressman Tom DeLay and Christine DeLay, Les Newton, a member of the Oaks at Rio Bend Board of Directors; Carolyn Teltschik, president, The DeLay Foundation for Kids Board of Directors, and other project supporters recently helped break ground on the Oaks at Rio Bend, a planned community which will provide a healthy, nurturing, permanent living environment for abused and neglected children in the Fort Bend County foster care system.
           </p>
           <p>
            A new project for the DeLay Foundation for Kids, the Oaks at Rio Bend is being developed on 50 acres donated by The George Foundation of Texas along the Brazos River in Richmond. Phase I is being developed on 30 of the 50 acres, with 20 acres being held on reserve for future development.

           &lt; A foster care community designed to resemble a small neighborhood so that foster families can support each other and raise children in a stable setting was officially opened Monday in Fort Bend County.
          </p>
          <p>
           &lt; The Oaks at Rio Bend, the brainchild of U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, and his wife, Christine, is a privately funded effort that will eventually be home to 192 foster children.
          </p>
          <p>
           &lt; Iva Powers is a foster parent who has already moved into one of the houses. She said having other foster parents for neighbors will be a huge advantage when seeking advice, comfort or help.
          </p>
          <p>
           &lt; Rio Bend is on the north side of Richmond on 50 acres of land donated by the George Foundation, a philanthropic group.
          </p>
          <p>
           &lt; "It (Rio Bend) is just like a regular neighborhood, there is one big difference, everybody on the street and the streets to come will be foster parents," she said.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Who are these people who are volunteering to move into these houses in a special neighborhood where only foster children and foster parents live?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            What happened to all of those children? What is going on in the community now? Why is the Rio Bend webpage so fking bizarre?
           </strong>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Lutheran Social Services of the South will be responsible for administering the day-to-day activities of Rio Bend such as interviewing, training and supervising foster parents.

            Confused about mission, non existent corporate support and top management until the employee achieves the goals set out by C suite, then summarily dismiss the employee. Not caring, compliance and finance issues. Have created a culture of fear for top managers and unaccountability for supervisors and line staff. Butts in beds mentality toward adoption and taking children from their parents.
           </p>
           <p>
            Upper management does not care about all of the lower paid workers. They do not manage by example but by instilling fear in the employees.
           </p>
           <p>
            Management refuses to listen to staff. This is a dog eat dog agency, don't let the name fool you!! History of violations....outlook for company not good!
           </p>
           <p>
            This agency is driven by individuals solely interested in their own careers and making money for the agency. There are very few individuals working here who are actually interested in making a difference for children. This agency threatens to fire their employees daily and rules by fear.
