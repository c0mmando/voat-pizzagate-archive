            I was reading the above-referenced book, written by ex-CIA Office of Security interrogators, when I came upon a passage the authors intended as an example of some of the agency's non-coercive interrogation techniques.  For obvious reasons, it made me take immediate notice, and I thought I would share it with you all:

            From pages 46-48.

           <p>
            Early in his career, Phil [pseudonym] had been called in to interview a U.S. government employee who held a senior managerial position as a GS-15.  The man, whom we'll call "Oscar," was under investigation for child molestation.  Phil had routinely been called upon to conduct interviews and interrogations of people who were accused of committing some of the most horrific crimes imaginable.  It was part of the job, and it had to be done.  But this one was especially tough. 
[...]
It was going well.  What Phil was saying was apparently resonating, because Oscar wasn't putting up any resistance.  Phil kept going, repeating the points he was making, and repeating them again.  When the time came to test the water, Phil did so gently, and with no hint of derision or sanctimony.  "Oscar, I know all of this is very embarrassing to have to talk about.  Nobody wants to be in a position of talking about things that are very, very personal.  Talking about things involving children is especially embarrassing in the society we live in, there's no question about that.  [...]  Now, when was the last time you were alone with any of these kids?"
           </p>
           <p>
            The disturbing nature of the rest of the conversation was such that we certainly have no intention of subjecting anyone to it here.  What we can say is that Oscar admitted to molesting hundreds of children.  He even shared his favorite hangout when he was on the prowl: a popular pizza and arcade chain that catered to children.
