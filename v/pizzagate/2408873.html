<p>LifeSiteNews has obtained internal documents of the U.S.-based Papal Foundation, a charity with a stellar history of assisting the world’s poor, showing that last summer the Pope personally requested, and obtained in part, a $25 million grant to a corruption-plagued, Church-owned dermatological hospital in Rome accused of money laundering. Records from the financial police indicate the hospital has liabilities over one billion USD – an amount larger than the national debt of some 20 nations. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Papal Foundation\'s HQ are in Philadelphia, and the Board is composed of a number of high-ranking US cardinals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donald Cardinal Wuerl, Chairman
Archbishop of Washington, DC
Daniel Cardinal DiNardo 
Archbishop of Galveston-Houston
Timothy Cardinal Dolan 
Archbishop of New York
Roger Cardinal Mahony 
Archbishop Emeritus of Los Angeles
Adam Cardinal Maida

Seán Patrick Cardinal O\'Malley 
Archbishop of Boston
Justin Cardinal Rigali 
Archbishop Emeritus of Philadelphia</p>

<p>The foundation<a href="https://www.thepapalfoundation.org/grants/recent-grants/"> provides grants</a> for seemingly benevolent purposes: rebuilding convents, rectories and seminaries. From the Life Site News article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wealthy American Catholic families funded the building of churches, monasteries, schools and seminaries in impoverished nations. AIDS hospices, facilities for care of youth with physical and mental disabilities, and the like have also benefited from their generosity.</p>

<p>Donors to the Papal Foundation are called &quot;Stewards of St. Peter&quot;, and a list of donors may be found on p. 12 of this pdf: <a href="https://www.thepapalfoundation.org/files/4814/5671/1265/PAPAL_AR_15.Offset-Fin.pdf">https://www.thepapalfoundation.org/files/4814/5671/1265/PAPAL_AR_15.Offset-Fin.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>POSSIBLE CONNECTION TO PIZZAGATE</strong></p>
<p>Some of the charitable activities of the Papal Foundation may raise red flags with veteran pizzagaters: grants for AIDS hospices, orphanages, children\'s hospitals and schools, in particular, and this is certainly an avenue for more research. However, if some will remember, the tragic and heartbreaking account given by<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2397920"> an SRA survivor on Voat </a>a few months ago, she related this key information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My main perpetrator, Msgr. Thomas J Benestad worked for Cardinal Krol and JP II for the Papal Foundation 
<a href="http://articles.mcall.com/1988-05-06/news/2631739_1_pastoral-care-cardinal-john-krol-papal-foundation">http://articles.mcall.com/1988-05-06/news/2631739_1_pastoral-care-cardinal-john-krol-papal-foundation</a>
This was Krol\'s funeral mass, it was televised and the good Msgr helped to cover the body, like family members do. I wish that video was still online... <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Cardinal+Krol&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI6LCRmKnZAhXjYt8KHfCGBZYQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662#imgrc=MO">https://www.google.com/search?q=Cardinal+Krol&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI6LCRmKnZAhXjYt8KHfCGBZYQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=662#imgrc=MO</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://articles.mcall.com/keyword/st-charles-borromeo-seminary">A 1992 article</a> confirms this information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rev. Thomas J. Benestad, director of the Papal Foundation, Philadelphia, was recently named an honorary prelate of his holiness with the title of monsignor. A charter member of the Diocesan Finance Committee, Benestad was released by Bishop Thomas J. Welsh and appointed to the Papal Foundation by Cardinal John Krol in 1988.</p>

<p><strong>MORE INVESTIGATION NEEDED</strong></p>
<p>There are hints from Q that the Pope is involved in sick and evil enterprises. There seems to be a connection between the Vatican and the Red Cross and NK. Q also refers to the Pope\'s approval of the change to the Our Father. &quot;P&quot; seems to refer to the Pope:</p>
<p>On Dec 21, Q said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Soros takes orders from P.
You have no idea how sick and evil these people are.
Fight, fight, fight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Feb. 10, Q said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Save the best for last.
[P]
Q</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can certainly begin investigating the troubled hospital in Rome that the Pope was attempting to shore up with funds from the Papal Foundation. The operations of the Papal Foundation in third world countries are also worthy of scrutiny, and, finally, the connection between the SRA survivor and the former director of the Papal Foundation, Msgr. Thomas Benestad, demands further attention.</p>',

            I found a newly formed group called The Santa Marta Group founded by Pope Francis in 2014
           </p>
           <p>
            The Santa Marta Group is an alliance of international police chiefs and bishops from around the world working together with civil society in a process endorsed by Pope Francis, to eradicate human trafficking and modern day slavery
           </p>
           <p>
            what I found interesting was the partners of this group
           </p>
           <p>
            The Santa Marta Group is a growing global partnership that has members in over 30 countries.
It includes:
The Vatican
           </p>
           <p>

             I didn't see this before. Thanks. This sounds quite sinister. Santa Marta is the hotel/residence where Pope Francis lives instead of living in the papal apartments next to St. Peter's Basilica. I think I've heard of this Santa Marta group before in a different context. Will keep looking.

             Wow. This is highly intriguing. Thanks. Multiply this with the fact that Pope Francis is the world's foremost advocate of migrants and open borders, and it certainly makes such an association more than a little suspect regardless of its stated intentions----or maybe the group's **stated intentions **are what makes people like us most suspicious?

              think I will leave the Papal Foundation for others and see what I can find on this group

               Absolutely look into it. I'm looking to. Cardinal Nichols is a huge leftist and open borders proponent like Pope Francis. How can you seriously say you want to combat human trafficking if you want no controls on migration and actively work to facilitate hordes of undocumented people swarming across the globe?

                It doesn't make any sense because it's done by design! They aren't simply silly lefties who have bleeding hearts, these are evil people who are very calculated and know exactly what they are doing. I saw a comment indicating you are catholic. I was raised Catholic so I do not mean to disrespect you, but the Catholic Church is very corrupt and downright evil at the top. Lots of good Catholic people, including most of my family members,  but it is a deeply corrupted and false religion that has fooled a lot of people

                 Yes, I am a Catholic, and I appreciate your concern, but I learned long ago that the Church has many evil/corrupt/apathetic/weak/unkind/dishonest members, but that the Church's mission is divinely instituted and the Holy Spirit is guiding its progress. I'm in for the long haul and believe it is my obligation to do all the good I can in my corner of the Church with the people in my parish. I believe with all my heart the Church will be purged and renewed someday soon, and we will be blessed with saintly leaders again. Church has been through before.

                 Santa Marta Group was started in 2014 at Pope Francis' residence. Don't know if you saw what I wrote about the M_Rsection (Migrants and Refugees) organization also started by Pope Francis and under his personal supervision. So he has a special human trafficking task force (extrajudicial?) and a pro-open borders activist group under his own guidance, working at cross-purposes. Even Fr. Michael Czerny, the head of the M_Rsection office

                 the difficulty of preventing trafficking among migrants:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  “Traffickers can easily take advantage of the desperation of migrants and asylum seekers. Ending up in an irregular or undocumented status, they are at a very high risk of abuse and exploitation, including trafficking and enslavement. Therefore, the Holy See stresses the importance of ensuring adequate legal frameworks and reliable pathways to prevent migrants from becoming victims of human trafficking.”
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 You should read what else he says. He proposes this as a solution:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  "We ought to recognize that we are facing a global phenomenon that exceeds the competence of any one community or country. In order to eliminate it, we need a mobilization comparable in size to that of the phenomenon itself.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  “The Holy See looks forward to participating in the high-level meeting to review the progress made on the implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons, September 27-28, 2017 in New York,” Fr Czerny concluded.

                I've been looking at the Santa Marta Group's Twitter feed and suddenly remembered another Vatican-sponsored group, M_Rsection,
                <a href="https://migrants-refugees.va/">
                 Migrants and Refugees
                </a>
                , run by a Jesuit priest.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 The Migrants &amp; Refugees Section is a small action-oriented Vatican office personally directed by Pope Francis. He is convinced that special attention and efforts are needed to ensure that those forced to flee are not shut out or left behind. The M&amp;R Section helps the Church worldwide to support those who are forcibly displaced by conflict, natural disaster, persecution or extreme poverty; those who are making their difficult way to safety or are stuck; and those who fall victim to human trafficking.
                </p>
               </blockquote>
               <p>
                So, you have Santa Marta Group, the anti-trafficking organization on one hand, and Migrants &amp; Refugees on the other, both personally supported by Pope Francis.

                Some have pointed that "M_Rs" = MARS. It is run by Jesuits who love Mars research; the Pope is famous for having said early in his pontificate that
                <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/pope-says-baptism-for-all--even-martians-20140512-zraqo">
                 he would be happy
                </a>
                to baptize a Martian.
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Christians cannot "close the door" to all those who seek baptism even if they are "green men, with a long nose and big ears, like children draw," the pope said at his daily mass on Monday, according to Vatican Radio.
                </p>
               </blockquote>

                There is a lot more to the Pope/Jesuit/Argentina/Mars/RedCross/NK thing, but I think everyone would think I was loony tunes if I said anything more.

                 Funny thing that both the Santa Marta Group and the M_Rsection group were specially initiated and personally endorsed by Pope Francis, his special pet projects:

                  began
                 </a>
                 in the presence of the Pope at his residence:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Following initiatives by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference for England and Wales (CBCEW), the Santa Marta Group was developed by the CBCEW and first met in Rome during April 2014 when police chiefs and Catholic bishops came together, in the presence of Pope Francis, to sign an historic declaration, committing themselves to a partnership to eliminate human trafficking.

                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 The M_Rsection (Migrants and Refugees Section) was created by Pope Francis and

                  put directly

                 under his guidance:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Discussion about creation of such an office had been ongoing for months. The pope's Council of Cardinals, a group of nine prelates advising the pontiff on reforming the Vatican bureaucracy, formally recommended its creation during their meeting in June.The Vatican press office said in a statement that a department inside the new office will be dedicated specifically to aiding migrants, which "expresses in a special way the pope's concern for migrants and refugees." That section will be put "directly under guidance" of the pope ad tempus, or for the moment, it said.

            LifeSiteNews is on target. Cardinal Wuerl AKA "Donna Wuerl" by some, lives in a Wash. DC $40 million Church complex in a penthouse on the 3rd floor, annual property taxes $50K plus. He is the one that relayed the Papal  request for $25 million. 
"During the strive to make a Sodomite priesthood, Donald 'Dignity Mass' Wuerl was there, in the seats of influence, letting it happen. "
           </p>
           <p>
            The Church is riddled with homosexuals who love display and luxury. Hence the gravitation towards money. See The Rite of Sodomy : Homosexuality and the Roman Catholic Church by Randy Engel. Homosexual Collective in the Catholic Church is intergenerational (beginning since the 1960s) built on a culture of sexual deviancy and metastasized into the Catholic hierarchy. They are changing the Church in order to change Catholics. Their social engineering needs money and they have targeting the wealthy Catholic Church to fund their political aims.

            Thanks for the ping. Where don't the tentacles reach, how many tentacles are there, and how the hell do we cut them all off? It's like we need a worldwide PG protest, and have a whole lot of people concentrated in Vatican Square, Times Square, and every other square of this fucked up chess board.

             I've always been aware of the clerical pedophile problem and ran up against it personally (in a mild form, thank God) but what the SRA survivor related about what occurred at St. Charles Seminary, PA,  is an entirely different level of evil which must be eradicated in the Church. Fr. Malachi Martin's book, Windswept House, I believe, chronicles in pseudonym form the satanic network in the US and Vatican. I read most of it some time ago and could not process that it was still a threat.

              Yes, and I remember growing up in PA and hearing my great aunt talk about how they would move priests around. She said they'd be there for awhile, then be transferred. I nor anyone I know was abused in the church, but while my great aunt attended church every week, I never her mention anything directly about any abuse. My aunt was a very good woman, and not a Bible thumper by any means, so I'm wondering if good priests get transferred before they're able to catch on to what's going on in the darkness. Do the evil ones mention code words around new priests and if they don't catch on or respond to them in kind, they're set to go elsewhere? And of course, the ones who are found guilty of abuses get transferred, so it would be nice if there was a public record of who get sent where and when. Might be able to find patterns that couldn't be seen before.

               Priests usually receive a 6-year assignment, at least in my diocese. Just looked it up: "Canon (church) law permits a conference of bishops to establish guidelines for the length of pastor appointments. In the United States, that term is six years, renewable for another six years. A pastor may be moved prior to that time, or may be kept on longer, depending on the bishop’s assessment of the pastoral needs within the parish and diocesan-wide."
              </p>
              <p>
               If a priest gets moved around in less than 6-year increments, that could be a red flag of some kind.

            THIS IS AN OLD EMAIL SENT TO ME IN 2006 BY A WELL KNOWN JOURNALIST
           </p>
           <p>
            "This is a great start. Thanks. BTW, you do understand that the Papal Foundation is big money, don't you? According to a Wall St. Journal 1999 article, the foundation had almost 50 million. It must be much bigger now. One of the foundation's 1 million+ donors is Tom Monaghan, the super conservative owner of Dominoes pizza. The big donors get an audience with the Pope. The whole thing is run out of the Philly A.D., but some of the biggest Cardinals and Archbishops in the US sit on the board of directors. "

             Big charity money. These people do a lot of good in the world for a lot of people who would otherwise have no hope.

              A lot of good?  You mean like Oxfam whose people were exchanging food so they could rape children.  Thousands Raped.  That is the good you are talking about.  People in the UK are up in arms and have been sending their messages of horror to the CEO wh is now at his wits end.  Rightfully so.  He should be.  Those little children were in his care and he failed them and so did his people.  We don't need  dogooders like the Papal Found. with ties to Soros and the CF.  Please do some research.

             Shocking.  A $215M Endowment.  "We are called by Christ to share this mercy," said Pope Francis, "with those who are spiritually and materially in need through the spiritual and corporal works of mercy."  That is the part that is the most sickening of all.

            Looks like we hit a nerve given that a shill is posting trying to defend. You know who it is, and you guys all know what to do to silence shills, right (which arrow to hit on all their posts).?

             Conrad Hilton Found. ***  Hawley Hilton McAuliffe In 2014, McAuliffe and her husband were appointed Hospitallers for the ORDER of MALTA, Palm Beach area, where she and her husband have organized a monthly outreach program to serve meals to homeless persons at St. Ann Place. Her passion for gardening and her love of community are evidenced by her service on the board of the Grass River Garden Club in Delray Beach.*** Dr. Mark Rosenberg MD MPP   While Dr. Rosenberg was president and CEO, The Task Force was instrumental in providing people in the developing world with greater access to vaccines for influenza, cholera, and other deadly diseases, and medicines for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. Dr. Rosenberg also was an influential voice in persuading the United Nations (UN) to recognize road safety as a public health issue, at the time only the second such declaration that the UN had made. AND Before joining The Task Force, Dr. Rosenberg served for 20 years with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including conducting early work in smallpox eradication, enteric diseases, and HIV/AIDS. He was instrumental in establishing CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control and became the first permanent director in 1994, serving as director and Assistant Surgeon General.   NOW I Find that Might Interesting.

               had a post about how in Africa they are causing the children to get cholera which facilitates organ harvesting.  The influenza vaccine I believe has also been killing children here this year, many more than usual.  He also has a connection to the CDC with HIV/AIDS.  This guy is Toxic.

             Mark Burnett is Mr. Reality TV. I was checking into his wife Roma Downey and she has a book coming out next month called “Box of Butterflies”. Seems like an interesting title choice for someone working in television production.

               It's certainly something to keep in mind. There was a very bizarre Homer Simpson episode with Domino Pizza boxes:

                Whoa.  Had never seen that.  Never watched it.  I have seen a few other videos of theirs and I think there were messages just as in the movies.  This just screams out at me.  Maybe not to others, but to me.  The boxes have Real Dominoes on them.  This is not implying a persons's name, but a Domino.  Dominoes on Pizza  (Box).  Then pieces of Pizza fall out of the Box that has Dominoes on it.  Could not be any more clear.  But like I said, to me.  Just Wow.

                  The only think that I just noticed now was the theme at the start.  2001 Theme.  That movie meant something and I can't remember what it was.  There was something behind it.  Darn!

                    Well, I found this
                    <a href="http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/an-insightful-i-think-analysis-of-2001-a-space-odyssey-that-i-feel-like-sharing-long-read.250078093/">

                    </a>
                    And I thought I would be bored reading it. Was I wrong.  I had to read carefully since very complex, but what an Awakening.  In a nutshell and I am extremely simplifying it, Kubrick was warning us against using technology for bad, probably also pointing at the MIC and our love of tv, phones, and movies etc. allowing ourselves to become controlled by them, and also it touched on religion, to abandon God, but the analysis explained that Kubrick was not against God per say, but religion.  I understand that to mean organized religion, as in warning us against the church (Vatican). It also talks about how he brings in Nietzsche in telling us to become more enlightened.  In other words, again simplifying, WAKE UP and pay attention to the truth in front of us.  Also getting away from the technology controlling our lives.  Wow.  I highly recommend you read this, for I think Kubrick was sending us a highly valuable message in this movie.  Also, the Dominoes Pizza piece with the Song at the beginning was telling us the same.  Pay attention.  Also possibly about the Vatican.  The Pizzagate in the emails as well.  And so much more.

                      Everyday my eyes are opened even more than I thought they could be.  I did not go to college, so i thought I would have a hard time, but one thing I do have is that I am very analytical.  So it helped me.  Enjoy and let me know what you think.

                    Yes, and I can't remember the answer to the meaning.  Was hoping someone would  come to our rescue.  Maybe I can try to look up.

                    Yes, I remember allegory.  I watched the video again, but did not notice anything else interesting.  I think the story was about the dominoes and pizza slices.  A very huge clue.

             So sorry, forgot to mention that Barron Hilton received papal knighthood from pope john II  see my comment below.  also includes LA Councilman John Ferraro.  So we should probably check out the Conrad Hilton Foundation.

            I was not able to read all the replies, and forgive me if this is not helpful, but I do know that when Benestad head the Papal Foundation, the first place he hit for money, was "BOB HOPE"... After Benestad was no longer involved with the Papal Foundation, he had a one year's leave.. we all know what that means.
           </p>

            I have Benestad's time line if anyone is interested in it

             That could be helpful, if it's not too much trouble for you. I know you're not feeling great right now.  It looks like Benestad was the first director of the Papal Foundation. He seemed to be very talented at getting very wealthy Catholics to donate to the organization. Adding "perks" helped, as
             <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB920960464758379500">
              this WSJ article
             </a>
             explains:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              And those who give $1 million or more to the Papal Foundation Inc. get not only a medallion, a gold pin and a certificate, but also a ceremony in Rome recognizing their contribution and a visit with Pope John Paul II in his private library. Arthur Birtcher, owner of an Orange County, Calif., real-estate firm, promised $15 million to the foundation, and has met the pope twice. The foundation "appeals to those high-net-worth Catholics who want to reach out and meet the Holy Father," he says.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Papal Foundation's endowment has grown to $47 million, from nothing in 1988; its administrator, Msgr. Thomas J. Benestad, says it gets new donations of between $3 million and $4 million each year.

                New York State's highest court yesterday reversed the convictions of three former officers of the defunct American Bank and Trust Company who had been accused of misappropriating bank funds to aid an Argentine financier, David Graiver.   Would be interesting to know if jorge bergoglio had anything to do with this. Argentina.  He was accused of being responsible for the death of two priests and allowing many babies to be shipped out of Argentina.  I would not be surprised if Benestad had connections, being his son was a priest.

                The tribunal, the Court of Appeals, in a 6-to-1 ruling, found ''no basis for the charges'' that the former officers, Torleaf Benestad, Saul Kagan and Jean Wolf, ''willfully misapplied'' funds or personally profited from any fraud at the Manhattan bank. Mr. Kagan and Mr. Wolf were convicted in 1979 by a jury in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Mr. Benestad had pleaded guilty.  HA HA  even though he plead guilty they found no basis for the charges.

            One good, comprehensive investigative report , exposing ALL of the pedophiles, institutional corruption, embezzlement and mishandling, including all of the uncouth quotes and belligerent policies.... that would likely be the start of something serious and catastrophic. Maybe something like that already exists?

             Thank you!  If you could add more info regarding this would be much appreciated.  Will look into this.  Order of Malta is a big player I am  sure.  I think the pope made a huge change within Malta last year involving Carlson of St. Louis Arch. Will have to look it up.  If someone knows please post.

              That involved Cardinal Raymond Burke who was a chaplain for the Knights of Malta. He is a conservative cardinal who has publicly opposed Pope Francis' attempt to relax Catholic teaching on marriage and divorce. The Pope, in an unprecedented move, apparently intervened in internal matters of the Knights of Malta and ordered the head of the order to resign. More here:

             That IS Absurd!  I wonder what "compensations" there are for those financial donations.  Why would anyone commit to such a requirement.  There must be benefits.  Organs?  Just a thought.

              Giving me the chills, Carmencita. It's very far from the "widow's mite" Jesus talked about.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much. And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing. And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury: For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.

               The rich think they can buy whatever they want or need with their wealth.  This must stop.  If they want or need a new boat or car, that is one thing, but being able to buy life through this Org. would be a Sacred Violation Against Jesus.  The pope should be ex-communicated from the church and sen to prison til death if this is proven to be correct.

             Thanks for this! I wonder if this hospital performs abortions? That would be scandalous enough for most Catholics to process: the Pope helping keep a pro-abortion hospital afloat.

              No, they probably have the mothers birth in secrecy and just tell them that their baby's going to a very nice family and that they're doing the best thing for their baby... (wink, wink)

               That is what he allowed to happen in Argentina when he was Bishop.  Catholics need to do the research.  Taking his words as gospel is ludicrous.  He has been charged with crimes in Argentina, in the Dirty War.

              Now this would be an eye opener for Catholics for sure ! No doubt he's tied to abortion clinics somewhere ! That's how they get their power apparently (sacrificing babies) makes sense he'd be behind it . That's what keeps him powerful . Wow this is so real !

              Looks like efforts were made in 2015 to rescue this hospital:

              In short.
             </p>
             <p>
              The primary fighters against cancer are a type of T cell called a cytotoxic T cell or a CD8 cell. They recognize "altered self" (such as tumorous or viral infected) and induce a targeted implosion of sorts. Think "mercy kill" in terms of mechanism.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cancer can foil this mechanism via mutations (due to damaged DNA repair systems, cancer can mutate rapidly) that can fool this defense via PD1 interactions that resemble normal cells.
             </p>
             <p>
              Where organ transplants and stem cells come into play in all this is the risk of graft vs host reactions. By altering the CD8 T Cells ability to recognize self vs foreign, there is an increased risk for organ and stem cell rejection. Think auto immune disease like symptoms.
             </p>
             <p>
              Immunosuppressants increase cancer risk by affecting a CD8 T cell's ability to fight legit cancerous cells.

               How does this connect to this Hospital?  Do you think their involvement with Stem Cells could involve them with Organ Harvesting?  Or Abortions? I found one of the Drs. that came to the US to give a Symposium on Stem Cells l but I could not link since the site is not allowed here.

                When it comes to fetuses, the most likely motive for an abortion done by a corrupt hospital would be to harvest embryonic stem cells rather than organ harvesting.
               </p>
               <p>
                Murder of a paitient via killer medicine would be along the lines of organ harvesting, although you can harvest stem cells from the corpse if you know where to look. For example, a major storage site for stem cells destined to become any form of skin or blood cell is at the base of the spine. You use a blunt needle to extract them. There's an interesting medical proceedure in which one can have some of their own stem cells from this site extracted (they get replenished over time) freeze them, and have them on reserve should they be seriously injured at a later point.
               </p>
               <p>
                Embryonic stem cells are "totipotent", meaning capable of transforming into any type of cell. "Pluripotent" stem cells have gone few some early steps of differentiation that determine what kind of cell they can be become. Think branching paths.

                There's a work around trick to evade banned domains. Copy the link -&gt; replace the . (the one before com, edu, gov, net) with (dot).

               <p>
                The finished evasion should look like this: yoursitename(dot)com/restoflink

                 Its the same idea as banking your baby's cord blood for later use to treat a range of diseases they may get. The sad thing is the umbilical cord is so rich in stem cells, yet these freaks insist on saying we need to be using aborted tissue. It's bullshit and is only another excuse to keep abortions happening

                 Thanks for this! Adult stem cell therapy is a very promising field, from what I've heard. Prolamine therapy, I believe it's called.

                 The Catholic Church has strongly condemned embryonic stem cells in the past, but there is a change of tone with Pope Francis' papacy and an invitation to dialogue with those who disagree. While maintaining the position that destroying embryos for research is wrong, the head of the Pontifical Council for Culture Cardinal Ravasi assures scientific researchers

               With the development of Immunotherapy using Immune Check Point Inhibitors (anti- PD1/PDL1 or CTLA-4) to abrogate tumour-induced immunosuppression, many cancer patients are being exposed to or may be considered for treatment with these drugs, including patients with organ or Allogeneic Peripheral Stem Cell Transplantation. Due to the mode of action, inducing or augmenting a cancer-specific immune response, there is a risk of organ rejection in organ transplanted patients and a few cases have been reported in the literature.   STEM CELLS.

            OK, I looked into the hospital.  I do not speak Italian.  BUT.  I can figure things out enough to see that this  Diagnostica di Laboratorio e Biologia Molecolare Clinica   means  Diagnostic Laboratory and Biological Molecular Clinic.  This would be a good place to research if I could translate.  Does anyone know how to change to English.  Don't know if that is possible with this.  There are other departments that I know should be researched as well.

             It sounds creepy. I wonder if it's connected to organ trafficking, the migrants and the slave markets in Libya. Pope Francis, as we know, is the world's foremost advocate of migrants and open borders.

               I think it's very fair to question why the Pope is so personally invested in keeping this hospital afloat. A perfectly fair question. Also, given that an SRA victim has come forward and said that her perpetrator was the Director of the Papal Foundation raises many other questions as well. I appreciate your skepticism, but I have made no claims or allegations; I have just said that the issue warrants further investigation.

                Based on the few minutes I spent looking at it, it's considered to be one of Europe's better hospitals.   I would also think there would be a big disurption in terms of people losing their jobs.

                 It's a claim that demands immediate and serious investigation and requires us to be aware that the individual in question, Msgr Benestad, may not be the fluffy financial administrator he seems to be.

                  You've gone far, far beyond "he individual in question, Msgr Benestad," have you not?  He's not even mentioned until far down in your post.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  First you say that there's a scandal with the Papal Foundation and it has rocked the Catholic Church.   Then you imply there's more to it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Reading the article this is a controversy that is limited to this foundation, some of the stewards were against this and one person resigned.  That is hardly a scandal that is rocking the Catholic Church.  The embezzlement and massive debt at the IDI hospital are indeed a scandal and people have been arrested.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Is the  pope coming in after the Hospital Scandal and trying to keep the hospital open is a scandal?  I'm not convinced.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It certainly is controversial within this foundation and some of the donor's to the foundation don't like it, but it's really limited to this foundation.  The reforms the foundation is proposing in the leaked documents due this controversy seems reasonable to me.  Even the leaked letter from the Chairman of the Audit Committee is measured.  Here's how he signs off on his letter.
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>

                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  He is not even arguing theft or embezzlement.  He sees red flags and is worried about throwing good money after bad.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So what does this have to do with pizzagate?  Nothing.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What does this have to do with Msgr Benestad?  Nothing.  He left this foundation in 2002 according a posting on the SNAP forums.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So is it just the allegations from Q?
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   There are hints from Q that the Pope is involved in sick and evil enterprises.
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  So the concern about the grant is really not relevant at all is it?
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkyUxfSOKbI">
                   It's just a McGuffin
                  </a>
                  isn't it?   It wouldn't matter to you if all the stewards signed off on a grant.  It's just the excuse to try and claim the pope is up to something sick and evil.

              Our minds are both going down the same path.  I too thought of the Libya Slaves and how I saw a picture of him at the fence where they are kept after their arrival.  I have had horrid pictures after going to bed at night about how he may be going to choose the best ones.  The nights I can't sleep.  There is no good coming to those people.  They are either used for organs, or sex slaves.  Yes, it creeps me out too, and makes me

               Funny, I said that before I read that you said it ... I was simply replying to a ping, and hadn't had time to read your post. But yeah, Q has connected NKorea and Soros and the Pope. Thanks for the post. Good one.

                Good God I hope so.  HE needs to be exposed.  He has already been named as being involved in the death of 2 Priests in Argentina the "Dirty War".  There are many other crimes like the thousands of babies being sent out of the country while he looked the other way.  May God help us expose this Criminal.

            Researching must begin.  What is going on in that hospital that it needs to be propped up by the pope?  A Children's Hospital?  That should send up Red Flags to all researchers here.  This is the post I informed you of
