<p>An article in a British construction magazine confirms that the Freud family, who were behind psychoanalysis and the Tavistock Clinic, and who became involved in the Madeline McCann investigation through outed pedophile <strong>Clement Freud, are closely involved in the pizza and ping pong restaurant business. Matthew Freud, his nephew, appears to have been part of a multi-million pound investment in these restaurants</strong>, which was attended by Hollywood celebrities, London socialites and members of the pizza and ping pong club circuit.  
</p>

<p>Proof:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the creation of Bounce Shoreditch spanning over two and a half years, <strong>the £3.5million project encompassed an investor line-up including PR man Matthew Freud, Zoopla’s Alex Chesterman and Zetter Group’s Mark Sainsbury</strong>. Bounce is also due to open its first international venue in Chicago in early 2016, with further planned openings in the US and Asia. </p>

<p>This eventually included the opening of AceBounce in Chicago as well, a couple blocks from the Obama-connected Loop Capital, who are connected to the ping pong nightclub circuit through Killerspin founder and close Obama confidante Robert Blackwell.

<p>Matthew Freud is the nephew of outed pedophile and former BBC personality, Clement Freud, who infamously invited the McCann Family to his villa in Southern Portugal following Madeline\'s disappearance in 2007. Matthew Freud headed the Freuds PR agency during the McCann disappearance and helped manage the media spin. <strong>Sara Latham, a close associate of the Clinton\'s and the Podesta\'s, was also a member of Freuds. Both Matthew Freud and Tony Podesta appear to have owned the same painting. While details are unclear, Shepard Fairey\'s Progress, a portrait celebrating Obama\'s inauguration, was part of the Heather and Tony Podesta collection, but then it shows up in a display case in the Freuds London office.</strong></p>
<p>Not only does Bounce Ping Pong bear much similarity to Comet Ping Pong, but the establishment also contains a number elements identical to Comet.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Shoreditch location contains a pizza oven which is nearly identical to the one at Comet in DC, and both Bounce and Comet sell nearly-identical personal pizzas as one of their main dishes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comet Pizza was opened in 2007, but changed their name to Comet Ping Pong in 2008, which coincides with this investment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matthew Freud attended and promoted events at Bounce, and the Podestas did with the Pizza Pac and home viewings hosted by Comet 
owner James Alefantis. Tony Podesta was close to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama; David Cameron has flown on Matthew Freud\'s private jet.</p>

            This Freud incest child molesting can be traced straight back to Sigmund Freud, and even further back to the founding of Frankist Jewish mysticism/Satanism, by Yacob Frank in the 1700s.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was the celebration of everything anti-social and counter-productive and counter-traditional, and it involved incest, child molesting, and orgies. Yacob Frank used his own daughter as the center of these ritual orgies. Supreme Court Chief Justice Louis Brandeis kept a picture of Yacob Frank's daughter on his Supreme Court desk. He came from a family of Frankists who arrived in the US with an agent of the Rothschilds, another Frankist family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recall that Sigmund Freud had a very very weird relationship with his daughter, and gave her many "therapy" sessions to talk about her masturbation. And it was Freud who promoted the idea that everybody wants to fuck their mother. That's a Frankist subversive tactic. Freud was a member of the Vienna Austria B'Nai B'Rith, the Jewish masonic organization that was/is rooted in Frankism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember the movie Eyes Wide Shut? This is based on a novella written by another Vienna, Austria Frankist Jew, and it's about initiation into Frankism.

            Check this out and read the article:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Frankist Paradigm: The “Frankist Paradigm” is the set of neo-Frankist beliefs that have now metastasized across Western culture. These ideas find resonance in a multi-cultural society, where animosities brew under the surface and politics becomes a proxy for ethnic warfare. Without traditionalism, society becomes insipid and narcissistic, finding itself attracted to radical politics as a catharsis and a sadistic release. Without unity, society divides into warring factions. The Frankist Paradigm weaponizes these conflicts, producing a society of malcontents more interested in destruction and animosity than collective progress.

            They are all linked to Sabbatean-Frankism, a distinct quasi-Satanic schism within Jewry. The extraordinary prevalence of Sabbatean-Frankist influence among top Jewish intellectuals from 1850-1950 makes it statistically impossible to deny its role because of the impossible coincidences."

            The article is above. Below is the Wikipedia quotes about Eyes Wide Shut and the story/author who wrote it:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Eyes Wide Shut is a 1999 erotic drama film directed, produced, and co-written by Stanley Kubrick. Based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella Traumnovelle (Dream Story), the story is transferred from early 20th-century Vienna to 1990s New York City
The book belongs to the period of Viennese decadence after the turn of the 19th century.
Young Vienna (Jung-Wien) was a society of fin de siècle writers who met in Vienna's Café Griensteidl and other nearby coffeehouses in the late nineteenth century. [1]
The group turned away from the prevailing Naturalism of the time and experimented with various facets of Modernism, including Symbolism and Impressionism. In his review of turn of the century Vienna, historian Carl Schorske wrote of the movement that they "challenged the moralistic stance of nineteenth century literature in favor of sociological truth and psychological - especially sexual - openness."[1]
Hermann Bahr was considered the group's spokesman. Other members included Arthur Schnitzler, Felix Dörmann [de], Peter Altenberg, Richard Beer-Hofmann, Felix Salten, Raoul Auernheimer, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Karl Kraus.
Schnitzler's works were called "Jewish filth" by Adolf Hitler and were banned by the Nazis in Austria and Germany. In 1933, when Joseph Goebbels organized book burnings in Berlin and other cities, Schnitzler's works were thrown into flames along with those of other Jews, including Einstein, Marx, Kafka, Freud and Stefan Zweig."

             Very interesting post, a lot of Freud's radical views can be explained by this fucked up theology, it's also why these types are seen working with Fabian Socialists and Anglo-American eugenicists in the early 20th century. It's not just a possible criminal front but a way of running society based on collective trauma and fear.

             The McCann investigation is part of a larger historical pattern dating back to the Ripper murders of "unsolved mysteries" provoking fear in society, all the way to the Yorkshire Ripper (possibly Jimmy Savile) to MH370 to Manson to Son of Sam. The City of London uses a fake occult group as proxy and they conspire to commit murders and use witnesses and informants to shape the story.
            </p>
            <p>
             We fixate on the culprit but it's actually us who are the victims. We become more hesitant and fearful. Maybe xenophobic if that's the goal. Once in that state, we are more susceptible to media manipulation because our defences are down. This is what Bernays knew. This is what Freud knew. And this is why Bernays' grandson co-founded Netflix.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's hard to understand why Freudian theory has such wide ranging implications but when you see the general populace as the victim, you can begin to understand how they can operate an elaborate blackmail and even human harvesting operation. The same fear is applied to make us doubt secondary narratives and possible "alternate" views.
            </p>
            <p>
             Which leads to the final stage, the so-called Canaanite abandonment of "care" that is the root of their belief system. The ancient tradition is apocryphal but it basically dictated that you could defeat the burden of care by immolating a small child. Within their framework, it suggests you can defeat the model of fear used to control Western Society from a single root. Those special ovens at Bounce and Comet are one of the only ovens that can do this inside and could host this ritual.

No. Elvina Pallavicini was a "queen" of the Black Nobility. There are various "queens" and "kings" as in rulers over regions and spectrums

            of society in the Black Nobility. The Massimos are the primary owners of the SMOM. The Chigis are high level managers of the SMOM.

             Interesting, think I've found a connection between the Knights of Malta and the Hampstead case.  Needs further research.

             Matthew Freud seems to be connected to everybody.  I'm beginning to think he works with MI6.

            Wow, you guys are sad. First of all, Pizzagate was debunked over a year ago. Mr. Alefantis even appeared on numerous media outlets and even Faux News and even your beloved Faux News debunked it. Repeat after me, there is no basement at CPP, there isn't or has never been, children being abused in any way on any of Mr. Alefantis' properties or by him, and fake news hurts real people. You people need to get a life.

             This is the bottom line: if you're a 'fan' you condone toddlers being exploited and laughed (at the very least) for the sick humour of Alefantis and crew. Toddlers taped to tables is NOT funny; calling toddlers 'hotards' is sick; exposing children in a supposed 'family friendly' eatery to satanic and violent images is child abuse.

             If you even took the time to read the research we did today, youd know that the Murdoch's know Freud and are mixed up in british high society. Literally how many standard talking points do you have to throw out before you even realize that we didn't mention any basement nor parrot Fox news as a reliable source? Do I have to mention that Dennis Hastert and Tony Podesta ran 'Pesto Pac' parties about a decade before the identical "Pizza Pac'" events? Or that bands at Comet like The Apes cheekily insert photos of tortured children into their videos? The fact is that it's far bigger than one restaurant, this is a global problem and those with any ability to stop this seem to be doing squat.

            Don’t forget daughter, Bella Freud, fashion designer and into the photography and art world. There are photos of her in her office studio and you can clearly see a photo of a naked child on the wall beside her. She’s uber creepy and even looks like a witch with all her facial moles and see through you eyes. She hobnobs with the usual London Luciferian crowd.

            The Daily Beast article linked above talks about two women who came forward with allegations against Clement Freud, but according to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clement_Freud#Child_sexual_abuse_allegations">
             Wikipedia
            </a>
            , there were three women accusing him of rape.

             Also:
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Scotland Yard was examining the details of the allegations and detectives were said
             <strong>
              to be looking into the possibility that Freud had associated with other alleged abusers at the time of the claims.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Allegations have also been made of predatory behaviour towards female students during his time as Rector of the University of Dundee in 1970s. Craig Murray, a former British ambassador, who was a student at Dundee University in the late 1970s, described an incident when Freud asked the president of the students' union to pimp for him and select a woman to entertain him.

            Yeah, good stuff SwordFish69 good to see you again my friend. Let's harp on this and harp on it some more, Alefantis and his buddies, especially Oliver Miller and their Doktor Pong experiment in Germany proved that "ping pong is an easy way to strike up a conversation with penniless and hungry young kids eager to please an older male who takes them under his wing" and that regardless of his STATE service as business partner to a cell of political saboteurs that use children as collateral he is still using his pizza business as a GROOMING and CULLING facility of underage boys for his and his friends personal gratification. It would only make sense that this predilection would turn commercial and their perversion would be given a new life. If one looked at it right it looks like an ethereal extension of something born of some real sin like much modern industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once again, on the Freud point,  the relevance that writers like myself, Swordfish and others here continually try to show is that at every turn we keep running into these PEDIGREED and WEALTHY family lines like the Maccoby's (who are INTIMATELY EMBEDDED in the PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS of our INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS) to the Sussmans and Pingree's of Maine and the PRIVILEGED and ANCESTRAL families that settled America who were allegedly escaping religious persecution...
           </p>
           <p>
            ...are actually the REAL 'witches' and are part of a cult that does not believe in the God we all would like to believe in and worship the god's and goddesses of cultures that demanded human sacrifice for their very survival and appeasement of their god's conditions for prosperity.
           </p>
           <p>
            And they wish to make their world your existence as well. Freud and the think tanks that arose out of this period in european history like the Tavistock Institute and The Royal Society CORNERED THE MARKET on all other forms of thought and promulgated their own idea of  an utopia that involved lucifer and the INVERSION.

              <p>
               After a stint working for RCA as a publicist for David Bowie and the Eurythmics, he was introduced to Uri Geller by his father, Clement Freud. Geller says he was looking for someone to help in negotiating a deal with a gold-mining company. 'I thought that I would give Matthew a break.'
              </p>
              <p>
               Apparently the deal went well, and Freud showed himself to be, in Geller's words, 'very cool and precise'. The man who had become famous by stopping watches gave the enterprising young man the benefit of his experience. 'I told him,' says Geller, 'that successful men wear a Rolex.'

                That place is creepy and gives me the Heebie Jeebies.  And yes, the  membership list is amazing.  Also have Parlor Kid's Shows and this guy  ALFONSO  Alfonso became a member of the Magic Castle in 1983 and has performed in every one of our showrooms and bars, totaling close to 2500 performances. With years of teaching experience, we eagerly invited him to be an instructor within Magic University. He has spent nearly 20 years teaching magic at after school enrichment programs and summer camps. He’s been invited to lecture and share his magic creations and performing ideas with magicians as far as Spain, Japan, Finland, and London, as well as many lectures here in the USA. He is also sought out by other professional magicians to help fine-tune their routines. Alfonso’s loves for magic and his easy going style can help get you on the fast track to performing magic!

                 NPH appears to be involved with other ping pong clubs through b-list actress Susan Sarandon. She has done work with them but has not appeared with the Comet crew.

Freud and the think tanks that arose out of this period in european history like the Tavistock Institute and The Royal Society CORNERED THE MARKET on all other forms of thought and promulgated their own idea of an utopia that involved lucifer and the INVERSION.

             Spot on. Books like

              The Assault On Truth
             </a>
             also exposed Sigmund Freud for committing academic fraud by covering up the cause of certain forms of Hysteria related to child abuse. Just read the Wikipedia page to see just how pissed off this book made the Tavistock establishment. This was from a reputed psychoanalyst who had studied Freud his entire life. His abstract psychoanalysis was the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card for these pedosatanists.

              I was quite shocked to learn recently that there is a revered 'Queer Studies' female academic who has said child porn should be made legal, and talked about 'child porn panic'. IIRC, she still teaches at a university today.

               I think you are referring to Judith Butler, who came up with 'Queer Theory'. Her book is a long, boring, tortuous and turgid read.

                No, actually I thought of the other queer academic you mentioned in your post at the time. Don't have the time now, but will look into your submission history tomorrow. I always meant to write a post about that woman.

                Re: Butler. Since she is behind the 'sex is construction too' shit, I wondered whether she might be CIA. Just a thought, pure speculation, but when you think about it, how much it came to serve the elite / Luciferian agenda, it would make sense.....
