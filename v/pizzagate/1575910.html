            Here's an interesting point of view in "Noreen Gosch: The Deceiver, The Liar, and the GateKeeper":
           </p>
           <p>
            "I couldn’t put my finger on it, but I felt that the story being presented was beyond bizarre and that this was being done, for some reason, on purpose- so much so that it generally always reached a point to where most people who look into it soon reach a point where they just can’t digest any more of it and kind zone out."
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            "It is my personal opinion that is Noreen, DeCamp, Gunderson and the rest of their camp they are all gatekeepers to the child kidnapping rings connected to Franklin and that they are there to make these stories so incredibly unbelievable and convoluted that anyone trying to understand or research Franklin or Johhny Gosch just gets so lost in all of it that they just dismiss it all- preventing us from hearing the real story of Franklin or what really happened to Johnny Gosch."
           </p>
           <p>
            There is also a seven degrees of separation sort of thing with all of this as Gunderson’s ex-wife left him for Michael Aquino and wouldn’t you know that Gunderson’s findings have Johnny being bought in Sioux City Iowa by none other than, you guessed it: Michael Aquino."
           </p>
           <p>
            The article at the link gives evidence and names and links some YouTube videos. He says Noreen Gosch exhibits duping delight in interviews and she testified in court that her husband sold their son.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know much about the owner of this website David Schurter. I knew there was some skepticism of NG even among those who believe there are organized, connected pedophile rings and stumbled upon this in a web search.

             I knew Gunderson is controversial, but didn't recall the Gunderson ex-wife Aquino connection. I haven't been able to find any confirmation of this. I think the author may be confused in that it's said Gunderson was married to Anthony LaVey's ex-wife, Diana Rively (LaVey being founder of the "Church of Satan"). This is controversial also, see:

            I'd agree with 'mostly true'. Bonacci is a strange person but I found this compelling: He claimed he was sold to a buyer with a ranch in Colorado that had a hidden spot underneath the house where the kids were sometimes stored. With a film crew he pointed out the ranch and showed the hidden area. "Who Took Johnny"

            This is real unfortunately. Buried by the press Jonny Gosh was addicted missing without a trace. Trafficked to Washington DC elites. Franklin scandal was revealed to some degree leading to connection ok White Hoose with George Ih. W. H. Bush. A fall guy was created Richard King I believe.He went to prison for finariiol crimes as a cover up. No charges about abuse victims are whereabouts known?The goverment shut Down then investigation denied child D.C. Trafficking. Tried scrubbing the story and threatening Johnny. Gosch family. See Noreen Gosch Testamentimoney. Damning pictures were released to the children's family in some threatening way. They are found online but the pictures were given to instill fear as they showed Johhny and others boys tied upon up legs bound, arms bound, restraints on legs and even gagged. Not just Johnny Goesh was pictured with several other young boys prebubescent in at appearance alll had their shirts off-bare-chested prepubescent boys hog tied by captors laying in a bed. What investigation? Nothing.sick would
