            Appreciate the skepticism but after reviewing her accounts I maintain that she is very authentic. These kids do have lives, just not normal ones. Good for her for keeping her dreams through the abuse. Btw, did you not see the picture of the ugly old woman flashing a satanic hand symbol...? I think she's very credible and sincere, and her faith is guiding her to speak out. Don't be THAT PERSON who brings her credibility down with unfounded suspicions. Too many have had to deal with that already. If, by some strange chance, she turns out to be inauthentic, it will be the job of professionals to determine it, not voat hacks.

            No. Don't lie and keep doing your research, but we need to keep some relative deference for potential victims. It is the humane thing to do and also important to not discourage other voices.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, your skepticism and investigative mind are very important here as well, so don't take my comments too seriously,

            I cried through her whole testimony and feel a bit of a soft spot for her ordeal.
           </p>
           <p>
            If she is lying, that would be pretty horrific as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please carry on. We need all perspectives here.

            Girls her age? She's 16 on that Twitter account and 20 when she made the Youtube videos. People do a lot of growing up during that time and as others have said she mentions child abuse a lot before PizzaGate was even around.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is wrong with the tweets and the timeline of her testimony? Can you give any examples that we can investigate?

             I'm an abuse survivor who has spent his whole life wading through a world of people who rarely believe because what I went through is so far outside of their experiences.

             Whether or not her story is true, something is wrong and that should be taken seriously.
            </li>
            <li>
             Whether or not her story is true, I suspect many piece of the pizzagate story to most likely be true, so let's keep moving forward.
            </li>
            <li>
             I hope she finds a stable love she can move forward with. That's what any person needs.

            I think it's good to question such things(although I believe her) because that is what the opposition will do. Being prepared for what they might ask or do will in the long run benefit us.

            Israel has/is genociding the Palestinian people and they are also running the United States government and that these 2 characters both throw their unequivocal support behind them is worrying to say the least.

            I don't see that side-by-side they are the same person.
There are articles online that describe her abuse that are from a bit of time back.
She kept having to re-record her story and was frustrated that her phone kept filling up and had to keep re-doing it.
And WHY WOULDN'T she want to be famous?
           </p>
           <p>
            She wants to be famous to be able to have a platform to be able to spread the word about Child Abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why bother doing what she is doing and taking the shit she is taking, if it isn't for some noble and widespread purpose?
           </p>
           <p>
            She should want to be the most famous person on Earth and make a real difference in the lives of other potential victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            I see nothing compelling in your takedown whatsoever.

            No offense, but did you actually watch all of her videos? 
In one of them, she describes the fact that she had tried to record her videos multiple times and then her phone would run out of space, so she had to keep retrying them.
If you had to report what SHE is reporting, and had been frustrated by her piece of shit phone that just stops recording video with little/no warning (I'm looking at you Iphone), your timeline might be off too.
For God's sake, who on Earth could even live her life, let alone tell the World about it?
           </p>

            Substantiate everything wrong with her timeline please.

            I have viewed two of her videos and she seemed credible. You never know obviously but a young girl wanting to be famous is pretty much in line with every girl her age.

            No, it's not the opposite and, of course, it's detrimental. Being famous is the last thing they need because that isn't real love. It's why so many turn to drugs, etc.

            Abuse victims are more likely to want to become famous. There's an insatiable need to be loved so this fits the pattern. Just look at the number of messed up stars whose back stories involve abuse.

            I'd really have to know more than this to dismiss her. At this point, I don't know so I'll let her speak until I know differently.

            Both those Twitter accounts mention child abuse and standing up against child abuse going back years. I really don't think the fact she tweeted that she wants to be famous a few years ago as a young teen casts doubt on her story. Just because someone has been abused doesn't mean they never smile or never pose like a happy family in photos, or that they never tweet silly frivolous things.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think those accounts actually make her story seem MORE truthful, because child abuse has clearly been an issue for her for many years, well before Pizzagate. We also want more victims to come forward, and treating people that come forward with suspicion and as though they are liars will discourage other victims. Especially when there is not really any reason to disbelieve her - saying she wanted to be famous one time on Twitter doesn't indicate she's lying nearly as much as her repeated mentions of child abuse from years back indicate that she's telling the truth, IMO.

             She wants to be famous to spread the word about abuse and make something of her suffering.
The young lady is an Angel in my view.

             The abusive comments she has gotten on Twitter and Youtube are simply outrageous.

             Prove she is fake or shut the fuck up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even the insinuation that she is fake, given the claims she makes, without proof is an epic violation of decency.

              Exactly! We should never accuse anyone. I would much rather feel a fool for having believed someone who was lying for attention, than be a heartless nasty person who accused someone who was genuinely bravely speaking out about their horrible ordeal a liar.

             Yes to this comment.   I wanted to be famous too, and maybe it's that connection to  a fantasy life that kept her holding on,  because  I wouldn't be able to endure 14 months in a detention at her age; and I doubt many would.   But,  it was better than her options.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also,  a lot of abused kids  (not even as severely as she was abused)   go off into fairytale places to cope,  and wish for a fairytale family, or  pretend their family was actually good even though they weren't  (the last position is known as Stockholm Syndrome.)
            </p>
            <p>
             I  will believe her until she gives me reason not to.
Then I'll suggest  polygraph tests, doctors examinations  etc etc etc.

            I was interested to see this post.  Intuition doesn't count even as circumstantial evidence so I've kept my thoughts to myself until now but I've had huge reservations about this young woman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Days ago, very early watching one of her first videos, I thought something was off, way off - the verbal, the non-verbal, the story itself.  If she is legit, then I'm wrong, I deeply apologize, and I'm glad I was a coward and kept it to myself.  If I'm right, thank-you OP for not being a coward and allowing me the opportunity to share my thoughts.  My guess is that she is seeking attention. What better way to do it than this. The story garners max attention, max compassion, is pretty easy to pull off, and it will keep giving since PG will be staying in the news for a very long time. Moreover, who's ever going to really challenge her and call her bluff when there will likely never be 100% proof that she's a fraud.

            Her Facebook and Twitter went silent in April 18 2015(?) and she said she was in jail for 18 months in America? or something?...So from April 2015 to now its been about 20 months which checks out I guess?...but she sure seems like a happy child in all the pictures and lots of "family" photos(?)....something is definitely odd about this...
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish she would have given the last names of the people she named instead of just "lee", "charlie" and at least have given the location of the "forest"...

             Lee has the same surname just like Ann. Through Lee's profile you can find a Charlie who has liked one of his photos. This could be the Charlie that Becki refers to.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of those photos on her FB are after she went into care in 2010. After moving into permanent care towards the second half of 2010. Look at Becki's Facebook explode into life in 2011. We suddenly see much more of a personality coming through now that she is no longer living with her parents. She talks about the stress of school and exams. She talks about going out with her friends and how she is so happy and can't stop laughing. In 2012 Becki posts a picture of herself all dressed up ready for the school prom.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the subject of photos and them being happy and smiley. Becki doesn't start uploading photos until August 2012. By this point she has been living in care for 2 years. Becki admits she was still making the mistake of seeing her Mum and says she was still being abused. Its still understandable how much happier in general Becki would be considering what happened to her.
