             But the magazine does pride itself on covering music related subject matter.  What better opportunity for that rag to address those (music related) band flyers, than right now, while they are doing a [propaganda] story to try to debunk pizzagate, and comet ping pong?
            </p>
            <p>
             Throw those flyers in their faces publicly, and expose their highly biased story, while at the same time using the Podesta story to reveal more of what this Ping Pong joint is really like to the public.

            The article mentions hacked emails that started the conspiracy theory... but not a word as to what was actually in the emails.

             There's nothing in the emails that implicated Podesta. Everything that PG claims about the emails was made up or read in an austitic manner to change it's meaning.  There no code in the podesta emails.  But the entire pizzagate narrative rests on claims a code was discovered.  It wasn't. It was completely made up and didn't even make sense when substituted back into the emails.

               I know a reasonable amount about autism.  I worked for many years very closely with a   math expert who had Asperger's.  It's very well known that autistic people tend to take things literally and he certainly had that issue.

                Colloquial language does not entirely match up with formal language.......It must be said at the outset that not all people with Autism Spectrum Disorder will have a problem with colloquial phrases, but some will, and will find it difficult or impossible to overcome these problems except by rigorous rote learning, and this might be difficult or impossible for many.... A lot of colloquial language involves the use of sarcasm. For example, the phrase ‘well that’s just great’ taken literally means high praise. But when was the last time you heard that phrase used in anything but a sarcastic tone? Again, people with ASD are poor are understanding sarcasm in particular and tone of voice in general.

               I was particular thinking of the email where Tony Podesta is asked if can meet for dinner and he replies with something like "No. Still in the torture chamber."  It's an obvious metaphor about being stuck at work doing something he doesn't want to do, but people are claiming it could only mean one thing, that he was literally in a chamber torturing people.  There's a example after example of this in the Pizzagate record.

               Hate-speech? Are you trolling me or are you autistic?
              </p>
              <p>
               And of course, this is not hate speech. I don't hate autistic people  Saying autistic people often miss the meaning of language is not more hateful than not hiring a color-blind person as your graphic designer.

                "Problematic history of Hans Asperger
               </p>
               <p>
                Asperger syndrome shares its name with Hans Asperger, a prominent figure in the early research into autism who worked as a paediatrician in Austria in the 20th century, including during the time of the Nazis. An eight-year study into his relationship with the Nazi regime was published in 2018, concluding that he assisted in their euthanasia programme.
               </p>
               <p>
                This provoked a big debate among autistic people and their family members, particularly those who identify with the term ‘Asperger’. We are listening closely to the response to this news so we can continue to make sure the language we use to describe autism reflects the preferences of autistic people and their families. "

                 Because I worked closely with a guy for 8 years.  I helped him find a Ms. PacMan arcade console when he didn't like the emulator I installed on his PC even when it had an old school joystick.  Because I used to give him a hand signal when we in a group and I was joking about something, so he would understand I was joking.

                 No it doesn't.  This is false.  It makes perfectly plain sense as it is.  Or as the article I quoted points out
                 <em>
                  People with Autism Spectrum Disorder Take Things Literally
                 </em>
                 and they have trouble understand colloquialisms and figurative language.  And this trouble leads them to miss meanings by taking things too literally.

                <p>
                 The guy I quoted is the author of the book,
                 <em>
                  An Asperger Dictionary of Everyday Expressions,
                 </em>
                 a book that would not need to exist if what I said didn't make sense.

                 Wow.  First you claim I hate the autistic and then you call me a NAZI and claim I'm making fun of children? You're feeling your oats, aren't you?  So the guy concerned with nuance and the validity of evidence and standing against the mob mentality of witch hunt is a NAZI?  Yeah, that sounds exactly like the Nazis.  Kristallnacht was all about propert textual analysis and nuance wasn't it?

                 And you're Vaxxer.  Of course.  You're so concerning about children you want them to get diseases like measles that could send them to the hospital or even kill them.  Okeydoke.

                </p>
                <p>
                 "Asperger managed to accommodate himself to the Nazi regime and was rewarded for his affirmations of loyalty with career opportunities. He joined several organizations affiliated with the NSDAP (although not the Nazi party itself), publicly legitimized race hygiene policies including forced sterilizations and, on several occasions, actively cooperated with the child ‘euthanasia’ program. The language he employed to diagnose his patients was often remarkably harsh (even in comparison with assessments written by the staff at Vienna’s notorious Spiegelgrund ‘euthanasia’ institution), belying the notion that he tried to protect the children under his care by embellishing their diagnoses.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Conclusion
                </p>
                <p>
                 The narrative of Asperger as a principled opponent of National Socialism and a courageous defender of his patients against Nazi ‘euthanasia’ and other race hygiene measures does not hold up in the face of the historical evidence. What emerges is a much more problematic role played by this pioneer of autism research. Future use of the eponym should reflect the troubling context of its origins in Nazi-era Vienna."

              Ahhhh... of course. Yeah... All the cryptic coded language is not suspicious at all. Referring to preferring dominoes on pasta instead of pasta makes perfect sense and is just by extraordinary coincidence identical to common pedophile code. And his brother just happens to collect artwork of children tied up in sexual poses. And the emails just happen to involve a woman who just happened to be heavily involved in the occult and makes references to killing and eating people. Thanks for clarifying. /s

               THIS BAND IS A ROLLING STONE BEST 30....what a coincidence!
"“...Seventies prog-rock exaggeration served with glitter-rock bang. If Procol Harum and Spooky Tooth had chosen to make records like the Sweet, they might have sounded like Uni. But they wouldn't have looked this good.” - Rolling Stone best 30 bands at SXSW"

            Usually art for a music venue is designed directly by the venue owner, an artist or promoter of the owners choosing. Alefantis put his very own personal beliefs into those promotion posters. Comet ping pong, Molesta's and the all associated are bound for hell. I just hope it's broadcast on national television when their lives are taken from them.

             The promoter for a lot of the CPP music is a tranny called Sasha Lord who appears to be another of these sick fucks.....a search through the archives here should give plenty of information... I vaguely remember she might also be a teacher!

             I wonder if all of those bands approve of those flyers?  It might be interesting to ask some of them what they think about that flyer art being tied to their band names.

            Also note how many, and what types of these band flyers have the words "for all ages" posted on them as well.
