            Fluoride and Earlier Puberty in Girls
           </p>
           <p>
            In the United States, children are reaching the age of puberty at earlier ages than in the past — a trend that carries health consequences, including a heightened risk for breast cancer. Some evidence indicates that fluoride, via its effect on the pineal, could be a contributing cause to this trend. In animal studies, for example, fluoride exposure has been found to cause a decrease in the amount of circulating melatonin and lead to an accelerated sexual maturation in females. (Luke 1997). Similar findings have been reported in two epidemiological studies of human populations drinking fluoridated water. In the first published fluoridation safety experiment in Newburgh, New York, the authors found that girls living in a fluoridated community reached puberty five months earlier than girls living in a non-fluoridated community. (Schlesinger 1956)  Later, in 1983, Farkas reported that postmenarcheal girls were “present at younger ages in the higher fluoride town than in the low-fluoride town, although the reported median ages were the same.

            The CDC’s Stance on Water Fluoridation—Another Misleading Recommendation
           </p>
           <pre><code>Take water fluoridation for example.

Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show that since the 1970’s, the dental health professionals in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have had sole control over the agency’s stance supporting water fluoridation.

The CDC is part of a larger administrative structure that provides intra-agency support and resource sharing for health issues that require the input from more than one area of expertise. Other offices that share information and expertise with the CDC include the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office of Minority Health and Health Equity, and the Agency for Toxic Substances. The general assumption has been that the agency used a broad range of expert input to evaluate fluoride before reaching the decision to support water fluoridation.

After all, since fluoride is swallowed, it stands to reason it may have an impact on your whole body, not just your teeth.

Yet the documents show that no CDC toxicologists, minority health professionals, experts in diabetes, or others outside the Oral Health Division had any input into the agency’s position.

This flies in the face of what the agency claims, and what water-, health- and political leaders have believed about the way the CDC operates. Without these additional experts from other fields, can we reasonably believe that the agency has properly assessed the research on whole-body harm from fluoridation? The documents have drawn attention once again to the CDC’s and EPA’s fluoride safety statements, which appear completely at odds with current scientific knowledge, and the fact that no outside experts from related fields were ever included may very well explain this discrepancy.

            CDC were totally up to their necks in getting HIV into the experimental Hepititus B vaccine and then ignoring "The Gay Plague" that followed. They wrapped up drugs that might have worked in red tape for years until ACT-UP stormed their buildings and started getting in their faces.

            Dr Lindsey 12 awards in 12 years for work in performance projects and programs. Earned doctorate in immunology and molecular pathogenesis yr before working at CDC. Primary role in Bogus flu swine propaganda. The CDC should be really vetted hard by some independent investigators. As before her current role of Dep Director of Laboratory Science Policy and practice Program Office. She was Senior Scientist in Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response an office that oversees 1.5 billion dollars in Terrorism Preparedness. Wow these people really need to vetted better CDC seems to be under NWO control obviously. Vaccines I will never trust again in my life, FDIC chips were said to be in some of the Vaccines. Really anyone think if a vaccine is worth it.

            It looks like they were acquitted of the crime. It looks like the ex-wife executed the plan. This is the only article I found on the acquittal. I do agree that the H1N1 vaccination and most flu vaccines are not tested long enough to know side affects and I do approve of fluoridation of water.

            Btw, this also supports studies which suggest that women are not generally involved
in sexually abusing children .... except when they come under the influence of a 
heterosexual male.
           </p>
           <p>
            MALES are our sexual abusers of children and studies show that they are heterosexual males.
Homosexual males are 100X LESS likely to sexually abuse a child.

             Dr. Kimberly Quinlan Lindsey has been with the Centers for Disease Control for 12 years.

             Atlanta (CNN) — An official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been arrested and charged with two counts of child molestation and one count of bestiality, police said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police arrested Dr. Kimberly Quinlan Lindsey, 44, in DeKalb County, Georgia, on Sunday.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Authorities also charged Lindsey’s live-in boyfriend, Thomas Joseph Westerman, 42, with two counts of child molestation
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The two are accused of “immoral and indecent” sexual acts involving a 6-year-old, according to information from DeKalb County Magistrate Court and an arrest warrant.
            </p>
            <p>
             The bestiality charge says Lindsey “did unlawfully perform or submit to any sexual act with an animal.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The alleged incidents took place between January 1, 2010, and August 22, 2011**
            </p>
            <p>
             Westerman is out of jail on bail; Lindsey remains in jail with bail set at $20,000, said Lt. Pam Kunz of the DeKalb County Police Department.
            </p>
            <p>
             Neither has made a public statement. Westerman did not immediately return a call from CNN.

            Quarter -- Thank you ... this is hugely interesting to me as I'm very interested in the CDC's pushing 
of vaccines and the connection to Autism and the similarities between Autism and Schizophrenia.
It's very obvious it's a corrupt agency and in order to do that you need corrupt people inside and looks
like that's just what this woman represents.

              Hi Quarter --
Just happened to re-watch VAXXED today as I was planning to pass it on to my library ...
but it's so excellent and informative that I'm reluctant to do that right now.
Shamefully, my library doesn't have a copy of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't know why the "rooms" are so empty when it comes to vaccines -- FEAR?
But we certainly will be having to face these issues as the public will be paying for 
the damages done to children because Big Pharma has been protected from lawsuits
by Congress.
             </p>
             <p>
              Wakefiled in VAXXED also points out that the "Herd" effect that did protect us all
when ALL children had natural cases of these childhood diseases and recovered
in just a few days.... because, as he points out, what used to happen when people
had that natural immunity was that Mothers passed on immunity to their children
through the placenta and by breast feeding.  Now, children who have had "shots" 
which don't provide any real immunity have nothing to pass on to their offspring.
So we will have whole new generations of children totally unprotected and highly
vulnerable.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you mean Alefantis' Mom?  Noooooooooooo.... wouldn't like to meet any of them!
             </p>

             i'm no scientist nor have i researched this in depth, but my theory about autism
             <em>
              if it relates
             </em>
             to vaccines is: you have more evolved, highly conscious children being born (naturally, because consciouness evolves) and....forgive me for being woo-woo here, but highly conscious young people, fresh to the Earth, would be sensitive to electromagnetism, and would likely be in touch with higher intelligence, creativity, willpower, ~dimensions~ whatever...okay, now you pump them full of heavy metals in an environment that contributes to high inflammation (all the sugar in our diet, processed foods, fluoride water, stress) and drop them in an electromagnetic soup (wifi, cell phone towers, etc)
            </p>
            <p>
             well, what would happen?
            </p>
            <p>
             the kids would be unable to function. they're very sensitive. everything sets them off. feeling is too much, lights are too much, they have meltdowns, they can't focus on boring schoolwork.
            </p>
            <p>
             i have autistic family and once felt pretty autistic myself. i decided to experiment so i started eating more organic food, drinking clean water, using non-fluoride toothpaste, non-aluminum deodorant, low sugar and alcohol intake, no caffeine, etc... the things i felt like sensory overstimulation and executive functioning troubles all went away.
            </p>
            <p>
             something about being injected with heavy metals, having heavy metals sprayed in the sky, and then having electromagnetic waves polluting every place you go, doesn't seem like it could be good for organic bodies to me.

             me too because children are being forced to take vaccines. I feel so sorry for the parents. Autism has drasticaly risen beyond scary and the suffers are tracking it down to when the child had thier shots. Look at how much money$$$$$$ Lindsey had access to in her Public Health Job. Scary money. Someone knows you when your up that high. I doubt that money is spent on terrorism preparedness, what a lie,  especialy when they are guilty of putrid, unclean, mercury ladin vaccines. If your interested in starting a forum about this topic, it could get big. There are lots of mothers that would be interested and would probably post thier stories. Vaxxed stories on youtube will break anyones heart in two. Do you realize that Bill Gates has actually given talks on how the earth needs to be depopulated? He and his wife are big into supporting of vaccines. Let me ask you, How can a planet depopulate when vaccines make people live safer and longer? Its all cow patties and bull chips. Im super disgusted. She is definately fits in the pizzagate box too.

              Hi Quarter --
Probably going to be answering both of your posts to me together ...
"Lindsey" has had a very interesting career where I'm sure she has come in 
handy as someone called on to deny "science" of things they need to debunk.
             </p>
             <p>
              And the $$ is always a question since we have no real control over the spending 
by our Congress.  Actually, we have none!
             </p>
             <p>
              I am interested in a forum on this topic, but I wouldn't be someone to do it.
I have no real involvement with children with Autism.  Just a very high interest.
But I do imagine that many parents with children with Autism are posting on websites
dedicated to that subject -- right?
             </p>
             <p>
              Very much agree that we need to hear their stories.
             </p>
             <p>
              Gates -- UGH!  Very suspicious character, imo.
Another meteoric rise by someone who benefitted hugely from research
(on computers) which was paid for by citizens and then turned over to
private interests!
             </p>
             <p>
              I do know they are huge supporters of vaccines, as well.
Yes -- quite a contradiction in vaccines he supports versus his opinion on "depopulation."
             </p>
             <p>
              And, yes, also agree that the marriage looked set up -- and odd.

                My view on the population is that a small number seek control over others for 
their own profit -- and are willing to do violence to gain that control.
Doesn't matter the race or religion -- no matter what group you're in, the %'s seem the same.
               </p>
               <p>
                No people want wars -- only Elites profit from them.  It is our governments which are corrupt.
Our right win leaders with fascist tendencies.

                Amazed at what you turned up with deaths of doctors involved with natural healing!
Had no idea about all of that -- the first I knew of it was doctors treating patients with Autism.
Really shocking.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also movement to health stores where natural products exist ...
but RoundUp/glyphosate is destroying all natural plants.
Honey is now contaminated by it -- 65% for convention honey/45% for raw honey.
So the honey doesn't really work for health any longer, but you also get the glyphosate
which can cause Cancer, Autism, Depression, Alzheimers ... on and on.
               </p>
               <p>
                Agree -- but actually it's more of a CIA/corporate press (See:  Operation Mockingbird and two companion programs ...
Paperclip and Gladio which were being written two years before end of WWII.)
               </p>
               <p>
                Really, whether we look at politics or media, anyone who is still honest will walk out on it.

             How in the world can we know everything? Alls I do is try my best and I make mistakes. This news however old it is is still news to those who havent seen it. So why should it be buried away just because it has a couple of different dates on it? Deride me for tryin. Yes, everything should be vetted. Theres a reason noone posts in here anymore, Theres no sense of helping others out, just rules rules rules and alot of barking.

               sorry for the mishap and i feel forgiven, yes, I should have vetted better (making mental note) glad we met. I have watched "severe autism" on you tube about Jamie. His mom is a hero. The reason I have watched those is because I wanted to know WHAT is autism and what it can do and what are people doing for relief of the  symptoms because everyone is just basically learing, the CDC isnt helping these ones with thier terrorist dollars. Jamies mom is a hero because shes had the guts to show people what has happened to her family. It should not be ignored.. Its utterly heart breaking and everyone takes the wind from thier sales if they complain. They are marching in the streets for goodness gracious because nobody is listening except the neighboring parent that has the same problem. I wanted to take a class at a nearby community college and they said I had to have a vaccination before I could attend. So I said no. I have no immune system at this time. I do believe I was vaccine injured along time ago. The more I learned about it the more I started to see some of my problems in their stories. I have cd burned alot of their stories off You Tube. The bible talks about these horrible last days.

               <p>
                Quarter -- 
I've had it happen to me, as well.  But sometimes it's difficult to keep in mind.
               </p>
               <p>
                Not familiar with YouTube/Jamie, but am familiar -- and try to stay familiar with
subject as best I can.  Dr. Andrew Wakefield has presented many of the parents...
have you seen the movie "VAXXED"?
               </p>
               <p>
                Yes, it is amazing to see the lack of help for parents with children with full blow Autism ...
or even some of the symptoms under the Autism "Spectrum."
               </p>
               <p>
                But, I believe people will be listening very soon -- here in NJ 1 in every 4 children has Autism....
Eventually, that news will be becoming more visible as the children move out of babyhood 
and into school age and adulthood. 
About as close as I have gotten to personal involvement with this issue is through my 
daughter as her husband's brother and his wife have three children and ONE seems 
to have been hared by Autism.  They are all beautiful children and my daughter has 
been very involved with especially the eldest daughter as she has been growing up.
At some point it became obvious that she was very frustrated in her schooling which
also seemed to be doing more harm to her.
                <br/>
                The family is having to move because the state/city where they live won't provide 
financial help of any kind for special schools, though they also don't provide any
appropriate schooling at all for children with these problems.  The grandfather is
helping, but the new special school is very costly -- kind of like sending a child to
college!  But she is much happier at this school.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's amazing the wisdom that these families show in speaking for their children,
despite that they are under such stress and financial strain and faced with so
much denial about the connection to vaccines.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yes, it seems that Big Pharm and US government are looking for any 
and every excuse to vaccinate and to make it mandatory for people of
every age.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm sorry to hear that you might also have been harmed by vaccines.
I think this is much more widespread than anyone in government wants to admit.
               </p>
               <p>
                My interest also relates to schizophrenia, for one, because there are quite some
astounding parallels between Autism and Schizophrenia.
For one -- the vaccines attack the brain -- and in Autism there is an 
under-pruning of the synapses.  Whereas in Schizophrenia there is 
an over-pruning of the synapses.
Guess its kind of like a computer missing a lot of programming in one case
and in the other having a lot of overlapping and outdated information in the other.
               </p>
               <p>
                Researchers looking into this are questioning all of the problems that have come
up with children -- for instance,
                <strong>
                 Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
                </strong>
                in newborns where
they think it is the vaccines which trigger it.  Nurses have testified to Congress that 
they have actually witnessed newborns dying immediately after a vaccine was 
administered to them.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also,
                <strong>
                 Colic
                </strong>
                in children is another unanswered problem which is 
ignored but my daughter had a very serious case of it which disrupted
our household for more than 6 months, at the minimum.
                <br/>
                It was so bad that the pediatrician was recommending "drugs" to relax
or put her to sleep!!  But no real explanation of what it was or what 
might help.  It seemed to be gastronomical and those kind of disturbances
are common in children with Autism.
My son then suffered **"projectile spitting" **until he was one year old.
That also suggests the same kind of gastronomical disorder.
               </p>

                All three of these problems suffered by children are now being looked at
as connected to vaccines.  Additionally, we realized a long time later 
that my daughter is somewhat dyslectic which wasn't caught in school.
And my son is bothered by "attention deficit" though neither was that 
caught in school.
               </p>
               <p>
                And every generation seems to be suffering much more from the 
increased schedule of vaccines.
               </p>
               <p>
                That's about it for me.

                Except that -- yes -- there have been homeopathic doctors who have helped
children with Autism by clearing their systems of the metals.
Unfortunately, those doctors seem to have very quickly come under attack
and an odd number of them have died under strange circumstances.

                 Peanuts --
                </strong>
                <br/>
                Also want to mention this to you (especially if you are passing on any info on
other websites) .... 
If you reflect on the huge numbers of children now who have allergies to peanuts
and other nuts, that is also rather suspicious as Big Pharma had used peanut oil
in some of the vaccines.

               How in the world can we know everything? Alls I do is try my best and I make mistakes. This news however old it is is still news to those who havent seen it. So why should it be buried away just because it has a couple of different dates on it?  Deride me for tryin. Yes, everything should be vetted. Theres a reason noone posts in here anymore, Theres no sense of helping others out, just rules rules rules and alot of barking.

              Whoa!! I remember when she died! What I find really sad is that some people have been claiming to be awake for many years now, yet they're not awake to what's in store.  But then I think only one person can read hearts , and it ain't me!! 🙂

             Can you even fathom the discust that God endures? He has ultimate patience. :):) His poor animals and loved ones and all the innocent ones and of course all the dead ones. Not to mention our beautiful home. Did you know that the Catholic priests are credited with the first propaganda? The 3 frogs in rev. are propaganda. I started thinking about frog in the bible and when they were used in Egypt. They were in everything and there was no escape. Thats how I feel in this age of media. I cant even sit thru a show barely. I just get so discusted with all thier cow patties and dung piles and cow chips!!!!!!  I have been thinking about the moon in rev that is blood red. Saturnalia with all thier moon worship and human sacrifice reminds me of that bloody moon, it just creeps me out!!!! I asked people in a post I did if they will be celebrating Saturnalia/Christmas this year after they know about Saturnalia, I got crickets. I was glad to see christmas sail down the road, I felt liberated from chains  and still do. Im just glad we are told the truth all the time. Plz help us to be obedient and led is my prayer for all of us.
