<p>Reich\'s Orgonomic Infant Research Centre was at the centre of child sexual abuse allegations according to this thread (can\'t find original source): &quot;Reich established the Orgonomic Infant Research Center (OIRC) in 1950, with the aim of preventing muscular armouring in children from birth. Meetings were held in the basement of his house in Forest Hills. Turner wrote that several children who were treated by OIRC therapists later said they had been sexually abused by the therapists, although not by Reich. One woman said she was assaulted by one of Reich\'s associates when she was five years old. Children were asked to stand naked in front of Reich and a group of 30 therapists in his basement, while Reich described the children\'s &quot;blockages.&quot; Reich\'s daughter, Lore Reich Rubin, told Turner that she believed her father was an abuser, although she did not say she had been abused by him, and she acknowledged that she had no evidence. She believed that Reich himself had been abused as a child, which is why he developed such an interest in sex and childhood sexuality.&quot; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5g4f3e/i_believe_i_have_found_some_interesting/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5g4f3e/i_believe_i_have_found_some_interesting/</a></p>

            I have never heard of these accusations about Wilhelm Reich before, but was aware of the research into orgone, which I had assumed was prana/chi/vril etc... This connects directly to satanic ritual abuse, or the energy that is extracted from the ritual victim - the 'loosh'.
           </p>
           <p>
            For what it's worth, Reich work into orgone research was silenced by the government, his books burned and he died in prison. He was brilliant, although his work was obviously mis-used.

            What the Antifa is suggesting is just evil. Pedos are worse than any political movement. These Anti-FA are the FA...

            Remember when the Liberal battle cry was over getting the government out of people's bedrooms?  Now the violent Marxist Communist activists want to eradicate the nuclear family...worse than Soviet Union style because they want to diddle the kiddies before teaching them to march straight. WTF people, when are Libtard Dems going to wake up?

             Keep in mind this is a small, but very vocal and deep state funded shit-group. I know hundreds of Libs and none of them are falling for, nor will they back this shit. 
Yes, it is my job, and yours, to show them what these fuckers are trying to do to their movement, and to continue teaching that most Dem "leaders" are Neoliberals that can now be flushed down the toilet. Kinda like when the dopey KKK shows up at a Tea Party rally. Yeah, they can just fuck right off.
