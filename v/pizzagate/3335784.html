<p>New Mexico authorities are focusing on Jeffrey Epstein\'s Santa Fe ranch, which could also spark changes to state sex offender laws</p>
<p>&quot;The scandal has raised alarms in New Mexico as the state\'s Attorney General Hector Balderas said &quot;outdated&quot; laws allowed him to avoid registering as a sex offender following a guilty plea a decade ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At the center of Jeffrey Epstein\'s secluded New Mexico ranch sits a sprawling residence the financier built decades ago — complete with plans for a 4,000-square-foot (372-square-meter) courtyard, a living room roughly the size of the average American home and a nearby private airplane runway.
Known as the Zorro Ranch, the high-desert property is now tied to an investigation that the state attorney general\'s office says it has opened into Epstein with plans to forward findings to federal authorities in New York.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Records show Epstein purchased the ranch, valued by county officials at over $12 million, from the family of former Gov. Bruce King, who died 10 years ago. A 1995 Santa Fe New Mexican story about his plans to build a mansion on the property said the home would be 26,700 square feet (2,480 square meters) with a 2,100-square-foot (195-square-meter) living room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The King family still owns land surrounding much of Epstein\'s ranch near the town of Stanley, a rural outpost on the plains that stretch east of the Sandia Mountains.
Gary King, the son of the former governor, was the state attorney general from 2007 to 2015, and was among a handful of candidates in the state who returned Epstein campaign donations.&quot;

            Gov. Bruce King, a Democrat,  was in office (one of 3 terms served)  when he sold the land to Epstein. New Mexico public officials have an unsavory history of corruption. Two state treasurers were sent to federal prison for extortion and collecting kickbacks. Albuquerque police have shady history (see
            <a href="http://realcrimes.com/Corruption_Overview.htm">
             http://realcrimes.com/Corruption_Overview.htm
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            Governor King's wife Alice was on the board of many child related organizations: San Felipe del Rio children's home, All Faith Receiving home that operates a safehouse for abused children, New Mexico Boys and Girls Ranches and founded the New Mexico Children's Foundation . Ironic that they would sell land to a future child molester.

            Gary King, Bruce King's son, was State Atty General twice 2007 to 2015, worked in Wash DC for the DOE. He accepted Epstein related campaign donations and returned them in 2007 after Epstein's arrest. He accepted campaign donations from Epstein related companies , again, in 2014 and again returned them when publicity ramped up on Epstein.

            The contractor has no reliable reviews, the license is inactive, and seems to only be used for this property.
 Why would you create a business, get a contractor licensed, develop a straw man, bring in actual workers, and go through all the money and trouble necessary for this when you could just hire someone reputable from NM? CONTROL. You want to build something outside of code and environmental oversight, have allies on the inside, and keep as many eyes off the property / project as possible. This sounds like the C()MET P1ZZA's k!llr00m connection to ' Margotwork ' who helped DESIGN THE PLACE! 
I would not be surprised if this is an M.O. for these M.F.s.

             Nice find. Everything Epstein is involved with is veiled in secrecy.  But how would building this ranch escape notice of our alphabet agencies? Or did it........

             Seems odd as there were also mounds on the island, surrounding the pit/tennis court. From the aerial view there are lots of 'burn marks' (terminology , not from fire) or areas in the land which are dead or discolored; usually means they have been excavated at one time OR have buried structures causing the surface to look or grow differently. Straight lines make me think tunnels, but could be pipes for utilities, irrigation, maybe mining. Someone thought it was worth it to DIG, and on this we agree...

             Some have speculated his Island Temple resembles a Zoroastrian fire temple : Ateshgah Temple, Baku
"This territory is known for such unique natural phenomenon as burning natural gas outlets (underground gas coming onto surface contacts oxygen and lights up). 
From times immemorial this was the holy place of Zoroastrians- fire worshippers (approximately beginning of our era). They attributed mystical significance to the inextinguishable fire and came there to worship the relic."

             Personally I think they use an amalgamation of sacred symbols sites (Dome of the Rock color and gold dome) and architecture rather than use singular religious or historical inspiration but, I recognized that connection too.

            His real estate lawyer owns the property at 49 Zorro Ranch Road. the only other property in the area. In some satellite shots, you can see what looks like a red light shining from the top of 49, and what looks like an unmarked dirt runway nearby.

            According to Bar ak, IT'S ALL ABOUT SCIENCE:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Barak recalls having visited Epstein at two of his Manhattan residences and said he did visit Ep stein’s private Caribbean island “once, for several hours—and years after the publications about sex parties or orgies there.” But, Bar ak says, “I've never been there at a party.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “To the contrary,” Bar ak says, “at his home, I met many very respected people, scientists, Nobel Prize winners, and I met him also in Boston, at MIT or the Harvard labs he supports.”"
