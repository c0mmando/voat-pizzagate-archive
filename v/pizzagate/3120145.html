<blockquote>
<p>In a stunning discovery, Amazon has sex dolls that look like children for sale on their site. A company called DVKFP has sex dolls, that are clearly meant to target pedophiles and represent children, listed on Amazon including a promise for &quot;hidden delivery.&quot;</p>
<p>One clearly shows an underdeveloped child\'s body with no breasts and little girl headband while another has photos of <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/avfzwa.png">what looks to be a young teen tied up with rope with torn clothes and a bloody gag in her mouth</a>.</p>
<p>The legality of child-like sex dolls is muddy. On one hand, our obscenity and child porn laws are very strong and include even cartoons or depictions of children in sexual situations as illegal, but are rarely enforced against Hollywood or the arts community.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Florida have taken action to attempt to stop the sale of dolls like these with a law called the CREEPER Act (Curbing Realistic Exploitative Electronic Pedophilic Robots Act) that was passed in the U.S. Congress but died in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Just last week, a similar Florida law headed to the Senate floor for a vote:</p>
<p>Sen. Lauren Book sponsored  SB 160 amid an international conversation surrounding child sex dolls and their link to increased sexual preying on children.</p>
<p>The bill would make it a first-degree misdemeanor to own, show, lend, sell or advertise child sex dolls. If someone possesses one without the intent to do the above, it would be a second-degree misdemeanor. And if someone does it more than once, it would become a third-degree felony.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill claim that men use these dolls to avoid molesting children, but there is no evidence that it works. Research in the UK has shown that people who buy these dolls are likely to have child porn in their possession, and child porn unquestionably harms children. As reported by The Hill:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the United Kingdom, which already has a ban similar to [the CREEPER Act], authorities have seized 128 dolls this year. Eighty-five percent of the men who imported them were also found in possession of child pornography. These individuals didn’t use the dolls as a substitute. They used them to supplement their stash of kiddy porn. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now they\'re on Amazon. Lawmakers better get busy and get serious about stopping violence against children currently available on Amazon, thanks to Jeff Bezos. Currently, Bezos is allowed to ban books by conservative journalists like Tommy Robinson, and has banned all documentaries and books on the side-effects of vaccines, but thinks it\'s fine to peddle in child sex dolls. Think about that. </p>
<p>Update 8:22 p.m. Eastern: Amazon has removed the sex dolls that look like children, but I caught the event on video.</p>

That's like saying porn prevents rape. It causes rape because you're training your brain with what you watch.

            If you think this is a child, you've obviously never been to Japan. Having lived there myself (and been to China a few times) this looks like a 27-32 year old woman.

            These do absolutely nothing at all to stop these sick freaks from abusing, molesting and torturing kids. It brings the sickness forth even more. They can’t get enough and they cannot control their urges to harm. Amazon is just profiting from the human trafficking trade by selling this garbage. I won’t shop there.

            Its hard not to think of words like conspiracy theories and pedo obsessed world leaders controlled by some invisible hand that seems to originate in money...
This stuff belongs with Hentai porn showing evidently pre pubesecent and or tweeny depictions of female bodies, Waifu cushions with naked children on them, sex education targeting younger and younger children, over sexualisation of children's media, ie cartoons and teen shows.  The usage of computer game networks (Steam and PS +)  to transmettre child porn and groom victims.  The normalisation of being a pedophile.  It's all so very well... orchestrated...

            Creepy. They shouldn’t be allowed to sell these, but if they are going to continue doing so, DHS should track all sales within the US and open investigations on every person who buys one.

            would you consider flairing this post 'NSFW'? Thanks.

            Amazon sold DIY circumcision sets as of last year. IIRC, we discussed it in a post. Nice to see where their priorities are.

             IMO, no post should ever be NSFW when highlighting the truth in relation how degenerates operate. Free education for all.

              Subverse rule no. 5:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               You must label NSFW posts (“Not safe for work”; for example gore, nudity etc.) as such when submitting.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              There is a reason why posts with NSFW content need to be flaired.
             </p>
             <p>
              1) As the label says, they are really 'not safe for work' = might incriminate the reader when read in a public context, like a work situation.
             </p>
             <p>
              2) (and more important) Content of these posts might trigger survivors, and the 'NSFW' label is a trigger warning.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               including one bound with a bloody gag in its mouth
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              might already trigger survivors, before they even decide to click on the post.
             </p>
             <p>
              Voat users can choose whether they would like to see NSFW content or not.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you have a problem with flairing posts 'NSFW', I suggest to start a discussion on
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/voat">
               v/voat
              </a>
              or
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/ideasforvoat">
               v/ideasforvoat
              </a>
              , or in
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
               v/pizzagatemods
              </a>
              , where posts with meta-discussions can go.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not sure whether we ever discussed the problem OP has pointed out here on
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">

               I prefer facts and reality over feelings. To many times, feelings get in the way of efficient course corrections when facts show the way.
