            Dershowitz had threatened to sue her for defamation, when Virginia claimed that she was forced to give him oral sex when she was yet a child, when the whole Epstein orgy island came into the news. He hasn't sued.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was widely believed many years ago that Dershowitz had his wife killed during a custody battle. His wife had left him due to finding out aobut his predilection for CP.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides being the defender of Epstein, Dershowitz was advisor to OJs dream team also. It would have been awkward for him to be in court and under scrutiny during the OJ trial when someone might well have brought up the case about his own wife falling off the Brooklyn Bridge.

             Hey Laskar, we could use links to that Dershowitz smut. He's a key to the Epstein story -- has weaponized the law into a tool for witness and prosecutor suppression -- and a major reason victims don't come forward and attorneys don't take their cases. Anything we can document on him could be valuable.

             <p>
              <em>
               Mr. Dershowitz has concocted a fraud which amazingly in large parts, he plagiarized from another fraud. I found that pretty shocking, shocking coming from a Harvard professor. I find it shocking coming from any professor. ... In the first two chapters of your book you extensively reproduce all of Joan Peters’ pages in her book

              Joan Peterson wrote a book entitled From Time Immemorial. The Case for Israel is a book written by Dershowitz, who was accused of 29 plagiarisms from Peterson's book.  This is a transcript of an interview done with Dershowitz and Finkelstein, who had shown Peterson's book to be a fraud.   Dershowitz attempts to muzzle Finkelstein and repeatedly threatens him with legal action.  That seems to be his MO. www.democracynow.org/2003/9/24/scholar_norman_finkelstein_calls_professor_alan

               Dershowitz's predilection for Asian Prostituted Women

             <p>
              In 1990, Boston Globe columnist Mike Barnicle wrote a column in which he accused Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz of having made a racially-biased statement. In the column, Barnicle claimed that on a chance meeting with Dershowitz in Harvard Square eight years before, Dershowitz said to him: "I love Asian women, don't you? They're ... they're so submissive."  Dershowitz went after Barnicle FOR YEARS afterwards.

             <p>
              One commenters, Seth, states: "Dershowitz has been widely reported in the Boston press as having expressed a preference for Asian prostitutes because they are "so submissive"."

             <p>
              Notorious child molester Rabbi Lebovits served less than three months in prison (he was sentenced to 32 years) after being represented by Dershowitz.  This is truly dirty. Lebovits's conviction was overturned on appeal after the then-Brooklyn DA indicted Samuel Kellner (the whistleblower) for alleged extortion of Lebovits..
The charges against Kellner were eventually shown to be trumped up and the DA’s conduct in the case was exposed for what it truly was – unethical and likely illegal. The tainted and often false evidence against Kellner came from his attorneys, Alan Dershowitz and Arthur Aidala.  Sam Kellner was falsely accused of attempting to extort the family of  Lebovits and faced the possibility of serving years in prison until the case against him was dropped last year. This is what hero Kellner had to say:

             <p>
              Dershowitz's first wife, Sue Barlach, was a victim of domestic abuse.  He beat her so badly she ended up in hospital after she found out he was having an affair.  After the divorce she was stripped of the custody of her children and she took her own life by jumping off Brooklyn Bridge. Dershowitz then used his formidable litigious clout to intimidate media outlets from publicizing the wife-beating event and her subsequent suicide.

               Where is the focus on the plaintiff’s courage? On her horrifying experience, and on the experiences of the millions of other minors bought and sold for sex each year? When rape victims do come forward, where is the focus on ensuring we don’t re-victimize them in the media? Brutalized by Epstein, betrayed by federal prosecutors who refused to pursue justice, Jane Doe #3 was then publicly shamed by Dershowitz. Shaming rape and human trafficking victims compounds injustice, violating those who report and discouraging others from doing so

He maintains that the consumption of pornography is not harmful.  He forgets that it's human beings being prostituted, used and abused in porn.
