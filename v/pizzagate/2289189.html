            Don't know about this.  This guy is just throwing a lot of stuff out there without much explanation or evidence.  For example, he says Otis Redding was beaten to death and thrown off  a pier.  Really? Redding died in a very public plane crash, and there are a lot of witnesses and photos regarding the crash. Members of the Bar Kays (his back up band, and afterwards their own music group) were on the plane. Some of them also  died in the crash.  The survivors have spoken about the crash for years.  If you are going to make stuff up, at least do a little background investigation. He may be right about Clive Davis, but he undermines himself with crap like that.

             And it killed everybody on the plane except one person so there was not really anybody around, like a group of survivors, to talk about it.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              On its final approach to Madison on this day in 1967, however, the private plane carrying soul-music legend Otis Redding would crash into the frigid waters of a small lake three miles short of the runway, killing seven of the eight men aboard, including Redding.

              The survivor has talked about it, I have seen an interview with him and read another. There were also witnesses on the ground to the plan crash. Its not a matter of believing in dark occult magic, its a matter of credibility. I am all for exposing pedos and any satanism behind it, but at the same time we have to be critical of what is thrown out there, as it can reflect on us as a whole.

               The same type of people made people believe 14 cave dwellers blew up the world trade center in broad daylight. this plane crash is kindergarten for these people. Otis Redding is famous for his song "Sitting On The Dock Of The Bay" so in ritual style they threw him off of a pier. I believe it but you don't have to.

            This is a must see documentary. I watched it some time ago and think of it every now and then when something comes up that confirms something in the doc. It's well done and breaking it into sections as they did makes it convenient for watching if you don't have the time to watch it from start to finish.
