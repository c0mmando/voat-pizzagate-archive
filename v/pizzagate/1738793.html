            TBH. Just wake up our own peoples. It doesn't really matter if we kill Alefantis, or torch an entire D.C. block. That will only alienate the truth from the people. The Zionists own the entire country. The food, water, government, air, schools, universities, businesses. Everything. We should work on waking people up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Once we own our country again, then we will have to think about violence. It will be an organized war to keep hold of our country from the parasites that once owned it, who will be manipulating other countries against us. AKA Nazi Germany 2.0
           </p>
           <p>
            Until then, violence is just a waste of our time. We need to wake our own peoples up. All of em :)

            Killing lowly middlemen like Alefantis is completely unnecessary, and highly destructive to any sort of progress. And he SURE AS HELL isn't going to get convicted in a one of the "courts", no matter what evidence we find.
