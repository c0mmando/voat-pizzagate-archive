            , this is not enough to demonstrate a direct link to Pizzagate. Removing per Rule 1. We aren't investigating generic "sex trafficking". We are investigating the sexual abuse of of

             kids
            </strong>
            by the global elite.

            Several factions of the mafia converge in Racine, Kenosha and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Even the Dixie Mafia is in Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of the families with connections to the area include Bonanno, Madrigrano, Balistrieri, Infusino, Gagliano, Ruffalo, Ricchio, Aiello, Russo, Consentino, Tenuta, Troha, Chiappette, Misurelli, Porcaro and others. Even the corrupt Boy Scout Governor Scott Walker is part of a group known as the Marquette Mafia. Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus work for the mafia and corrupt corporate masters, and also also corrupt Boy Scouts.
           </p>
           <p>
            People with extremely close ties to the most powerful people in the area were known for trafficking drugs. They have a private, fully controlled International Airport with a Customs office, and a private, fully controlled harbor on one of the largest fresh water sources in the world. The state is run by the mafia, corrupt churches (including mafia ties such as the Dominicans in Racine), Freemasons, Knights of Pythias and Knights of Malta, corrupt corporations linked to the Pilgrims Society, corrupt foundations and organizations such as Rotary &amp; United Way, corrupt arms of the RNC and DNC, corrupt and complicit authorities, and greedy politicians who receive kickbacks and are told they are immune to all laws. The area caters to the global elite for secret agenda meetings, pizza parties, dialysis and blood transfusions, and organ transplants. It is built on sacred Indian burial grounds and has only two or maybe three media sources in the area, all of which are corrupt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recently, a guy known as "Mr. Racine" passed away. He was a radio personality that promoted corrupt businesses. The Bonanno family was interviewed in his last story in the corrupt local newspaper, and he was a close friend of the corrupt criminal mayor tied to the mafia who just resigned yesterday amid allegations of bribery, blackmail, extortion, embezzlement, fraud, rigged development deals, rigged elections and votes, misconduct in office, abuse of power, illegal campaign financing, racketeering, collusion, conspiracy, stalking and threats against witnesses. The mayor's resignation follow his cousin the corrupt criminal city administrator who didn't have a college degree or public administration experience, and was involved in the same list of crimes. That follows the resignation of the corrupt city attorney who helped them break laws and lie about the law to push through corrupt deals. That follows the resignation of the corrupt criminal District Attorney who refused to investigate his freemason brothers who were involved in criminal felonies and brazen corruption. Witnesses identified him as trying to flee the scene by car before fleeing on foot after he was speeding down Main street, running through an intersection, knocking down a street light, then obstructing justice, and he eventually got a ride back home without going to jail. His Freemason friend the state Attorney General showed up with the rest of the corrupt group to give him hugs when he announced he had to resign because too many members of the public were too disgusted with the obvious levels of corruption and cover ups. He was replaced by another corrupt DA who violated the Hatch Act before getting into office and won't investigate corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            The mafia are one of many players in the global pyramid, as are street level gangs like MS-13 who are given sanctuary in Sanctuary City Racine. Secret societies have infiltrated all forms of government and industry in Wisconsin, and they use charities and Foundations to push through their corrupt agenda and create community buy-in around programs for the homeless, women and children, elderly and veterans. They compartmentalize programs to avoid exposure and create separations from direct quid pro quo arrangements.
           </p>
           <p>
            Laws do not matter in Wisconsin. Everything is controlled by private interests including the prison and education systems. Now they are using those interests to control the fresh water supply and other resources. They are also creating fake organizations like The Fight to End Exploitation to combat trafficking sponsored by the groups who are connected to those involved in the trafficking and criminal corruption.

            Now whenever I see a cheese ad on TV I think of the Mafia.  Sargento is a family (supposedly) owned company but it ends in an O.  Hah. Another Italian Mob Name?  Thank you
