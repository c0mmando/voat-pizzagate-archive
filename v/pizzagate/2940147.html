            He is also aligned with far right wing RSS ...and asks them for solutions to a problem ...that exists because of the debt system...run from London..
The RSS were funded by marwari merchants like Birla family...who were opium agents for the British..
The birlas also funded Gandhis movement ..
In fact GD birla housed Gandhi at the time of his assasination at Birla House ...while at the same time his elder brother was sending cheques to Sarvarkar , the handler for Gandhis assassin...
The Marwaris are basically the Satanic court Jews of the crown corporatiin that is India ..
           </p>
           <p>
            Looks like Child trafficking run by the global satanists will be used as THE drive to inject global governance...
Problem , reactiin , solution..

            Have you looked into the director? I hear ALARM BELLS

            The Guggenheim's are an Elite Jewish/German family involved in film and FINE ART
           </p>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, was produced and directed by Davis Guggenheim. An Inconvenient Truth won the Academy Award in 2007 for Best Documentary Feature. The film, released in 2006, featured Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and his international slideshow on global warming.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2013, he directed a 30-minute documentary "The Dream is Now". It tells the stories of undocumented youth and their families who are desperate to earn their citizenship in the only country they've ever called home. The film follows the lives of 4 undocumented students in the United States as they deal with our "broken" immigration system. Guggenheim's film, however, offered only one perspective and possible solution: it advocated for Congress to grant an amnesty.
            </p>
            <p>
             A documentary film about the band U2 directed by Guggenheim titled From the Sky Down opened the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival in September.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then-Candidate for President Barack Obama's biographical film, which aired during the Democratic National Convention in August 2008, was directed by Guggenheim. The Guggenheim-directed Obama infomercial, which was broadcast on October 29, 2008, was "executed with high standards of cinematography", according to The New York Times.[10] In 2012, he released The Road We've Traveled, a 17-minute short film on the president.[11]

             I posted so others could help research. Steve Jobs avoided setting up a Globalist Foundation/charity, so I was surprised to find that his widow not only helped finance the documentary, but also was the executive producer. This is what increased my interest in this film. I agree, there are many red flags- that's why research on this documentary might give us some leads. Thanks for your input.
