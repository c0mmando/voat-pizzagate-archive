            I'm skeptical that the vocals are sampled words (too much inflection, not robotic at all, play it at half speed and it is obviously the same person singing all the songs) and open to interpretation of the listener. I wonder if anyone has found audio of Alefantis singing karaoke or something like that to compare vocals. Since these people have been singing this same child abduction and killing theme probably for 15 years or more and making it hidden in the lyrics instead of  out in the open like Alice Cooper-dead babies exploitation shock lyrics, it sure seems likely they have witnessed this in real life. Seriously that The Psyched-Rubber Gloves video (taken down now) was all about child sacrifice, NO DOUBT WHATSOEVER about that.  Also the word GLOVE has been used by these people quite often for many years, so not sure if they are copycats of the 1980s Lp "the glove" or it has some meaning in their rituals.

            Disclaimer: I'm not a pizzagater, I just love disassembling lyrics. This is my opinion of the meaning.

           </p>
           <p>
            They punished the person. The face is very personal and provokes strong visual imagery and an emotional response from the listener.

            "I can't even leave"

            "Night first" the first night there, the swapping of words could mean that night is still approaching.

           <p>
            "Night face"
           </p>
           <p>
            Assuming this isn't a typo, it could be a reference to what the face looks like after the night when the beating occurred, battered  and bruised, a night face because you don't want to see it in the daylight.

             My friend, I would be EXTREMELY careful when watching these vids... they are using NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) in these videos which is a psychological tool used to influence the viewer. I've warned people about this before and will continue to do so, if you watch these videos, put the volume on mute and only watch in piecemeal attempts as the subliminal messaging is there and designed to impact your subconscious.... the CIA has put a lot of money into researching how to program people via MK Ultra which never stopped. They are pretty advanced when it comes to this so please be careful.
            </p>
            <p>
             But just sow you know, the whole point of most of these videos is focusing in on the male-female duality played by Majestic Ape which we have come to a consensus is sometimes a man and sometimes a woman behind the mask.... the point is that they are giving homage to the ISIS-Osiris-Horus link of gender neutrality when Horus was engendered by Isis copulating with a dead Osiris who was missing his penis b/c a fish ate it and swam off.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's also all over the art they reference... I've posted about this a lot. Ann Leda Shapiro is one such artist that highlights this male-female duality:
            </p>
            <p>
             "
             <strong>
              Woman Landing on Man in the Moon
             </strong>
             "
             <a href="http://www.annledashapiro.com/projects/EarlyWork/earlyWork.htm">
              Link
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "
             <strong>
              HeShe
             </strong>
             "

              Link
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Notice the male and female sexual organs used in conjunction... it's in a lot of her artwork and is also a reference to the ancient Sanskrit legend dealing with the lost race of Atlantis near Madagascar where there was a race of people that could procreate on their own and had a 3rd eye instead of a brain.

              That's very interesting and noted, but I think avoiding the sound is pointless. Let's make the assumption that you are correct and there is subliminal control coming from this music put in by the cia. If this is true then they could put it ANYWHERE such as in adverts movies and series. Which means watching any sort of media is dangerous, not just music videos.

               That's the point, but this HB videos are just egregiously done so... it's meant to be shown to children imo whose minds are weaker by definition since they are young, malleable, and formable. It's not as dangerous as to someone like you, but it should be stated and not taken lightly considering there is some really sick shit in those videos.

                I agree with you. People pretend like it doesn't affect them, but some videos really have lasting effects on you. Gore videos I've seen have changed me and stuck with me to this day. I never should have watched themm

            Heavy Breathing guitarist and bassist Erick Jackson says he scours the Internet to find vocal samples.
           </p>
           <p>
            “I take anything that sounds decent and cut up the vocals into single words and syllables,” Jackson says. “I then pitch and tune the phrases till they sound musical. By this time there is no semblance to the source material.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The result is often energetic but inhuman psych rock, whipped into a frenzy by a charismatic vocalist who doesn’t exist. Take Heavy Breathing’s latest single, “Night First” (stream it below). Over a propulsive organ riff, a robotic croon doles out vaguely meaningful sentence fragments: “I can’t believe,” “Yes, I’m feeling,” a garbled cadence that could very well be the title of the song.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Basically, the vocals are another instrument that produces riffs and rhythms,” Jackson says. “The actual words are open to the listener’s interpretation.”

             In my opinion, no lead singer could take channeling the evil that is embedded in this psy-op music through their bodies and out to an audience.  Eventually they found the perfect, soulless solution - a frankenstein voice cobbled together from all kinds of disparate sources, and probably some screams and moans as well.  Soulless vocals for a soundscape literally meant to shatter the souls of those who participate, both victim and perpetrator in unspeakable blackmail acts with this as psychotropic background onslaught, while dosed on heavy psychotropic reality shattering drugs.

             Mind control music performed by mind control puppets, produced by a handler but ultimately produced by dark psyops alphabet agency/ies.  This is my opinion and I have no proof.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also in my opinion, and with no proof, I believe that the band performing this sound design was the tip of the iceberg - a front.  This stuff was produced for the blackmail parties because "Night Moves" just doesn't cut it for the type of thing that had to be done.
            </p>
            <p>
             I certainly know and hold out the hope that I could be wrong in my theorizing.

             Isthland may be a car licence plate? 
google gave me that:
14 ISHTLAN 	Used 	Mercedes-Benz C-Класс 190 D 2.5 MT (90 HP) 	Michigan (MI) 	1997
            </p>
            <p>
             ADD: How does licensing in America work? On reload here are more ISHTLAN-plates. Why is that?
