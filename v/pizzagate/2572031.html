<p><strong>An anon at the chans dropped a hint regarding a woman who met with Laura Silsby in Haiti the day before Silsby was arrested in 2010 for kidnapping children, Anne-Christine d\'Adesky.</strong> </p>
<p><em>NeonRevolt now published an article about the anons\' findings (see below).</em></p>
<p>Most of you are familiar with the Silsby case, since it has been frequently discussed here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Life_Children%27s_Refuge_case"><em>from Wikipedia:</em></a></p>
<p><em>On January 29, 2010, a group of ten American Baptist missionaries from Idaho attempted to cross the Haiti-Dominican Republic border with 33 Haitian children, most of whom were not orphans and had families. The group (..) did not have proper authorization for transporting the children and were arrested on kidnapping charges.</em> </p>
<p><em>Nine of the ten missionaries were later released but (...) Laura Silsby remained incarcerated in Haiti. By the time she went to trial on May 13 the charges had been reduced to &quot;arranging irregular travel&quot; and the prosecution sought a 6-month prison term. On May 17, she was found guilty and sentenced to the time served in jail prior to the trial.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What made the case interesting for our investigation was Silsby\'s connection to the Clintons. <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-01-25/clinton-silsby-trafficking-scandal-and-how-media-attempted-ignorecover-it">They intervened on her behalf</a>, and both the charges and her sentence were reduced.</p>

<h2><strong>So who is Anne-Christine d\'Adesky?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.neonrevolt.com/2018/06/01/the-morally-repugnant-elite-and-their-bad-juju-haiti-dr-humantrafficking-qanon-greatawakening/">This NeonRevolt article</a> discusses the findings of the chan anons.</p>
<p><em>Most interesting finds:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Her family, an elite Haitian family, owns a shipping company in Haiti.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They also own Wahoo Bay Beach Club and Resort. Wahoo is mentioned in a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/40647">Podesta email</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NeonRevolt asks whether they might have been involved in trafficking. Also, they point out that Laura Silsby might have 
met d\'Adesky in order to find a way of shipping children out of Haiti (which is, of course, mere speculation at this point).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The article also discusses a recent child trafficking case in Haiti - with 33 children as victims. Remember, Silsby also smuggled 33 children. A coincidence? </p>

             So who is Anne-Christine d'Adesky?

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            She's the one who underminded Silsby legal defense.  Silsby's lawyer claimed that Silsby did not know she was doing anything wrong because they had permission of a Dominican official.  d'Adesy told her that didn't count and she would most likely be stopped at the border for trafficking.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             She Met With Laura Silsby The Day Before

           <p>
            No She didn't
            <em>
             meet with
            </em>
            Silsby.   She "met" Silsby.  And she did not meet her the day before.  She met her in a hotel in Santo Domingo on Jan 24.
           </p>
           <p>
            Silsby was arrested on Jan 29th.
           </p>
           <p>
            This speculation does match up with any known facts.  If d'Adesky met up with Silsby for nefarious purposes why come foward at all?  She came forward a couple of days after Silsby's group was arrested and said, hey this group is lying about not know the rules, I ran into them last week and I told them they would not be allowed to do that.

             Not true. She met her first by chance, and introduced herself (according to what she said) and then she met

              So Silsby was just going up to people asking if they knew anything about Child Trafficking they they could meet with?  and d'Adesky says I'm in the child trafficking business and I can meet you later?  Is that how you imagine it?

               I don't imagine anything. I'm just referring to what d'Adesky said - she met Silsby and her group at the hotel, obviously overheard them talking about orphans/orphanages, and introduced herself, as she was interested in the topic.
