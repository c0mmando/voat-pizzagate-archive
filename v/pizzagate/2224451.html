            Oh shit, new find.  Sorry I am in my phone and can't link to it.  Kevin Spacey attended the Yalta Economic Summit (YES) in Kiev and was a speaker for Victor Pinchuk on the section on "young leaders."

             Things are getting good...
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Victor Pinchuk is an Ukrainian oligarch and the largest individual donor to both the Clinton Foundation and the Tony Blair Foundation. He made his fortune with the industrial pipe business Interpipe Group. [1] He has also worked with George Soros on human rights projects. He runs the Victor Pinchuk Foundation for his philanthropic endeavors. [2]
             </p>
             <p>
              He is married to Olena Pinchuk. Olena is the daughter of Leonid Kuchma, the former president of Ukraine. Pinchuk's father-in-law is also a suspect to the murder of the journalist Georgy Gongadze. [3] [4]
             </p>
             <p>
              Interestingly, Crowdstrike’s CTO and co-founder, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank with openly anti-Russian sentiments that is funded by Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk, who also happened to donate at least $10 million to the Clinton Foundation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Furthermore, in 2013, the Atlantic Council awarded Hillary Clinton it’s Distinguished International Leadership Award, and in 2014, the Atlantic Council hosted one of several events with former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who took over after pro-&gt;
Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in early 2014, and who now lives in exile in Russia.
             </p>
             <p>
              Alperovitch is a nonresident senior fellow of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council.  The Council takes a hawkish approach toward Russia and has released numerous reports and briefs about Russian aggression.

            <p>
             The Kevin Spacey Foundation (KSF) creates initiatives that discover, train, fund and mentor emerging artists in drama, dance, music, and film as well as offering life enhancing theatre-in-education projects, in line with its vision statement to:
             <strong>
              ‘Send the elevator back down’
             </strong>
             a phrase coined by Jack Lemmon, Kevin’s great mentor.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            For those that may have seen talk of creating a "space elevator" that is supposed to supply the energy needs of the human race this is an example of what they really mean.
           </p>
           <p>
            The schtick is that a giant tether will be constructed from earth into space. This tether would create free energy and supply all our energy needs and catapult humanity into utopia.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is code talk for helping "rising stars" of their cabal reach higher levels within the cabal hierarchy. Ironically Kevin "Spacey" gives us a good example of what this means.

              Well, if you think about the space elevator concept, and elevator goes up and down. The freemasonic "ladder" also can be thought of an as elevator. It goes up and down.
             </p>
             <p>
              Secret societies have degrees. So as you earn degrees you "go up the ladder" or move up. Rising stars go up.
             </p>
             <p>
              The way I think of it is that when you get hooked up in the right way with the "in crowd" you are on the elevator, or the ladder, etc...There are many ways both literal and metaphorical that can apply. Such as being an actual freemason, and earning degrees. If you notice in a lot of masonic imagery you will see two pillars, a ladder, the sun, etc....
             </p>
             <p>
              In Prince's case he was a rising star. I don't know for sure if he was a member of the Boule or not. The Boule is the black freemasons so to speak. Your black people that are affiliated with masonry are usually Prince Hall Masons or if they are into occult masonry they are in the Boule. So if he was in the Boule he was climbing their ladder, or on their elevator so to speak.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Boule is subordinate to the freemasons and like anybody else, white or black, considered an expendable tool, and will be sacrificed at any point they may become worth more dead than alive, consider a threat, or just to make some sort of point to the rest of the crowd for control purposes.
             </p>
             <p>
              Prince dying "alone in the elevator" is symbolic of him being a sacrifice. For what reason I don't know. You might search "prince sacrifice" and come up with a reasonable guess because there is stuff on the web about it.

               Prince was a devout Jehovah's Witness, which I think means he couldn't have joined any kind of secret club, freemason or otherwise.
              </p>
              <p>
               That is interesting information, maybe he was part of the secret society against his will, like used in a ceremony without his knowledge or consent. I honestly cannot imagine him being a Prince Hall mason, but it is true that he wasn't always strong about his faith, he kind of rediscovered it I am guessing. You can tell because he looked healthier after embracing God and strict healthy diet and abstinence from drugs. I saw him in concert live in 2004 and he looked younger and better then than in 1984.
              </p>
              <p>
               Prince was incredibly talented and I don't really know that much about him, but oddly I do know a lot already about his death, both from media as well as speculation on sacrifice rituals. Most people do not realize that Prince was on a "legal high" drug that was sold to him as counterfiet Vicodin, and these are what actually killed him, not the fentanyl. He thought it was the weakest pill but it actually was U-47700 which is like a "bath salt" or "legal high" drug brought in from China usually mislabeled as bath salts or pool cleaner. These are drugs that never went thru clinical trials and were just kind of discovered by hobbyists, most of the time... this is where MDMA came from, "ecstasy" along with all the fake ecstasy that is out there. I personally am afraid of drugs but I've studied biology. U-47700 is known to be more immune to narcan and this is why Prince needed two narcan shots when his plane made the emergency landing. Even Fentanyl doesn't do that. The police have been investigating the source of the counterfiet pills, he likely bought them off a street, because of the stigma associated with conventional pain therapy.
              </p>
              <p>
               The day before he died one of his entourage got prince's permission to send a rehab doctor out, who was unavailable and sent his son, with a dose of suboxone, supposedly to give to the local doctor who would then give it to prince. this was their attempt to get around the more strict Suboxone prescribing laws which are state-by-state and require special training. So sad that Prince didn't get into rehab locally and a month sooner, all this would have been stopped. That is assuming this wasn't a sacrifice, I am kind of 50/50 thinking it is possible but at the same time, how could prince be buying street pills while not having a will...? this guy has a literal vault full of unreleased music, he's a notorious control freak, and you're telling me that he didn't have a will and that he was willing to play russian roulette with street pills? this guy could have had any opiate he wanted... either it was shame or something that kept him from acting like a more normal rock star would have acted, only getting more pure and expensive drugs.
              </p>
              <p>
               He literally died from fake vicodin that contained U-47700 which is notoriously dangerous in terms of addiction, breathing problems, and overdose.
