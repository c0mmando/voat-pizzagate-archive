<p>WHAT?  Are they trying to Switch The Blame Here?</p>
<p>Senators have demanded an independent investigation into how the Defense Department deals with reports of sexual violence among children who live and attend school on U.S. military bases across the globe.</p>
<p>The latest order is just one aspect of legislation that endeavors to revamp the Pentagon’s handling of service members’ children sexually abusing one another.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials reportedly have resisted a review by the department’s independent inspector general, according to The Associated Press, despite evidence of widespread failures in ensuring accountability toward perpetrators and offering support to victims.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Senate Armed Services Committee passed bipartisan proposals to address disparities in juvenile justice and seek to “protect student victims” at DOD-run educational institutions.</p>
<p>The latest developments come amid a renewed focus on rape and sexual assault within all ranks and divisions of the U.S armed services, in which U.S. lawmakers often have condemned the Pentagon leadership for not doing enough to improve the internal male-dominated culture.</p>
<p>Despite an array of initiatives put in place in recent years to combat the problem of sexual assault, the Pentagon’s annual report released in late April revealed a 10 percent uptick in reported incidents over the past year.</p>
<p>The data showed that the number of alleged abuses rose within all four military branches, the highest ascendance coming from the Marine Corps, which increased 14.7 percent. The Navy escalated 9.3 percent, while the Air Force documented a 9.2 percent jump and the Army 8.4 percent.</p>
<p>An overall 6,769 men and women reported assaults, a rise from 6,172 a year earlier, and the highest number since 2006, which was the first year such data was collected.</p>
<p>However, Pentagon officials stated that they see the number — the highest for the seventh year in a row — as fortitude that more victims are buoyed to report such aggressions to their superiors, while at the same time they acknowledge that much work lies ahead.</p>
<p>“While the progress we have seen provides some comfort, we neither take it for granted nor are we under any illusions that our work is done,” Elizabeth Van Winkle, a psychologist and executive director of the Pentagon’s Office of Force Resiliency said. “In fact, we see this progress as cautionary and recognize that one of the greatest threats to progress is complacency.”</p>
<p>service member\'s children sexually abusing One Another?   WTH is that all about?   This sounds like they are going to pass off this increase of abuse on the children when in actuality it is the members themselves.  Granted there are probably those that have been abused by their fathers and others that were and are in the Armed Forces and could now be pedos themselves, but this sounds like BS To Me.</p>

            Little fucking late-military  bases are headquarters for MkUltra, sexual trafficking, etc. Michael Aquino was PROTECTED by the  military-that should say  it  all-we have an "INVASION OF THE  BODY  SNATCHERS" happening for decades  now

             Yeah, those pod people on the truck.  That's where Aquino came from.  The fact that he has been allowed to roam free on the base should scare the hell out of everyone.  Def a wake up call.

             They are good at pointing fingers at others when the truth usually is that the instigator is the person pointing fingers.  My grandfather told me that in his own language.  Why people don't understand that when it has been going on for centuries, I don't know.  Stupid People is what we now have.  No one can see the truth right in front of their face.  Yes, of course they are trying to push this on their own children.  Beyond Despicable.

            The senate, ordered the Pentagon to investigate themselves? The Pentagon directs the military. Are they legit now too, like the FBI? Is this supposed to make us think Trump is taking them on? More theater. I suppose some in here want to suggest Michael Aquino will soon be arrested and other Colonel's? More nonsense. The entire system is a possession of the Rothschild banking cartel. They don't take themselves down. Stop being excited by this theater. Agenda 21 is in progress while you do nothing and think they are in trouble. They are not, we are.

             I think you may possibly be on to something.  I don't know what to think anymore.  It's possibly all another Dog and Pony Show in the World of Kabuki Theater.  I am still holding on to hope, but my patience is wearing thin.  All I can say is that they certainly are good at fooling us, they have been doing it for decades.

            Recent figures obtained by the Associated Press have revealed the grim reality of child sex abuse as an epidemic among the US military.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the report, hundreds of children of US service members are abused each year, most of them being the children of enlisted service members.
           </p>
           <p>
            It should be noted that the full scale of the problem is unclear and remains shrouded in secrecy; according to the Department of Defense, which issued AP the shocking figures after a FOI request, "information that could unintentionally uniquely identify victims was withheld from release to eliminate possible 're-victimization' of the innocent."
           </p>
           <p>
            The AP’s findings so far show that between fiscal years 2010 and 2014, there were at least 1,584 substantiated cases of military dependents, or children of US service members, being sexually assaulted
           </p>
           <p>
            Enlisted US service-members were found to have abused children in 840 cases, while most of the enlisted service personnel involved were male. Most of the victims were said to have been female
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2015, US service members were reported to have abused children in 133 of 301 sex crime victims. The information suggests that child sex abusers make up the biggest group (or gang) currently held in military prisons
           </p>
           <p>
            The recent AP investigations show that many of these sex abuse crimes, including crimes against children are in some instances committed by soldiers in senior positions.
           </p>
           <p>
            The growing problem of child abuse and rape among the US army, and other forces is a direct symptom of the diet of de-humanization being force fed to soldiers sent to other countries to kill and rape entire nations, literally and figuratively.

             Oh there is plenty of that going on.  Also I believe there is filming of CP on some bases.  There was a case last year I believe in Colombia on a US Army Base were they were filming the raping of teen girls.  Beyond disgusting.

            But what they’re really doing is programming the kids on these military bases. I also believe the military fathers know about it and either consent or look the other way as they’re in too deep and there really is no way out, especially in black ops. There’s a lot of info on what really goes on inside these bases from ‘super soldiers’ telling their stories.

             I just responded to someone else about filming of CP on bases as well.  Yes I agree there is programming going on.  We have had people on here admit they know but cannot dox themselves due to already being targeted.  Totally agree that there are officers that know but are either powerless, or know they will end up on a slab.

           <p>
            I have been wondering what will happen within the cults in response to our exposure. As awareness spreads, and policies are implemented to protect kids, what will ritual abusers do? Consider that their belief system is built on doing evil in exchange for personal power. To advance and gain protection from their dark master, they must sacrifice something or commit a symbolically evil act.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember all of the witches in the street doing spells and crap last year, to get Trump impeached? How did that turn out? Their supernatural powers are waning. I imagine that they are scrambling, as individuals, to find fodder for their ritual sacrifices.
           </p>
           <p>
            This leads them to more and more desperate acts, risking exposure. I postúlate that this could be one explanation for a rise in statistical reports. I realize I hat this doesn’t exactly jibe with reports from living victims. Perhaps there is some aspect of SRA behavior that involves a living victim. I know they are involv d in depraved acts that victimize the innocent, but I have no knowledge of any ritualistic use for it. Is it unheard of for someone to abuse or torture a victim in the name of an evil power, but the victim remains alive, and perhaps unaware of the supernatural nature of the abuser?
           </p>
           <p>
            I know that’s a lot of speculation. The report here mentions an uptick in reported abuse. That’s not the first one I’ve seen saying that recently. I guess I’m just throwing stuff on the wall to see what sticks...

             Well throwing stuff on the wall is a good idea.  You also get to see what it looks like, while it is up there.  This causes many to come up with answers.  Now for the SRA Survivors, have you looked at my post on our SRA Survivor

              Right. That post is a perfect example of what I’m thinking. Fiona Barnett too. I should reread through their accounts and see if there is something that supports my point.

              People should always s be on the lookout and protect their kids. It could also mean that we are seeing signs of the lower ranks getting desperate and on the ropes. The next wave of life low hanging fruit.

               Ha.  Yes, and I have felt for quite some time they were going to hang their putrid perverted sex crimes on someone else.  They can't look in the mirror for the image is too ugly.

             Yes, the White -Washing is what they are so good at.  But really I think some are catching on to the normalizing and white washing.  Yes, they have allowed Aquino to skate under the radar.

            This is borderline unbelievable (nothing is 100% unbelievable anymore 😔).  How about we finish investigating the thousands of Pentagon employees that

             That was exactly what popped up in my mind too.  The Porn Problem at the Pentagon.  I think they are trying to get us to forget about that.  No Way Jose.  I completely agree.
