            Preface
           </h1>
           <p>
            The existence of "Operation Brownstone" and "Brownstone operations" is not yet officially recognized as operating procedures of the U.S. government. This topic is considered by many to be purely speculation as it is largely based on circumstantial and anecdotal evidence, but there have been many requests to address this particular topic here on this site. Some of the witness testimony from Jeffrey Epstein victim, Virginia Roberts, and the Palm Beach Police Department resembles such an operation. We will discuss what we know based on what few sources exist that seem to support that such operations indeed existed and have taken place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Operation Brownstone, also known as a "Brownstone operation," is a reference to a theory that intelligence agencies, such as the CIA and FBI, engage in utilizing underage individuals for prostitution purposes with high profile targets, for the purposes of being able to blackmail those high profile individuals later. Generally, the incidents are recorded via videotape and the underage victims are debriefed after the encounter.

            Origin of the term "Operation Brownstone"
           </h1>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Brownstone is a brown Triassic-Jurassic sandstone which was once a popular building material. The term is also used in the United States to refer to a townhouse clad in this material.

            In the late 1980's, Representative Barney Frank admitted that his former partner, Stephen Gobie, ran a prostitution ring out of his apartment, in the base of a brownstone in Washington, DC. However, Frank denied all knowledge of Gobie's activities and said he kicked Gobie out when he learned the truth.

            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            The speculative element is that Frank knew of the prostitution ring that ran out of his apartment and that the ring involved sex with minors, with recordings of the illicit activities to be used later for blackmail purposes. It is unclear what individual first used the term "Operation Brownstone" - perhaps former FBI Agent Ted Gunderson who spoke frequently on this scandal - but the term referred to these alleged blackmail operations that took place specifically at the brownstone which housed Frank's apartment.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Barney Frank scandal would be part of two other individual  but heavily interconnected scandals: The DC Call Boy Scandal and the Franklin Scandal.

            In 1989 a major scandal implicated high level government officials of the Bush and Regan administrations in a sex trafficking ring based in Washington D.C. Eventually, lobbyist Craig J. Spence would be pinned with most of the crimes, his life and career would be ruined and he would eventually be found dead of mysterious circumstances.

            <p>
             Spence entered a downward spiral in the wake of the Washington Times expos√©, increasingly involving himself with call boys and crack, and culminating in his July 31, 1989 arrest at the Barbizon Hotel on East 63rd St in Manhattan for criminal possession of a firearm and criminal possession of cocaine.
            </p>
            <p>
             Months after the scandal had died down, and a few weeks before Spence was found in a room of the Boston Ritz-Carlton Hotel, he was asked who had given him the "key" to the White House. Michael Hedges and Jerry Seper of The Washington Times reported that "Mr. Spence hinted the tours were arranged by 'top level' persons", including Donald Gregg, national security adviser to Vice President George H. W. Bush at the time the tours were given.
            </p>
            <p>
             When pressed to identify who it was who got him inside the White House, Spence asked "Who was it who got [long-term CIA operative] F√©lix Rodr√≠guez in to see Bush?", agreeing that he was alluding to Mr. Gregg.

            In the 1980s, banker/politician Lawrence King used the Omaha, Nebraska Franklin Credit Union as a cover for many criminal activities, including child trafficking and pimping to elite clients in Washington D.C. Children were prostituted at parties hosted by gay-pimp Republican lobbyist Craig Spence. Lawrence King's sex ring was allegeded to have been led by "a cult of devil worshipers involved in the mutilation, sacrifice and cannibalism of numerous children."
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations">
             (source)
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The credit union failed due to King‚Äôs embezzlement and a Nebraska State Senate investigation turned up massive evidence of large-scale child abuse, but the FBI shut down the investigation and two sham grand juries attacked the accusers. Several witnesses and an investigator were murdered or died mysteriously. Former CIA Director Bill Colby went on record stating the case had merit before dying in a ‚Äúcanoe accident‚Äù.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein, who had close ties to Bill Clinton and many of Clinton's associates, followed a similar pattern of entrapment with VIPs using minors. Epstein had video cameras setup in his Palm Beach home allegedly for the purpose of blackmailing important individuals after those individuals engaged in illicit activities with underage girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://archive.is/HkWom#selection-1271.0-1289.155">
             On October 9th, 2016, the New York Post reported:
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In a 2006 court filing, Palm Beach police noted that a search of Epstein‚Äôs home uncovered two hidden cameras. The Mirror reported that in 2015, a 6-year-old civil lawsuit filed by ‚ÄúJane Doe No. 3,‚Äù believed to be the now-married [Virginia Roberts] Giuffre, alleged that Epstein wired his mansion with hidden cameras, secretly recording orgies involving his prominent friends and underage girls. The ultimate purpose: blackmail, according to court papers.
            </p>
            <p>
             ‚ÄúJane Doe No. 3‚Äù also alleged that she had been forced to have sex with ‚Äúnumerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, a well-known prime minister, and other world leaders.‚Äù
            </p>
            <p>
             ‚ÄúWe uncovered a lot of details about the police investigation and a lot about the girls, what happened to them, the effect on their lives,‚Äù [author James] Patterson says.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Oddly, similar searches by police or other officials were never done in Epstein's other properties, which are located in New Mexico, New York, France, and the US Virgin Islands - particularly as Epstein's Palm Beach home was filled with incriminating evidence, including photos of his underage victims in the nude.
            <a href="http://archive.is/VYObQ">
             (source)
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It is also worth noting that Epstein has a dentist's chair in the Palm Beach home.
            <a href="http://archive.is/Kq5jb">
             (source)
            </a>
            While there is no definitive reason why, one could speculate that it allowed Epstein or others to install in his victims audio recording devices in their molars before they were presented to high profile targets. The existence of such audio devices has been known to the public since at least 2002.
