            Alexandra Tydings Luzzatto doesn't mention her baby Maeve Chaim Luzzatto in this article. It looks like James Alefantis in this picture looking over her and the baby. Luzzatto's are satanist and strong ties to the Podesta's and Alefantis.

            more on Alexandra Tydings "work" and "associates" Through the 4th Wall is based in DC... Jennifer Schwed &amp; Doug Bradshaw  own this company and Alexandra is one of the "stars" and works closely with them on other projects (more on that later) Tydings is also associated with another theatre company formerly know as
            <strong>
             Molotov
            </strong>
            and this theatre company has posted that** "Patrons would often be given ponchos to protect their clothing from splattered (fake) bodily fluids."**
           </p>
           <p>
            Patrons would often be given ponchos to protect their clothing from splattered (fake) bodily fluids??? gee that sounds fun. (not)
           </p>
           <p>
            The  producer of Molotov now is involved with a new theatre group in DC called
            <strong>
             SeeNoSun,
            </strong>
            a company that says its mission is to produce plays “that
            <strong>
             explore human monsters and the unspeakable acts they commit
            </strong>
            .” Alexandra Tyding is closely tied to these groups and "acts" in the associated (disgusting) "interactive" plays.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is Doug Bradshaws twitter page with a picture of himself and the infamous Alexandra Tyding Alexandra and Doug its header is: When the Internet lets you down, #DDoSAttack , why not immerse yourself in "Madness"? real nice.

             "TheShining is back in theaters. But before you see it, come meet our twins. They'll play with you. Forever... and ever. #PoeFactory"
            </strong>
            oh really? Alexandra is some kind of dark priestess.

            OK. So I found out ALOT more. Where to start... weird pieces and connections about Alexandra Tydings.
           </p>
           <p>
            First off. how about her role as the "Murderous Seraphim"
            <a href="https://twitter.com/alextydings/media">
             Twitter post referring to her role as the Murderous Seraph
            </a>
            in  a play called "A Dream Within a Dream"?
            <a href="http://poemadness.bpt.me/">
             Dream Within A Dream page
            </a>
            and here is the very weird "trailer" for this "interactive" living play.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://vimeo.com/102964848">
             Fucking Weird Trailer for Play
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now it gets even more strange. So the production company that produced this is called "Through the 4th Wall"
            <a href="http://throughthe4thwall.com/#">
             Through the 4th Wall website
            </a>
            And on this webpage you will find descriptions of what they do. I will let you peruse and deduce but basically they set up not just plays but real life fantasy scenarios for hire. Owned by Jennifer Schwed &amp; Doug Bradshaw. More on them in another post... clearly pedo/satanists.
            <a href="http://throughthe4thwall.com/#!/mission-statement/">
             Through the 4th Wall MIssion Statement (suspect doesnt even begin to cover it
            </a>
            but they say "Have you ever seen a visually stunning film, play or painting– or read a great book and thought, “I wish I could live in that world…” etc. They have some interesting government clients and on and on.. .
           </p>
           <p>
            So now back to Alexandra Tydings (Mother of the kids in the pool) she is clearly working with/for this strange "4th world" production company based in Alexandria Virginia (Need to go through these leads further) but I believe they create "alternate realities" for the elite as a "luxury brand" and she is clearly an asset or involved in some way. NOT the innocent mother of abused children IMO based upon reasearch into her twitters and social media AND who she follows and is followed by (I havent even TOUCHED her very devoted follower "Bless Queen Evil" on twitter. so many interlinking strands. This may seem small but she refers with glee to be playing "again" the "Murderous Seraph" now doing research on meanings here I could go deep but basically Seraphim are associated with Angels, and specifically Luciferian fallen angels or disciples of Satan. She loves it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Alexandra Tydings is in this thing deep but plays a very different role. I have much more but dont have time to post now. More later... the links and ties with all these people again tie into the Washington Post, CIA and the shadow slaves of the elite (once victims themselves I am certain) any thoughts here. At minimum I would like to open up the idea that this woman is one of them.

            1ew, this link seems to be a fake.  If you look at the archive of the facebook page, you will see "posts from 1994" and "posts from 1999".  FB wasn't around at that time.  It doesn't make sense to me that someone would fake a page for this.  The original poster of this thread is a very new member (as of today) and has already deleted other submission(s) of hers. Not sure what to think.

            I see some people saying that someone should contact her. Some are saying no way. Can we weigh the options? Please help some of us understand why she shouldn't be contacted. Or her husband for that matter. The article said she's not on social media much. What if she doesn't even know her kids are being abused? What if not saying anything, the kids continue getting hurt. I posted a little bit ago how this family has Rothschild friends and Tony Podesta on Facebook friends list! What about forwarding a infograph of it? I'm not doing it. Don't get attitude. I'm just curious.

            Anne Luzzatto was the first wife of Francis Luzzatto, before Tamera, so I would assume she is the biological grandma.
She is also a member of the elite CFR (Council on Foreign Relations). The CFR boasts many of richest and most powerful individuals in the US.
Other members include: Jeffrey Epstein, George Soros, Anthony Luzzatto Gardner

            I went to Anne Luzato's Facebook? Look at the image. On the bottom left, in her friends list, is Tony Podesta and a Rothschild.

            If she's not doing anything about her kids, it could very well be possible that she thinks it's normal and the same thing happened to her growing up. People who get abused can fall right into that lifestyle and do the same thing to other kids. It's like children who watch abuse growing up tend to be abusive when they become adults. It's well documented. If the grandma is pimping out her kids now, she was probably pimped out as a kid.

            Very strange wording in BIO.. Who wrote that? Makes sense for people who hate children.. Anything for a career?

            "Little Miss Perfect" hmmm. Something's missing? Barbie Doll? Nothing is "perfect" except when dead or lying.

            Sounds like they are trying to cover up an arranged marriage.. Who doesn't date their spouse before they marry?

            I know, it's hard to understand how anyone could do this sort of thing, it's unfathomable. It's easier to understand a meth head selling her daughter at a truck stop. But read a little about the children of God cult, well documented, irrefutable, prosecutions, they traded their kids like baseball cards, shipped them all over the world. Lots of parallels, lot of people involved, all around the world. The cult still exists, they've supposedly disavowed the pedarasty, but it was a central tenet.

             I went to Anne Luzato's Facebook. I don't really understand who she is but know she's related. Maybe the biological grandma? But look at the image. On the bottom left, in her friends list, is Tony Podesta and a Rothschild!

             This is how we end up with a society that takes out their cell phones and records people getting beaten instead of intervening.  We are taught not to intervene and to just report things. Then when it gets to the corrupt one in the chain it gets dropped/covered.

            That's fucking ODD. This is all so fucking ODD. A part of my brain desperately wants all of this stuff to just be "fake and imaginary" but then you look at it and it's just fucking impossible to "explain it away".

               exactly, and it gives them time to come up with a counter defense.  there is very little strategy to make the most impact that also involves letting the target know about your plan.
