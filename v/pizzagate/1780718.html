            To be honest, the user population here does tend to skew towards right-wing Evangelicals from what I've seen.

            I have to call out the lack of discernment of many posters taking this individuals story of being a victim at face value. Notice how these mods get in personal battles, delete legitimate threads under false pretense of rule violations that did not occur, and how they actually create threads and argue with people? I sure have noticed it.  You would think they would be neutral, moderaters, and promote well intentioned threads while deleting obvious disinfo and shill threads. And the name abortionburger probably is not the best name for a PG mod to begin with.

             Is it common knowledge that mods post submissions under different avatar names?   Here is Vindicator saying that is routine

            Understandable since these are really sick posts.
           </p>
           <p>
            That they contain personal threats to you is something that we are all now bearing witness to.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the way that the right wing comes to power, by threats, intimidation, violence.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's always been true and it's still true today.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, I really think any post which threatens anyone should be reported by the website to authorities.

             I don't know how any of you trip about some clown on the interwebs typing threats to you. That is typical disposable web threat nonsense. How can you live in terror from typing? Ever been in a chat room back in the day? Ever been in a forum before you came to this one? You are really scared for your life because somebody typed bold letter trash to you? Gotta admit, I can't relate to most of you. i have zero fear of typed threats over the net.

            Totally agree with you and think it's outrageous that any of those posts weren't removed.
They should all be removed and upon a warning, the posters should be removed.
If that had happened in this case with this offender/troll these kinds of sick posts wouldn't
now be increasing and the poster would be gone.

            <p>
             I'm a 25 year old married lady with a one year old daughter, her main activity is getting as covered in mud as possible and eating all the things. I like taking her to parks and Monkey Joe's, but I don't have too many other mom friends, and I'd like to make some! Any other toddler moms in the Winter Park area? 
oh, PS, she's fully vaccinated, I know parents who won't let their kids around non-vaccinated babies now that the anti-vaccine movement starting to gain momentum.

            <p>
             I just got a job teaching music to Autistic children. Now, I'm currently a violin teacher and I have some experience with Autism, but being a general music teacher is new territory. The school that hired me wants me to do a "demo class" on Monday with a group of about 10 high-functioning Autistic first-graders. What should I put in my lesson plan? I don't really know where to start, except maybe some rhythm... hand clapping, etc. Anyone who has experience with autistic children, please comment! I can use all the help I can get. Also, this is basically my dream job, so wish me luck!

              Baby James is a girl!
             </strong>
             I had a gender ultrasound two weeks ago and they told me with utmost certainty that the baby was a boy. I had just known it was going to be a girl, and was needless to say, very disappointed to hear the news. 
After two weeks of coming to terms with it, I was finally getting excited about him being a boy, when SURPRISE, IT'S A GIRL!
My 18 week ultrasound revealed that whatever it was that we saw on the 16 weeker was NOT a penis. 
I could just explode with joy! I was crying at the doctor's office, I don't know that I've ever had this much emotion inside me before!

            interesting timing i thought tho, for her today to say she's been doxxed... when everyone already knew all that info months ago.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            it is not right to say 'i've been doxxed' and 'my life has been threatened' when neither are true... especially wrong to do that on this sub, where personal safety is the most influential fear factor involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            stop pushing a fake fear narrative onto us.

             This says it all. I already knew our mods were subverted and working against us, I have experienced it myself. If you call the mods out, they ban you too. I had my first account banned for proving that my post were deleted under false pretenses, and banned for calling out the mods on it. Vindicator is terrible as are many of these mods. None can be trusted.

            Death threats? Such drama. This sounds like a David Seaman event. Either way, I wish we could dump all our mods, not just you, and personally chose new ones. Make this permanent please.

            I'm a perfect example of cyber identity. I've kept this username banner for far to long. But, I've never got in hot enough water to fear for my family. Should anyone try to research my cyber identity.... this name will take them through a lot of my life.

            It's the added inconvenience (a minor one, admittedly) of creating and verifying a new email address that is a derrent. Google requires phone number verification for new gmail accounts, many other serices do as well.  If certain domains become a problem, *@domain can be banned, just like IP ranges 1.1.1.0/24 blocks the entire subnet.
            <br/>
            However neither of those are effective against persistent or professional trolls who have a large number of proxies. The next steps are to maintain a dictionary of keywords and phrases for auto-flagging, heuristic analysis of voting patterns and lexographic analysis of the posts to detect sock puppet activity.

            AB, kinda a journey into fence riding. You will find this decision is a quantum one. It will attract, magnetize even dark to you as you have not made the connection of heart to integrity. It is a journey that can be made with choice. Choose what lives in your heart. Heart has a lot more neural connectors than the brain. True for us all. If you choose to be a silent partner, do not live in fear. Champions of the realm work for all that decide their true calling. We are our own champions. We work for all that recognize our worthiness. We are all worthy. Peace to you and yours. Fear not.

            Let's not forget this rather stunning reply AB recieved after messaging a "member" of the NYPD about the Weiner laptop -

            Good work getting this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone here should go through AB's submissions and save what they think is important before her account is gone.  (Assume that is fine with you AB?)

            It looks like AB was stalked - the stalker's name was similar to hers [B]  And on another thread, it was suggested that CTR was targeting opinion leaders.  Is this what may have happened here?

            AB, it's been an honor to serve with you and I am so bummed to see you go. I know how much your dog would love the taste of juicy keyboard-warrior shill, so I am not too worried about your IRL safety. Let's keep in touch, though. Keep givin' 'em hell in the research department; we'll keep making sure there is a place to publish it. ;-)

            It is also a good idea to drop subtle references that seem believable but are totally false.  Mention how your brother got red-pilled or your son's teacher is trying to leftist brainwash him.  Say that in the IT business you know how easy it is to dox someone.  Post in a city/country post and act like it is a place you have lived or want to visit but are not sure anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, you can go back and delete your posts.  As of tomorrow no one is going to read this post unless they want to dox me so I may as well delete it.

            no. i am not. pizzagate is a representation of a much larger issue with a powerful group of people, who you are currently defending. can you tell me why ? besides "pizzagate is stupid" ? i didnt think so. 25 grand if you can my friend :)

            Best wishes for your safety and peace of mind in your new incarnation wherever else it may be.  Thank you for being a vital force for the effort.  A total free speech forum is not a good host fit for this controversial topic, and this is exactly the reason why - because of what it attracts and allows.  Since the general rule here is no comment can ever be deleted, I'm glad you could at least remove these.  .

            I have been theatened twice. I know what pizzagate reveals its what we believe and so much more. I am sure some others will figure it out soon to. So of course they're getting desperate. They are watching they're goals dismantled. I pray we are closer to ending it..

            Just reading this and very sad and maddening. Although I personally feel if a Pedo is Catholic, Jewish, Atheist...i don't care, we need to call them out in the forum. But to personally attack another like this, especially AB who has put so much time and energy into PG is extremely disturbing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope AB can take a rest and come back.  Even if it's under a new name.  Thank you for everything you've done AB.
           </p>
           <p>
            And for everyone else, why don't we just FULL on ignore the shills. No down votes, no responses just a big echo chamber of ignoring them. Or maybe a few downvotes to just mark who they are?

             I think one of the worst things people can do is not use their downvote.  It is literally the only (feeble) weapon allowed and is supposed to cure all the ills of the shills.   Can't count the number if times a mod has basically said - it's the community's duty to downvote the shills that's how voat works.

              I can understand this but I feel like sometimes the shills want us to waste votes on downvotes so then we can't UP vote important threads. I feel like if we completely ignore them as if they weren't there (like the shadow banning we get in twitter) and don't add fuel to their fire, they don't get the platforms they want.

                Ok cool and thanks. I will down vote but will do everything in my power not to respond. Although it's hard to not cuss them out.  I've been using the phrase "21st Century Slaves of the Globalists" bcuz that's exactly what they are

            Wow... definitely file that report. The threats he is issuing, the IP address he is using, he threatened many of us (including me as well)... perhaps the investigation into him, his ability to doxx, the threats, etc... will expose a breadcrumb trail that uncovers who is paying this hate-filled shill.

              Technically speaking, it's publishing someone's address/phone number online making them vulnerable to threats. More broadly speaking, it is revealing someone's real life identity. Doxing other users is against Voat's User Agreement/TOS. Doxing those who are not users -- i.e. subjects of this investigation, is not, so long as it is publically available information.

            I'm going to take this as a hint that it would be a good idea to abandon this account and create a new one, just to keep the identifying information as diffuse as possible.  Of course I realize that such plebian tricks are no match for NSA spy tools.  Thanks for a great legacy AB and I'm grateful you're alive and well and hope you stay that way!

            Another  point-if  you are  going to do PIZZAGATE  research  you  should already  be  committed, everyone  knows  the  risk,  but  personally some  things  CANNOT BE  ALLOWED  TO  STAND  and the  rape  of children  is  one-if you are  not  willing to  deal  with this  you  shouldn't  start  in  the  first  place-you  have  my sympathy and respect for what  you  have  done,  no  judgement  here (personally)

            Your  first two lines ring of BULLSHIT FELLAH-this is exactly what the ZIONIST  JEWS  IN  POWER  WANT   is  to force  people  to be SCARED into outing these  culprits-the  Jews have a  history of this, infiltrating the  choke points  of  power, controlling news, art, finance, book publishing-they  did  this same trick in Germany which led to the  Germans despising these PARASITES-when the Germans  found  out after  WWI that the Jewish banking cartel made a  deal with the  English  to  use  their resources  and power  to  get the Americans  into  WWI the Germans, which  resulted  in  Germany's defeat,   who  had  previously given  the  Jews unheralded freedom  in  their  country (they  had  been  kicked  out  of  every European  nation in  the  last  2000 yrs) things  changed-it  will  soon  change  here in  the  USA-this is what LIBERALISM has done  to  the  USA-WAKE  UP  PEOPLE  and KNOW  WHO  YOUR ENEMIES ARE!

            Supposing you started banning mentioning of Jewish involvement in a pizzagate post would give the enemy an easy way to defend themselves from scrutiny, wouldn't it?
           </p>
           <p>
            You shouldn't be so quick to censor. I shouldn't have to point out to you that this could easily part of a 3 part plan to 1) Create a need for more moderation / censorship 2) Oust a mod trying to do the right thing 3) Replace them with a pedo who will fuck things up
They exploit your ideas about "The most parsimonious explanation" if you think it's just an unhinged individual and not part of the above plot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mods have a difficult line to walk, but its partially their fault if they get doxxed. They should know what they are getting into. They are of course going to be targeted with links trying to reveal who they are, people are going to search for social media posts related to them, reverse image on their profile pics, usernames, emails, any unique identifiers.

            , you have my highest respect. Not only for this decision - which must have been hard -, but most of all for your valuable work for the community. We are going to lose a highly dedicated mod. Hope to see you around and all the best! &lt;3

            Very happy about the fact you're still staying AB :) saw those jewburger posts myself and the incessant and unrelenting nature of them. Thinking about it now it's obviously a sign that you were doing too good of a job moderating.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you so much for the amount of time you've put into this forum. I've benefited IMMENSELY as an individual attempting to decipher all of the degeneracies our world has to offer and I'm sure we'll never be aware of how positively you impacted that process.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hopefully this is a reminder that we, as a community, need to do a better job of protecting the people who are attempting to protect the flow of information to us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also sorry about the negative implications of the situation. If you need any practical help just let me know.

            subverse so the rabid anti-Semites on here can boast to each other about "smashing in Jew's skulls" etc somewhere else. Pizzagate is a complicated can of worms, and they really don't sound too bright - so I for one won't miss their forensic skills.

            Still wondering why you people respond to shills in the first place. Wasting your time. Also ignore my username and if anyone would like to threaten me I have plenty to respond with. They use fear because they are cowards. End of story.

             Do you think there is any personal information he may have about you?  Is there a Roberta's near you?  Are you Jewish, have a "Norman and Kingsland" in your locality?  If you feel some of it is a bit close to home, that is concerning.  As I recall, he got into an escalating spat with AB [over what I don't recall] until he dox'd her and she [rather unwisely] seemed to confirm the dox.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course with the internet, a little research can find information about the neighbourhood from afar, so an apparent threat may not be just around the corner.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't confirm any hits, but a heads up that some people are being stalked would be helpful to know and then the techies can work out how it is being done.  Careless talk or spy info / acidfox / or a more highly organised shillfest may be the explanation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Presumably something you posted triggered the rather offensive responses.  You identified as Jewish, defended same or similar...
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps best to let it blow over rather than blow up.  What with this thread and the "How not to get your submission deleted" thread we've collectively lost a lot of digging time.

              It's a well-known pizza place. Something that would turn up with just a google search for "Hipster Pizza Brooklyn". He knows I'm in Brooklyn because I've mentioned it several times, but just mentioning Roberta's is something anyone with access to a search engine could do.

              I've been called a Jew, Cuck, Fag, Nigger, etc non-stop for the last 5 months or so, so... that's not much of a surprise. People just call you whatever they hate the most at the moment.

              This one is pretty hilarious... he claims he's "right up the street", but not only is it not even close to being on the same street it's over 2 miles away from Roberta's. This is the funny part: what's on the corner of Norman and Kingsland? Another pizza place. I'd put money on the fact that the dude is just looking up pizza places in Brooklyn.

            Thank you for all you've done for the sub, AB. I never thought this would happen to you when I invited you to join the team, and I'm really sorry you're having to go through this. Needless to say, we're losing a great mod here, but no community service should take priority over the safety of your own family. Be well.

              The problem is that Zionist threads also get deleted from what I've seen.  Even though FBIanon clearly mentioned in his first 4Chan AMA to watch out for Zionists...
             </p>
             <p>
              The other issue is that exposing Zionism will also expose its co-conspirators, the Evangelical Christian churches, in the process as well.  Which makes up a very large portion of the user base here, due to the crossover from Trump voters.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just look at any of the threads that even mention Protestant/Evangelicals on this forum in regards to Pedogate. nothing but crickets.  Bring up the Catholic Church/Vatican brings out the pitch forks/venom in a matter of minutes.
             </p>
             <p>
              I made a very good threat (IMHO) regarding the Protestant/Evangelical connection and it didn't even get 10 upvotes!
             </p>
             <p>
              While other threads about subjects that have already been rehashed/posted before gained popularity in a much quicker fashion.

              He denies it. But the obsessions match. He apparently has removed all the Jewburger comments in his PizzagateShills sub, once being called out. He has systemically attacked every major pizzagate researcher as well as mods and users who challenged his BS -- claiming we are "disinfo shills". Jewburger is the only user I've ever seen link to articles in his subverse.

               Yeah, I'm on the shill list. I found it amusing. He has me on the list with the mods for some reason too.  You are right that whenever someone links to ArmySeer they usually are him using sock-puppet accounts.  They also use really glowing language when talking about him.  I would bring that up to him and told him to stop autofellating himself.

               I thought he was mainly a harmless nuisance.  Son of a bitch proved me wrong.  I'm pissed at what was done to AB.

            This is not good. No one should be threatening anyone. Especially over something touted as "fake". The fact you are being harassed means something's going on beyond anything being alleged in this forum.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry you're being subjected to this, and you're right to put your safety and the safety of your family first. Yeah, absolutely don't engage in useless arguing that goes nowhere. Doesn't help anything other than waste time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks for moderating for this long. It's a tough job and I admire you for hanging in there.

             Indeed, quantokitty. If you look into what AB was doing before becoming a mod, you will see the likely cause of this harassment. Look back 3 months.

            Sorry for what you had to go through yesterday, that whole Kushner thread was a mess. Was shocked at what jewburger posted, such a gross invasion of your privacy. Hope to see you back on here soon in another shape or form, stay safe.

            I am going to copy-paste some of the abusive comments towards AB here, as I know many people will probably not look at them otherwise. This is abuse. Utter crap - we cannot accept this treatment towards mods that put up with enough shit every day as it is. They are investing their time towards this effort without pay. This commenter is making multiple accounts specifically to harrass her because she is not compromised. You KNOW who is on the right side when they get attacked in precisely this personal, low-blow way. People giving their time to this important effort for no money, do not deserve this abuse.

She peddles herself as a crisis actor on modelmayhem.com, the same agency the other crisis actors at Aurora were hired from. She used to be cute in her little panties there, but she's old now.

            Last night there was a post about how to lure and kill Jew pedos... It remained up for at least 2.5 hours last I checked. I agree the moderation needs to get serious about this very sudden anti Jew influx. Enough is enough.

             The mods are terrible IMO and I have told them as much. They have given 100% false excuses for deleting some of my post while they left obvious shill post up. Then they banned me for reposting while clearly showing the links that supported my assertions. They then used the excuse that I was spamming. Bottom line, they shut down every thread I had made making a case that Trump was not investigating this and was obviously part of the club. Tons of links supporting my case. This was before it was obvious to people now after the Syria attacks. Good riddance to any mod that wants to leave, and I wish we could chose our mods.

            You're concern trolling and tone policing right now. That's the actions of a splitter. That's more toxic than any shill.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wherever there is a demographic or corner of society that isn't allowed to be criticized, that's where pedos will hide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gays and Jews can take a bit of shit. They have before and they will again. They ain't made of glass.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you're worried about "how we look", you should probably go somewhere else. Because you'll only be impeding PG by running around telling people they're sounding like nazis or whateverthefuck stupid shit. And as you're already pushing for outright deletion of "unsavory sentiment", you've pretty much proved that you're a toxic influence.
           </p>
           <p>
            4chan has done the lion's share of digging and discovery on PG. Being a bit of a homophobe, or racist, or just an asshole doesn't impede the investigation, at all.

            Be careful AB, this is probably the best solution.  As a forum linger-er I'd like to suggest the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            To understand what kinds of monsters we are really dealing with we must have some knowledge of what it is we are trying to understand. 'Know your enemy' is the cliche'. So with regard to PG we are actually talking about a subset of a more general group.  In short we are dealing with the clinical psychopath and sociopath, in all of its manifest possibilties.  I'm confident that if we subjected the so called world leaders to the battery of tests to identify psycho-sociopathic characteristics we would probably find a large swath would not only test positive across the spectrum of degree but there would also be a lot of really high scores and probably plenty of clinical positives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keeping this in mind we always need to be on gaurd or vigilant. Please realize there are some insane things going on in society and for the 'normal' human being none of it makes sense because they are not clinical psycho-sociopaths, ie their brains are working for the most part. It is incumbent upon all of us to realize: 1) Our society is literally sociopathically structured and in a respect we're almost all afflicted to one degree or another. 2) Society is being ruled by psycho-sociopaths. This does go a long way to understanding the insanity of the world. 3) Though it is nearly impossible for a healthy human to undertand the psycho-sociopath it is possible to identify them as difficult as it is. 4) This infliction upon our species is independent of demograph. Clinical psycho-sociopaths are found equally in all populations. 5) Educate yourself and everyone you can, per the usual protocol. I suggest the following documentary as a good start!

            For a more indepth investigation into our divided brain I suggest looking into the work of Iain McGilchrist even though it is a broader context that doesnt directly deal with mental pathologies.

             polyb1123, yours is an excellent analysis. Can't upvote it because I'm new.

             Have you ever read about 'ponerology', the study of evil? I read of it on Laura Knight-Jaszick's SOTT website. Pedophilia has to be among the worst of evil sin/crimes. I've no mercy for the pedos.

            Voat's official stance is extremely anti-censorship so as long as the post doesn't break any of the rules, it must remain up. The thing you can do is make your own post with a better headline and downvoat the inflammatory one. If we come together against them, they won't win.

            You are going to be missed you must've exposed a real nerve. I remember some accounts even trying to pretend they were you. I hope jewburger is banned for doxxing. Will you make a police report? I am very disappointed that these sickos are so unrelentless and vicious. The poor children.

             Wow -- that should be fixed right away as there certainly should be a way to BAN the poster.
            </p>
            <p>
             This sick garbage is effecting the entire board -- no one wants to have to deal with these sick posts over and again.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hurry up with the IP ban because if this poster gets the idea that he can threaten and get his way, he'll continue on
with it.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's no place else on the internet where he could get away with these sick posts without being banned immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
             Voat:  PLEASE keep removing posts by this poster -- and permanently ban the poster.

             "jewburger" was probably an alt of your fiercest opponent armyseer who seems buddy buddy with Millennial_Falcon...possibly an alt account of his or former mod Phobos_Mothership.

             Banning trolls is critical to the success of voat.  Its a difficult problem, IP range banning might be the only practical solution. Also make the user register with a new email each time and lock the email permanently

            Nooo!  Sad &amp; Sorry to loose a good researcher and person.  Peace be with you and yours.

            P.S. how the hell is jewburger13 (nothing suspicious or occultist symbology in that nic [sarcasm]) not banned and still allowed on VOAT after this, much less all his Nazi anti-jew bashing posts?  Makes me question the VOAT TOS &amp; other Mods.

             Don't worry, md3, abortionburger is much more deadly to these fucks as a researcher than she was as a mod. Her research is what drew the ire in the first place.

You're one of the best. &amp; you will be missed. Would there be anyway you could contact someone in this forum just to let us know you're alive and well in the future?

            Wow!! This is horrible! I have a lot of respect for the mods here. You guy's are consistently having to ban user's and delete posts.  I amazed at how many user's you guy's have to ban when reading the banned user list. I get a real lol when reading your banned user reason

             Yes. Early on when I posted the Steemit article about the Alefantis victim, my credibility was being questioned and I thought I would prove that I was a real person by linking to my FB. Since my first name on FB is not my real name and my last name on there is my husband's last name (I didn't legally take it when we got married), I didn't think it would be tied back to my actual identity. It took him a couple months, but as of a few days ago, he has my full name, my location, my profession, and personal details. My reddit account of the same name is 7 years old and my post history was combed through to find out small details about my life. I found yesterday that someone has archived every single page of my comment history on archive.is.
            </p>
            <p>
             Live and learn, I guess. I won't be giving away personal details in the future.

              Live and learn is right.  You self-doxxed.  You'd be amazed what someone with pay-service for private investigation access to databases can put together.  smart idea.  I would conduct a security review and review of procedures and make some changes as needed including carrying and knowing how to use a handgun for self defense (this should have been done a while ago.  Competency takes time).  Also use your side,rear mirrors while driving and understand the basics of what a surveillance detection route is.  Good luck.  Thanks for courage.

               Blacksmith21, this is a fantastic comment. Is there any chance you could make a post about how to do a "security review", and hook people up to basic situational awareness know-how resources. I think we could all really benefit from this, given the topic we are reseaching and documenting and the power and resources of those involved. I for one do not believe it is a coincidence that AB was targeted after vetting and publishing the account of the Alefantis rape victim.

              God bless you, AB. I would have thought somebody with online experience to the extent you mention would have learned NEVER EVER TRUST A STRANGER online. Not even a 'nice' poster. You don't have to prove your integrity to anybody.

              I wish I weren't new. Then I could downvoat the jewburger creep. First post I made was to warn members about the antisemitic shills.

            I find this so very sad.  No one should have to be exposed, Member or Mod.  Yesterday I decided I will no longer respond or comment to shills. I am down voating them, and moving on.  We are prolonging their stay and engaging them in fruitless arguments that lead no where, except wasting our time. This is their purpose.  Keeping us from doing research is a win win for them.

             “And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.”

              You are right about that, but I got into a comment battle a while ago and I was chased for a while even when I stopped commenting.  I have been down voated because of it as well.

            Regrettable, but understandable. I think the extreme criticism of mods in general is unwarranted. It's a thankless job that can only be done imperfectly. If VOAT/pizzagate members used logic, they would realize that if there was a real concerted effort to conceal information, the actual deletion rate would greater than it is by at least an order of magnitude, and deletions would not even be allowed to remain in the deleted submissions folder.

             This. Backing down shows you're weak.  no offence OP but it's true.  Be alpha male and defend your homestead.  Don't let them scare you off... if it's worth fighting for,
             <em>
              if it's real
             </em>
             , you'll realize the scare tactics and stand your ground rather than backing away.

               Youre defiantly not being weak, you have a family to care about. A single person without many connections has more to work with, but its not right to being risk to people who arent involved in what you do. Good luck with things, I hope the people giving you death threats see how bad of a person they are being for promoting the rape of children.

               I'm sorry this happened to you. I seen that he knows your name and city and stuff. But, I didn't see that he threatened you or your family. Was that in a comment?
