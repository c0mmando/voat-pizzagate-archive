<p>Epstein was Cosmo\'s bachelor of the month in 1980 --the  &quot;New York Dynamo&quot; liked &quot;Cute Texas Girls&quot;</p>

<p>Back then he would talk to only millionaires.  
</p>
<p>But not for very long, when they too were just part of the hoi polloi as far as Epstein was concerned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Long before Jeffrey Epstein boasted of his billionaires-only client list—and long before his arrests for molesting underage girls in Florida and New York—the perverted financier was an eligible bachelor in the glossy pages of Cosmopolitan. </p>
<p>In July 1980, Epstein was featured as the magazine’s “Bachelor of the Month,” a tiny section advertising successful single men across the country. At the time, the future sex-offender was a Bear Stearns trader and asked potential dates to write him at the investment bank’s former headquarters in Lower Manhattan. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/when-jeffrey-epstein-was-cosmopolitan-bachelor-of-the-month">link</a></p>
<p>One month after Epstein’s Cosmo debut, Bear Stearns placed an ad in The Wall Street Journal naming employees who made limited partner, including Epstein. But the former Dalton teacher left the firm in 1981, sometime after he was accused of financial chicanery that allegedly involved lending a friend $20,000 to buy stock.</p>
<p>According to Vanity Fair\'s Vicky Ward, after his departure from Bear Stearns, Epstein had insisted that he exclusively managed money for billionaires, though his only known client was Limited Brands chairman and Victoria’s Secret mogul Leslie Wexner. “I was the only person crazy enough, or arrogant enough, or misplaced enough, to make my limit a billion dollars or more,” Epstein reportedly bragged.</p>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Epstein has been a familiar face to many at Harvard for years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Networking with the University’s leading intellectuals, Epstein has spurred research through both discussions with and dollars contributed to various faculty members.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lindsley Professor of Psychology Stephen M. Kosslyn, former Dean of the Faculty Henry A. Rosovsky and Frankfurter Professor of Law Alan M. Dershowitz are among Epstein’s bevy of eminent friends that includes princes, presidents and Nobel Prize winners.
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein is also well acquainted with University President Lawrence H. Summers. The two serve together on the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations, two elite international relations organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Epstein’s collection of high-profile friends also includes newly-recruited professor Martin A. Nowak, who will run Harvard’s mathematical biology and evolutionary dynamics program.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like Kosslyn, Rosovsky and Dershowitz, Nowak praises Epstein’s numerous relationships within the scientific community.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I am amazed by the connections he has in the scientific world,” Nowak says. “He knows an amazing number of scientists. He knows everyone you can imagine.”
