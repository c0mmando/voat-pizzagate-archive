<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this text I shall use the &quot;Fully Sourced Executive Summary of Pizzagate
Evidence&quot; artictle from the Pizzagate subverse in voat.co as my main frame of
reference.</p>

<h2>Verified Creepiness</h2>
<h3>Comet Pizza / James Alefantis</h3>
<p>James Alefantis and Comet Pizza
Taking a look at James Alefantis\'s Instagram, the type of &quot;art&quot; both live shows
and painted, which was exhibited in that &quot;Comet Pizza&quot; joint, on on top of that
the specific invitation on their poster &quot;for all ages&quot; prove to me this is a
sick perverted person with pretty clear hints for pedophilia tendencies.</p>
<p>I think that the use of the perverted/encrypted hashtags such as #chickenlovers
and #killroom etc. by him and his Instagram friends show they probably consume
prohibited sexual online content and refer to it in these graphical and textual
posts. I don\'t believe any of said posts are subvert commercial/trade posts of
prohibited child sex and child trafficking. I don\'t think it is a specific
advertising to a specific &quot;trade&quot; or exchange but simply a sharing of a sick
perverted opinions and content.</p>
<p>As for the Symbol itself with the crossed ping pong rackets, to me it is a
possible but not a clear match to the butterfly pedophilia logo.</p>
<h3>Tony Podesta</h3>
<p>Clearly he is another sick perverted person. He hangs in his living room so
called &quot;art&quot; which depicts abused children and youth, including clear suggestion
to disposed bodies of child and youth victims. That is basically pornographic
&quot;art&quot;, which probably excites child predators and deeply disgusts and disturbs
anybody who is not a psychopath or doesn\'t have pedophile tendencies. The
weirdness continues with this guy keeping teddy bears and other child toys in
display in his bedroom.</p>
<p>Just based on Tony (and apparently his wife\'s) taste for the arts I suspect this
is a deeply disturbed and dangerous individual which shouldn\'t be anywhere near
children.</p>
<p>From my understanding of the two Podestas it is mainly Tony who is buddy with fellow
perv James Alefantis. The Podesta Brothers friendly relation to confirmed child
sex predator Dennis Hastert also seems to run through Tony. It\'s Tony and Dennis
who were college friends and travelled together to Japan and admits to still
keeping in touch with Denny.</p>
<h2>Unverified Creepiness</h2>
<h3>John Podesta - The &quot;Clean&quot; Brother?</h3>
<p>With John Podesta I seem to lack direct evidence such as taste for the arts,
friendly/personal relations with known or suspected pedophiles other than his
brother. As far as I can see he has plausible deniability and nothing suspicious
that really sticks on him personally.</p>
<h2>Some Possibly Too Wild Inferences and Accusations</h2>
<h3>The Luzzatto Pool Party</h3>
<p>That &quot;suspicious&quot; message where Ms. Luzzatto is accused by some of &quot;offering her
children as entertainment to pedophiles&quot; had been itself or replies containing
it, circulated to at least 19 people (you can count yourself the addresses in
the TO and CC lines), emails domains which among private domains also public and
commercial ones such as .gov, .washpost.com</p>
<p>It would be insane to solicitate child sex, for your own family children, in
such a public and unsecured manner.</p>
<p>Reading the content itself, it seems completely innocent to me. There is no
code there. It is goes a little bit humoristic about describing the
entertainment factor of young children having fun in the pool, which hints it
could be a little bit annoying to the adults. It speaks about perfectly normal
and relevant details such as the weather and the pool being heated. No code,
it\'s a normal text about a family event.</p>
<pre><code>With enormous gratitude to Advance Man Extraordinaire Haber, I am popping up
again to share our excitement about the Reprise of Our Gang’s visit to the farm
in Lovettsville.    And I thought I’d share a couple more notes:   We plan to
heat the pool, so a swim is a possibility.    Bonnie will be Uber Service to
transport Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have
some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.   And with
the forecast showing prospects of some sun, and a cooler temp of lower 60s, I
suggest you bring sweaters of whatever attire will enable us to use our outdoor
table with a pergola overhead so we dine al fresco (and ideally not al-CHILLo).

           <p>
            They were released to implicate Podesta and his friends in this evil satanic pedo-ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is why they were given to Wikileaks. Doesn't matter who hacked them. They are real.
           </p>
           <p>
            Assange said they should lead to prison for Podesta and Hillary. They are evidentiary in nature.

            Expensive defense attorneys will say they are completely innocent nothing creepy about them.

            As he worked in a butchery he must have been desensitized to that stuff. Every hunter or butcher deals with gory stuff of that sort which would make most people who are not exposed to it discomfort and sick. But I haven't seen enough of that sort of evidence so far to make me see more to it.

            , can you please add the links to all the emails you've quoted here so that people can click through and verify your quotes are accurate and in context? Using the Executive Summary does not really satisfy the submission guidelines for evidence because you are not linking to specific support for each claim. It is too long to try to dig through. Also, it's not a primary source. I will leave this up for now so you have a chance to make ths a proper research post.
           </p>

             I will attempt to modify it to your satisfy. I downloaded the Podesta emails mbox file from wikileaks and used thunderbird to search for the relevant emails which have been mentioned in the main PG articles. The same process can be done online by searching the online podesta emails from wikileaks, and I believe then each email found can get its own link but please give me more time.

            As for the Luzzatto email... Further down the replies we see this comment from Drew Littman "Thanks for remembering me, as I was planning to use the farm as the backdrop to announce my candidacy for speaker of the house."
           </p>
           <p>
            This email was sent October 8, 2015 a mere 4 months AFTER our good pal Dennis Hastert (former Speaker of the House) was OFFICIALLY INDICTED BY THE FBI for his Pedo cover up.  This situational context CANNOT be overlooked when diving deep into this email exchange.

            )
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore, the same Drew Littman responds once again with "I've never had an affair, so I pass the Walter Jones test." Walter B. Jones has for 20 years been the U.S. Representative for North Carolina’s 3rd congressional district; in DC he’s regarded as the absurd caricature of a do-gooder, i.e. he is a noble man indeed. Again, CONTEXT IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Luzzatto Email is NOT INNOCENT.  She is offering her own flesh and blood as sexual entertainment and anyone that cant see that is misguided in their objective analysis of this piece of evidence.

             Your context is completely wrong.   It has ZERO to do with Dennis Hastert and everything to do with John Boehner, Kevin McCarthy and the fact that the Republicans could not get it together to pick a speaker.  Also it's a joke.  Why can nobody recognize a joke on this board.
            </p>
            <p>
             Context matters, huh?   What was the big news story on October 8th 2015?
            </p>
            <p>
             On September 25, 2015, Boehner announced that he would step down as Speaker and resign from Congress at the end of October 2015. Boehner's resignation took place after Pope Francis' address to Congress the day before, an event considered by Boehner personally as the highest point in his legislative career. Sources in his office indicated he was stepping aside in the face of increasing discord while trying to manage passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government. Conservative opposition to funding Planned Parenthood as part of the resolution, and stronger threats to Boehner's leadership on account of the controversy, prompted the abrupt announcement. Originally, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California had announced he would run for Speaker and was seen as the prohibitive favorite. On October 8, 2015, McCarthy abruptly announced he would not run for Speaker, citing that he felt he could not effectively lead a fractured Republican Caucus. After McCarthy's announcement, Boehner announced that would stay on as Speaker until a successor was chosen.

             <p>
              It's a stretch. The words and phrases are ambiguous. All the evidence is circumstantial and would never make it into a criminal trial or even get past a Grand Jury. However I think there is some bad shit going on in these circles. The Franklin Scandal is proof this has happened before. The Brownstone Ops we all learned about explain the motivation behind child trafficking.And I strongly believe all the Pedo code words in the emails were put there intentionally to trap investigators and paint them as unenlightened bigots.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem for them is a heck of a lot of us deplorables have gotten up to speed on these issues. I read a lot of military history. It gives great insights into how to win. Pizzagate is very similar to the Battle of Kasserine Pass in North Africa when the US Army got ripped a new ass hole by a battle hardened Afrika Corps. The US Army lost its first battle. It sucked. It was a massacre.
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kasserine_Pass">
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kasserine_Pass
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              But there are many battles in any war. The very next battle was the Battle of El Guettar where Patton used newly invented proximity fuzed artillery to eviscerate the Afrika Corp. Actually eviscerate doesn't quite explain it. Patton use proximity fuzes to liquefy the Afrika Corps.
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_El_Guettar">

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Battle of El Guettar was Patton's first victory and he won every battle after that. He went through the German army like shit through a goose. I strongly suspect the next battle in this current war will be the first of many victories for the Deplorable Horde Army. I can't wait. God hasn't lost a battle yet.

            Nice to see someone actually use critical reasoning and try to see how this would play out in the real world including the risks of being so "unsecured" as you put it.   In fact, if it was you or me, would you use that your regular email with your name on it to discuss this stuff at all?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why not use an anonymous email? So simple to create.  Why use something that identifies you as John Podesta?  Anytime a website wants me to sign up for something I still use my old AOL email named after one of the Dukes of Hazzard characters.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the the reaction to the Luzzatto email in particular is people just reading things with the most negative interpretation they could think of.  Whether or not that is the most plausible interpretation.  I don't think the raises any red flags whatsoever.  I think it's a grandmother making a corny joke about entertainment.

            All ages shows are a tradition in Washington DC for nearly almost 40 years, the venue, that started it in 1980, the 9:30 club is still one of DC's most popular rock clubs. Here's their policy.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Q: How old do you have to be to attend shows at 9:30?
A: Unless otherwise posted our club is All-Ages, All The Time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Q: My child wants to attend an all-ages show at 9:30, but I feel nervous?
A: We’ve been doing all-ages shows for many years, but the decision to let your son or daughter come to a show here is obviously up to you as a parent. We suggest attending a show with your child so you can get a first-hand experience of how we run the club and treat our patrons. We’re confident that once you’ve been here you’ll feel comfortable about allowing your child to come to 9:30 shows.
            </p>
            <p>
             Q: Do I need ID to enter the venue?
A: An ID is only required if you plan on drinking alcohol. Because we are an all-ages venue we take checking ID’s very seriously. In compliance with DC laws anyone 21 and older who plans on drinking alcohol will have to show a valid, non-expired, government issued photo ID, no matter how old you think you may look. Anyone without proper ID, regardless of age, will be treated as under 21 and not allowed to buy, hold or drink alcohol. This policy is strictly enforced and any violation will result in immediate ejection from the venue.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The tradition grew out of a frustration of having to be old enough to drink to go see a rock show or have your fans see your show.  Small bands who don't play big arenas mainly play bars where alcohol is the main source of profit. The rock scene in DC when it started was almost entirely underage, both bands and fans.  One of the bands that started this tradition were still in high school when they starting playing shows, so this meant their main audience...ie their friends couldn't go see them play live. The choice they faced was either everyone gets fake ID or they find a place that would let them play and let their friends in.   This same community later started a movement called "Straight Edge" kids who vowed to be straight, not take drugs or drink or even smoke cigarettes.  This was highly unusual since getting wasted was the focus of the scene before them.  The symbol the Straight Edge kids used is a big black X on their hands.  This was how clubs that sold alcohol indicated who was not allowed to drink.  If you had the big X on your hands, you couldn't buy beer.

            All Ages might sound odd to folks not aware of what it really means, but it has nothing to do with pedophilia.

             As for the Symbol itself with the crossed ping pong rackets, to me it is a possible but not a clear match to the butterfly pedophilia logo.

            This is actually an incredible common design element. You can find clip art that matches almost exactly to what Comet used.  In fact, if you google crossed paddles, the most common results are crossed oars, or kayak paddles as this is a very common symbol for Rowers or Crew teams.  You can find tattoos like this

             Thank you, it's very informative. I agree the Ping Pong logo itself seems an innocent symbol to a joint where people also play ping pong, and it is the crossed paddles is also the official table tennis logo. On the flip side I have seen enough of that Alefantis other stuff to suspect it could also mean to him more than that.

             What's really interesting is the "All ages" tradition in DC. So it's like the default option for some or most clubs and dines to be "for all ages all the time" and put it by default on their leaflets and ads? I think that in this case Comet Pizza took advantage of this practice by allowing stuff that doesn't seem appropriate for little children to take place in an "all-ages" event.

              Of course you would put all ages on the flyer, you're marketing to that audience.
             </p>
             <p>
              All ages shows almost never have little children at them, it college kids and some high schoolers.  They shows are still late at night.
             </p>
             <p>
              9:30 is all ages all the time.   Others may to it on a show by show basis.   Another reason to include that your advertising.

             Thanks mate. There is allot of confirmed evidence about criminal and corruption stuff regarding the Clintons. Regarding PG to me the evidence I have seen so far doesnt link very strongly to Clintons. What seems to have been uncovered so far is a bunch of connected sickos and it's necessary to uncover further who knows how many victims they abuse.

              Clintons not linked to PG??  By this comment I can only assume you have not yet looking into the Laura Silsby connection/arrests and also the EPIDEMIC of child trafficking that has plagued Haiti since the earthquake...Haiti,  a place that the Clinton Foundation has spent an awful lot of time and resources into "humanitarian efforts".... Giving the Clinton's the benefit of the doubt is absurd at this point.

           <p>
            It seems like an established fact that Pedophiles use that Cheese-Pizza code for
trading of "pizza-related" goods and services in the dark net. As a remark I
would like to though the question to whomever perhaps knows, whether a similar
code is used in the trade of other contraband goods and services? Could it be
that in other criminal circuit Pizza means drugs etc. ?
           </p>
           <p>
            But Now lets look at some further alleged use of said code in the Podesta
emails:

    I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them.

    Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.

    I miss you both

    Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

           </p>
           <p>
            It is somewhat weird. It could possibly be cryptic, but then whomever says so
should decipher it in a way that makes sense. Lets try to decipher it using the
supposed pizza code:
           </p>
           <p>
            'strategies' = gender, pasta = boys, sauce = ?, cheese = girls, box = maybe some
sort of delivery (physical or electronic?) of some merchandise (is it dead alive
or inanimate ?) and why does he says square shaped box (isn't a standard box
square shape by default?).
           </p>
           <p>
            And than the last sentence must either be an addendum to give the paragraph some
plausible normal (albeit creepy) content, or perhaps it is overloaded with more
cryptic meaning, for example, by "my children and grandchildren" he actually
means some of his pedo buddies, perhaps some of his groomed victims which he had
turned into monsters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moreover this message is sent from Herb Sandler to both John and Mary Podesta,
and we must assume that in this scenario the pizza-related handkerchief is also
pedo code, so that means that at the very list John and Mary Podesta and Herb
and Susan Sandler participate in the most heinous crimes, and that their realtor
from Marthas Vineyard is also in the know. Any of them could rat on all the
others and totally destroy them because at list in that 5 people layer there is
no sufficient insulation between them.
           </p>
           <p>
            So in this scenario if I were the realtor (Ms Tate) I would be extremely worried
for my safety as obviously I would be a strange fifth wheel that don't fit and
better get ridden off. Scary stuff...
           </p>
           <p>
            Now lets try to read it literally again, perhaps the content makes sense in the
plain meaning as well? So what do have here? It's Christmas 2015.  The Sandlers
like food. The Podestas love food. They are a rich hedonistic people that go
crazy after fine cheese and whine and maybe sin with junk food as well (and
isn't every human at some level obsessed with food?).
           </p>
           <p>
            The Podestas sent (quite possibly as holiday gift) to their Friends the Sandlers
a box of fine cheeses. Herb was surprised to discover cheese, he thought it
would be Pasta. As normally one person can't "demolish" a boxload of cheese
himself, he waits for his children and grand children to return from the holiday
vacation. Then they will play dominos with the grand children (which I assume
are kids), which is quite normal, and eat the cheese, which perhaps children
find less appetizing as, lets say... pasta?
           </p>
           <p>
            To sum it up- option 1 is this is code, which than must involve a pretty risky
circle of individuals of two married couples and at least one non-related
realtor and if we go further with the theories it must involve allot of others.
To chat about it even in code would be stupid not to mention that to take part
in such a club.
           </p>
           <p>
            option 2- there is no code, cheese means cheese, playing dominos means just
that. The phrasing is a little weird and naughty. Maybe it betrays forbidden
thoughts but it is very unlikely that it  refers to any specific criminal undertaking.

           <p>
            The Pizza-related message originates from a seemingly innocent message sent by
Kathryn Tate who is/was a working as a realtor for a
legit Marth Vineyard's real estate agency named Kendall and Kendall
(kendallmarthasvineyard.com), to Susan Sandler. It states:
           </p>
           <pre><code>Susan &amp; Herb

I just came from checking the Field house and I have a square cloth handkerchief
(white w/ black) that was left on the kitchen island.

Happy to send it via the mail if you let me know where I should send it.

I also meant to inquire yesterday about the pillows you purchased.  I can send
them as well, if you let me know where they are in the house.

Safe travels to all

Kate

            Bellow that message there are two quoted previous short exchanges between Tate
and Sandler. It appears that Tate had taken the Sandlers to view Houses in Marthas
Vineyard. Here is the entire text of orginal message:
           </p>
           <pre><code>Hi John,

The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related.
Is it yorus?  They can send it if you want.  I know you’re busy, so feel free
not to respond if it’s not yours or you don’t want it.

Here are links to the houses we drove by today located in Vineyard Haven.

1 House at the end of the road to Lake Tashmoo at Kuffie's Point

http://kendallmarthasvineyard.com/vacation-rentals/vineyard-haven/marthas-vineyard-vacation-rental.php?id=29

 

2. House along side Owen Park( the last one we drove to)  Patty has never had anyone complain about noise from the town wharf or parking area.

However, the VH Band does play on Sunday evenings inside the bandstand at the top of the street.  It's on 3 floors.

3. House across from the VH Yacht Club, which I feel the ceilings are too low for you and Steve, but Patty asked me to send along.

Here are links to the 3 houses in Chilmark

Thanks for all piling into the car.  It definitely was more fun with everyone

we were in two cars.

            So what do we have here? It seems that the Podestas and the Sandlers stayed at a
rented house in Marthas Vineyard, which is pretty normal for rich American
spoiled elite. These houses or estates have names, because again we are talking
about exclusive property of the reach spoiled american elitists. They seemed
have been renting "The Field house" notice the capital 'F' in the original
message, perhaps it is this property, "Aquinnah Field House": 
(link:
            <a href="http://beachcombersmv.com/marthas-vineyard-vacation-rental/marthas-vineyard-vacation-rental.php?id=87&amp;nav=back">
             http://beachcombersmv.com/marthas-vineyard-vacation-rental/marthas-vineyard-vacation-rental.php?id=87&amp;nav=back)
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            As of now it seems to be listed by a different agency. Anyway I
don't find anything that seems like a code in the text sent from the realtor.
The Field house is just a rented real estate, the pillows are just pillows, the
handkerchief is just a handkerchief.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the email from Susan Sandler to John Podesta in which she says:
            <code>
             The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems
pizza-related.  Is it yorus?
            </code>
            the formulation seems very strange and indeed
cryptic. My conclusion is she probably refers to something, I would suspect some
experience that the Podestas and Sandlers shared during that vacation. But we
don't know what if any. And for it to be anything sinister, the realtor would
also be in on it. So she would have to be a legitimate realtor working in a
legit agency, who rents properties of other people, her rich clients, to sick
murderous pedophile couples. That a pretty big professional and personal risk to
take, it involves to many people and to take part in it would be very risky and
irrational.
