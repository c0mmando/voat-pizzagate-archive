<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has criticized Conservative Party Leader Andrew Scheer over his response to a man who invoked the “Pizzagate” conspiracy theory while asking a question at a town hall in Kitchener, Ont. on Thursday.</p>
<p>Scheer has countered by saying Trudeau’s criticism shows the prime minister is “desperate to try to change the channel from his own corruption scandal.”</p>
<p>The controversy arose after a man at Scheer’s town hall touched on the debunked Pizzagate theory over the course of a rambling two-minute question in which he criticized the Trudeau government’s decision to donate money to organizations like the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>Pizzagate is an unfounded conspiracy theory that claims Democrats in the U.S. harbour child sex slaves at a Washington, D.C., pizza restaurant. The rumour prompted a gunman to fire an assault weapon inside the restaurant in 2016.</p>

<p>“The Clinton Foundation is part of child trafficking and child sacrifice if you study it. It is in the Pizzagate,” the town hall attendee said to applause from the crowd. “How do we get that money back?”</p>
<p>Scheer responded by expressing concern about Trudeau using money from Canadian taxpayers towards “his own personal projects,” stating that the Clinton Foundation was just one of many examples of groups that received money from Trudeau’s government to promote “their own particular ideology.”</p>

<p>Canada donated $20 million to the Clinton Health Access Initiative in 2017. The money is to go towards helping young women in Nigeria with family planning.</p>
<p>On Friday, Scheer said that he didn’t correct the man on his Pizzagate reference because he didn’t hear it.</p>
<p>“I heard the question was related to the government’s — Justin Trudeau’s — decision to give a grant to the Clinton Foundation. That is what I answered,” Scheer said Friday in Rosser, Man.</p>
<p>“I didn’t hear anything about the other aspect.”</p>

            Oh good!! Damn, yeah!! Trudeau is bankrupting Canada while also working for the globalist banksters. More debt the better. Also allowing mass immigration of Muslims( some connected to ISIS)  causes regular hard working Canadians to hate the muslims coming in but this is just a ploy to cause chaos and hatred.The muslims are not our enemies(at least most aren't) but they come over and get sometimes as much as 4800.00 a month while  we now have a homeless problem with the elderly and benefits for these people are drying up. Divide and conquer and Trudeau is simply a new world order sock puppet

            Today Scheer wussed out and said in an interview today that he didn't know what pizzagate was and that he didn't follow American politics. It doesn't give him any brownie points if he's that incurious about the world, especially Canada's closest neighbor.  He reminds me of a weasel anyhow, the only thing he's got going for him is he's running against Trudeau.

              Keep stoking the phony left vs right paradigm and selling Trump as a savior. Tucker works for CIA controlled news. You are not red pilled. He also loves Comet Ping Pong and is a regular.

               So what? That doesn't change the fact that most people on the right are decent people who believe in God and have honest jobs, and believe in the sound principles that created the Constitution, and the Left basically a collection of anything other than that. Of course the undermining of the original Constitutional government was designed over decades of secret societies' influence.

               Tucker Carlson doesn't give off any alarm bells that I've seen. We are all pawns in this enormous machine, most of us unknowing and I'm sure that's the case for him as well. The powers that should not be want to drive secularism to the point of destroying morality and creating a crisis, leading to the "antichrist" power to offer the solution: Luciferianism (or something based on it)

             Of course, he was brought up in a privileged family whose father was a complete sellout to the "elite" (who I prefer to call depraved turkey vultures).  Trudy has the look of MK in his eyes and cannot speak without being told what to say, just like all the rest of the politicians.

              Yes yes yes. A friend in Montreal tells me that both him and his brother were ritually abused and this woman knew of one of the handlers. Yes, this is real. The look in his eyes, just like so many in Hollywood and in D.C. As my Dad used to say, "the lights are on but no one's home".

                Exactly! That skiing incident where his brother dies. Someone selected Justin as the more malleable boy. Maybe he took to programming more than his brother. I ahve seen this in my own family unfortunately
