<blockquote>
<p>The Templeton Prize is an annual award granted to a living person, in the estimation of the judges, &quot;whose exemplary achievements advance Sir John Templeton\'s philanthropic vision: harnessing the power of the sciences to explore the deepest questions of the universe and humankind’s place and purpose within it.&quot; It was established, funded and administered by John Templeton starting in 1972. <strong>It is now co-funded by the Templeton philanthropies, and administered by the John Templeton Foundation</strong></p>
<p>The prize was originally awarded to people working in the field of religion <strong>(Mother Teresa was the first winner)</strong>, but in the 1980s the scope broadened to include people working at the intersection of science and religion.[2] Until 2001, the name of the prize was &quot;Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion&quot;, and from 2002 to 2008 it was called the &quot;Templeton Prize for Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities&quot;</p>
<p>The prize has been referred to as prestigious[9] and coveted,[10] with The Washington Post calling it the most prestigious award in religion</p>
<p>It has typically been presented by <strong>Prince Philip in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.</strong></p>

            IS THE UN TRYING TO LEGALIZE PROSTITUTION WORLDWIDE? -

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In a September 20 appeal to the UN leadership[ii], the New York-based women’s rights organization Equality Now expressed concern about the recommendations contained in the Global Commission on HIV and the Law’s report HIV and the Law: Risks, Rights and Health (2012), published by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the report Sex Work and the Law in Asia and the Pacific (2012), backed by the UNDP, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)...
            </p>
            <p>
             In these two reports, Equality Now wrote, the UN agencies tell Member States that “in order to support efforts to reduce HIV/AIDS and to promote the human rights of people in prostitution, all aspects of the commercial sex industry should be decriminalized, including pimping, brothel-keeping and the purchase of sex”.
            </p>
            <p>
             Besides the letter of the law, evidence on the ground, too, does not seem to support the UN agencies’ claims....
            </p>
            <p>
             Ironically, in a report issued in September, UNDP, UNFPA, UN Women and UN Volunteers actually established a direct link between rape perpetration and the purchase of commercial sex, noting that both stem from gender inequality. So why are UNDP and UNFPA now advocating the decriminalization of prostitution – and accordingly the inherent decriminalization of rape?

              The United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed the Decade 2013-2022 as the International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures building on the efforts of the UNESCO General Conference which had called for « the development of a universal global consciousness » based on « dialogue and cooperation in a climate of trust and mutual understanding » and for a « new humanism for the twenty-first century. »

               Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888—1975)
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was born into a middle class Brahman family in south India near Madras.
              </strong>
              His family valued education, and he attended Christian-sponsored secondary schools and did his higher education at Madras Christian College. During his education he came to study classical Greek and Western thought, especially Plato, Aristotle and came to know Christian religious views. He was confronted with Western teachers who held a low opinion of the Hinduism they saw around them but who were active in promoting Christian social action, especially in the fields of health, education and poverty reduction.
              <strong>
               Madras was also the headquarters of the world-wide Theosophical Society
              </strong>
              which agreed with the Christians that Hinduism was asleep but who felt that it could be awakened from within by its deeper values and did not have to copy the West.
              <strong>
               This was the avenue which Radhakrishnan followed
              </strong>
              , a recognition of the stagnant state of much of Indian religious thought and practice but a confidence that the answer lay in a revitalization of the best of Indian thought such as the Upanisads and the Bhagavad Gita.

Instead of trying to improve their care, Tenet healthcare paid Florida Governor Rick Scott $200,000 in campaign contributions and Scott then repealed all of Florida's pediatric heart surgery standards. ..Since Tenet Healthcare may be illegally harvesting organs it stands to reason that removing these heart surgery standards would only make their job even easier by removing even a pretense of responsibility...

             I did some more digging into DynCorp and the affiliates of RTI Surgical. One of the things I had learned before was DynCorp likes to have their Florida locations next to places where they can drop off bones and organs. I had first noticed this trend that there was a RTI Donor Services location very close by DynCorp in Melbourne, Florida.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another big find. In West Palm Beach Florida, Bioflorida which encompasses such businesses as RTI Surgical and Tavistock (type in Palm Beach in the ctrl-f to find on the page) is located at the zip code 33401 with Dyncorp located at 33404.

             A children's book-writing parish councillor was shot in the head near his cottage in a leafy Hampshire village yesterday, before the gunman leapt on a motorbike and crashed and died while fleeing from police. James Nash, 42, suffered serious head injuries after the shooting at his picturesque home, called Holly Tree Cottage, on MacCallum Road in Upper Enham.
            </p>
            <p>
             A woman, 40, was also assaulted at the scene and suffered minor injuries. Her identity is unclear but Mr Nash lives with his wife Dr Sarah Nash, a top scientist who works at a laboratory that builds space equipment.

              Intelligence-run mind control operations are usually a multi-generational thing with each generation more easily programmed, as the genetic memory of the horrific medical procedures become more ingrained into the family’s genetic makeup.
              <strong>
               In the 1950’s, a genetic bloodline study was started by the NSA based at Harwell Laboratories to find suitable candidates, especially children, to be used in Project Mannequin.

           <p>
            Supplication, prayer or spell.

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...An invocation can also be a secular alternative to a prayer. On August 30, 2012, Dan Nerren, a member of the Humanist Association of Tulsa, delivered a secular invocation to open a meeting of the City Council of Tulsa.[3] Nerren was invited to perform the invocation as a compromise following a long-running dispute with the City Council over prayers opening meetings. The invocation was written by Andrew Lovley, a member of the Southern Maine Association of Secular Humanists who had previously used the invocation in 2009 to invoke an inauguration ceremony for new city officials in South Portland, Maine
            </p>
            <p>
             In some religious traditions including Paganism, Shamanism and Wicca, "invocation" means to draw a spirit or Spirit force into one's own body and is differentiated from "evocation", which involves asking a spirit or force to become present at a given location. Again, Aleister Crowley states that
             <em>
              To "invoke" is to "call in", just as to "evoke" is to "call forth". This is the essential difference between the two branches of Magick. In invocation, the macrocosm floods the consciousness. In evocation, the magician, having become the macrocosm, creates a microcosm.
             </em>

              The blurb: This classic book, first published in 1978, shows some of the beginnings of the spiritual work of David Spangler while co-director of the Findhorn Community and shortly thereafter. It contains a new preface and one new chapter written in 2012.

              - Utter garbage...Consider this quote by Spangler. Endorsed by the UN, no less:..
              <em>
               "Lucifer comes to give to us the final gift of wholeness. If we accept it, then he is free and we are free. This is the Luciferic initiation. It is one that many people now, and in the days ahead, will be facing, for it is an initiation into the New Age . . . No one will enter the New﻿ World Order unless he﻿ or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer. No one will enter the New Age unless they will take a Luciferian initiation." (Quoted from "Reflections on the Christ," 1978 ed., Chapter IV, pgs 44-45)

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              After aiding the CIA in turning Greece into an American Vassal state, AHEPA began publicly lobbying for "reform" of US immigration and adoption law... details exactly how the adoption system was "reformed" which actually means codifying legal kidnapping...
             </p>
             <p>
              .This loyalty to US and Greek nationalist interests made AHEPA a favorite of the State Department, who designated the order as “an arm of the government of the United States in administering the resettlement of 10,000 Greek refugees.” Much of AHEPA’s lobbying work embraced the anti-communist language so popular during the early Cold War. When presenting an appeal for the 1953 Refugee Relief Act, AHEPA…The administration also linked AHEPA’s work to the preservation of democracy because of American democracy’s roots in ancient Greece. This magnified AHEPA’s relief work in a war-torn country as a larger Cold War fight for the representative government and free-market capitalism.

            A Complex, Brighter Horizon by  Philip Clayton

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             IN JUNE 1998, when 23 Jewish, Christian, and Muslim scientists gathered at the University of California, Berkeley, to talk on the topic "Science and the Spiritual Quest," the conference garnered 100 million media impressions, including the cover of Newsweek. Today, almost nine years later, the mere existence of science and religion dialogue is no longer newsworthy...
            </p>
            <p>
             The most rapid, and perhaps the most significant, changes are now taking place outside the United States. They are arising as other religious traditions begin to study the history of their own interactions with science and to formulate their own, often very different, agendas for the future. Three collections, all published within the last six months (two of them, interestingly, by the much-maligned Templeton Foundation), signal the new trends; together, they begin to put a face on the future of the dialogue in an era when American and Christian interests are no longer dominant...
            </p>
            <p>
             Michael Heller notes in Science and the Search for Meaning that the really interesting intersections between science and religion are the domain of existence,
             <strong>
              the domain of ultimate rationality,
             </strong>
             and the domain of meaning and value.

             Remember during Bush the Lesser's reign of terror......Valerie Plame had been outed .....Judith Miller, NY Times reporter had been jailed. It was in the news that Libby sent Miller a note saying the roots of the aspen trees in Colorado are deep. I thought at the time it seemed like a coded message. Even more so now........Aspen Institute?
