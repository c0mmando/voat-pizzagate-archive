<h1>The dam is about to break</h1>
<p>Church Militant has learned exclusively that the attorney general office of the state of New York is now outlining plans for a Pennsylvania-style grand jury report.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, it was just announced that the publisher of Cdl. Donald Wuerl\'s upcoming book has yanked the deal, canceling publication. The book had been titled What Do You Want to Know? and was described as Cdl. Wuerl\'s advice to everyday Catholics when inviting non-Catholics to friendship.</p>
<p>There are eight dioceses in the state of New York, including the archdiocese of New York, with 7.3 million Catholics throughout the state and initial reports indicate that sexual abuse and specifically cover-up of that abuse by bishops is every bit as bad as in the state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Church Militant spoke with New York State Attorney General Barbara Underwood, who told us:</p>
<p>The Attorney General has directed her Criminal Division leadership to reach out to local District Attorneys — who are the only entities that currently have the power to convene a grand jury to investigate these matters — in order to establish a potential partnership on this issue.</p>
<p>In the wake of the release of the Pennsylvania grand jury report, speculation around the country has begun that grand juries should be convened in every state — an idea that fed-up faithful Catholics are now supporting publicly.</p>
<p>Brad Miner: &quot;I\'m in favor, frankly, of 50 grand juries, including, you know, we\'ve already had one in Pennsylvania, but we need one in the District of Columbia too — so that makes 50. Every single state, we got to do this, and it\'s got to be the civil authorities, I\'m sorry to say.&quot;</p>
<p>Joining Miner are the likes of Illinois State Supreme Court Justice Anne Burke, who was a member of the 2002 U.S. bishops\' national review board. Burke says, &quot;I think every state should convene a grand jury into this culture of secrecy that protected offenders at all costs.&quot;</p>
<p>Miner\'s and Burke\'s public sentiments may soon become a reality. In addition to the Pennsylvania grand jury, Nebraska is now sending signals that it too is prepping for the possible convening of its own grand jury. This as a result of revelations of homosexual predation on seminarians in the diocese of Lincoln.</p>
<p>But the eight Catholic dioceses in New York could prove to be a target-rich environment for any grand jury investigation.</p>

            Thank you,

             @Vindicator
            </a>
            , for posting this stunning article. Sounds like the chickens are coming home to roost in NY where the art of cover-up has been perfected. I have a feeling it might be worse there than anywhere else, because of the confluence of dioceses and huge metropolitan areas. The seminaries are of particular interest: Immaculate Conception in Douglaston which had to be shut down temporarily because of an epidemic of STD's, and Immaculate Conception in Huntington, also the target of many rumors and allegations. There is, from stories I've heard for years, a large Lavender Mafia network in NY which has had a strangle hold on the area for decades. Bishop Murphy of the DRVC, and Cardinal Dolan, I suspect, were both selected for their Irish ability to cover up and obfuscate and are iron fists in velvet gloves, ruthlessly squashing all whistle blowers and non-team players.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand the new bishop of Rockville Centre Diocese, Bishop Barres, is thought to be a good man, who spends many hours in prayer and who has tried to reform the catechetical programs in the schools, etc., but his failure to remove Benestad is inexcusable. Apparently, the Vatican cleared Benestad, despite a Pennsylvania DA finding the victim's allegations to be credible, and a local Review Board, made up of lay experts, also cleared Benestad, so Bishop Barres  lifted the ban he had placed on Benestad and allowed him to retire and move to Florida. Bishop Barres also failed to remove another priest, Fr. Lawrence, from the priesthood, despite the priest's confession of wrongdoing, and kept him in a "secure" and "monitored" facility, allegedly because he thought it would be safer for the public to keep him there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not a good outlook for Bishop Barres, and the Rockville Centre's whitewash job
            <a href="https://drvc.org/">
             on their websit
            </a>
            e is nauseating. The press spokesman, Sean Dolan, even made an attempt to deflect attention from Bishop Barres' troubles by a despicable red herring, bringing up the point that "there are survivors of abuse elsewhere in society":
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Bishop Barres has spent many years talking to and counselling the survivors of abuse (including the survivors of abuse elsewhere in society, who should not be forgotten). He is well aware of how devastating such abuse can be to survivors and their families."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It's very telling that Sean Dolan's press statement does not mention the case of Msgr. Benestad at all, focusing instead on Fr. Lawrence. The PA press conference specifically highlighted the case of Msgr. Benestad and the story of his abuse was so shocking and appalling, that failing to address Bishop Barres' involvement in that case on the DRVC website is a glaring omission. Why doesn't Sean Dolan mention the Benestad case and try to whitewash it in the same way the Fr. Lawrence case was?
           </p>
           <p>
            Very interesting, and it doesn't look promising for Bishop Barres at all.

            I don't understand why these gay men would spend years studying to become a priest.  If you want to be gay and have a lot of sex, go ahead and do it. You don't have to envenom and infect a religion.
           </p>
           <p>
            These child rapists like Cunningham are still in power. They are arrogant in the extreme. Nobody wants them there. Everyone knows about the abuse. And yet they refuse to leave their perch because of the all the perks offered by the Catholic Church.  I hope they burn in hell.

            Where is Gilderoy? His 6 mo old post on Catholic priest corruption mentioned the ties the Benestads had with Vatican money
The Rev. Thomas J. Benestad, director of the Papal Foundation, Philadelphia, was recently named an honorary prelate of his holiness with the title of monsignor. A charter member of the Diocesan Finance Committee, Benestad was released by Bishop Thomas J. Welsh and appointed to the Papal Foundation by Cardinal John Krol in 1988.

            Time to turn the hounds loose!
           </p>
           <p>
            Father Enrique Rueda was suspended from priestly duties by NY Bishop Clark because he spoke out against the pervasive homosexual influence in the Church and wrote the 1981 book : The Homosexual Network: Private Lives and Public Policy that detailed what was going on in the Church:
           </p>
           <p>
            Following ordination, he served as a Catholic chaplain at NYU and to migrant farm workers in Upstate New York (Orange County), as well as a parish priest in the South Bronx.  While incardinated in the Diocese of Rochester, he directed a drug counseling and education center and was given pastoral responsibility for the Hispanic Community there during what he would call “the happiest days of his life.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Father Rueda was the organizer and first director of the Catholic Center at the Free Congress Foundation in Washington, D.C., where he worked as a senior contributing scholar. He authored several books including The Marxist Character of Liberation Theology, Roman Catholicism and American Capitalism: Friends or Foes, and The Morality of Political Action.  But it was after publishing The Homosexual Network: Private Lives &amp; Public Policy in 1982 when he garnered the most notoriety as well as acclaim.

             In 2015, after Bp. Cunningham became head of Syracuse, a group of outraged Catholics petitioned Rome to force Cunningham to resign because of his callous attitude towards sex abuse victims.

              It became public that Cunningham had said during a 2011 sex abuse deposition, when asked whether he thought boys being raped by priests were sinning, Cunningham answered, "The boy is culpable."
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             His words caused such uproar that nearly 90,000 signed a petition to Pope Francis, urging him to remove the bishop from the diocese.
             <strong>
              Cunningham never resigned and remains the bishop of Syracuse to this day
             </strong>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I can't believe it.
           </p>
           <p>
            So Pope Francis decided that a bishop who said the victims are the perps could stay a bishop. Noted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now of course it makes sense why he initially claimed the survivors of clerical abuse in Chile were not trustworthy when they complained about clergy involved in a cover-up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Smh in disbelief.

             The Church won't stand for it. It takes time, but Catholics will root this shit out from the inside. It's been many people's sworn life work for a while now. You are starting to see the results. Voris is only one example.

              I hope so. As you know, I think that Benedict XVII and Pope John Paul II were as bad as Francis when it comes to sovering up sexual abuse. So I'm sceptical about any new Pope who might get elected after Francis will have died or retired.

             Word up. Day of the rope can't come soon enough. I have spent over twenty years working on this and my emotions are fried. I need a break from this shit but it has become ingrained into my soul to keep working on it. I need to buy some toys and get away from this shit but I can't stop looking and participating. The desire to help can become a pathological situation. I want to look away and be a happier person but I would not be happy if I didn't help. Its a paradox and a swamp. Thank you for what you do.

             If D.C. participates, that will be 50 grand juries.
            </p>
            <p>
             The main rub here is the fact that local DAs must be on board:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Attorney General has directed her Criminal Division leadership to reach out to local District Attorneys — who are the only entities that currently have the power to convene a grand jury to investigate these matters — in order to establish a potential partnership on this issue.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Many are compromised, without doubt.  The only hope is that public outcry and peer pressure will carry the day in those cases.  I foresee a slew of DA real or fake suicides and "heart attacks."

              50 grand juries with committed resources bringing the same level-of-effort as PA and their 900 page (2 year) investigation against the sodomites would indeed deal a major death blow to other special-interest criminal gangs (rogue intel, poltico's, govcons, power players, bankers, middle-men ect) operating in the shadow's. Make no mistake DAs would be compromised, especially it a system were set up to protect victim's. We've seen in all of these major instances from Franklin, to Dutroux the cover up, disinfo, and usurping of victim's credibility..."a thousand ways to Sunday". I think JEM had it right. An approach to source living victim's   claims,then validate ,corroborate timelines and associations, provide required systems in place to protect the victim is the tactical approach to blow the lid off the biggest fish in the world: criminal syndicates such as the Clinton Foundation, Rogue Intel\Politicos's ect. Her mistake was too assume she might find some integrity at ICE\DHS divisions specifically designed to provide mission support to eliminate human trafficking. NEVER TALK TO THE FED WHEN YOU ARE GOING AFTER THE TOP ECHELONS. PA had DAs and the Catholic Church...while not an easy target, it has over the years been rocked by scandal. JQ Public is not surprised. But there sure would be surprised if a living president sodomized a boy and~ X ~ numbers of victim's came forward to peal back the onion layers. JQ Public's idealism would be shattered.

              I do hope so, I really do. Just imagine how many trials against priests and bishops could be held, and how many victims vindicated, if these damn statute of limitations wouldn't exist.

             Just finished article.  I agree.  Beyond Words.  Sickening.  I have sent it to Judith/Stcharles   We must keep these articles coming.  They should be posted so often they make newbies sick to their stomachs so that they will help push all this forward.  Waking the People is Our Purpose.  Abuse of Children by Priests.  Those that are entrusted with Our Children.  Vile. Evil. Same letters.

            <p>
             In a 10-minute interview on Feb. 27 this year, retired Buffalo diocesan priest Norbert Orsolits admitted sexually abusing "probably dozens" of underaged males, after one alleged victim had accused him publicly.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Yes, that's probably the usual ratio - for every victim that has come forward, there are dozens more.

            That awful realization I just had that South Park called it again in the Season 6 episode "Red Hot Catholic Love" in which they say the scope of the pedo priest problem goes straight to the top and that the non pedo priests are outnumbered by the pedos.

             Exactly. The Church is basically a pedo organization (I mean the clergy, not Catholics in general), with some non-pedos among them.

               It is good but more must come out about the SRA. Huge covering up of that. Children are their tortured 😖 Victims. OUR CHILDREN 👶.

             If priests are this evil, why not the Stars of Pedowood?  They are already tainted in many ways.  I think everyone here should write a letter to their State Officials to Push for a Grand Jury Investigation like Pennsylvania.  What a Victory that would be for Victims.

            CONTINUED:
           </p>
           <p>
            The eight dioceses of New York are Albany, Brooklyn, Buffalo, New York, Ogdensburg, Rochester, Rockville Centre and Syracuse. Each diocese has more than its fair share of abuse and episcopal cover-up spanning many years, including recent years.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the diocese of Albany, the homosexualization of the Church got underway in the late 1960s under Bp. Edwin Broderick, ordinary from 1969 to 1976. Broderick was a protege of powerful New York Cdl. Francis Spellman, whose active homosexuality was well known but covered up by Church officials and the media.
           </p>
           <p>
            During Broderick's tenure, Albany became known for accepting and promoting gay seminarians and priests. When Bp. Howard Hubbard succeeded Broderick, the gaying of the diocese accelerated greatly. Hubbard was bishop for nearly 40 years and among many disturbing cases, he was linked to Thomas Zalay, who, in 1978, committed suicide at age 25.
           </p>
           <p>
            The revelations surfaced when Zalay's brother, Andrew, discovered a letter, written by Zalay shortly before his death, alleging homosexual activity with Hubbard. Zalay said Hubbard justified homosexual acts by suggesting the Bible defined celibacy as being free of sexual contact with women; therefore, according to the bishop, homosexual acts aren't sinful.
           </p>
           <p>
            Zalay regarded homosexual acts as sinful. He didn't consider himself a homosexual and wanted to get away from Hubbard. The only way to escape him, he concluded, was suicide. Zalay set himself on fire at his parents' home.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hubbard also let a known homosexual predator priest, Fr. John Fitzpatrick, free access to high school students, whom he would take on regular outings after school. His predatory behavior was known as early as the late 1960s and continued over decades. After a sex abuse allegation in 1993, Hubbard sent Fitzpatrick away to a treatment center, only to place him back in ministry as a chancery aide for the next three years when further allegations of abuse surfaced.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over his nearly 40-year reign, Hubbard became infamous for covering up cases of homosexual predator priests. In the nearby diocese of Rochester, Matthew Clark was bishop from 1979 to 2012, largely overlapping Hubbard's time in Albany. In fact, Hubbard and Clark were known to be extremely intimate associates. They often appeared together and were seen as essentially inseparable.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a point of interest, Bp. Clark was the spiritual director to the young Timothy Dolan during his time in seminary at the North American College in Rome.

Brad Miner: "As we've seen, the abuse, and to a very great extent, I think, the cover-up, comes from this gay network."
            </p>
            <p>
             Clark's longstanding embrace of homosexuality earned him a public rebuke from then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who castigated him for supporting homosexuality.
            </p>
            <p>
             In late 1990s, Clark allowed Fr. Jim Callan to conduct same-sex weddings until the Vatican discovered and forced Callan out. In 2002, Clark had to place three priests on administrative leave after being threatened with a lawsuit for sex abuse cover-up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Records show Clark, who routinely officiated at gay Masses, had allowed the priests to remain in active ministry for decades in spite of multiple credible allegations of abuse of teen boys.

             The archdiocese of New York, home to almost half the Catholics in the whole state, has a long sordid history of homosexual acceptance on the part of the hierarchy and covering up cases of abuse. At least 80 priests stretching all the way back to Cdl. Francis Spellman's tenure have been publicly accused of sexual predation — most of them of males.

            <p>
             Spellman was the bishop who ordained homosexual predator Theodore McCarrick who, the next year, began his sexual assaults.
            </p>
            <p>
             The cases are in fact so many that the archdiocese just last year had to take a $100 million line of credit with CitiBank to begin paying off victims, many of whom had their cases covered up for years and decades under the tenures of Cdls. Terence Cooke and Edward Egan, something that Cdl. Timothy Dolan has been criticized for being slow to address.

             Critics say he has exacerbated the homosexual clergy plague by cozying up to pro-gay elements in the Church.

             He has been leading the charge among New York's bishops in fighting against victims being able to come forward — by opposing the New York state legislature's push to expand the statute of limitations for reporting sex abuse.

             Shuffling over to the diocese of Buffalo, current bishop Richard Malone recently went on a tirade against Catholics withholding donations to the diocese because of sexual abuse allegations and bishops covering it up.
            </p>
            <p>
             And for the record, his complaints came while he was vacationing on Cape Cod. He said:
            </p>
            <p>
             Regarding the Catholic Charities Appeal, though, I do not understand, and cannot accept, the logic behind the decision on the part of some individuals to express their dismay by holding back on their contributions to Catholic Charities. ... My heartfelt thanks to those of you who did not succumb to such unfortunate and, I believe, flawed thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Malone also said that his vacation time had been "clouded by the challenges we are facing right now in our diocese."
            </p>
            <p>
             At least 90 people have applied for financial compensation through the diocese's pay-out program for clerical sex abuse victims — which was rolled out in March 2018. Sixty-five priests in the diocese of Buffalo stand accused of sexual misconduct.
            </p>
            <p>
             In late May and early June, there were calls for Bp. Malone to resign, after investigative reports by Buffalo's ABC affiliate shed light on decades of negligence and cover-up by the diocese. The three-part investigation highlighted the cover-up under Bp. Edward Head, who led the diocese from 1972 to 1995 and the continued cover-up under Bp. Henry Mansell, from 1995 to 2003.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a 10-minute interview on Feb. 27 this year, retired Buffalo diocesan priest Norbert Orsolits admitted sexually abusing "probably dozens" of underaged males, after one alleged victim had accused him publicly.
            </p>
            <p>
             A few priests from Buffalo also appeared in the Pennsylvania grand jury report.
            </p>
            <p>
             In one glaring case, Fr. Dennis Riter has three male victims who've given evidence of his abuse to the diocese. A witness to one of Riter's assaults informed the diocese by letter in the early 1990s and the diocese swept it under the rug. The victim was a 10-year-old who had come running out of a rectory with semen on his face and chest.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio of the diocese of Brooklyn, who was consecrated by then-Archbishop Theodore McCarrick in 1996, has also resisted reforms in New York state's statute of limitations for reporting sexual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2016, New York State Assemblywoman Margaret Markey claimed DiMarzio offered her a $5,000 bribe if she would pull her support for the proposed legislation that would increase the statute of limitations for reporting sex abuse — the same legislation Dolan is vigorously campaigning against.
            </p>
            <p>
             The next year, in 2017, the diocese, together with the archdiocese of New York, paid out $1.8 million to six victims of a total of eight priests implicated in the lawsuit.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2002, two lawsuits were filed against the diocese, which were both lost on appeal due to the statute of limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bishop John Barres, current bishop of Rockville Centre, was highlighted in the Pennsylvania grand jury report for his time as bishop of Allentown from 2009 to 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was during his time as bishop that accusations against the notorious Fr. Thomas Benestad resurfaced, and according to the grand jury report, Barres made no attempt to remove Benestad from ministry.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pennsylvania grand jury report: "The Diocese elected to rely on Benestad’s word rather than the word of the victims and the determinations of law enforcement. No attempt was made to remove Benestad from ministry. Benestad was granted retirement, resides in Boca Raton, Florida, and assists with a local parish."
            </p>
            <p>
             Benestad is the priest singled about Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro during his Tuesday press conference for rinsing out the mouth of a 9-year-old boy with holy water after oral sex.
            </p>
            <p>
             As we've seen, the abuse, and to a very great extent, I think, the cover-up, comes from this gay network.
            </p>
            <p>
             In February 2018, a report called "Hidden Disgrace II" was released by lawyers, outlining the abuse of 51 priests, following a 2003 Suffolk County grand jury investigation, which took place under the tenure of recently retired Bp. William Murphy — Barres' predecessor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Turning to the diocese of Syracuse, also riddled with multiple sex abuse settlements, Bp. Robert Cunningham announced in February, following the model of the New York archdiocese, that it was launching a victims compensation program for 76 victims of priestly abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             Priests were routinely shuffled around even after credible accusations of sexual abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             For instance, Fr. James Quinn was accused of repeatedly molesting a 13-year-old boy during Catholic Youth Organization trips in the 1960s, where he would get the boy drunk and violate him when he was unable to resist. The victim sued the Syracuse diocese in 2003, but a court barred the lawsuit over the statute of limitations. The diocese then reinstated Fr. Quinn after an internal investigation revealed "insufficient evidence."
            </p>
            <p>
             Another victim, raped more than 200 times by Fr. Thomas Neary when he was 10 years old, sued the Syracuse diocese in 2011. The rapes happened in the boy's own bedroom while his parents were home, the priest telling his parents not to worry if he heard the boy crying.
            </p>
            <p>
             The priest was supposedly there to offer counseling to the boy on the priesthood and told the parents the boy was crying because "the priesthood is hard."
            </p>
            <p>
             It turned out Neary had many more male victims, the total number remaining unknown, but in at least eight cases, when the victims approached Bp. James Moynihan privately to share their stories of abuse, Moynihan gave each of them the same line: You're the only one who has ever come forward about abuse by Fr. Neary.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2015, after Bp. Cunningham became head of Syracuse, a group of outraged Catholics petitioned Rome to force Cunningham to resign because of his callous attitude towards sex abuse victims. It became public that Cunningham had said during a 2011 sex abuse deposition, when asked whether he thought boys being raped by priests were sinning, Cunningham answered, "The boy is culpable."
            </p>
            <p>
             His words caused such uproar that nearly 90,000 signed a petition to Pope Francis, urging him to remove the bishop from the diocese. Cunningham never resigned and remains the bishop of Syracuse to this day, each year making appeals to the laity to give millions of dollars to his diocese.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bishop Cunningham: "This weekend, as you’re preparing for Mass as a family, I encourage you to experience a greater love by giving to the Hope Appeal. Thank you for answering your call to serve during this year of the family."
            </p>
            <p>
             The diocese of Ogdensburg is also tainted by scandal, with multiple priests over the course of decades outed as sex abusers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since 1950, 56 people, 37 of them minors at the time, have accused priests of sexually abusing them — with a total of $3 million paid out in sex abuse settlements and counseling for victims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ogdensburg has also launched its own victims' compensation fund, announced earlier this spring, agreeing to pay victims in exchange for their promise that they won't sue the diocese.

             <p>
              The bishop, Terry LaValley, has been criticized for his lack of transparency, refusing to follow the example of other dioceses in publishing the list of names of credibly accused priests.
             </p>
             <p>
              Although LaValley headed the diocesan review board overseeing clerical sex abuse claims before he became bishop, he's been very secretive about the accused priests, making it impossible for the public to learn who most of the accused clergy are, when the diocese learned of their alleged crimes, and how the diocese handled it, whether they removed them from ministry or, like so many other bishops in so many other dioceses, transferred them to other parishes and kept them in active ministry.
             </p>
             <p>
              Concerned Catholics say all of this must come out and responsible bishops disposed of.
             </p>
             <p>
              The bishops' continual flow of statements expressing sorrow and regret just don't cut it anymore.
             </p>
             <p>
              Brad Miner: "Every time someone comes forward, like Cdl. DiNardo or someone else, to make a statement, it's just more PR, it's more stuff crafted by lawyers, so that culpability is pushed away as far as possible from the individual speaking."
             </p>
             <p>
              Sources tell Church Militant that if the New York attorney general does, in fact, pursue a grand jury investigation there will be many many more cases than this and the final report may be even more damning than the Pennsylvania one.
             </p>
             <p>
              As various states now begin seriously considering launching their own grand jury investigations, it appears as though the American hierarchy will soon be buried under mountains of litigation and further scandal for years to come.
             </p>
             <p>
              And all this while federal racketeering charges against the Catholic Church the U.S. Department of Justice are now being discussed freely in various media outlets.
