I\'m new to pizzagate, but my impression is that it\'s a good representation of what pizzagate has uncovered so far. One thing I found interesting is that he pointed out some Illuminati symbolism at several points throughout the film. Like I said, I\'m new to pizzagate, but I have been researching the occult for years now. I concluded long ago that this is a religion which is sexually abusive in nature.</p>
<p>Much like pedophiles, the Illuminati (which in this case I am using as a blanket term for occult practitioners) have a secret language that they use to communicate to one another about things they would rather keep secret. My concern is that if pizzagate is ignorant about this symbolism they could overlook some otherwise obvious clues that could potentially help further the pizzagate investigation. So here is a crash course on their symbolism:</p>
<p>Vigilant Citizen\'s <a href="http://vigilantcitizen.com/category/pics-of-the-month/">Pics of the Month</a>: Vigilant Citizen is an influential conspiracy theory blog about the Illuminati. His pics of the month have been extensively documenting for years the prevalence of occult symbolism in the media, along with how it oftentimes contains a juxtaposition of violence and sexuality. From time to time he explains the meaning behind it as well. It\'s worth looking through these.</p>
<p>I made several videos on my YouTube channel that explain the meaning behind occult symbolism. Much like pizzagate, I pull a lot of my material from social media pages of various people/groups as I have discovered that for now they are a gold mine of information (until they wise up and stop posting this stuff on social media). One video explains how many occultists <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yE-H2olGYVg">eat menstrual blood as if it were a sacrament</a>. Another explains how some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4QFrdtkscI">worship Satan in sexual manner</a> as if he were a deity.</p>
<p>I made another video about an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0v9xIGFCZo">Illuminati cult</a> that has chosen to maintain a public presence (which is highly unusual). I would like to cross reference that with a <a href="http://lifeinthesourcefamily.blogspot.com/">blog I found</a> with an alleged former member who claims it was sexually abusive in nature (among other things she claims members were required to eat menstrual blood on a regular basis). I think this is relevant to the pizzagate investigation in that it gives people an idea for how a sexually abusive cult would operate.</p>
<p>I also found a news story out of England about a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/11/sex-cult-leader-colin-batley-sentenced">pedophilic sex-cult</a> based on occult practices. Again, I am cross referencing this by a <a href="https://nathanieljharris.wordpress.com/">blog I found</a> by someone who claims to have been at least loosely affiliated with this activity and is now speaking out against it.</p>
<p>I understand that at first none of this may seem to have any relevance to pizzagate. Admittedly it may even lead to some dead ends. But at the same time it may cause some people to catch some evidence that would otherwise go overlooked. As for the other sexually abusive cults, they could potentially be linked to pizzagate as part of larger network; I would not want to rule that out.</p>
<p>Anyway, hope this helps and does not lead anyone down any blind alleys.</p>',
