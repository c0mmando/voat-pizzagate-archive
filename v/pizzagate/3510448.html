            BTW, I saw this movie tonight. 100% Pizzagate. It was an excellent movie, though. I saw it on IMAX. It doesn't end well for the monsters. :-)

            There's a really disturbing scene in this movie where they are harvesting "steam" from a young boy, so much so that I walked out of the theatre and got a refund. There's no mistaking that the "steam" in question is actually blood, or more accurately, adrenochrome - just by the way it is filmed you can tell. The giveaway is that the main villianess tells the boy that his fear and pain heighten the quality of his "steam" as she swallows his "steam" along with her other gang while he screams in pain. That was enough for me. They are not even trying to hide it anymore - it's in our faces. The scene reminded me of the end of Marilyn Manson's video for his "song" Say10 starting at 3:32, there's no mistaking what he is depicting, sacrificing/consuming a child:

            Remember paedophile Sir Clement Freud serving Madeleine's parents a delicious chicken risotto. The elites around the world likely snickered, "How droll!" at coke and orphans'-blood parties.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Inviting Gerry and Kate McCann over for a lunch of egg and watercress salad and [chicken] risotto [which Mrs. McCann in her book proclaimed the best they had ever eaten], the shamed broadcaster befriended the couple over strawberry vodka cocktails.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Mrs Haynes [a rape victim of Freud's when she was 17] said: "Why did this 82-year-old man befriend the McCanns out of the blue? The Freud I knew wouldn't engage with you unless he really wanted to.  Why did he invite them round and cook for them? Why, after their long search, did he stay in touch with them?"
           </p>
           <p>
            England is just full of paedophile Sirs and Lords (the good and the great) and Members of Parliament and murdering prime ministers.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The former Liberal Member of Parliament [paedophile Clement Freud] was "great friends" with [paedophile] Rolf Harris, shared an office with [enormously fat paedophile] MP Cyril Smith and had a villa ... just yards from where Maddie had disappeared."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Paedo Clement Freud and the former prime suspect in Madeleine McCann’s disappearance (Robert Murat) regularly drank together at a pub in Portugal. Freud was also a regular at another pub that was dubbed The Plough and Paedo after a British man working there nicknamed DJ Shifty who fled police who wanted to question him about alleged ..."
           </p>
           <p>
            "John Buck, British ambassador in Lisbon, at the time of Madeleine McCann's disappearance, went to Portimao to demand that the PJ immediately announce to the media - above all the British - that Madeleine's disappearance was an abduction and that her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were two innocent victims."
           </p>
           <p>
            Off topic but there were horrific murders in 2012 in France, near Chevaline,  of the British al Hilli family formerly from Iraq. An astoundingly complicated affair.
           </p>
           <p>
            The salient points are;
           </p>
           <p>
            1 - Immediately after the murders the British dispatched people from their embassy in Paris to the murder scene.
           </p>
           <p>
            2 - Years after the murders, the mother of the children, previously a sympathetic figure, was discovered to have been married in the USA to a CIA connected man whom she apparently did not bother to divorce before marrying Mr al Hilli.
           </p>
           <p>
            3 -
            <strong>
             Her previously CIA connected husband died of a heart-attack while driving in traffic in the USA almost TO THE HOUR that Mrs al Hilli was murdered in France.
            </strong>
            What a coincidence.

             In filmmaker Mike Flanagan’s adaptation of Stephen King’s Doctor Sleep, as well as the follow-up to Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, Rose the Hat is the leader of a nomadic tribe called The True Knot. Rose and Co. hunt telepathic children who have the ability to shine a la Danny Torrance in The Shining and Doctor Sleep’s analogue, Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran).
             <strong>
              Rose and her followers torture such children and feed off their essence
             </strong>
             , which they refer to as “steam.” This allows Rose and her friends
             <strong>
              to live forever, while increasing their own individual powers in the process.
             </strong>

             Addiction isn't the only demon Danny faces in the visually stunning Doctor Sleep. He needs to help teenage psychic Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran) confront
             <strong>
              a terrifying group of cultists who kill people like them to prolong their lives.
