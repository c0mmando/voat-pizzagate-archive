            During the run of "Miami Vice" this Caucasian co-star was promoted as a bad boy &amp; top TV sex symbol. According to the comments after the Blind where much truth is always revealed,
           </p>
           <p>
            "This actor used to be A+ list back in the day. He struck big gold on a hit network show. Later on in life he struck silver on another network show.
           </p>
           <p>
            Except for those shows though, he has struggled to get anything to stick. He makes movies, mostly the kind where the salaries aren't high and barely leave him any money after his big monthly expenses.
           </p>
           <p>
            Throughout his career, there have been decades of drug abuse and booze too. There have been lots of tabloid relationships and breakups.
           </p>
           <p>
            Too many scandals to count. Somehow though he has stuck around. Did I mention he used to be king of the casting couch back in the day on his gold show.
           </p>
           <p>
            Each week there were several women who were given a line on the show in return for having sex with the actor. No sex? Replaced with someone else.
           </p>
           <p>
            On his silver show he did the same thing. The problem was times had slightly changed and he was not as popular and he ended up paying a bunch of settlements and the studio even more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back before he made it big, he was a guy who was making one off appearances on network television or if he got lucky a few lines in a movie here and there.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was also when he was trolling high schools for female teens. He went through a series of 14-16 year olds before settling on a 16 year old to move in with him.
           </p>
           <p>
            He would send her off to hangouts where teens would be and tell her to not come back home until she found girls to play with. He never liked them older than 15 or 16.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of these girls that was brought back was given some drugs to make her more willing to do what she was going to be forced to do regardless. The drugs left her with permanent brain damage and she died a few years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fast forward to the present day. The younger sister to that brain damaged girl found an old diary written by her deceased sister that mentioned our actor's name and it was one of the last entries that the girl had been able to write before the damage done to her. No one in the family had even known the girl knew the actor.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, the sister reached out to the actor in hopes he might just be able to let them know anything he knew about the drugs she took or where she got them. They were just questions, not accusations.
           </p>
           <p>
            The next thing you know the actor has lawyers all over this sister. They tell her to drop everything and to not bother the actor again. Well, now that set off alarm bells so she started doing some more investigating and found other names in the diaries and tried to track them down 40 some odd years after this happened. She got lucky enough to put two and two together and then went back to the actor about two months ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are we surprised that this woman turned up dead the other day in the city where our actor lives? It is not like he has not been accused of assault and harassment and violence before. Maybe trying to protect what career he has left."

               Very lucrative  way to make a lot of cash when you are low man on the totem pole.  Also, why would he think there was anything wrong in trafficking when he was fooling around with young minor age girls? No problem.

                   Something rotten sure happened that night.  The part of a 6 ft man hanging himself on a hotel door is what keeps nagging at me.  Now we have this guy in Toronto and his wife with the same MO.  Worked once, why not try it again.  I think DG is behind this.  Really, I do.

                 Yeah, hopefully we can.  I saw Steve Spielberg on the news trying to get out in front of possible releases of sex abuse accusations.  He went on and on about how terrible it is, what has come out.  He was glad it was coming out. He is afraid, as he well should be  I nearly fell on the floor laughing.  Oh The Tangled Webs They Weave.

                  yes I saw that too. So ODD. He's always been so elusive and now he's taking selfies while being front and center? Hmmmm....trying to be Mr Fun and Accessible so that when and if awful truths come out about him, folk'll be like, 'oh not that guy'....

                  These people really think the rest of us are idiots. When will they learn the world has woken up and you can't pull this pathetic shit anymore?

                   I know, it is a joke.  I can't wait.  I just can't wait.  Dustin now exposed himself to a minor.  Also saw that New York Post has piece on NBC paying off accuser of Chris Matthews.  Ha!  Now we are going to get the take downs of the news anchors.  This is so rich.
