<p>Alexander Trofimov was thrown out of Russia for serially raping  9- and 10-year-old girls and keeping them as sex slaves. He escaped to Cambodia, set up a Russian shell corporation which acted as organizer on behalf of the US and built a $300 million resort on Snake Island where he was arrested with 19 child sex slaves he kept there, 14 of whom testified against him. Soros groups stepped in with a lot of background negotiations, and he was shielded him from extradition to Russia Soros NGOs escorted him out of Cambodia.   Trofimov is chairman of the Koh Pos Investment Company, which in 2006 received permission to build a 300-million-dollar resort on Koh Puos, or Snake Island, a place where he continued to rape young girls.    This  I found relevant to Pizzagate, because it shows a pattern of the US government and Soros setting up NGOs and agencies to fight child trafficking, but those agencies in fact enable the trafficking to take place:</p>
<p><em>APLE (Action Pour les Enfants) is the main pedo protection NGO currently operating in Cambodia. Their donor list is currently &quot;down for maintenance&quot; online but what i was able to find out tangentially is that the Soros groups fund them, Microsoft Seattle is a major donor as is Terre Des Hommes our of the Netherlands. The last organization is another child protection NGO which has come under fire in Ethiopia for having a convicted pedophile run their NGO orphanage - Terre Des Hommes pedophilia (<a href="https://thedeezone.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/ethiopian-court-rules-exposing-child-abuse-is-defamation-of-character/">https://thedeezone.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/ethiopian-court-rules-exposing-child-abuse-is-defamation-of-character/)</a>). What I am looking for in this scattered info-digging - is a common thread showing whether this merely a coincidence or if is this a visible case of fox running the hen house where professional pedophiles run these child protection NGOs. The APLE NGO is entrusted in Cambodia with doing full investigations, questioning of victims which should be police work and not private foreign NGO work - this is also typical for Soros groups who &quot;gather evidence&quot; and launder evidence this way in many countries. They seem to turn over occasional evidence of small fish to prove they protect kids - since 2003, they have brought charges against 23 pedophiles in Cambodia - it seems that they could do 23 per HOUR in Cambodia if they had their act together, considering the funding they have from big places....Of the 14 NGOs APLE had in tow when freeing Trofimov, I can identify at least this one, Terre Des Hommes, of actual pedophile activity while allegedly protecting kids in Ethiopia - this case here (<a href="https://thedeezone.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/ethiopian-court-rules-exposing-child-abuse-is-defamation-of-character/">https://thedeezone.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/ethiopian-court-rules-exposing-child-abuse-is-defamation-of-character/)</a>). Tangential peripheral info like this on an NGO\'s activities in other countries is typically all that will ever be found on cases like this - not enough to prosecute but abundantly enough of many more such anecdotes surface to tell the story. But the fact that the NGOs all ganged up to actually FREE the biggest pedophile caught in Cambodia alone tells plenty fo story.</em> </p>
<p>On February 7, 2008, WMR reported: &quot;WMR has learned that pre-teen child trafficking and prostitution is now rampant in Cambodia and that the trafficking is known and abetted by French and U.S. intelligence agencies operating out of the French and American embassies in Phnom Penh. A recent visit by FBI director Robert Mueller to Phnom Penh that coincided with the opening of an FBI office in the Cambodian capital stressed Cambodia\'s cooperation in the \'war on terror.\' Child trafficking was not discussed. In fact, Mueller\'s Cambodian counterpart, Hok Lundy, the chief of the Cambodian National Police, has been accused of involvement in human trafficking, including children. Lundy was granted a visa by the US Department of State to visit Washington despite having been refused previous visas due to the trafficking charges against him.</p>

            Unfortuneately I don't. For the last couple of years they seem reliable though, but I wouldn't trust them to be uncorruptible or anything, so I'd always store what seems important locally, too.

            So they say it is good that he will not abuse any more girls for 11 years. What about when he gets out?  They never stop. He will be rabid by then. 30 yrs would have been better but if still alive he still could not stop.

               I'm glad you raise this issue. Ostensibly, yes, APLE, fights trafficking.  On the face of it, APLE went after the Russian paedophile. Behind the scenes they are doing the trafficking; aiding and abetting the pedophiles.  The  director of  Action Pour Les Enfants (APLE) has since been charged by police after  sexually assaulting at least nine residents at an orphanage he ran in 2013 and 2014.
               <br/>
               .http://www.phnompenhpost.com/former-aple-chief-arrested
              </p>
              <p>
               Philippe Broaly, a former judge from Lyon, was arrested last week and accused of sexually abusing seven boys aged between 12 and 19. Broaly is the president of Enfants du Cambodge, an NGO which partners Cambodian children with donors in France. But Broaly was also the president of the Ecole Francaise de Sihanoukville.
              </p>
              <p>
               Veha Long, 32, Cambodian founder and director of the Underprivileged Children School in the northwestern tourist hub of Siem Reap province, was arrested for trafficking at least four teenage students. He was accused of asking the teenagers living at his home to give sex to foreign donors.
