            Awful lot of long winded concern posts about these protests lately. Be a pity if a lot of people showed up a la Dutroux.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, I think protesting at MSM HQs to do their damn jobs makes more sense than protesting in the heart of darkness for said darkness to persecute itself. Not to say those in MSM don't include participants, of course, but the focus now is draining the DC swamp. They can either distance themselves from protecting the DC and political pedos or fall with them. Point is, the media should be all over something like this, not going out of its way to cry about how fake it is.

            Unfortunately we are nowhere near critical mass. I would say 80% or more of the US thinks we are a bunch of lunatics and nutjobs. Just go to any MSM news article about PG and look at the comments. We have a loooooong way to go. Its easy to think differently when everyone in  your circle on Voat, reddit. Twitter, 4 chan and Facebook are on our side, its just a drop of water in an ocean of the population.

               Looks like FBIAnon joins the general 4Chan discussion on 03/06/2017 and says:
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm FBI anon.  Here's a H2FSK code to verify [gives code] 
April third everything is going to be revealed.  I recommend never returning to this website after March 15th if you don't want to wind up entering a new era.
Bump this as much as possible before it gets snabbed.  Identify shills if needed.

               Some of you know where this is heading.  You know what to do.

               Maybe someone interested can work out what is going on at 4chan.

            Again another post trying to scare people and to tell them not to attend the marches! I notice a big force trying to talk people out of attending these marches.. They dont want them out in the streets where they maight get attention, rather have all those people contaigned at some forum wich only few people know about. Yes it maight get trolled by paid people.. Staying in a forum will get the word out? I think sometimes need to take some risk. I do hope everyone will be save.

            I think determining who our genuine allies (in positions of power) are in seeking justice for Pedogate, and putting (polite) pressure on them to move forward with the investigation is a way better plan. I help to run a conspiracy group on Facebook, and even still, I find myself regularly checking my rearview mirror when driving. I look both ways before leaving my home. You know that these people are everywhere. I am in no way on the level of someone like Roger Stone, who they definitely tried to either hurt, or kill, yesterday, but I ~am~ an outspoken critic of the Clinton Crime Cartel, and the evils these assholes perpetuate.

            Anyway, back to the point, I think that the marches are doing nothing but setting yourself up for retaliation. The snipers and FBI surveillance of Occupy Wall Street comes to mind. Those people were putting red flags above their own heads and drawing attention to themselves.

            Despite my advocacy of the investigation for Pedogate, I don't need any more paranoia, just or otherwise, or worse.

            I've already told those close to me that if I was found dead, it wouldn't be from suicide, just in case.

            I really wish arrests would start, though. It's frustrating playing the waiting game. It seems like it's to the point where the buzz about the topic is wearing off, and that's bad. Keeping the conversation going keeps the hope for justice alive.

            Ive been thinking its just some set up the whole time. I wouldnt be surprised if the people who showed up found not many other people there. I strongly recommend not marching for your own safety.

            I basically agree. We stand to achieve very, very little with a public protest at this point, while opening the movement up to a massive opportunity for agitators, provacoteurs, AntiFa, and others to conduct ops to make it look violent/stupid/otherwise discredit us.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think that if it goes as well as it possibly can, few will ever hear about it. I think it's setting itself up to shoot the movement in the foot with various ways the opposition has of exploiting it for manipulation and mockery.
