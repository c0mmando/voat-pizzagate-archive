<h2><strong>Exhibit A: &quot;Housing Video&quot;</strong>,</h2>
<p>A facility of tiny rooms, uploaded 21st Nov 2016 by Chip Hearn of Rehoboth beach, owner of Peppers Hot Sauce and The Ice Cream Store: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nJxakmwup0">https://youtu.be/1nJxakmwup0</a> Video description: &quot;Hey guys we have spent the fall already make life better for next year!!!&quot; Joe Biden is on The Ice Cream Store website.</p>

Joe Biden spent &quot;winter retreat&quot; of &quot;Delaware State Education Association&quot; Feb 2008or09 in Rehoboth Beach. These that I know of. He seems to love it there.</p>
<h2><strong>Exhibit C: &quot;the worst pedophile in American History&quot;</strong></h2>
<p>Rehoboth beach was home to Earl Bradley, former-paediatrician convicted of pedophilia in 2011 on 529 charges against 127 children. The case was prosecuted by <strong>Beau Biden</strong>, Joe Biden\'s son. Bradley was sentenced to 14 consecutive terms of life plus 165 years in prison without parole. He also filmed and photographed and used a storage locker. Beau Biden missed a Senate race to prosecute the case.</p>
<h2><strong>Exhibit D: Grotto Pizza</strong></h2>
<p>Grotto Pizza of Shady rd, Rehoboth beach (next door to a Shady rd climate-controlled storage lockup), and is 0.3miles from Chip Hearn of &quot;Housing Video&quot;). Grotto run a loyalty card and app system called <strong>The Swirl Club</strong>: <a href="http://www.grottopizza.com/swirlrewards">http://www.grottopizza.com/swirlrewards</a> You get a &quot;free Jr Cheese Pizza&quot; on your birthday.

<h2><strong>Exhibit E: David Brock</strong></h2>
<p>David Brock lived in Rehoboth beach for a DECADE before meeting Alefantis. Brock and Alefantis both got sued by Brock\'s former boyfriend with threats to reveal Brock\'s Media Matters crimes. more below.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p><strong>Chip Hearn</strong> is the owner of Peppers Hot Sauce shop, <a href="http://www.peppers.com">http://www.peppers.com</a>, largest selection in the world, and The Ice Cream Shop, both in Rehoboth Beach Delaware.</p>
<p>JOE BIDEN is on Chip\'s Ice Cream Shop menu page here: <a href="http://www.rehobothbeachicecream.com/menu.html">http://www.rehobothbeachicecream.com/menu.html</a> </p>
<p><strong>WHO IS THE ICE CREAM MAN?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>AND WHO MAKES THE SWIRL PIZZAS?</em></strong></p>
<p>In Rehoboth Beach there is a GROTTO PIZZA, and 19 more throughout Delaware, with 2 a little closer to the White House: <a href="https://i.sli.mg/Isk61Z.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/Isk61Z.jpg</a></p>
<p>Grotto Pizza use the swirl as their whole identity, they sell it on hats and mugs and they even make swirl pizzas: <a href="http://www.grottopizza.myshopify.com">http://www.grottopizza.myshopify.com</a> </p>
<p>The Grotto Pizza website homepage boasts photos with a few Governors and Senators and whatnot, make sure you take a look, at least one photo was taglined about catering a political event in DC: <a href="http://www.grottopizza.com">http://www.grottopizza.com</a></p>
<p><strong>HOT SAUCE AND ICE CREAM:
WHO IS CHIP HEARN</strong></p>
<p>And why is his latest YouTube video showing a facility of tiny empty rooms? <a href="https://youtu.be/1nJxakmwup0">https://youtu.be/1nJxakmwup0</a></p>
<p>Chip Hearn The King of Wings, owner of a Hot Sauce company called Peppers in Rehoboth Beach Delaware (largest selection in the world they say - I bet Hillary loves his selection).. a 0.3 mile walk from Grotto Pizza. From Coastal Highway to Shady road. btw: Next door to Grotto on Shady road is All Climate self-storage center.</p>
<p><strong>I\'ll let the media tell you more about Chip Hearn:</strong></p>
<p>The King of Wings Chip posts short videos on YouTube about his Hot Sauce shop, he posts under the usernames thekingofwing and peppersofrehoboth that I know of.</p>
<p>(In most videos he plays the jolly santa, in many he says weird things and innuendo, and has a few videos just focused on the kids etc, and in one video I saw he thought it had stopped filming, and he broke character (off-screen) saying to film more &quot;customer interaction bullshit&quot;)</p>
<p><strong>HIS LATEST VIDEO. EMERGENCY!</strong></p>
<p>Can I just stress: his latest video is titled &quot;Housing video&quot;, viewed 30 times when I first found it, and it appears to be showing-off the inside of a new facility of tiny empty rooms: <a href="https://youtu.be/1nJxakmwup0">https://youtu.be/1nJxakmwup0</a></p>
<p>If anyone is trying to debunk Pizzagate, debunk that video please.</p>
<p>If any trusted law enforcement are reading this, find.that.facility. </p>
<p>Pizzagaters - where is that video filmed? What or who is kept in those tiny rooms?</p>
<h2><strong>ALSO IN REHOBOTH:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>WAS DAVID BROCK</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/02/27/media-matters-boss-paid-former-partner-850g-blackmail-settlement.html">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/02/27/media-matters-boss-paid-former-partner-850g-blackmail-settlement.html</a></p>
<p>David Brock lived for a DECADE with William Grey, before Brock dated Alefantis. Brock sold the &quot;beach-house&quot; (dunno where), to pay Grey $850,000 &quot;blackmail&quot; as Brock called it: a lawsuit by Grey that included a threat to reveal damning Media Matters donor information or something. Breitbart tweeted about it at the time, <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewbreitbart/status/174203334582996992">https://twitter.com/andrewbreitbart/status/174203334582996992</a>  
</p>
<p><strong>ALSO IN REHOBOTH</strong></p>
<p>There is a Ledo\'s Pizza franchise worth looking into right next to CHIP and he is very friendly with them (<a href="https://youtu.be/zIFMU9juH3U">https://youtu.be/zIFMU9juH3U)</a>). </p>
<p>Also &quot;somewhere nearby&quot; is the Peppers WAREHOUSE, job listing recently posted confirms existence but I don\'t know where specifically. An odd customer in a video I saw mentions it in his positive review of Peppers. Perhaps it\'s an old location, hence now Housing Video.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO IN A LEDO\'S PIZZA: CARDS</strong></p>
<p>This woman (<a href="https://youtu.be/1KEuVMCos-k">https://youtu.be/1KEuVMCos-k)</a>) talks about what food she likes, and about her SendOutCards business opportunity to send people GREETINGS CARDS with QR codes inside to videos to &quot;make people smile&quot;. They talk about a Children\'s Eat Free Wednesday deal on the wall, and end the video saying C U Next Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong><em>Haven\'t we heard something about Cards before?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>ALSO OF INTEREST:</strong></p>
<p>The footer of Peppers.com has a <strong>Ring of Fire</strong> box displayed, a web ring of related hot sauce websites. <a href="http://www.ringoffire.net">http://www.ringoffire.net</a>, made by NetRelief in (I think) 1998. NetRelief also made thesmokering.com.</p>
<p>I found my way to hotsaucedaily.com, run by Brian and Marylin Meagher. He blogged a swirl pizza from Grotto Pizza. Click to his Google+ and click pics of him, there he is in a Peppers tshirt at I think Rehoboth beach, and commenting on the pic is a guy called Pedersen, click to <em>his</em> About Me to see his talk of being good at computers where he mentions &quot;triangles within triangles within triangles&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>Who checks Biden\'s mail?
Where and what is the Housing Video facility?
What does Joe Biden know?
Does he disavow?
Who owns what?
Who owns Grotto Pizza?
What do you get in the Swirl Club?</p>
<p>many more questions await you. Anyone have any answers?</p>',

Brock sold the "beach-house" (dunno where), to pay Grey $850,000 "blackmail" as Brock called it: a lawsuit by Grey that included a threat to reveal damning Media Matters donor information or something. Breitbart tweeted about it at the time,

            This may be way out there from looking at too much of this stuff, but is there any chance as they go on and on about the wings being bigger than usual and chicken being code for very little child, that the wings are not from chickens?
           </p>
           <p>
            And there was that pizza place in NY that Hillary likes, with the really creepy poster and about summer solstice, which also says they were roasting chickens.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry.  It's just that their way of talking about the especially large wings seemed an inside joke.

            Those small rooms remind me of something very specific.  In the late 80's a friend of mine attended a musical theater school located in the Ansonia building on the upper west side of Manhattan.   We were there late one night and noticed barricades by the stairs that led to the basement.  Made curious by this, we decided to explore past them and discovered a defunct gay bathhouse below that had been out of use for quite some time.  There were cheap plywood rooms built off the main area with cots, tiny rooms, smaller than pictured in the video.  We found little traces of what had gone on, empty poppers bottles, etc.  This might be what you're seeing.

            Great data. Red Hot Chili Pepper wife went after Scott Baii AND the young daughter. Idk, it seems like false news, blame Putin, boo how intensity is like those crank metg addicts coming down or fearing they will. Threat of pedo and Hunan flesh addictions to be stopped via Trump and public awareness?? Its all very addict behaviors, blaming all, defense mechanisms, imbalanced, gaslight , no accountability, narcissicistic whining.

            I followed a lead of a 80s comedy horror, Comet something and came to another franchise, Texas Alamo that was an odd website, and to own a franchise; must have three million plus already a nonprofit status for a business!

            I have a strong feeling we are onto something here concerning Rehoboth Beach. Here are some loose connections I have made that have piqued my curiosity...
           </p>
           <p>
            I arrived on the , Rehoboth Beach angle independently.
           </p>
           <p>
            It started with this picture...
            <a href="https://i.sli.mg/SjUw5E.png">
             https://i.sli.mg/SjUw5E.png
            </a>
           </p>
           <h2>
            See the background? What does this look like to you guys? *I'll say what it looks like to me at the bottom of this post. Look at it yourself first so I don't influence your opinion.
           </h2>
           <p>
            There is an amusement park in Rehoboth Beach called Funland. Parks like this are attractive to pedophiles.
            <a href="http://www.funlandrehoboth.com/">
             http://www.funlandrehoboth.com/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So I start researching Funland and this article comes up...
            <a href="http://archive.is/7ZnhM">
             The Darker Corners of Pinocchio
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             We already established that the Coachman is responsible for illegal child trafficking, transporting them to a
             <em>
              Fun
             </em>
             land called Pleasure Island, (a word that many adults associate directly with sex) and luring them there with fun, candy, anything a kid could want.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I look at the pleasure island scene on youtube and find this...
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAfAH1OvdoE">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAfAH1OvdoE
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at 6 seconds in. Pinocchio is holding an Ace of Spades. Remember what the FBI anon said about cards?
           </p>
           <p>
            At 2:36 mark, there is a blue swirl that looks similar to the pedo logo. This one could be nothing though.
           </p>
           <p>
            *As far as the James Alefantis pic I linked, to me the background looks like he is at a beach with a camp fire. It also appears that there is a person wearing a white pointed hat. Is anyone able to find out where this photo was taken?

             The expectation by the rich to just meet up on their jets and boats, as if money means safety is quite a mind game pressure.

            Rehoboth Beach was home to Earl Bradley, convicted in 2011 as the "the worst pedophile in American History". Joe Biden's son prosecuted the case before he died of brain cancer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joe Biden is on the website of Chip Hearn of Rehoboth Ice Cream Store and Peppers Hot Sauce who just uploaded a video of a tiny child-sized brothel-like facility.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joe Biden spent his birthday weekend at Rehoboth beach this very year. November 20th. The same weekend the Housing Video was uploaded by Chip.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rehoboth beach is the hub of Pizzagate. David Brock lived there for a decade before dating Alefantis.
           </p>
           <p>
            No concerts or shows needed. Giant pedophile ring.

              Look at Saville Reality based in UK and Jersey Island. Esp the app only old mansions. Mansions known to have satanic statues as a norm. Island is under the Queen.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even if I was ultraruch, so many restaurants, mansion, people (ate they human) that I would never want to be near.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bet some good trained dogs would pick up a lot of clues and scents.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bet, each state has places to find of sites. Each state, sure has dark histories coming out with boy juvies, institutions and more.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bet, metal detectors, water runoff/pipes/sewafmge lab tests would pick up corroded remnants.
             </p>
             <p>
              Bet a lab test could show human flesh eaters. That would be great IN court cases.
             </p>
             <p>
              Aside: Cannot a new internet be build on different frequency spectrums? Do we really need to be dependent on their internet?
             </p>
             <p>
              A new utube and other sites. From Franklin case to fbianon and NYPD, the excuse is used over and over that they cannot pursue for all govt would be exposed and fall.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its such a mind control to think we need those top elite, pyramid schematic if tyranny. They are proven useless and corrupt. There are billions of people, many way more skilled and with good intents vs agenda.
             </p>
             <p>
              I call vs that we need them. And why does fbianon state that if he released info that he could be killed; yet writes he has a suicide pact with his wife if Hilary was to win/things got worse?
             </p>
             <p>
              If he is willing to suicide die with wife, why not just go out a hero?
             </p>
             <p>
              He stares his wife uses fourchan, also, on dig subthreads, yet another time stares he not inform his wife of things to keep her safe; but has a suicide pact.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yah, he wrote he was putting in false info, but..I wonder the inconsistencies as this is such life or death type issue.
             </p>
             <p>
              I notice he does typos in some pattern..by the way...
             </p>
             <p>
              Was Biden son, good or was this huge pedo case what bigwigs do to other elites that get sloppy, not follow orders, or try to blackmail Biden?
             </p>
             <p>
              From pot, traffic tickets owed, CP's bombard good parents, fisherman utube guy so punished; such a difference in how elite treated.
             </p>
             <p>
              Epstein's bigwig attorney is quite questionable and intimidates that female victim of libel and jail. Sounds just like Franklin case, the female victim.out in jail and the male victim so threatened, he does lie at one case to coverup in fear, then fails to show up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its interesting that one victim in Franklin area that came from well to do pedo satanic famy, that uses shamanism in a healthy, positive mode versus the anti life reverse. ( compare to latest gaga commercial with big tech co).

              You're suspecting child rape, because you're suspecting child rape. There's nothing at all about the size of that room to lead you to that, you have to have a whole narrative arleady in place for you to go there. There's a specific size of room associated with child rape?   Seriously?
             </p>
             <p>
              Rooms that size are found all over the country for cheap apartments for college students or other folks moving into their first place.  Places you could put a small futon or a twin bed in.
or in expensive areas, places for folks who work there.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rehoboth Beach is a vacation spot right?  So you need more help in the summer months than the winter and the prices go up in the summer right?
Considering the video is labelled housing, and not something like small one bedroom for rent,  He probably brings in summer work and free/cheap housing is a perk.  That would be my guess.

            <p>
             Ones visited Comet and saw this lady tell the lil girl to go back into party room. The couple went back there later, and nothing even there, but curtains and an old bar, looking unused in a kids party room.

             That old YouTube celeb caught doing pedo that has a farm. Bunch of rednecks making utube videos and commenting in bizarre defense.
            </p>
            <p>
             Really shows how "celeb money status," causes masses to be fanatic, just like with Saville. Ones even blame parents for bringing their kids to a farm, as if ones would know about pedo.

             Guy went to Comet and saw the guy have the group of boys run and get in a Uber. License plate, interview driver where they went. Well being of those boys, is highly concerning.
            </p>
            <p>
             Already, Subway was caught with that pedo guy for commercials.

             To interview workers, relatives, old employers, neighbors, classmates, Podesta daughter, Epstein, old bands and bars that played with Majestic, Chelsea in hardball interviews could really lead to slip ups if safe way to do interviews.
