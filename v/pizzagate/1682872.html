            Not surprising. Professors are constantly pushing establishment psyops, wonder if they are put in their positions by the cabal? The child rape stuff seems to be the underbelly of the American establishment.

            This is disturbing as shit. 
I'm wondering if one could find an equal amount of arrests made in ANY career category?  is this just a reasonable cross section of society in general, or is there a higher % of professors who have this propensity?
           </p>
           <p>
            My fear has become, that with the seeming onslaught of arrests/information regarding the scale and scope of pedophilia that (apparently) exits in our society, the cry will not be to Hang the Bastards!, but rather, to "understand, the bastards ".
           </p>
           <p>
            I have said for a few years now that the next push on the American mind will be pedophilia.  The exact same defense can and will be used against/for IT as was used in the selling of homosexuality as "normal".
            <br/>
            "they are BORN this way, and there is NOTHING anyone can do to "change it". 
And make no mistake about it, homosexuality was sold to our society and culture.  if you are over 40 years old or so, and if you have any cognitive /memory abilities whatsoever, you had to notice the shift in attitudes towards homosexuality in our society. 
50 years ago, homosexuality was even considered "off", by Hollywood . Or at least by what Hollywood put out.  As in their movies and TV shows.    Then starting in the 70's, a very different image/attitude was presented and promoted.
            <br/>
            And for chrissakes don't go giving me shit over this, I'm merely stating historical evidences.   And don't give me the name of an obscure 1958 movie where a homosexual character was the hero.     There is a reason why Rock Hudson lived the life he did and kept his sexual identity a secret until he finally told the world he was gay.  Its because his career would have been essentially over if he came out in 1968.  What Hollywood insiders know or whisper is irrelevant.  How the public perceived, was everything.
            <br/>
            I didn't know how the hell the pro-pedophile crowd would EVER pull off making pedophilia acceptable, but I knew they were going to do it. 
It will also be interesting to see where the homosexual community falls on this.
            <br/>
            We know where the right will line up.  We know where everyone with kids will line up (those that aren't fucking pervs, that is) . and we know where the Bill Mahrs and Chris Cuomos will line up.
