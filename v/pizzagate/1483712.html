            Actually, his death will not spark as much controversy as it will spark violence. People will overlook pizzagate because they're too emotional and too busy fighint and rioting. FYI, several factions will wage war. That is already happening covertly. The problem is we, the people, who represent the aware people who know of the abuse of children and corruption, need a faction to be reckoned with, one that can put pressure on things NOW.

            Just awareness does nothing

            There have to be some pi's or police officers that have been following this. That have access to better investigational resources that are willing to help in this way

             This is why there needs to be a "central intelligence" that can send those with the tools to do so out on a mission.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm thinking: an anonymous (tech savvy) collective that sorts out what locations, what people need to be followed. To plan a strategy, formulate them, set specific goals and get money from crowdfunding used to fund the secret agents.
            </p>
            <p>
             If it's possible, it's not insane. The situation asks for a serious faction that can actually do something. All the information that is gathered will be for nothing, if we don't use them to change what is wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is also not good to just "hope" Trump will do the work, nor to sit around and wait for him to be killed or bribed in some kind of coverup.
            </p>
            <p>
             We need a plan B that can put pressure on society.
