            I really don't know how we could answer this. I doubt you are in any danger from anyone unless you are a Russian diplomat. I don't have an Ipad. I would call Apple and ask them or your internet service.  Sounds like you are tired, which is when its really easy for anyone to make mistakes, get confused, be extra paranoid. Get some sleep and worry about it later, its probably a some sort of setting that got messed up by accident.

              I don't know anything about that kind of thing, but I would call Apple just to either complain, or get some idea of their answer. I did have someone hacking my phone and it is unsettling, so make sure you take care of yourself.

            This why you never allow any software/firmware to update anything in any device. They build in filters and restrictions and they also build in blocks that you can not roll back to a previous version, especially Apple devices. Like Android now from 5..1.0 on, have made it so you can not re-flash to an older version. Apple has always been next to impossible to flash back unless you go to great lengths to save "blob" files etc etc..

            They wont let you edit your own HOSTS file to block what you want to, but they do anything to make sure you are plugged in directly to the propaganda machine and they block anything that counter measures them.
