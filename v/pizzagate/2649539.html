For example in the game DanganRonpa the character Kotoko Utsugi is a 12 year old child actor whose parents have been prostituting her to producers to be famous. This is from the wiki\'s description of her.</p>
<p><a href="http://danganronpa.wikia.com/wiki/Kotoko_Utsugi">http://danganronpa.wikia.com/wiki/Kotoko_Utsugi</a></p>
<p>&quot;Kotoko was born and raised in Towa City. She was a child prodigy and a famous child actor whose father was a dentist.</p>
<p>When she was about 10 years old, her parents prostituted her to producers where she was repeatedly raped by them. Her mother did it out of a twisted form of parental love and prostituted herself alongside Kotoko as a &quot;mother and daughter set&quot;, believing that this was in her daughter\'s best interests and that it would help further Kotoko\'s career, make her &quot;sparkle forever&quot; and have the spotlight. Kotoko\'s mother saw youth as a great, horrifying power, a one that should be used in your advantage when you still could. She didn\'t care if Kotoko and the society would hate her, as she believed that her actions were completely right. As a result of the trauma, she ended up developing a breakdown trigger to the word &quot;gentle&quot;, a euphemism the producers had used to describe their rape.&quot;</p>
<p>This scene shows her begging another character not to be raped anymore.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CiNAw2W3LU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CiNAw2W3LU</a></p>
<p>Next is the game Persona 5. The president of Japan is the enemy in this game.</p>
<p><a href="http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Masayoshi_Shido">http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Masayoshi_Shido</a></p>
<p>&quot;Shido is in reality the leader of a grand conspiracy that secretly controls all of Tokyo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He despises anyone who tries to stop him from any of his desires, no matter how fleeting. He is also quite litigious, threatening to sue anyone who irritates him and has no qualms with blackmailing even the police into keeping their mouth shut.&quot;</p>
<p>The other antagonist High School gym teacher who rapes all the underage girls at the school. His name is Suguru Kamoshida and he is a former celebrity Olympic athlete. </p>
<p><a href="http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Suguru_Kamoshida">http://megamitensei.wikia.com/wiki/Suguru_Kamoshida</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/-GAabsf4WEs?t=1978">https://youtu.be/-GAabsf4WEs?t=1978</a></p>
<p>&quot;Kamoshida is a former professional athlete and Olympic volleyball champion who later became the volleyball coach of Shujin Academy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is a lustful, vain, cruel and utterly selfish bully who abuses his female students emotionally, physically and sexually, and is willing to sabotage the athletes in rival sports of his own school purely so his own class rises to prominence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is aware that his sexual desire for his female students is aberrant, but ignores the consequences of his lust, yet his Shadow Self admits it\'s more about domination than sexual attraction&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He also began sexually harassing his female athletes while subjecting male athletes to brutal physical abuse which he justified by labeling it as &quot;training.&quot; Despite his blatancy, the students could not speak up against Kamoshida as the principal silenced any attempt to speak up against or otherwise report Kamoshida\'s actions. With no way to stop his systemic abuse at Shujin Academy, known by the students, staff and even the parents, Kamoshida began to see himself as nothing less than an untouchable ruler - a king who had the entire Shujin Academy as his own castle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;However, once the protagonist discovers that Kamoshida is trying to blackmail Ann Takamaki into sexual relations with him, it is confirmed that he sexually harassed (and heavily implied that he sexually abused) her friend, Shiho Suzui resulting her attempted suicide&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The cause of his corruption is his lust and desire both for success and power, resulting in his callous treatment of his athletes and his ephebophilia towards his female students.&quot;</p>
<p>The next game is Octopath Traveler. </p>
<p><a href="http://octopathtraveler.wikia.com/wiki/Primrose_Azelhart">http://octopathtraveler.wikia.com/wiki/Primrose_Azelhart</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrgZCsDtb4c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrgZCsDtb4c</a></p>
<p>The game is split up into seperate stories of the characters with one being named Primrose Azelhart. Her father is killed and she is forced into a sex trafficking ring masquerading as a dancing group for the local tavern. Her master, Helgenish, abuses her and makes sexual advances on her in exchange for her livelihood inside of a dorm with other girls forced into the same ring. At one point, one of the men who killed her father is seen negotiating with Helgenish to sell her off to him as part of his brothel in another town. This man is one of three in a secret society that rule lawless towns and this one in particular runs a sex trafficking ring. Each of these men bear a tattoo, &quot;The mark of the crow&quot;, an obvious reference to the mark of the beast.</p>
<p>&quot;Ten years ago, Primrose had been a witness to how three men broke into her home and killed her father right before her eyes. All three of them had the mark of the crow somewhere on their body: one had it on his left arm, the other on the right, and the last one had it on his neck. As she was young, Primrose had no idea what to do and simply cowered in fear as she watched the events transpire. Such things then led to her venturing away from her home, traveling from place to place to find leads on where they might be so she could have her revenge. Her insistent information gathering led her to the town of Sunshade, where she was taken in by Helgenish and fashioned into a dancer who he profited the most from and used him as a means of earning more custom and unmentionable, degrading things. She endured all of it, all for the sake of finding one of the men that appeared ten years ago in her home and caused House Azelhard to fall into ruin. Ten years later, she is still seen dancing for Helgenish and still keeping up with his abusive, manipulative and disgusting tendencies towards his dancers, with Primrose as his crown jewel..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The employer of Primrose and an acquaintance of one of the men who murdered Primrose\'s parents. He was the one who gave her a roof over her head while she searched for the whereabouts of the \'crows\'. Many times, it is referenced how Helgenish is an abusive person who takes advantage of his dancers, threatening them and calling them names to no end and forcing them to earn their keep while using them as a means of satisfying his own twisted pleasures. When his dancers have no use to him anymore, Helgenish \'puts them down\' by beating them half to death and throws them into the gutters afterward for them to suffer and die in.</p>
<p>Helgenish constantly abuses Primrose the most as much as he dots on her - he uses her and always orders for Primrose to go to his quarters every night and dresses her up in beautiful jewelry in exchange, while trying to manipulate her into staying as his and his alone, showing how materialistic he is towards things that have caught his fancy. Primrose has strong feelings of hatred for the man who had abused her, mistreated her, and disgraced her constantly through her life and even calls him out for his disgusting habits and saying how he had no real contribution to where Primrose stands now, that where she is at the moment is by her doing alone and that Helgenish never helped her in the first place - all of this gushing out the moment Helgenish murders Yusufa, her only ally among the dancers, right in front of her. After facing him off in battle, Primrose takes his life in exchange for his wrongdoings and steals the map his acquaintance had given him to use as a reference as to where the men marked with the crow could be, finally setting her journey of vengeance in motion.&quot;</p>

<p>The producer has described it as &quot;the world\'s first Shotacon anime&quot;. The series consists of three episodes, as well as a one-shot manga chapter, a computer game and a video compilation of songs. Because of the high cost of producing anime, the characters and contents were intensively product-tested before production began.</p>

Primrose has strong feelings of hatred for the man who had abused her, mistreated her, and disgraced her constantly through her life and even calls him out for his disgusting habits and saying how he had no real contribution to where Primrose stands now, that where she is at the moment is by her doing alone and that Helgenish never helped her in the first place - all of this gushing out the moment Helgenish murders Yusufa, her only ally among the dancers, right in front of her. After facing him off in battle, Primrose takes his life in exchange for his wrongdoings and steals the map his acquaintance had given him to use as a reference as to where the men marked with the crow could be, finally setting her journey of vengeance in motion."

           The producer has described it as "the world's first Shotacon anime". The series consists of three episodes, as well as a one-shot manga chapter, a computer game and a video compilation of songs. Because of the high cost of producing anime, the characters and contents were intensively product-tested before production began.

            Japan has had CP as part of their culture for as long as I can remember. Anime is full of pedo creepiness; I remember in the original "Dragon Ball," the character Master Roshi, an old man, is constantly lusting after Bulma, a young girl who I'm pretty sure is said to be 17 (at most). His perverted attempts to see her naked are a running gag in the show.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also some very twisted Japanese film genres. First there is what I can only call "snuff style" movies, like the "Guinea Pig" series from the 80s and early 90s, which were 45-50 minute films of a (usually young-looking) girl getting kidnapped by bandits, gangsters, or in one case a serial killer dressed as a samurai, and they proceed to drug the girl and then dismember her body slowly. An entire sub-genre dedicated to nothing but that.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR7q9pZ1rgg">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's Guro. If you haven't heard of guro, its basically art or pornography (usually the latter) based on dismembering and mutilating people, and again, it's usually young-looking girls. Guro has manifested in manga, hentai (anime porn), video games, and more in Japanese culture, and is catching on in other regions as well. Guro ranges from very light to some of the most grotesque imagery you can imagine.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also there is Shotacon and Lolicon, which just takes a Google search to discover how fucked up that shit is. For those who don't want their browsers tainted, its anime porn featuring children.

            Having been an anime and hentai fan for many years I do know that Lolita and Shota (make equivalent of Lolita) themes
Are quite prevalent in anime and hentai. They have their own sub genres and they’re a common trope.

             No Aum was a doomsday apocalypse mass murder cult, it may had global political ambitions with the terrorism thing. The lolita thing or perv fetish or tolerance for maybe abusive relationships is there with Japanese. I have no doubt there may be some 'pizzagate' scandal in Japan, this abuse, molestation thing is every where in the world every media every church and temple all nations everywhere. I will ask a guy to come in here give a run down on Jpn culture from a non-conspiracy objective outside view ...

             could give you a quick talk on why they are different peoples. Looking from an American view, maybe say a conservative view you would see they are kinda weird like say French are weird, the weird thing may not always be criminal but other times it is criminal.

              Yep, and was a Scientology routine turned terrorists.
             </p>
             <p>
              Japan ... hmm is weird place. Cute (kawaii) is part of the country. Old men love Hatsune Miku - they saw she’s cute. There is also a strong Lolicon (Lolita complex) affliction but it’s weird, men will act that fantasy out with younger soapland workers. Prostitution is a grey area in Japan and police allow it. You will also come across 20-30 year old guys dating high school girls and high school boys banging jr high girls. Way younger isn’t a problem. Teacher also diddle the students.
             </p>
             <p>
              But!
             </p>
             <p>
              It’s such a fine line that it’s amazing that all out pedo’s draw a line at how young they go. Like I said paying a high school girl for sex isn’t that weird. Most guys won’t but I would come across girls who did have older “patrons”. Older guys would stop at high school girls and normally 16 and older at that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trust me on this. Jr high girls were only targeted by high school boys.
             </p>
             <p>
              Gays also kept things on board too. You would see them on TV but never really pushed their “gender” on anybody. You don’t here about faggets like George Takei grabbing guys by the balls.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is definitely a fascination with high school uniforms! Come on! Who would pass up a chance of Britney Spears in her private school uniform. This is all of Japan. Girls know they hold that power. Too bad none of my Xs had their uniforms from high school. Oh well. So, soaplands would offer that service along with nurses and what not. Soaplands can be cheap like $100 for an hour - decent girls too! No hags. Japanese guys would rather spend $20 more for young one than an old bird.
             </p>
             <p>
              Is there perverts? Yeah, there are! Faggets who grope girls and women on the trains but women have started calling out men and mistaken accusations are a problem now.
             </p>
             <p>
              But never have heard of elementary level pedos though. Perverts sitting naked in a car out slide of high schools? Yep! I’ve even seen a guy piss on the front gate of a high school before too. I was like wtf?!? I’ve even cane across a government employee who stole high school uniforms.
             </p>
             <p>
              High shool girls are a grand target. Jr high ? Nothing. Elementary school? Never.
             </p>
             <p>
              Japan has the strangest porn I’ve ever seen. Well westerners like animals - I didn’t see that in Japan. Nope. Don’t know why. Maybe the women thought that was just too much.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, comic books targeting elementary school kids is full of panty shots while older kids would have less of that. Shonen jump was a major seller and it was full of panties. Even jr high school boys said it was weird.
             </p>
             <p>
              What about politicians? 60 year old guys propba oh pump 20 year olds without even blinking. 18 ... maybe ...
             </p>
             <p>
              But their is one rule that could get you busted and that is if a girl was in a school uniform and you get caught, you were busted for pedo. If she didn’t have it on, you could claim ignorance.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cheating is similar. Walk out of a girlfriend’s house covered in lipstick and you are safe. Walk into a love hotel — bam! Busted! Love hotels are for sex. They are cheap to stay at though!
             </p>
             <p>
              So is their pizzagate in Japan? Not with elementary school kids. Jr high ... not sure. High school - yep.
             </p>
             <p>
              What about us military. Oh boy! I’ve locked 15 year olds out of bars. So for sure I bet sailors have diddled 15-16 year olds. Even heard of rape stories too. A lot and I mean a lot is covered up. Whatever gets on TV is nothing.
             </p>
             <p>
              I love Japan but I’m not gonna hide what I know.

            In regards to Persona 5 (I've mentioned this game before), Goro Akechi is an allegory to the CIA given his MO of false flags and assassinations. Shido is likely an allegory for the Clintons given his mafia ties, use of suiciding, the media being completely on his side, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is also a late game Mementos target who's a commentary on the casting couch. Eerily similar to Harvey Weinstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the party members (Makoto Niijima) is the daughter of a police officer who was murdered while investigating a sex trafficking ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            The game also viciously rips the nasty side of Japanese culture (the victim is dirty when it comes to rape, work culture, arranged marriage) a new one.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm pretty sure that Persona 5 was written by gaming industry white hats.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've also made commentary on Danganronpa Ultra Despair Girls being a red pill game regarding Pedowood. Normally, Danganronpa is a black comedy, but the chapter in question (along with the other child abuse stories) is taken 100% dead fucking serious.

              It gets weirder regarding Danganronpa. It has actually helped out by giving some insight during the pizzagate investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              During the threads regarding the Vanderbilt pool pics, the game ended up giving me an insight as to the likely howdunnit of the crimes were commited. Probably done in a similar manner to the situation with Hiyoko's body (hung with a slit throat) in the Mikan Tsumaki case.
             </p>
             <p>
              That same case turned out useful in understanding some things regarding the Chris Cornell/Chester Bennington murders. More specifically, a piece of dialogue from Chiaki Namani regarding the difference in rope burn profile between a suicide and a ligature strangulation. Covering up this important piece of evidence is why Cornell's body was cremated so quickly.

              Shows what kind of dank timeline we live in. I believe Ultra Despair Girls was meant as a red pill game in regards to Pedowood.

             <p>
              I've mentioned the game here before. Pretty much every time I say something about how "they" should receive a "Very Special Punishment" for their sick crimes or say IT'S PUNISHMENT TIME!! I mean it as in a Danganronpa style execution. Have a whole bunch of them as it relates to specific sickos.

             Later that week, senior politician Takami Eto sparked complaints from China after suggesting that the Nanking massacre during World War II was a "big lie".

             China says that 300,000 Chinese died at the hands of Japanese troops in Nanking, but some Japanese nationalists contest whether the massacre happened at all.

             In the same month, two politicians sparked fury among female legislators by appearing to condone rape.

            <p>
             Seiichi Ota, a lawmaker with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said at a debate on Japan's declining birth rate that at least gang rapists had a healthy appetite for sex.

             Then Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda, commenting on Mr Ota's remarks, suggested women who are raped are "asking for it" by the way they dress. 
 Kiichi Inoue, minister for disaster management, suggested that the murder of a classmate by an 11-year-old schoolgirl indicated a sign of women's progress.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Men have committed thoughtless, harsh acts but I think this is the first for a girl," Mr Inoue told reporters. "Recently the difference between men and women is shrinking." He said "vigorous" women were increasing in society.
