            I know Hector is the CEO but he only make around 11K more than his vice, Larry engelstein. It seems less than likely that hector would have much to do in regard to any sort of plotting. That task is generally doled out to their direct "underlings". See bush/Cheney.

             No one knows for sure, but I doubt Hector did any of the planning.  He either carried it out, or had one of his goons do it.  More than likely it was Podesta that gave the orders and planning.
