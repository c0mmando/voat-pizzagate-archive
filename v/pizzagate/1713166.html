The ENTIRE THEORY came about because some asshole\'s equation of the universe\'s weight which this idiot CAN&quot;T POSSIBLY KNOW didn\'t add up, so he posited this utterly ridiculous nonsense about some other form of matter that only exists &quot;out there&quot;, of course never questioning whether his idiot equation might be at fault.

<p>This is one of the reasons that theoretical physics departments are full of jews, and why engineering departments are almost completely bereft of jews: In theoretical physics, you can say ANY BULLSHIT YOU WANT, and you don\'t have to prove it, and usually can\'t prove it because there\'s no way to. In engineering, you can\'t get away with that kind of fraud. </p>
<p>So if you look into the scientific fraud media figure Stephen Hawking, you will find that he has actually made NOT ONE single significant discovery that hasn\'t been completely discredited, and his entire career and fame are based on this nonsense that everyone knows now was total bullshit. </p>
<p>No surprise then to see this satanist freemason who hangs out with Jeff Epstein calling for &quot;world government&quot; to save us from robots. This guy is a complete fraud, and his fame exists ONLY because of his association with organized satanism/freemasonry, and because his disability fits the &quot;diversity&quot; narrative. </p>

            Stephen Hawking doesn't really exist.  It's just a body (maybe body double) that should not be alive with the disease he apparently has.  Has anyone ever seen his lips move?  Who is that voice that is speaking?   Boy, I'm sure the vultures have been laughing for years over this one.  I'm really surprised to see him in that photo however...wtf is up with that.

            How do we know the kikes didn't hack his spaz chair years ago? Some hook nosed bastard could be guiding him around by remote control and sending SMS texts to his speak-a-spaz console. The kike would be collecting his salary + disability.

            The original Hawking is long gone and dead. He was replaced decades ago before his big deal bullshit books were written.
Researchers have even found the name of the impostor and that he fakes everything.
