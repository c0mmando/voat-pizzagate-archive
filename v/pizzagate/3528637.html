<p>child trafficking  hidden agenda              where are they going--------------to wealthy parents---to pedo\'s?</p>
<p>grandparents were told they cant have the baby either</p>
<p>Jill Goss visited a GP for a routine appointment to check a swelling on her baby daughter’s arm. But after an  sequence of events,</p>
<p>her child was taken from her forever and she was thrust into a living nightmare. The mum had their children seized by social services using secretive court care orders. Parents up and down the country are facing court battles each year against councils who are removing </p>
<p>children in record numbers.  Jill, who has not seen her daughter since she was taken by social services and adopted in 2012, said: I think about her every day.</p>
<p>Campaigners and judges have warned of strong-arm tactics by social services who hide under a cloak of secrecy granted by the courts.</p>
<p>Devastated families are being torn apart with thousands of children under the age of one alone taken from parents each year - </p>
<p>many of those removed after birth from hospital wards, that is in the youtube video. Children taken through forced court care orders rocketed by a 34 per cent. Government sources  have investigated the huge leap and that there is &quot;no single reason&quot; for the rise.</p>
<p>The explosion in care cases - with almost 73k  children in care last year - has been described as an &quot;untenable&quot; pressure on courts </p>
<p>by the top High Court family judge Sir Andrew McFarlane.</p>
<p>Public outrage has followed some high-profile cases such as one in June when a judge blasted social workers after they removed a boy, aged eight, from his mother\'s care because she did not take him for an ice cream.</p>
<p>Others include one child taken away because they were too fat and nine children - some as young as two - removed because parents failed to get them to brush their teeth.</p>
<p>For Jill,  the trauma began when she took her baby daughter to see a doctor over a swelling on her arm.</p>
<p>The GP diagnosed a tiny fracture on ten-week-old Alyssa\'s arm and sent her for hospital x-rays which discovered three more fractures</p>
<p>on her legs and ribs. Baby Alyssa had been receiving treatment for vitamin D deficiency but this was dismissed by social workers -</p>
<p>despite doctors\' reports saying this may have led to the fractures. Alyssa\'s father Jon then claimed to have accidentally injured the</p>
<p>child while holding her after they say a police officer and social worker advised them this was the easiest way for Jill to get the child </p>
<p>back. Jon later retracted the statement but a family court judge ruled he had likely injured the girl and that because Jill maintained</p>
<p>he had not harmed his daughter she was not safe to be around the child either. Both Jill and Jon were arrested and held on bail but </p>
<p>after two years the charges were dropped.  At the same time they were involved in a two-year court battle which saw Alyssa put up</p>
<p>for adoption.   Jill, who has not seen her daughter in six years, fled to Spain in 2012 to give birth to her son Loiq after she is said to have received threats from social workers he would be taken from her at birth.But despite UK authorities initially pursuing Jill she now lives happily with her six-year-old boy in southern Spain, alongside the rest of her family.</p>
<p>Jill,  said: &quot;Once we took Alyssa to the Royal Berkshire hospital it started to go very wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;After they found the fractures the police were called in and we had to speak to them.</p>
<p>&quot;Alyssa had been constipated so we\'d been told to massage her stomach but social services said this could not be the reason for</p>
<p>the fracture. Another doctor said there was no way we had injured her though. &quot;We were arrested in the hospital and taken to the</p>
<p>station but I thought I\'d be able to go back and see Alyssa - the police said I could but I was just terrified and distraught.</p>
<p>&quot;Then I signed a document believing it meant Alyssa could stay with her aunt but in fact I\'d signed for her to go into care. They</p>
<p>considered putting me on sedatives but I was still providing breast milk for Alyssa which they were taking to her. &quot;I\'d been lied to - it was horrendous and I later told my solicitor but they didn\'t push this in court.&quot;We were in the court within days and it was clear then Alyssa</p>
<p>was in care - I always believed I would get her back because we had done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>At the High Court he said the social worker\'s criticisms were &quot;utterly insubstantial&quot; and &quot;obviously inconsequential&quot; - describing her report as &quot;very long on rhetoric&quot; but &quot;very short indeed&quot; on &quot;concrete examples&quot; of &quot;deficient&quot; parenting.</p>
<p>There\'s a big government push for adoption which would mean fewer children in care but it\'s had the opposite effect.&quot;</p>

            There are a slew of these stories also in MedicalKidnap.com   Remember Sen. Nancy Schaffer died trying to warn us about the govt. stealing our Children. It’s CPS. Arizona is one of the worst states. Be careful. Singles Moms are vulnerable but poor couples as well. This is a National  Outrage.
