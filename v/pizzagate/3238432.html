<p>As Buck Woodward wrote over the weekend, WWE\'s Ashley Massaro was implicated as being part of an escort service run by Michelle &quot;Nici&quot; Braun in an article that was published in the current issue of Rolling Stone, written by the magazine\'s Contributing Editor Michelle Grigoriadis.</p>
<p>According to Grigoriadis\' piece, the FBI monitored emails between Massaro and &quot;Bella Models&quot; which Braun ran as the front for the escort service, arranging transportation for Massaro in 2004. The monitored emails (and many other email exchanges between the agency and others, models and clients alike, from 2004 through last year) were used as building blocks for a search warrant executed during a raid on Braun\'s home October 2007.</p>
<p>Massaro came out publicly against the allegations almost immediately on her MySpace.com blog, penning, &quot;Just got buzzed on some BS that is going around. Dont believe it for a second. Getting in touch with my lawyer as we speak. No post song because I\'m beyond upset.&quot; Massaro has not commented since.</p>
<p>One theory that began making the rounds online after word of the RS article broke was the idea that WWE\'s Massaro is being confused with another woman who goes by the same name. However, according to Grigoriadis\' piece, Braun\'s escort service was made up almost exclusively of high-end women recruited &quot;from the ranks of Playboy models and porn stars.&quot; It was what set them apart from other agencies and what made Braun her fortune. While Massaro wasn\'t with WWE at the time of the monitored emails, she was indeed, already involved with Playboy.</p>
<p>The timeline mentioned in the Rolling Stone article is very important here. The article noted the year of the FBI monitored emails between Massaro and Bella Models was 2004. That would be a year prior to Massaro winning the 2005 Diva Search competition and signing on with World Wrestling Entertainment full-time.</p>
<p>However, as noted, Massaro would have already been involved with Playboy, modeling under the stage name &quot;Mackenzie Ryan&quot;. In 2003, Massaro took part in Playboy\'s 50th Anniversary Playmate Search, posing for a magazine dedicated to the search. She was also featured as Playboy.com\'s Cyber Girl for January 2004. While WWE has played up a storyline that Ashley\'s character first posed for the magazine in 2007, the reality is that Massaro had appeared previously for Playboy and those pre-WWE appearances do theoretically fit neatly into the same period as the FBI emails cited in the article.</p>
<p>The Rolling Stone piece noted that Braun had been soliciting Playmates through one of Playboy owner Hugh Hefner\'s girlfriends, who, had a connection to Braun and &quot;was willing to solicit other Playmates and [Hefner] girlfriends.&quot; It stands to reason that Massaro would know those who traveled in those circles by virtue of her modeling work for the magazine and the escort service specifically provided services for those looking to meet high-end, beautiful, somewhat celebrity women that would otherwise be unattainable had it not been for the size of the johns\' wallets.</p>
<p>Now, I concede there\'s always a possibility that another woman was using the same name (either legitimately or using a stage name that happened to be Massaro\'s real name) during that time period, but I\'ve been unable to find anything that lends credence to that theory. All research for the name &quot;Ashley Massaro&quot; only turns up information relating to the WWE performer. One reader who actually sent us a link to the &quot;other&quot; Ashley\'s website mistakenly sent us to photos of a pre-WWE, pre-tattooed Ashley.</p>
<p>A case of mistaken identity? Involving Rolling Stone magazine and a writer that has a great track record? Well, the odds that there was a mix-up involving another woman going by the same name (one that isn\'t exactly Jane Doe when it comes to being common), with connections to Playboy during the same time frame as the 2004 emails seems almost astronomical.</p>
<p>Still, despite all that, could this still just be a case of mistaken identity for the self-proclaimed &quot;Dirty, dirty Diva&quot;?</p>
<p>When reached via email over the weekend regarding the Massaro aspect of her Rolling Stone piece, RS Contributing Editor Michelle Grigoriadis didn\'t seem to believe so. When informed of Massaro\'s denial and the online theories, Grigoriadis commented, &quot;Obviously, I stand by my story. Massaro is named in an FBI search warrant that was executed on Michelle Braun\'s property in October, 2007. I have no knowledge of another woman by the same name.&quot;</p>
<p>Gossip website TMZ.com picked up on the Massaro story over the weekend, but were unable to reach World Wrestling Entertainment for comment at the time. As of this writing, WWE has not publicly responded to or acknowledged the story.</p>
<p>World Wrestling Entertainment is taping Raw tonight in Toronto, so Massaro should be scheduled to be at the taping. Should she make a live appearance on the show, we\'ll know soon enough if the Toronto fans acknowledge the story.</p>',

               Yes, thanks for keeping things on track. My ex wife was apparently a call girl prostitute(which in 5 years of marriage i had no idea of til the end) however this evolved into what i believe she was doing in Cambodia(among other places) trafficking children. Many prostitutes come from child abuse backgrounds but this story on Ashley Massaro does NOT directly tie into child abuse or trafficking. Should be on Pizzagate whatever

            This is a very well written &amp; detailed blog written in 2010 by an "anonymous ex Hollywood insider" type who sounds pretty darn legit. It's a really good read &amp; may shed some light on some of what goes on &amp; what these wicked sickos tick in Pedowood.

Ashley Massaro Ram Jammed?
            </p>
            <p>
             Many fans will remember that last year, Rolling Stone Magazine revealed that former WWE Diva Ashley Massaro was allegedly an employee of the high-end escort service run by alleged madam Michelle "Nici" Braun. HollywoodInterrupted.com has now revealed several of the celebrities who were clients of the service - including "The Wrestler" star and WrestleMania guest celebrity Mickey Rourke. Other clients include Courtney Love, Jose Canseco, Charlie Sheen and magician David Blaine.
            </p>
            <p>
             Transcontinental Madam Michelle Braun (mug-shotting above with ex-husband Farrell Kellener) had seen better days leading up to her '07 cocaine bust in Boca. Around the turn of the century, she was reportedly enjoying a 60% commission off her free-spending list of rather obvious clients including: the 'roid raging Jose Canseco, legendary lecher Charlie Sheen, Rick "Scum" Salomon, serious thespian Mickey Rourke, and talent manager Jeff Kwatinetz (who would shell out six-thousand shekels to dip his schmeckle in a former Playmate). Also, one of Braun's former prosties who sub-contracted via a pimp she just settled a six-figure claim against reports that creepy magic guy David Blaine was a frequent Nici's Girls client, and even lapsed Kabbalah enthusiast Courtney Love would often order up girls for threesomes with her boyfriend.
            </p>
            <p>
             Madam Braun has reportedly been under investigation since 2000, But she slipped up in 2007 when she electronically pimped out another Playmate to an undercover operative in Orange County for $15,000. Identified only by her initials in court documents, a source close to the investigation tells Hollywood, Interrupted that the harlot in question was none other than former Playboy Playmate, Carrie Stevens. And, from the looks of her specs, the undercover agent would have gotten his money's worth.However, Hollywood,Interrupted has learned that former Playmate Stevens claims she does not know Michelle Braun, and has never engaged in prostitution. Fair enough. Incoming e-mail messages now suggest that the hooker in question is Playmate of the Month for May 2002, Christi Shake. So many alleged Playmate prostitutes, so little time for Madam Michelle. The burning question now is did Randy "The Ram" Ram Jam Ashley Massaro?

Ashley Massaro VS Ashley Massaro!
              </p>
              <p>
               Here are the mysterious details about the two Ashley’s:
              </p>
              <p>
               1- On the left in the bikini is an alleged Las Vegas model who happens to have the same name as WWE wrestling diva, Ashley Massaro. The WWE Ashley Massaro has been fingered in an escort scandal by the FBI and Rolling Stone magazine. Fans of Ashley are trying to say that the girl in the bikini is a dead ringer for Ashley with the same name who is actually the one implicated in the whole mess.
              </p>
              <p>
               2- There are two Ashley Massaros. One is our favorite ex WWE diva, the other is a model who supposedly lives in Las Vegas. Both women have the same name, and the two were often mistaken for each other in the past which is why WWE Ashley went by Ashley Marie Massaro before she joined WWE. To make life more exciting both women look freakishly similar, but the Vegas Ashley is said to be younger than the ex WWE diva.
              </p>
              <p>
               3- Philly Burbs journalist Eric Gargiulo has spoken to a few people close to the Ashley Massaro escort scandal story, and they are saying that the Ashley Massaro named by Rolling Stone is indeed the WWE Diva. Gargiulo's sources are saying that the timing fits right and considering that the girl in question was advertised from New York City, it's a pretty big giveaway.
              </p>
              <p>
               4- Ashley's profile did in fact exist on the website of the Los Angeles based "Bella Models" escort agency, but no pictures were found. Although, Massaro's name was never erased from the website. The page said that Massaro was based out of New York City. Of course, the WWE Diva is from Long Island, New York, which is nearby New York City. The page also listed her nightly booking fee at whopping $25,000.
              </p>
              <p>
               5- At the moment, it appears as though that the WWE Diva's lone saving grace is Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer saying that there is, or at least was, "another Ashley Massaro" based out of Las Vegas. The alleged Massaro is a bikini model who won some major bikini competitions in 2003 and 2004, according to Meltzer. Additionally, the alleged Massaro is three years younger than the WWE Diva. People have trying to find information online on the supposed bikini model, but no one's been able to pull up up anything on her. Even if a Las Vegas based Ashley Massaro does indeed exist, the only other possible explanation that the person named by Rolling Stone is not the WWE Diva is if the Las Vegas bikini model happened to live in New York City in 2003-2004 as well, and that's a pretty big stretch.
              </p>
              <p>
               In conclusion, well honestly we at WWEGossip are a bit stumped. Are there two Ashley Massaro if so this could be a very lucrative storyline fore WWE or even TNA.
