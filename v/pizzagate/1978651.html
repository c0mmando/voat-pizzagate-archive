            We know infraguard, stratfor, and many other "intelligence agencies" are aimed at us.  We know that organized crime has evolved. Don't take your safety for granted.  These are the skeletons in the closet that people kill to keep hidden.  Judging by the players involved; we are very close to a major paradigm changing event.

              We live in an age where "data collection" is priority number one. If you think the goverment is the only entity capable of spying on ones communications you are as crazy as the shit that you type.  Or intentionally deflecting. ...funny, a special forces vet once said that same exact line to me in regards to average people being stalked and spied on. Infragaurd is real. Stratfor= real. Organized crime = real, its npt a stretch to assume i may have hit a nerve with information i have discovered. For someone who doesn't know anything about me you sure reply to my comments to tell me what you think you know about me often.

               I believe you.  Had the same thing happen to 2 friends back in the 70's before all this data collection was possible.  They said there is an underground that is so inner connected...ppl that you would think are ordinary.  Scared the shit out of them and this was way before the 'spricy' network was so developed.  They crossed the mafia, Julliard ballerina thing I posted about couple of weeks ago and were deff stalked thousands of miles away.  Most everyone thought they were crazy cept for few of us that knew them and knew how the dark side works.  It would seem within the rhelm of logical that locally pedo's would run their own vigilante networks...bc they have a lot at stake/this is the core of their very lives...consumption of children in one way or another.  This consumption is critical to their beliefs in offerings to the dark side for power.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another thing to consider is might not have to data collect to find out who you are...they also play with mind reading.  Just 'what if' they tune themselves to particular thoughts like radar?  If that might be the case then learn how to control your thoughts/meditation is fantastic for this btw.  We have the misconception that we can hide our thoughts from others when in reality we are connected via a vast web of information.  Those that learn how to read minds simply put focus on the ability.  Someone into the dark arts would certainly find this a beneficial skill to perfect.  You have Chi masters use this for good/so dark apprentices could just as easily use it for evil.
              </p>
              <p>
               Stay safe~my friend said they seem to come out more at night.  Might want to keep that in mind.

                 Consider most of the professional debaters are employees of
                 <em>
                  fill in the blank
                 </em>
                 , not all but certainly a large gathering.  I just ignore them.  I'll answer a question and when it looks like someone is wanting to take it into a debate just move on.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I say this bc there are those that need to be aware of the psi stuff.  Many would not even know it is important to protect self and have command over thoughts outgoing and incoming.  Then again the professional debaters might want to keep the discussion mute/so they wear posters out with endless looping debates.
                </p>
                <p>
                 They keep trying to do it with Racine but Racine is not going away.  There is a reason why Racine is so important which eventually might be understood...but the debaters are sure on it like a fly on shit lol.  Same with psi.  Take clues from what they try and circumvent and then you know where to focus :)

               Ok man, let's put this into perspective.  I'm not going to be cruel and say that you are being paranoid, most of the time that is true for people, but sometimes it is not.
              </p>
              <p>
               An operation, such as what you are talking about would require massive data gathering.
              </p>
              <p>
               You would have to conduct gathering from key sites (4chan, 8chan, voat, reddit, facebook).  Of course most of this information is for sale and not hard to gather.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then correlation, which would really only require a handful of engineers and some free software.  This might only take a couple of months to get the platform setup, so we'll exclude time involved.
              </p>
              <p>
               Once that is completed you will have a subset of users who have in essence doxed themselves.  You could go further with the data collection and get information from ISPs, but that would be unnecessary for the operation.  There will be a handful of people that have given you their general location, their picture, and their activities.
              </p>
              <p>
               Next step would be figuring out how to intermediate people without direct connection to you.  Internet messaging would be the cheapest way.  Bounce through a couple of proxies and send an email.  Not the scariest of methods.  People get doxxed often, and most people will just file a report with the police and be on their way (after scrubbing their history).
              </p>
              <p>
               So, getting you would have to move to a personal level.  Recruitment of people to do the work for you is much easier in cities than it is in the rural areas, so your pool of victims shrinks.  You hire on a couple of people who are sympathetic to your cause and pay a couple of hundred dollars.  They shadow you for a while finding where you go to do your normal thing.  Inside of a public area they whisper vague references to make you think you're crazy and you blab it on the web.
              </p>
              <p>
               Intended result, fear an paranoia in your cause.  Cost, probably &lt; $100k.  Result, not so effective, but it does have a mood shift.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another way of getting that intended result that any of us could do.  Blab on the internet that all of this is going down.  Maybe hire on a couple of actors to follow you so that you have "proof".  Cost, far less that $100k.

                Before i blab that hipsters called me out in kroger? You are going through alot of work to disprove something that I experienced. I know what the little chomo looked me in my eye and said. Nothing you can type will convince me that it did not happen. Its not like a made a youtube vid, posted everywhere and started selling shirts.  I am aware of OTO within 10 miles, freemasons within 5 and Cia everywhere so gtfo with that denial.

                 BTW, given that you said it's true.  The organization required to perform an action like this, as I've lined out is completely within the realm of possibility.  Pedo's have more than enough of a networking and resources to pull it off.  Sorry to hear you got caught in their drag net.

                 Not disproving you.  I have pschizo-typal pd.  The paranoia in my brain is cranked to the max, and mild hallucinations.  If the shit looked you in the eye, then yes you are not being paranoid.  Although why you didn't walk up to him and confront him I do not know.  But, whatever (I type at 75 wpm when I'm using the computer and not my phone, that took me like two minutes to get out my thought).

            False flags take alot of time and effort...they have NOT been doing a good job lately..CPP perp is easy to dissect if any reasonable journalist would look into it, easy to blow that lid off...even the big events like the tower in England are mired with bad actors who have appeared repeatedly (how did those Sandy Hook parents get to...England?)...if they do it will be sloppy sloppy sloppy and that is good news for us...
           </p>
           <p>
            I kinda have a new personal mantra...these folks feed on fear right?  Or at least they try to create fear as a positive..so what would they NOT like?  What say a little love.  Meeting these choads with LOVE and BOUNDARIES appears useful...and have had a few direct encounters...

            Didn't I say earlier that the Deep State would try to pull some false flag regarding targeting the media for their "fake news" narrative.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would make sense for the culprit to be a "right wing nut case" emphasis on the quotations, as that would fit the fake news narrative which could EASILY be used against US on voat.

            I think it was a few days ago actually.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition, anti semitic comments and threads have been sprouting like daisys here. Almost as if the Deep State is trying to plant evidence that pizzagaters are all anti semites.

           <p>
            That's got False Flag Hoax written all over it. No Deplorable Horde soldier would ever bring children into this. That's the whole reason we're here after all: to protect children from Deep State Pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I agree. The first sign of the False Flag was the fact the guy who made the meme was Russian and apologized in English. That's bizarre. Why would a Russian guy even care let alone apologize. Russians don't apologize for shit like that. They celebrate.

            This is going to be another Smith-Mundt special. The guy will have an assault rifle with a high capacity magazine probably.

             The Russian flag on his account could easily have been a joke. A lot of those Redditors were ironically labeling themselves Russian, and posting in Russian for a while. The mods even changed the language of some of the sub from English to Russian

            There was a screenshot from 4chan saying it was going to be either Alefantis or one of the Podesta Bros.  John has been extremely mouthy on Twitter.
