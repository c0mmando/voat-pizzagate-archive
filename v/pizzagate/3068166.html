            Arkansas, home of bill clinton....wal mart and tysons chicken....hillary was on the wal mart board of directors....tysons chicken has been named for transporting drugs across America......also having some awful genectically modified  chickens. Wal mart can be thanked for closing down thousands of family businesses across our country resulting in ghost towns........same for amazon and fast foods. Not fair market at all when they can sell at reduced prices by buying in bulk. T. Roosevelt would not have approved.

            People who hate Christians so much that they went and created a religion glorifying evil in order to mock them. They can call themselves atheists all they want but idolizing a goat-headed hermaphrodite is worship and it doesn't matter if they actually believe in it. If it wasn't about hating Christians they would have chosen something else to get their point across.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's only a matter of time before the 'true believers' move in and co-opt it or splinter off and start their own cult if it hasn't happened already. And at that point it will cease to be sarcastic, edgy, atheist humor. You can't build something out of hatred and expect anything positive to come from it.

             Yes, but atheists are some of the most delusional people I've ever encountered (and I sincerely wish it were not so), and finding one who is objective and open-minded, scientific, is almost impossible. The cognitive dissonance displayed by most atheists is almost unbearable and takes enormous energy to critique, because there is simply so much wrong with it.
            </p>
            <p>
             "In addition, although many atheists deny that atheism is a worldview, atheists commonly share a number of beliefs such as naturalism, belief in evolution and abiogenesis.[3]" Atheism is certainly a religion. And I've never met an atheist who does not believe in these three core ideas, it's almost universal. They have no alternative.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Some atheists have become rather dogmatic. Terribly certain in their conviction that there is no God and anyone who thinks there is is a deluded and dangerous fool. ,,,atheists are becoming as intransigent about their own views as the people they so despise.
Atheism is becoming a religion of its own. It already has its gurus and its revered sacred texts... It has its magnificent temples within which lie mysteries and unknowable truths." -The Trouble with Atheism

              "English Pastor Daniel Smartt defines atheism as a religion, using Ninian Smart's seven dimensions of worldview as a list of criteria. It is not necessary in Smartt's model for every one of these to be present in order for something to be a religion.[10]. However, it can be argued that all seven are present in the case of atheism:
             </p>
             <p>
              Narrative - this dimension is concerned with stories which explain the origin of the universe and the human life. For Christians, there is the Book of Genesis. For atheists, the Big Bang theory, the abiogenesis hypothesis, the evolutionary paradigm, etc., play a similar role[11] See: Evolution as a secular origins myth
Experiential - this dimension is concerned with personal or spiritual experiences. Many religious believers report experiences of being near to God. Many atheists report an experience of "liberation" in the moment when they first rejected God[12]
Social - the social dimension of religion is concerned with religious leadership and community in congregations. Contemporary atheism has its own leadership (authors such as Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris) and social gatherings (e.g. the Global Atheist Convention held in Melbourne, Australia)[13]
Ethical - this dimension is concerned with the ethical teachings of a religion. Logically speaking, if there is no God, how can there be any objective ethics? Ethics is reduced to each person's individual whims. Despite this, the leaders of atheism are insistent that they do have ethics, and even claim to have better ethics than religious people[14]
Doctrinal - this dimension is concerned with the philosophical teachings of a religion, its claims about the ultimate nature of reality. Some of the central dogmas of atheism include the non-existence of God, the non-existence of afterlife or an immortal soul, that all which exists is ultimately reducible to matter (materialism), and that faith is illegitimate[15]
Ritual[16] - this dimension is concerned with rituals, the celebration of rites, ceremonies or festivals. Although atheism at present has few rituals, there are explicitly atheist versions of rituals to celebrate major life events (birth, marriage, death), and some atheists have proposed annual festivals to substitute for Christmas or Easter, such as Charles Darwin's birthday (Darwin Day). See also: Atheism, rites and rituals
Material[17] - this dimension is concerned with the physical artifacts of a religion, such as buildings, monuments, art, etc., and with physical places considered sacred. Many atheists argue that all nature is sacred.
All of these seven dimensions are present for atheism, and hence atheism is a religion under Smartt's model. Although atheism possesses some of these elements more strongly than others, Smart's model does not require all of these dimensions to be present, or present equally, for the existence of religion to be established."

            Lucien Greaves allegedly is also member of the Church of Satan, so imo the allgedly 'atheistic' Satanic Temple is only a scheme to attract some new followers by luring them into Satanism with the atheist bait.
