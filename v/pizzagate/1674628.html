<p>Considering people would go so far to frame him in a ricin attack involving the president makes this relevant Pizzagate information if you ask me.

            Curtis' story doesn't add up.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             He owns a cleaning business and "lands a contract" with the hospital, yet is required to use a hospital timeclock like an employee?  If he is an independent contrator, why does he care about Mexicans "getting more overtime?"  Makes no sense.
            </li>
            <li>
             "The largest non-metro hospital in America" according to WHOM?  By what parameters -- # of beds, $ made, ...?
            </li>
            <li>
             The photos on his "book" page of "body parts" are FAKE!!  Detail is missing (fingernails, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
             He claims that he 'freaked out" (my paraphrase) upon discovering the fridge full of "body parts."  WHO took the photos?  Those parts were OUT of the fridge and laid out (with blood to boot, which you will NOT find in a Path Dept./Morgue).  Did he assemble them, then take pictures?  FAIL.
            </li>
            <li>
             "Legal documents" (mostly correspondence) he produced lack substance.  Where are the rulings?  (I only perused the first two links; once I smelled the BS I decided not to spend more time on it.)
            </li>
