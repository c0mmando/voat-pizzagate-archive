<p>One more organ harvesting find.  Amazingly, I wasn\'t able to find this talked about on Voat even though it was big news back in the day.

Reportedly, when asked about it responded, &quot;But I don\'t even eat rice!&quot;  
</p>
<p>Well, it turns out not only did they have to release him because of not having any solid proof but that before that he had discovered a bunch of human dismembered body parts in a refrigerator at the North Mississippi Medical Center (NMMC).  He wrote a book about it called &quot;Missing Pieces.&quot;  NMMC is the largest non-metropolitan hospital in America.  The man who is now thought to have sent those letters is Everett Dutschke, a failed candidate for Mississippi state representative.  Dutschke is also charged with having fondled three underage girls.   
</p>
<p>Considering people would go so far to frame him in a ricin attack involving the president makes this relevant Pizzagate information if you ask me.  His claims are pretty clearly vindicated by the info that has gone into the Pizzagate investigation. The organ harvesting, clearly, goes very deep.</p>',

            Curtis' story doesn't add up.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             He owns a cleaning business and "lands a contract" with the hospital, yet is required to use a hospital timeclock like an employee?  If he is an independent contrator, why does he care about Mexicans "getting more overtime?"  Makes no sense.
            </li>
            <li>
             "The largest non-metro hospital in America" according to WHOM?  By what parameters -- # of beds, $ made, ...?
            </li>
            <li>
             The photos on his "book" page of "body parts" are FAKE!!  Detail is missing (fingernails, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
             He claims that he 'freaked out" (my paraphrase) upon discovering the fridge full of "body parts."  WHO took the photos?  Those parts were OUT of the fridge and laid out (with blood to boot, which you will NOT find in a Path Dept./Morgue).  Did he assemble them, then take pictures?  FAIL.
            </li>
            <li>
             "Legal documents" (mostly correspondence) he produced lack substance.  Where are the rulings?  (I only perused the first two links; once I smelled the BS I decided not to spend more time on it.)
            </li>
