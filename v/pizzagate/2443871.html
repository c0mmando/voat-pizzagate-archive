<p>INFAMOUS CHINESE ORGAN HARVESTER INVITED TO HUMAN RIGHTS SUMMIT AT VATICAN</p>
<p>Excellent article <a href="https://sentinel.tw/china-global-leadership-narrative-vatican/">here</a> explaining the significance of the presence of notorious Chinese transplantation surgeons at a human rights meeting entitled “Modern Slavery, Human Trafficking, and Access to Justice for the Poor and Vulnerable” at the Pontifical Academies of Sciences and Social Sciences which opened yesterday.</p>
<p>The meeting was hailed by the Chinese state-run paper, <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1092671.shtml">Global Times</a>, in this glowing headline: &quot;China to attend Vatican meeting against organ trafficking to boost exchange.&quot;  The meeting is &quot;a step in the controversial diplomatic warming between Beijing and the Vatican which will “boost people-to-people exchanges” in the context of Beijing-Vatican relations. It is an advance in “relations between the two peoples” and is “beneficial to people from the two sides.”</p>
<p>Dr. Huang Jiefu is infamous for harvesting organs from Chinese prisoners. This is esp. troubling in light of the fact that Pope Francis is currently negotiating a deal with the Chinese Patriotic Church <a href="http://nationalpost.com/opinion/terry-glavin-is-the-pope-abandoning-chinas-christians-to-beijings-brutal-regime">selling out</a> the faithful underground Catholic Church. The deal would in effect further criminalize the underground Church by removing papal support, making it far easier for the Chinese govt to round up Catholics in the catacomb Church and place them in re-education camps, leaving them at the mercy of the brutal ChiCom regime.</p>

            It’s weird to this pope in action. I’m watching to see how Catholics respond. I have a lot of respect, and find many sincere believers that are Catholic, it breaks my heart to see how far these sincere ones are from their upper leaderships that we investigate here. Worlds apart.

             Catholics for the most part are very good little sheeple, but this pope is testing the limits of their endurance. "Conservatives" are finally starting to realize something is very wrong.

            NOT JUST CHINA:
"In the early 1980s a new form of human trafficking, a global trade in kidneys from living persons to supply the needs and demands of ‘transplant tourists’, emerged in the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. The first scientific report on the phenomenon, published in The Lancet in 1990, documented the transplant odysseys of 131 renal patients from three dialysis units in the United Arab Emirates and Oman. They travelled with their private doctors to Bombay (now Mumbai), India, where they were transplanted with kidneys from living ‘suppliers’ organized by local brokers trolling slums and shantytowns. The sellers were paid between $2,000 and $3,000 for a ‘spare’ organ. On return, these transplant tourists suffered an alarming rate of post-operative complications and mortalities resulting from mismatched organs, and infections including HIV and Hepatitis C. There was no data on, or discussion of, the possible adverse effects on the kidney sellers, who were still an invisible population of anonymous supplier bodies, similar to deceased donors."

"Later, she is also expected to attend a function organized by a local organization, which works with the Clinton Foundation. She will also be interacting with children at a local school in Maheshwar before retiring for the day to the hotel.

            What a Laugh.    “China, once an organ transplant pariah, is now accepted as global leader after reform, papal recognition.” – Global Times, Sept. 9, 2017.    China is guilty of allowing thousands of trafficking victims be stolen out of the country every year.  This is their reward.  Not a big surprise, since jorge bergoglio let many babies be taken and sent out of Argentina before becoming pope.  He has also faced accusations and charges with crimes in the Dirty War.  The pope is dirty.

             Surreal, isn't it? This makes me wonder even more if that hospital in Rome which Pope Francis bailed out with Papal Foundation money is connected to organ harvesting. Would be a neat little circle, wouldn't it?

              OOH, I was am so convinced the hospital was into organ harvesting through stem cells.  A nice neat little package.  And elites are paying for it through the Papal Found.  Does this possibly allow them the benefit of on call organs?  Idk, but possibly another neat little package for the elites.  Nothing is too low a stoop for them.

               It’s not just organs. Check out CRiSPR 9 gene-editing technology. There taking that to the next level. Stem cells will be obsolete when CRISPR becomes more marketable. They don’t care if stem cells are illegal, when gene editing can be their path to immortality. Check out the TED speeches on CRISPR. You will trip out.

                The MOD  March of Dimes is guilty of lying to mothers that they are not selling baby parts.  It is in a PDF that I cannot include here, but it is there. There is a whistle blower that claims they are doing just that.  I am about to throw up.
