As of this writing my  six and a half year investigation into my past has always pointed to me and Johnny Gosch being the same person that was perpetrated as part of the monarch mind control and telepathy research project And that I was used as a young child to compromise G Bush so he could be raisin to power.
I need help with my investigation into my past that is directly linked to pedogate. I know who did what, I was there. I am not anything like what people think I am. I was a very functioning person for many years prier to my awakening to memories that were hidden in my mind  behind amnesic barriers. I realize how unbelievable this sounds but I have a lot of physical evidence, including Johnny\'s birthmarks and some of his memories. I have been investigating my emerging memories for over 6 and a half years now. Almost all of them point to me being Johnny Gosch. I also have memories that belong to Johnny, like my mom making me that castle cake and others where John , Johnny\'s father took him to a child sex rooms many times where I was there also. My programmer had me change places with Johnny a lot and unlike everybody else involved that was subjected to ritual abuse that have more than twenty alters (personalities) I only have one and my alter is Johnny Gosch. I have memories of being on the beds that Noreen has on her site. I remember right after the kidnapping that I was subjected to massive electric brain shock that was quite painful. I remember them saying &quot;Adam died, why don\'t we make him Adam.&quot; Then &quot;how are we going to do that &quot; then&quot;we can use the system backwards&quot; speaking about using ritual abuse where the alter becomes the front personality and the original personality becomes the alter. These and the fact that I have Johnny\'s birthmarks and a few of his memories is turning my life upside down. Currently the mathematical odds of me being Johnny are greater than that of me being Adam. There are other issues involved with these odds also.  My memories of the cover up are more than twice the known facts to date. Also: Noreen the mom, like myself have been subjected to Satanic ritual abuse (criminal hypnotism) which is much about memory manipulation. Therefore Noreen like myself are only about 80% correct. Sorry but that is just the nature of ritual abuse. So just because you find one mistake, don\'t throw out the rest. The truth is somewhere between My story line and Noreen\'s story line The facts as I currently see them are as follows;
. I am the person that Noreen Gosch says was Johnny Gosch that visited her in March of 1997.( which was just another part of the cover up) Some of my supporting evidence is: I have all Johnny\'s birthmarks. ( I calculate the MATHMATICAL odds at 1 in 100 trillion that there is a high level connection to the cover up and the odds of me being Johnny Gosch are significant. These Include a large birthmark shaped like south America on my left chest. A very large birthmark that runs on right side of my chest. This birthmark is clearly with in the perimeters of what they would look like after 35 years as the Photos of Johnny bound on the beds on Noreen\'s web site johnnygosch.com and my photos on my profile in development at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008330380453">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008330380453</a> It was me while I was in an hypnotic trance the entire time and my programmer and his student. The truth is that Noreen was subjected to programming while I was there where they altered her memories. This is called mind control because we are all the sum of our memories. I have been unable to determine my true identity because the FBI have been running the cover up. And the leadership of the FBI does not miss a chance to attack my credibility. Johnny was kidnapped by the leadership department of the Illuminati called the hidden hand. (AKA shadow Government) There is an interview with a guy that calls himself Hidden Hand that is easy to find that will give everybody a good ideal of what they believe. President Bush was a member of this group. Therefore Government kidnapping. Fact is it was Bush that had most of the child sex evidence destroyed at the national center for missing and exploited children that is operated by the FBI. I need help with my plan to establish a nonprofit that will do the investigating exposing and will be overseen by a think tank. to finish my investigation into my past that will be responsible for administering a web site where all information about the pedos will be exposed. I can departmentalize the Johnny Gosch evidence where it will become understandable to most people. If anybody has any intelligent questions I will answer a few yes and no questions. Noreen is about 80% correct but she refuses to realizes that she is a highly controlled monarch slave that is a talking mouth for the cover up. I was the same way before I started to awaken 6 and a half years ago When my amnesic barriers started breaking down, allowing the memories behind them to conscientiously emerge. I\'m not going into how ritual abuse works. endritualabuse dot com FYI I know most of the people in the 200 plus photos that the nonpedos left at Noreen\'s. They are the irrefutable proof and were left for my use. I do not want to cause Noreen any hardship so please respect my wishes of not involving her in this discussion. Sadly in order to tell the complete truth and have it understood there are a few fact that I have had to disclose about her. I have waited a long time and have suffered much in an effort to respect her. But there are children being hurt right now as I type this and will also be when you read it. We can protect many thousands of children by just exposing 10 percent of the cases. This is very easy to do. It is a generational blood line cult that about 10% become perpetrators and the rest including me and Noreen are sacrificed to become monarch slaves that are unknowingly used to further there agenda. The FBI knows how to trace a family tree and have eye balls to observe with. The order came from Washington DC that will not allow any FBI to investigate what I am saying. This is what I have been told twice by the FBI and even more times from the NCMEC because it is run by The FBI. Furthermore: I have a lifetime of information that is linked to this case. They have been covering up the cover up for years now. Did you know that nobody has Johnny\'s fingerprints? these could have been gotten years later but nobody involved got them, NOBODY. This is the reason everybody is looking for the birthmarks. Ted Gunderson found me in South Texas and was paid over 50K to turn the investigation away from me so he Ted concocted the Jeff Gannon connection. It all serves to confuse the public. These people put me on a plane on 9/11 with a stop that landed between the two planes hitting and talked about something that was going to happen on the east coast. Protection of the children need to be the first priority and this entire Johnny Gosch thing has been purposefully engineered to expose everything in an irrefutable way. Let us all not allow the powers to be to instigate infighting like what they have attempted to do between me and Noreen. It will only work to protect the pedos as a delaying action. constructive suggestions sought. END</p>',

            There are two photos of me taken less than 3 years ago that clearly show my birthmarks. These are the evidence that nobody seems to want to look at. What kind of investigator would not look at evidence like that. It is the only evidence I have that is easily understood that gives the rest of the information I have any creditability. The FBI is already one step ahead of me and has been spreading false reports saying "he must have put them on himself to get attention" to local law enforcement and has never sent me to a dr. to have them examined. I have no intention of releasing any information that can be covered up to anybody but the think tank that must be set up to deal with it because only they will know how to look into it. If pizza gate doesn't want to do anything, I am going to quit pounding my head against this wall that people don't even want to see. Why should I waist my time looking for evidence when everybody is to scared to look at it. From now on , I will only correspond with people that are willing to look at the evidence the way I posted it in my first post. Then we can debate the evidence and determine how we can proceed. PM me only after looking at the evidence for further contact info.

             The conversation was not addressing the private independent investigative group with a non profit to fund it nor the think tank that will lead it, Because of the sensitive nature of most of the evidence, I have been very careful to not allow the cover up to know anything about anything that can be covered up. Therefore; the think tank and the non profit comes first because it will need to manage and compartmentalize the investigation to maintain secrecy so things aren't covered up. These groups are created and managed by think tanks and can only be taken apart the same way. If anybody has the skills or resources, and the time to help me move forward, please PM me. My time is best spent doing memory work.

             Furthermore, WhyAserverWasBuilt, even if he isn't Johnny and he is trying to find out who he is it is not your business to stand in his way. You have no business telling him what to do or what he can and cannot do.

            Adam, another question about something I never quite understood. Paul Bonacci would say that he'd fly to D.C., Bohemian Grove and, of course, to kidnap you hundreds of miles away, etc... but he gives the impression that he still lived with his family. How was it possible for him to do so much traveling around the country? I mean, was he kidnapped at the same time that his sisters boyfriend began taking him to Offutt for programming or.... well, I guess if you say that Noreen is programmed that maybe Paul's parents and family are too so that they wouldn't have questioned his multitude of prolonged absences???

             In most illuminati families there is only one person allowed to be awake and is normally a skilled programmer. What people need to understand is that they spend 30 plus years learning the craft. It is a mentor protégé relationship that last half there life. They always operate in these teems and are always protected if cault by one quick call to the CIA. our government down plays the power of hypnosis. Only hypnosis is needed to get any information they want from anybody. Water boarding is used as the trauma required to create amnesic barriers in adults. This allows them to be programmed into unknowing double agents before release. Ritual abuse is the foundation of the NWO's power. Everybody is programmed, we are born sleeping.

              Is there a group of people above the Illumaniti families that is fully awake to control the Illuminati families? Seems like there would need to be a group of awake people above them to keep the Illuminati families running.

             we all need to establish a think tank first, This must be able to counter the illuminati's think tank leadership model. It must have all educational bases covered so the plans made by it don't have any weak areas that can be exploited. under the think tank there will be the membership, a non profit and later a company. The think tank can answer your question the best. Please help me put a think tank together.

            I'm 100% blown away. Been obsessed with everything "Johnny Gosch" for a few years now; would even study the pictures of Gannon and Gosch for any similarities. Wow! Okay, so here's a question that I'm pretty sure we'd all like to know. I apologize if someone's already asked it already; just a long thread that I haven't had time to read yet.

             John Gosch was a pedo and subjected Johnny to ritual abuse starting before five years old. John was also there after the visit in 97 where I was taken out of the back of the van into the head lights so he could see me. I suspect he tried to take me because there was some kind of confrontation. IDK but I remember people asking the who did it question and the answer was always Aton caused/fault (levey)

               Both families that raised Johnny and Adam are from the same illuminati blood line family. AND ritual abuse is what they do, they even use it on themselves much of it Is very good for you

               Noreen is a highly programmed monarch slave that  is unknowingly used to  help steer the cover-up. I have told Noreen most everything I say here but she is responsible for some evidence being covered up. Currently she is not a trusted partner and I have not spoken to her in over a ,year  because she has betrayed my trust and caused delay in my investigation. For Johnny's sake, I truly hope I do not uncover anything that points to her being a perpetrator. Noreen has known about the birthmarks for 6 years. the FBI is telling local law enforcement that "I must have but them on myself to get attention" without ever doing any medical test and talking to me less than an hour.

                I showed you what I can see on your site and the pictures you reference are not visible to me. Do people have to be on your friends list to see your pictures? Maybe I can't see them because I don't have facebook. I'm not sure, but they are not visible to me.
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                If you can see the pics you can do this. In the search box in the lower left hand corner type "snipping" and it will find the "snipping tool." You can use it to save a pic of the pics on your facebook page.
               </p>
               <hr/>
               <p>
                Then you can go to www.catbox.moe and upload them. It will give you a url and the url will be where the pic is stored. Then you can paste the url here like I did of your facebook page. Then we can see the pics.
               </p>

                I have look at this site.
                <a href="http://johnnygosch.com/">
                 http://johnnygosch.com/
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                It appears to be Noreen's site. Do you think her handlers are using that site to milk money out of the Johnny Gosch situation and put up a front of concern?
               </p>
               <p>
                What about the origin of the pictures on that site? Who do you think would have sent them to Noreen? Do you think her handlers are periodically putting them up to keep money coming in so they can steal it?

                 the photos on her site read like a family photo album I know everything about the photos. They are the irrefutable proof needed to and there is a lot more where they came from and DNA evidence from the bedding if I can find it. I have lost access to my Johnny Gosch Facebook account because it was in my laptop that got stolen last week.

                   these people never throw away evidence as good as that. They can't get caught because the CiA is just a phone call away and it is illegal to interfere with there operations. I know where to look

            Adam, being that you know so much about the shadow government and Illuminati, what are your thoughts on Trump? Many believe he is out to get the pedos as many have been arrested since he was in office. I’m curious what your take is on him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, I know you’re having trouble figuring out who you really are, but I’m just curious how you are doing now? You obviously have a home to stay in and internet access, I hope my question is not too invasive but are you staying with a family member, friend, etc. and are you safe there?

             I do not conceder myself safe but have become used to it. I am continually subjected to psychological warfare tactics, mostly by elements of the ground crews of  homelands securities aerostat based surveillance operations and the black operations they are working with. Trump, IDK. he is most likely a sleeper.

              This is what you're facebook page looks like to me. Only one picture at the top. Is there more? I don't have facebook so maybe a person has to be signed in to see the rest of the pictures?

            The US government kidnapped Johnny Gosch and subjected him to unbelievable trauma. This is absolute fact that they will never admit. They will disappear me and attack my creditability in ways I can not even begin to think about. The FBI has had full knowledge of Me for over 6 years and is part of the homeland security department that is threatening to have me disappeared for continuing to speak out. They are killing everybody that attempts to help me.

            Because I am a poster child, If anything happens to me It will trigger an escalation in the internal war going on between the pedos and the nonpedos with in the system and may cause the fighting to move  into the streets. This entire thing about me has been engineered starting over 20 years ago to play some part in there plan. I was told originally 15 years ago that it was to take place about now and might have something to do with an alien false flag biological attack they had planed to kill off over half the world population within the first year alone . I Highly suspect they are working with the Angels who are real and live in the spit world and will use the monarch children to manifest the angels so they can be called aliens that they plan to blame the attack on. But I myself do not understand what they have planed because they always change things up at the last moment. Regardless they will never admit anything and it will be me that ends up suffering and no body else will care , just like the last 6 years where I have asked over 2000 powerful originations and people to help me with all of them doing no thing or dying.
I'm going to help my friend fix his kitchen cabinets today and have to go. They can't hurt me any more than they already have so I am not scared of anything they can do 
 I am happy that I am awake.
My life mission is to awaken everybody in this great awakening that was triggered by our civilization entering into the information age.
 WAKE UP EVERYBODY AWAKE MEANS ANGEL. 
To be awake is to be able to interact with the angels.

             Noreen is only allowed to work with the controlled media. I need her working with me and need to have her awakened. I know who her handler is and because I have achieved a high level of awakening I can quickly identify other people's slave status,  programming type and level of awakening.

             I do not identify as Johnny, My name is Adam. Therefore please do not call me Johnny. If my Johnny Gosch personality is in fact the real Johnny Gosch that part me has been so traumatized that all he does is cry. I,  Adam, find it almost impossible to communicate with the Johnny part of me because his tears run from my eyes when he expresses himself within me
.
 I have chosen not to be used for profit or propaganda. When I realized that there were more lies than truths in my life, I chose to express the truth as best I can. Only the truth can truly set me free.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will not go in front of any cameras that will be used to expand on the lies being told. The truth is way more complex and disturbing than most people are able to comprehend. Therefore; will need to be taught not told.

            I have studied this case for 14 years. I have a few questions. There was much written and said about the birthmark. What was said is they tried to remove it and there is a scar from that but you can tell where it was. You don't talk about them trying to remove it. Did you have any children in your life? That's my second question. Why do the photos you post look nothing like Johnny that have been in the books as he was growing up before he was kidnapped? (Why would you even have access to those photos since you were taking abruptly from your home?) Thank you.

             Most of what you studied was misinformation inserted into the cover up by Ted Gunderson after he was compromised in south Texas. 
Ask yourself Why does Johnny have my birthmarks? Then do the math.

            I’m just a little confused so please bear with me, I’m trying to understand. So your real name is Adam but you have a personality named Johnny who is a 5 year old boy. You have the same birth marks as Johnny Gosch, but you couldn’t be him because the pictures of the boy on your Facebook look very young. Johnny was 12 when he was taken and a very tall kid (5’7). The kid in the picture looks about 10 and much shorter than 5’7. Do you believe you are the original Johnny Gosch or only used as a prop to visit Noreen in 1997 to erase/alter her memories?

             you are looking at the wrong photos on Facebook look at the photos where my birthmarks are clearly visible.. furtheremore I do not know if I am Johnny or not. But I can do math and I have researched my memories in order to determine there creditability. I have a lot of evidence that is POINTING to me being Johnny.

              Adam, will you show us a current picture of yourself? We are trying to help you, but at the same time we don’t know who you are. How do we know you aren’t someone that is messing with us? I’m not saying you are, but please understand we are trying to help you and want to believe everything you’re saying.

               there are two photos of me on Facebook with out head but with birthmarks.  I need professional photos done that can possibly be used publicly. I live in Palm Springs CA if anybody is close
It is the birthmarks that are most important now. Only a organized group can help me. I'm hoping we can help each other.

             that kid is the next generation after mine. He much younger. What is important is that it is a photo of him being traumatized in order to embed a hypnotic suggestion into one of the personalities they are building within him so the suggestion becomes a personality trait of the alter they are building with in him.

            Adam and Johnny, thank you for coming forward and sharing your story. You've already helped me by what you've said. Your bravery in coming forward in order to help other children is very moving.

            You mentioned that a very powerful group had put you under 24/7 surveillance to try to prevent the perps from reprogramming you. Are they still able to protect you in this way?

            I remember  some years back --maybe 10 or so---reading that Johnny Gosch was in Russia writing a book. it was about the time of the jeff Gannon thing perhaps. Ted Gunderson! Yes, sadly I've read not so good things before bout both him and Noreen Gosch

             with ritual abuse it is very important to not blame the victim for what the perpetrators do to there minds. Unless I find evidence that shows Noreen is a perpetrator , I will treat her as a victim and I will not hold her responsible for what the perpetrator did to her. please understand that when Noreen contradicts herself , it is caused by the programmer manipulating her memories OR by her minds slow process of naturally awakening, which is what older minds do, this is called wisdom ( the ability to process decisions cauncausly. )

            We would love to fund your non-profit, where should we send money? Also, we should troll the 2000 organizations that you contacted trying to further your research and wouldn't help you investigate...which of the 2000 do you want us to harass first?

             the non profit will be overseen by an unpaid board of directors that are able to also function as a think tank to counter the illuminati's think tank tactics. If anybody wants to be on the board and help run it they will need to be educated in one of the fields of study. need legal and investigative people the most now.

            I'm intrigued but, i agree with other users that this needs formatting. It appears to have been written using voice to text.

            do you mind being asked questions? I'm sure that alot of people would like to speak with you if you can provide some tangible proof within reason to show that there is any truth to your claim.

             I have posted the proof on my face book profile.  I you compare the right side birthmarks that are visible in a few of the photos on Noreen's web site called johnnygosch.com It's a very large birthmark that covers a quarter of Johnny's right side and then compare it to the photo of my birthmark that is posted on my profile you will see they are the same birthmark. Remember to keep in mind that all photos on Noreen's web site have been subjected to photo shopping. Mine has not been. And that mine only has to be found within his marks. the more noticeable parts of the matching marks repeat throughout all the photos where as the marks that are photo shopped are random.

              Adam/Johnny if this gets deleted I will repost it here because you probably can't use the private message system to communicate with a new account. If I repost it here
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               v/pizzagatewhatever

              if it gets deleted you can join the conversation. Understand?

            Thanks for sharing your story. I’ve been extremely intrigued by the Johnny Gosch story since I found out about it a few months ago. How can we help you? Can you please provide a picture of yourself so we can see if there is a resemblance to Johnny?

             "soul dump" This has a nice ring to it. We should gather the "soul dumps" and format them. This could make a good collection. Makes me think of "White victims of black crimes #xxxx" Why don't we have something like this for pg? "PG Survivor, Soul dump #xxxx &lt;moniker/name&gt;". I think this has archiving value.

            Here you go. Just edit, copy and paste this and then save. I’m sorry nobody would help you.

            CONFIDENTIAL As of this writing my six and a half year investigation into my past has always pointed to me and Johnny Gosch being the same person that was perpetrated as part of the monarch mind control and telepathy research project And that I was used as a young child to compromise G Bush so he could be raisin to power.
           </p>
           <p>
            I need help with my investigation into my past that is directly linked to pedogate. I know who did what, I was there. I am not anything like what people think I am. I was a very functioning person for many years prier to my awakening to memories that were hidden in my mind behind amnesic barriers.
           </p>

            I realize how unbelievable this sounds but I have a lot of physical evidence, including Johnny's birthmarks and some of his memories. I have been investigating my emerging memories for over 6 and a half years now. Almost all of them point to me being Johnny Gosch. I also have memories that belong to Johnny, like my mom making me that castle cake and others where John , Johnny's father took him to a child sex rooms many times where I was there also.
           </p>
           <p>
            My programmer had me change places with Johnny a lot and unlike everybody else involved that was subjected to ritual abuse that have more than twenty alters (personalities) I only have one and my alter is Johnny Gosch. I have memories of being on the beds that Noreen has on her site. I remember right after the kidnapping that I was subjected to massive electric brain shock that was quite painful. I remember them saying "Adam died, why don't we make him Adam." Then "how are we going to do that " then"we can use the system backwards" speaking about using ritual abuse where the alter becomes the front personality and the original personality becomes the alter. These and the fact that I have Johnny's birthmarks and a few of his memories is turning my life upside down.
           </p>
           <p>
            Currently the mathematical odds of me being Johnny are greater than that of me being Adam. There are other issues involved with these odds also.  My memories of the cover up are more than twice the known facts to date. Also: Noreen the mom, like myself have been subjected to Satanic ritual abuse (criminal hypnotism) which is much about memory manipulation. Therefore Noreen like myself are only about 80% correct. Sorry but that is just the nature of ritual abuse. So just because you find one mistake, don't throw out the rest. The truth is somewhere between My story line and Noreen's story line
           </p>
           <p>
            The facts as I currently see them are as follows; . I am the person that Noreen Gosch says was Johnny Gosch that visited her in March of 1997.( which was just another part of the cover up) Some of my supporting evidence is: I have all Johnny's birthmarks. ( I calculate the MATHMATICAL odds at 1 in 100 trillion that there is a high level connection to the cover up and the odds of me being Johnny Gosch are significant. These Include a large birthmark shaped like south America on my left chest. A very large birthmark that runs on right side of my chest. This birthmark is clearly with in the perimeters of what they would look like after 35 years as the Photos of Johnny bound on the beds on Noreen's web site johnnygosch.com and my photos on my profile in development at
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008330380453">

            </a>
            It was me while I was in an hypnotic trance the entire time and my programmer and his student. The truth is that Noreen was subjected to programming while I was there where they altered her memories. This is called mind control because we are all the sum of our memories.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been unable to determine my true identity because the FBI have been running the cover up. And the leadership of the FBI does not miss a chance to attack my credibility. Johnny was kidnapped by the leadership department of the Illuminati called the hidden hand. (AKA shadow Government) There is an interview with a guy that calls himself Hidden Hand that is easy to find that will give everybody a good ideal of what they believe. President Bush was a member of this group. Therefore Government kidnapping. Fact is it was Bush that had most of the child sex evidence destroyed at the national center for missing and exploited children that is operated by the FBI.

            I need help with my plan to establish a nonprofit that will do the investigating exposing and will be overseen by a think tank. to finish my investigation into my past that will be responsible for administering a web site where all information about the pedos will be exposed. I can departmentalize the Johnny Gosch evidence where it will become understandable to most people. If anybody has any intelligent questions I will answer a few yes and no questions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Noreen is about 80% correct but she refuses to realizes that she is a highly controlled monarch slave that is a talking mouth for the cover up. I was the same way before I started to awaken 6 and a half years ago When my amnesic barriers started breaking down, allowing the memories behind them to conscientiously emerge. I'm not going into how ritual abuse works. endritualabuse dot com FYI I know most of the people in the 200 plus photos that the nonpedos left at Noreen's. They are the irrefutable proof and were left for my use.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not want to cause Noreen any hardship so please respect my wishes of not involving her in this discussion. Sadly in order to tell the complete truth and have it understood there are a few fact that I have had to disclose about her. I have waited a long time and have suffered much in an effort to respect her. But there are children being hurt right now as I type this and will also be when you read it. We can protect many thousands of children by just exposing 10 percent of the cases. This is very easy to do. It is a generational blood line cult that about 10% become perpetrators and the rest including me and Noreen are sacrificed to become monarch slaves that are unknowingly used to further there agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI knows how to trace a family tree and have eye balls to observe with. The order came from Washington DC that will not allow any FBI to investigate what I am saying. This is what I have been told twice by the FBI and even more times from the NCMEC because it is run by The FBI. Furthermore: I have a lifetime of information that is linked to this case. They have been covering up the cover up for years now. Did you know that nobody has Johnny's fingerprints? these could have been gotten years later but nobody involved got them, NOBODY. This is the reason everybody is looking for the birthmarks. Ted Gunderson found me in South Texas and was paid over 50K to turn the investigation away from me so he Ted concocted the Jeff Gannon connection. It all serves to confuse the public.
           </p>
           <p>
            These people put me on a plane on 9/11 with a stop that landed between the two planes hitting and talked about something that was going to happen on the east coast. Protection of the children need to be the first priority and this entire Johnny Gosch thing has been purposefully engineered to expose everything in an irrefutable way. Let us all not allow the powers to be to instigate infighting like what they have attempted to do between me and Noreen. It will only work to protect the pedos as a delaying action. constructive suggestions sought. END

               I'm an one of the old-timers who needed paragraph breaks, you made it so much more readable.
              </p>
              <p>
               And JohnDGosch, writing your memories is the free and freeing healing.  It's the method we need.  And wearing a watch everyday, helps keep the mind control away.   Give thanks every chance you get, wow that's good medicine.

                Awww thank you. I’m mean to bullies. But, I don’t get why more people can’t show more kindness and compassion to the average person. Can you imagine how much better the world would be if we all just showed more kindness? Writing is healing. It’s like therapy. Sometimes my mind is going much faster than my fingers can keep up and the last thing I’m thinking about is my formatting.
               </p>
               <p>
                We have no idea what kind of emotion this person was feeling at the moment as they poured their heart out. So, complaining about the formatting is just wrong on so many levels. Especially since we should all know, better than most, how someone who could have suffered from trauma and mind control may not do things or know how to like the average person. He even asked for help and said going back and reading it would be hard. I think we need to show more compassion!

                 We can't get away from the world making harsh judgements and snap decisions.  This forum is clearly not polite in it's postings.  No one can read everything and a lack of paragraph breaks is something that often causes me to skip forward, to something else.  If being listened to is the goal. you've taught him to fish with better results.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I saw it as stream of consciousness writing.  It's very useful for the writer, less so for a reader. A paragraph is for breathing.  We all need to breath as we read!

            do you (anyone here) remember the group who helped the woman get DNA proof that she had been kidnapped as a small child? This was a few months ago, posted on facebook. They need to see this post.

             I think you are pretty fucked up. You really had to treat him that way? What if he has been under mind control or is mentally ill? Maybe you could learn to have some compassion and not be such a selfish prick.

             Will you please help me rewrite this. It is very difficult for me because I wrote my first self created paragraph only after my awakening about 6 years  ago and that I HAVE MANY triggers that are attached to the memories that this came from that cause emotional swings and unknown reactions in me from the ritual abuse.

              Also there was a story a few months ago of a woman who had been in a car accident and it caused her to regain some memories, she realized that she had been kidnapped as a child and was able to use DNA to prove it. I'm hoping someone remembers her name. She could probably help you.

               I always thought Johnny Gosch is the same person as Jeff Gannon. Have read a lot of background on this case on other private sites.

              <p>
               Can re-post info once the focus on investigating the truth behind the LV tragedy and the other sensational news stories die down. Posters are more likely to read John's story when online news becomes boring once more.

                I heard an interview with Noreen Gosch on Sword and Scale which was very recent (2014) where she retracts the whole Jeff Gannon idea because she says he is too short. She had someone visit him in person and he was no taller than 5’4, and Johnny was 5’7 at 12 years old.

               My name is Adam Johnny is my other personality that I have almost no communication with because he is a frightened 5 year momma's boy that only cries when he learns what happened This deeply effects me because his tears run from my eyes. I am doing a lot of memory work in an effort to cause the amnesic barrier that is preventing me from seeing Johnny's memories to break down. And I have been ever so slowly integrating the two personalities , but the only personality I have any real knowledge of or control over is Adam. I suspect most of my emerged memories have come from my Johnny alter. It was him that led me to Noreen. And He is the one that is pulled towards her. Noreen has done no thing what so ever to help and has hid all the information I gave her. I do know who her handler is and that is just a lot more proof. The government will not ever admit they kidnapped Johnny and I have been continually threatened by homeland security that they will put me in one of there secret hidden prisons if I continue to speak out . I am willing to give my life for this chance we have to end the abuse of children by the leadership.. If the movement does not reach critical mass this will end bad for me

                Furthermore: I will never be able to write my autobiography because of the triggers attached to the memories I write about. They cause emotional swings that are used to manipulate me and cause all the sentences to end up in one long confusing paragraph.

             I have already spent almost 40 K investigating this. DNA will cost another $1500 if  done correctly and will only expose many child victims that are adults now and have no knowledge of there true identity.. What is truly going on is a huge child kidnapping ring that is searching for telepathic children that are kidnapped and placed in illuminati families to increase the illuminati's ability to manipulate the quantum enigma and the reality we think we live in. Pedophilia is a very small part of the overall problem. The memory manipulations used to repress the child victims ability to remember the abuse and leads to further abuse throughout there life is by far more harmful and more difficult to expose.

Have you tried to contact someone with a huge voice like Alex Jones or Project Veritas or any truther with a huge following?  4Chan is another great site for getting to bottom of things, to.

               I have contacted well over 2000 different groups and people in positions of influence and only one tried to help and they killed him. At that time which was a couple of years before my awakening, kind of a preawakening. where a  very powerful group put me under 24/7 surveillance in an effort to prevent the perpetrators from doing there maintenance on my programming. Over time as we age the amnesic barriers naturally start to break down where memories emerge. These first are programmed to emerge first and trigger a call home program which cause an uncontrollable erg to contract the perpetrators and tell them what you remembered they did. This lets them know it's time for maintance. About every 5 years. Based on my experience NOBODY CARES or more likely they are being targeted by the system to prevent them from helping. This is the reason for me going more public in an attempt to find a group that is much harder to target. What I need is a think tank to advocate for me and that can be the middle person between me and everybody else. Otherwise they will just keep attacking my creditability or subjecting me to more of there psychological warfare game that keep me off guard and not centered on my adjective.

             That child who I know well is being subject to this type of bondage because it changes a hypnotic suggestion into a personality trait that becomes part of one of his personalities for future use.

              Hope this question isn't too painful. Is it true your father sold you? Anything to do with anger at your mother, or was he a sociopath/psychopath? I recall you developed into a very handsome, charming man. True?

              Thank you Johnny for your courage. Solving your identity would be a huge success i proving pgate. 
The best way is DNA. Will Noreen submit to DNA test? If not I believe Johnny Goesh had a sister. Will she submit to DNA tests?
