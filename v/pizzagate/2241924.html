            You know, the strange thing is it doesn't even matter if you have an image ... or a video ... Biden is on video. Now Al Franken is captured in a photo, but people are making excuses for it and saying it's not really groping. It's only "pretend groping".

            So if wouldn't even matter if they have Killary drinking Haitian orphan blood and surgically transplanting an organ into her body. No one will believe it except a certain segment of the population.

            I can't deny that this is an obvious proactive forshadowing on the part of May. How desperate is it to tell people to expect future eivdence against the establishment and it will all be lies? Who wouldn't see through that? My assumption is this is more to do with the global economy collapsing, and how they have been hiding it for years. When it goes down quickly, they will have no explanation. Maybe they will try to blame Russia. Only idiots would beleive it. If this has to do with PG I will happily be wrong. I would prefer that actually.

            It's a real pickle, how do you expose video evidence of child molestation?
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything about it is illegal.  Knowledge of, possession of, distribution of, promotion of.  It can only be rumored of, or viewed in closed door sessions.  Such evidence needs to be shown to have been legally obtained, which is impossible mostly.  The best of policeman are overwhelmed with serious violent crimes appearing daily.  The need the tip off of a citizen to find this dark web.  Their computers are aflicted with all the crap hitting the rest of us, and they don't all have the brightest of IT security.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't think the White Hats can release actual child porn connected to Big Names, anytime soon.  That must come later after selling state secrets, Uranium 1 or similar crime is fully proven. Uranium 1 looks like a great first target.
           </p>
           <p>
            ....latest count I saw was about 1,300 Sealed Indictments !  And not a peep about any of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I find fascinating is the positive potential outcome of all these secret indictments, especially if publicly dumped in a lump. (If secret back room deals are cut on all of them, we got the same old same old.)
           </p>
           <p>
            We are at a low point in respect for law in the USA, because we are certain it's not applied at all equally.  Money will buy in court any outcome desired.  We see it everyday.  If you have enough of it and previously retained the best local attorney, your free to do as you please.  We little people don't like that system, it's worse than disgusting.  We can loose a drivers license and our job for driving home from a bar after 2 drinks.  They don't allow bars within walking distance of peoples homes, bars all have free parking.  Drinking and Driving are built into our cities and townships.  So is busting you for it.  Big bucks made all around out of your wallet.  Money buys insulation from all that, should have take a cab they say.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the Prosecutors and the Courts and the Police, can visibly be seen to be standing up for the Constitution,  it will do wonders for everyone's faith in the system being good in the main.  Even the bad guys behind bars, would gain new faith in the judicial system.

            We need to keep our heads and remember how this looks to the normies. Stay calm, stay rational. Be prepared for faked obviously photoshopped images to drop first as the demons attempt to get out ahead of the story.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it from the Normie perspective.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if we produced an entire photoalbum of Creepy Biden and Alfantis tag teaming newborns, what normie brain is even partially configured to be able to accept that as reality?
           </p>
           <p>
            We accept it, bc we have manned the trenches for over a year now and have seen how pervasive the spiders web of cruetly, corruption and abuse goes.. But that have not.

            Resist the urge to "I told you so" the normies. Be prepared to scrutinize any and every bit of evidence presented, and perhaps most importantly be ready to scrutinize the demons efforts to "debunk" their own red herring evidence. It may provide clues or revealing insight into what to look for when substantiating the real deal.

            Here is a (long) interview with a UK cop who was finding himself in trouble time and time again for doing his job too well (re investigating child prostitution, trafficking)... Worth a listen...comes across as a very sincere and smart cop....

            Wow, I was sceptical of your statement until I heard Mays' speech and watched the British news, which is now saying that Russia has been 'interfering' for longer than what they first thought; that Russia may have had something to do with the Brexit vote.  And why on earth would she talk about 'photoshopping'??  That is such a random thing to mention.  Yes, they're conditioning people and sowing the seeds of 'Russia did it'.

              Yes, exactly.  It's well known that the globalists do NOT want Brexit, while the British people do. Brexit was a big FU to George Soros and the NWO elite.  The elite are trying to work out how to do a fake Brexit; that is, make the people believe Britain is breaking from the EU when in effect it's not.  I wouldn't be surprised if their next move was to stop Brexit, claiming Russia tampered with the voting.

            Looks like the photographic evidence is finally going to come out then Mrs. May?  I see the preparation building a false narrative is underway......oh Mrs May, you disappoint me, we all hoped something better from a woman and a Pastors daughter at that, we thought you might put the children first before elites.
            <br/>
            I defended you when people were bad mouthing you here on voat because you had no children, because I found out that you had said that you would have liked children but was no able too. Now I feel very sad, especially if this narrative preparation is regarding pedogate specifically.  Like the saying goes, A Picture Paints A Thousand Words...........and no one will be fooled into believing it is fake.

             Any woman denied children who wanted them indeed merits some sympathy.  But given the massively increasing hardship, poverty and  cruelty she and her government are inflicting upon my people and particularly children, that sympathy where given and is gone; for good.  I hope something is coming that indelibly implicates all the evil bastards in Parliament.  Let’s face it; given the sexual harassment and other scandals they’ve faced in the past few weeks they’re hanging on by the skin of their teeth already.  I can’t wait to see them sink. Bring it.

              Hes just he best.  To think I knew nothing really about him until I saw him supporting Trump!  I was not really into politics in any way, shape or form.  Just came across Trump Prophesy by Mark Taylor and I started to watch the Debates. I used to get so annoyed when hearing the twisted, tweeked reports on CNN etc., when I had watched the Debate.  Then Nigel Farage came on stage, wow, I love that guy! haha

               He causes a stir.  Got to give him that.  I was not a fan when he was UKIP leader but watching him against Claude Juncker the day after we voted to leave the EU I completely changed my opinion.  The man has some balls.

            England is an liberal shit hole full of Muslim sand niggers and SJWs. Whatever Russia wants to plant there is probably a hell of a lot better than what the English are doing.

               There is truth in both of your posts...the elites in England are horrible - and their godless degeneracy has trickled down into the masses.  Still there are a large contingent of good Brits theat see what you/we see and hate it.  With that said, City of London, Rothschilds, and of course Windsor’s are truly dispicable and operate out of their home base there.

            You goys are aware Theresa May is the daughter of a satanic vicar who abused dozens of boys and girls and actively colluded with one of the most prolific serial killers in British history?
           </p>
           <p>
            One look at May and it is clear she is as mind-controlled as MK ULTRA technology could make her generation. The 'Maybot' slur is unwittingly astute.

             I am glad that I am not the only one - key phrase - just one look at her - is enough. Exactly what I felt about JA - Art collector Tony and Skippy. How about Tony Blair - he looks like a demon inactnate! 
A bit of occult trivia - what are the odds that the only two female UK prime ministers would share same but reverse initials (masonic duality) MT &amp; TM (not a coincidence) It's time to take that sick global pedo cabal - pedo gate is the NWO.

             I mentioned this before, but over a year ago, Anon on youtube shared that there was an actor who had confessed to being paid a good sum of money to make a video of Donald Trump, hitting a woman around in an apartment.  Apparently he felt so bad, even though he was a Killary supporter, he said he did not know what the job was, and it took 3 solid days  locked up in an apartment filming. 
 All that was required was that he had to look like Trump. I will try find the link.  Sounds like what they are going to try say has happened to them.

              Holy Cow!  No wonder they are getting scared.  Things are going to be released and they are getting out in front of it to do damage control.  Something for sure is up.  There is something really nasty coming down the pike.  I want to see their worried faces.  I would like to see Fear and Terror on their faces.

               oh my,  that’s not an image I want passing through my mind ever again.  (Have to have some sympathy for the cameraman on that little scene.  Yeuch.  Begone). On a serious note, the UK people I’ve spoken to about PG have asked me many times why I am
so interested (or in some cases, “obsessed”) in US affairs and politics - and its incredible but true that their level of disbelief and dismissal for the subject increases dramatically when I claim that the same problems are prevalent over here.  But, I feel that with everything else, what goes on or down in the US usually makes its way to the UK eventually, and in the same way that the prevalence of Hollywood paedophilia now climbing slowly into the public consciousness is the preparation and the precursor for the real truths about child exploitation to finally be safely revealed, the ramifications of this will inevitably seep into the U.K. and provoke a similar avalanche of revelations here - in fact I’m almost depending on it.  I think May also has a whiff of what Trump has been doing and what’s coming and she’s preparing for when that storm travels the Atlantic to Old Blighty.  God speed, say I.

                Yes, well some of the Pedowoods are from England, so that should wake them up pretty soon.  George Clooney lives in London.  So does Kevin Spacey have a place there as well.  When the truth hits the fan, stand back.

              That's thev one we are waiting for. 
Remember that Eric Prince (Blackwater) did a radio interview about NYPD being in posession of the tapes back in November. And guess who Trump nominated as secretary of education - Betsy Devos - who happens to be sister of Eric Prince!

            I've seen other fake news stories pop up on my facebook feed that claim Russian operatives paid a Hillary look alike to shoot a porno with another woman. This is clearly damage control, lets hope when this video drops it achieves the ultimate destruction of the pedo elite, but if it falls on deaf ears and brainwashed sheeple, literally what else could be done to awaken the masses. Speaking from my own experience the trouble with the amount of people already brainwashed by the lefts narrative or simply those who don't give a shit, is scary enough itself.

             I saw those too... pre-emptive plants to cite when it breaks as a contingency? They are all about planning for shit hitting fans... the entire Russian/Trump narrative was thought through BEFORE he even came close to building up steam to win the election. If they were planning to trash him IF he won (which he did), how much manpower and PR have they been planning to counter this?

             I'm scared to suggest it, but, if this kind of info is released, they can't just ask CNN to sweep up their mess anymore. Something drastic will occur to prevent the masses from turning on them. At this point I'm convinced they will stop at nothing to maintain power, and if that power is stripped away from them, they will simply lash out like a wild animal backed into a corner.

             Like millions ants cornering a starving bear that just smoked crack, many will perish, but we need to continue forth and take it down, one bite at a time, for the greater good.

              Have you heard about all the earthquake activity in northern Cali? Its being compared to someone putting lubricant on the San Andreas fault . They are going to use earthquakes and other so-called natural disasters to eliminate us . Hence why the Bible warns us of earthquakes etc in the last days .

            lol - Looks like somebody finally got hacked for real. LOL BRING IT. It won't be easy for people when all the images of famous and wealthy people are shown harming children. Just the satisfaction I'm getting from imagining the idea that there will be actual justice is worth it. Still waiting for the Deathstar moment and the YubNubs.

            Sort of looking like the Hive is bracing for the release of the fact that they are all a bunch of child rapists doesn't it? Creepy Uncle Joe is also suddenly the children's advocate, him and Lady Gaga.

            Fox News had Jaunaita Broderick on yesterday interviewing her about Bill Clinton raping her and the anchors were so supportive they practically sold her story to the viewers in a positive light.

             Suddenly we'll see news reports about how low the age of consent used to be in the U.S. and around the world, historically, and articles saying how children and teens actually do understand and are able to consent (you see these things online already). I expect the media to vomit all over this with how society needs to change and they will demonize Christian "puritanicalism" for the mess we're in. The people in power will deny and deflect, but at the same time they'll work to reeducate the population to accept it.

              Lol they already are. It’s always the jittery ones. The little chihuahua ones that start barking first. Ethereum creator comes out pro pedo, salon continues pushing pro pedo narratives. Washington post and NYT all published articles with sickening and questionable headlines this year. They’ve become so good at twisting the narrative.

              The reason some children are even promiscuous in the first place is because ADULTS groomed them into thinking that it was normal . Then they grow up one day and either become fully against it or become fully engulfed in it with no way out and no turning back .

            Another pre-emptive strike.  Now that this narrative exists, other perpetrators can use it.  It is exactly the same as the CIA leak that stated they can make it look like the Russians did it.

             You know they'll flood the news with this shit too. However, I think the good guys may be back channeling to try and work out deals for information. - The people with the leaks may just have the upper hand. I mean, if this shit gets out it's not gonna be a good look for anybody. People are going to lose their shit. They'll be on TV 24/7 talking about who is to blame etc. - They're going to have to craft a deadly attack and deliver it with fencing style and precision. Otherwise it's gonna be a fucking mess.

             This was just like the "Watch out from Whoppers, they are all lies" Wikileaks warnings... and Holder's warning about agents "integrity being challenged and questioned" or whatever the fuck he said...
            </p>
            <p>
             Pre-warnings are fantastic indicators.

            <p>
             My biggest challenge now is how to deliver the most epic "I TOLD YOU SO!" to all of the critics and people who didn't even bother to look into this while denouncing it. Blind shills. Totally brainwashed people are about to get shook to the core.

               Hopefully Q Anon is right when he says the white hats are all in position and prepared for this... but I believe he also warned of mass power/internet outages. Can't remember the exact phrase, but, something like "If everything goes dark, don't worry, we have planned for that as well".

              Like we've said all along, they tell us exactly what they are doing by saying we are doing it!  How stupid!  -  Like the time my Aunt caught my cousin, who was about 14 at the time, as she walked in the house and said 'Come here Ann, I know what you've been up to at the park!'  Ann said, 'what, kissing the boys?' My Aunt said 'no, but that as well!'  Ann said 'smoking?' Aunt 'no that too though' I stood there thinking.....Ann shut up your getting yourself into more trouble.  Ann would have made a great Democrat if she had been American lol
