<p>One blogger who is speaking out is Craig Murray and I found a very interesting comment on one of his blogs which may have all sorts of connections for this forum.  The comment is too long to post in its entirety, so you can read it <a href="https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2018/03/the-deep-state-breaks-surface/comment-page-3/#comment-726367">here</a>.</p>
<p>It begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just what kind of trouble are the royal family in? The Daily Mail is reporting about Prince Charles’s boyfriend Michael Fawcett, the man who the late George Smith accused of raping him, including in a taped interview he gave to Princess Diana.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Midway there is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “free hand” thing appeals to British journalists’ sense of humour, but it’s also meant to distance Prince Charles from whatever dirt – and we are talking about “entertainment” for the super-rich – may soon attach to Fawcett.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And eventually ends with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another who is named is the <strong>US banker John Studzinski. He combats human trafficking apparently.</strong> Sounds like an ideal contact for Ivar Mountbatten and co. and Helen Windsor’s ex-boyfriend at SCL in making sure that the “Ukrainian girls” they supplied around the world were all properly kite-marked, wouldn’t you say? Everything above board and shipshape. Nothing untoward going on. All “compliance” boxes duly ticked.</p>

            Oh my gosh, his foundation is openly buying children?  And what happens to them then, how do we know a percentage of these children do not disappear into international child sex trafficking rings, and get murdered at human sacrifice ceremonies somewhere?  And
            <a href="http://archive.is/VIcsv">
             he works for the UK government too?
            </a>
            I'd like to know exactly the location and status of each and every child these nuns ever purchased, but of course, we never will.

            Yes Yes Yes. You got it bud. Here you will see that
            <strong>
             THE ROYAL SOCIETY
            </strong>
            is THE premiere group that has been the progenitor for the Tavistock institute, responsible for every PLAGUE in history and were part of the original settlers into America, INCLUDING the Folger family, that CARRIED WITH IT THE PAGAN BELIEF SYSTEMS OF OLD EUROPE WITH THEM FLEEING PERSECUTION AND FREEDOM OF "RELIGION" as I covered in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2370750">

           </p>
           <p>
            Great minds think alike and Swordfish69 and I were all headed in that same direction. The Royal Society were the first cult achemists to coin the phrase ALKAHEST for the life giving properties they knew were in human blood, except back in those days they straight let it out, bathed or drank it in massive orgies, now they are trying to refine the process, as told to us is all these fancy hollywood movies like Aeon Flux and Jupiter Rising.
           </p>
           <p>
            ALKAHEST just also happens to be an emerging life extension technology corporation being studied out of Stanford U as we speak, a good customer and client of, Planned Parenthood.

            So Varkey is supporting sharia law and tries to promote it.....could this be one of the reason why the British establishment, including the Archbishop of Canterbury (!) accepts the spreading of sharia law in Britain?

            The Arise Foundation definitely needs to be looked into.

            IBVM stood out to me, and I have some information I'll post here.
           </p>
           <p>
            IBVM is also known as Loretto/Loreto Sisters, and Congregation of Jesus.  Abbreviations following nuns' names include SL, CJ, and IBVM.

           <p>
            Like the Jesuits, IBVM answers "only to Rome" in most aspects.  I suspect IBVM leadership is massively involved in "very high level" Pedogate, like the Jesuits.

            In the blog post mentioned in the OP, by
            <a href="http://archive.is/RjKsZ">
             Craig Williams
            </a>
            who I just found out is a whistleblower and former ambassador, there is a list of board members of SCL.  One,
            <strong>
             Ivar Mountbatten, was mentioned by the commenter "N_" as a supplier of "Ukrainian girls," presumably for SCL blackmail purposes,
            </strong>
            although I don't completely understand the commenter's Britishisms for the full meaning.
           </p>
           <p>
            For some strange reason, I looked up a
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ivar+mountbatten&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOgbXr2oLaAhULMawKHSJ_BA4Q_AUICigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=974">
             picture of Ivar Mountbatten,
            </a>
            and out of nowhere I got bad chills and was almost brought to tears although I've never met nor heard of him.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suddenly had a hazy memory of him torturing women who were used as sex slaves.  They say the body doesn't lie.  I get emerged memories from time to time, such as having been forced to be present at rituals, but I can't get confirmation of anything from my family, who will take me down with total lies, paid for and otherwise, in two seconds if I ask them any more questions or speak publicly.
           </p>
           <p>
            So take it with a grain of salt, but I think that Ivar Mountbatten guy is heavily mind controlled to do heinous things.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what commenter N_ wrote about him:

             Thanks.  I didn't bother to go into Mountbatten because I tend to assume that everyone knows all about the history of the Royal Family and all accompanying stories - my bad.

             The Prince and the Pedophile: Charles’ Connections to Pedophilia Networks

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              At this point, it should be mentioned that, although the official line is that Savile and Charles met in the 1970s as part of the coincidence of mutual charity work, Savile himself has stated that he was friends with the Royal family “for a million years.” In fact, it was reported that Savile actually stated he was introduced to the Royals in 1966 by Lord Mountbatten, a known pedophile and sexual pervert.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, already, we have Savile, a notorious pedophile linked to other individuals of the Royal Family named as pedophiles as well. Prince Philip, of course, is Prince Charles’ father. Lord Mountbatten is largely considered Charles’ mentor.

              There is no need for you to go into every piece of information for people.  They can look things up.  But yeah, creepy pedophilia connection via the great-uncle of Ivar, Prince Charles' mentor Earl Mountbatten of Burma.
