<p>That he belongs to such a group shouldn\'t be surprising, as most prominent politicians have membership in one of more of the &quot;mystery schools, &quot; such as Freemasonry, Order of Skull and Bones (Bush-41, Bush-43, John Kerry), Bohemian Grove (BG), the Jesuits, Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), Royal Order of Jesters (ROJ), and Shriners, and on and on. These are recruiting and breeding grounds for politicians seeking power and influence. So it\'s useful to think of pedophilia practices as an exercise of power over others. This is ** institutionalized pedophilia**, sanctioned within socially acceptable fraternal organizations.</p>
<p>Recent posts on the Royal Order of Jesters (ROJ) have been valuable in providing insight into sex practices within these organizations and what may be deemed acceptable versus what is otherwise against the law.</p>
<p>Investigative journalist Sandy Frost has written extensively on Jesters. She discusses a state Supreme Court judge as well as a retired police captain (the Buffalo, NY case involving Brazilian girls) tried and sentenced to a minimum security prison for violation of the Mann Act.</p>
<p>&quot;Because of his cooperation, the judge got a reduced sentence in an apparently minimum security facility. His cooperation has led to the Jesters being investigated for the sexual exploitation of minors and international travel for those purposes. Child sex tourism.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One alleged that she was left pregnant after one such trip at age 13.&quot;</p>

<p>The site <a href="http://freemasoninformation.com">http://freemasoninformation.com</a> has some good insights. In the comments section of the following it says: &quot;The fact that Shriners have sex with children at their parties is probably their most closely guarded secret. Their basic protocol is to drug children so they can\'t remember what happened afterward.&quot; Then the writer says, &quot;Considering the fact that Shriners are Moslems (they take an Islamic oath and have an Islamic belief system) take note of what the Islamic \'faith\' says about using underage girls for sex.&quot;</p>

<p>To become a Shriner, one first needs to become a freemason. Is George H. W. Bush a Shriner? Was that why he had such a great rapport with the Saudi royal family when he was president?</p>

<p>&quot;The Shriner meets in TEMPLE - most of which have distinctly Arabic names. They are often built to resemble a Mosque. He wears his fez with the Muslim symbols on it. He takes his oaths and says his prayers in the name of ALLAH. Many of his secret passwords and code phrases are in Arabic, which he is required to memorize in order to be in the &quot;order&quot;. &quot; </p>

<p>Secretly, were the Bushes always on board with the Islam coddling policies of Barack Obama, even after the 9-11 terror attacks? Remember Bush-43, when he allowed members of the bin Laden family to leave the country when all other planes were grounded?</p>',

             I thought Freemasons didn't like you to believe in a God. They wanted you to leave that behind. I've never heard of Muslims and Freemasons having anything to do with each other. I'm new to all this so I probably sound like an idiot.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, am I understanding this right? Shriners are Muslims turn Freemason and have a fricken children's hospital?

              A requirement to join Freemasonry is belief in a supreme being.  They don't care which one.

               In 1962 the Shriners of North America allocated $10 million to establish three hospitals that specialized in the treatment and rehabilitation of burned children. After visiting 21 university-based medical institutions, the decision was made to build the first pediatric burn unit on the campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB).[3] In 1963 the "Shriners Burns Institute" began operation in a seven-bed ward in John Sealy Hospital, the teaching hospital for UTMB.

             <p>
              Don't know about the other stuff mentioned but they have one of the best hospitals for burned children in the world in Galveston. I don't know much about the background but it's been here forever. I've been there many times. Too many.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: You hardly look like an idiot, this stuff is quite complicated. Freemasons do want you to believe in a supreme being, just leave Christ out of it and they're happy. No need to respond, but again, the rank and file Shriner members and masons across the country are not into kiddie diddlin.

               Thank you! I have like 7 tabs open right now reading about all of this lol. I've always heard it's a wonderful hospital. That's why I'm so surprised that it was established by Freemasons!

                It is indeed a great hospital and they've helped thousands of kids right there in Galveston, they're flown there from all over the country. We're all still learning, and it's hard to discern the truth on all this stuff. General Patton said once "if everybody's thinking alike then somebody's not thinking." I would assume that means during the process of finding a solution, or the truth, once facts are absolutely established that's another thing. Below is just one of the websites for the burns hospital, there are many, but on this one you can see the spooky symbolism.

                The Roman Church does its share of "good deeds" and they're even spookier. Anyway, let us know when your book on all this comes out :)

                 I wonder if the good deeds are their way of making people believe that they aren't evil. Freemasons don't care about children. All this is so confusing. Thank you 🙂

                  Exactly. It works the same w/ all these wonderful do-gooder charities. Smokescreen. People are just not naturally that "good" to give so much for nothing. I'm not. Yes, to me the Roman Church is much spookier. It is much more of a direct assault on the person of Christ. And "drunk w/ the blood of the saints," and they have "committed fornication w/ the kings of the earth." I should post more, I haven't been on Voat much lately.
