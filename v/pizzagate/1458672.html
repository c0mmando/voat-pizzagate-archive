I stepped back from pizzagate to let things &quot;process&quot; for a week or so.... one big thought that bubbled up, worth sharing. It\'s about the possible real reason for doing this to the kids (In the larger international  picture). If we Take the &quot;ability to  do it&quot; away in the first instance ,  we could immediately cut down on people doing this to kids as a political &quot;tactic&quot;.   If I am even partly right, one of the things we should do that is immediately within our power to do, is to warn ALL NEW legislators we send to ANY political office, state, federal, FBI, ANYWHERE. We should tell them NOT to drink or eat a damn thing at ANY party they are invited to when they first arrive in office. It\'s a pretty simple thing to do.  If I am correct, this by itself, may start draining the swamp.  
</p>
<p>If I am even HALF right, we may have at least ONE answer to the question: Why did we send in so many new REPS to the Republican side of the ISLE with the Tea Party... only to watch them sit back and take no action against the OBVIOUS take over of our FEDERAL system by the Clinton Crime Family, and even a number of foreigners. I\'m sharing a thought about the big picture, as you go foreword for the sake of the children. </p>
<p>IMHO: His name was SETH RICH, and yes, &quot;they&quot; (especially foreigners) would stoop to abusing even killing kids, as a &quot;political&quot; tactic. If what I am saying does not make sense yet, keep reading, it will. </p>
<p>During my mental break, I had a dream, that put me square back on a sidewalk in...my Capitol where I lived, YEARS ago.  I was with about 300 people who came from all over to testify against the banning of the use of raw milk from privately owned cows? The  dream was a replay of a real life event I had forgotten:</p>
<p>In reality, in that moving group of people on the sidewalk, on the way to a local restaurant during the &quot;testimony lunch break&quot;, I walked &quot;three across&quot; on the sidewalk next to two strange women who had a conversation going that went something like this:</p>
<p>A:  &quot;There\'s those girls&quot;
B:  &quot;Where?&quot;
A:  &quot;Over there. Across the street?&quot;</p>
<p>I looked. There were two college age women, both blondes,  in beautiful grey wool looking business suits. They looked ridiculous, because the business skirts were pleated mini skirts (and I mean MINI MINI barely few inches out from under the jacket mini skirts. Yes. With matching gray very very high heals? </p>
<p>A: &quot;You think they\'ve got another blackmail party planned?&quot;
B: &quot;I haven\'t heard anything, but maybe we\'re the first.&quot;
A: &quot;We should put out a memo when we get back&quot;</p>
<p>I wondered what they meant by blackmail. When my two strange friends took a lunch table together at a 4 seat round, I couldn\'t help myself. I asked if I could sit down. The nice older women said &quot;sure&quot;. </p>
<p>Me: &quot;I couldn\'t help over hearing you. What\'s with the blackmail thing?&quot;</p>
<p>Brace yourself. Here is what they explained, and I really can\'t do justice to any quotes here, so just going to sum up:</p>
<p>It was about a blackmail party. All newly elected (1st time Representatives) would get invited to some party. The invite came on the same of the party. The invitation was usually just before the REPS left to go home for the day. I remember the ladies saying the whole same day thing gave the new REPS no chance to talk to anyone about the party... who was going, who not. There was no time for questions, but, it was made out to be a really important party.  It usually started happening about six weeks after the elected officials at the Ohio State House were &quot;sworn in&quot;. 
They were confused about why it was happening at that time, on that day maybe, (spring? Summer? Warm out for sure) and they were not sure, but not taking chances. They were going to send out a memo to all legislators as soon as they got back. I assumed they worked at the State House.   They explained that whoever was doing these party\'s would invite the newest REPS, and the reps would be picked up in a LIMO that had a couple of these gray suited women in it? The reps thought they were going to some kind of important &quot;meet and greet&quot; kind of thing. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the LIMO picked them up early. They arrived among the first to the party at a house. They would be offered a drink while the LIMO went to get other REPS. The drink was drugged. They woke up in bed in one of the bedrooms in the house. Later they would get photos of themselves in the mail. They were photographed sleeping naked with the women. From then on they were &quot;blackmail-able&quot;.  This is just one of three different stories they knew about I am using as an example. For all I know, other REPS drove themselves to the party. The limo situation is the one they told me about in detail.</p>
<p>I Had enough. Woke up. Yeah, I was as disturbed as I was the first time I actually lived it. But, having my morning coffee it struck me to ask a few things:</p>
<p>1) What if... what they said had some truth to it, and the whole system is politically corrupt, because MOST of the legislators suffer from blackmail set ups that are simple staged photographs like this?</p>
<p>2) IF they knew that this kind of thing was going on, why didn\'t they just send out a warning to everyone every year after the election?</p>
<p>3) Maybe they did. Would the blackmailers give up then? Or would they change the operation to somehow get the same result?</p>
<p>4) This would sure work for young male married representatives. What do you have to do to the unmarried ones? Make &quot;gays&quot; out of them? That would\'t work. Not anymore. SO, what else could be used to blackmail a REPRESENTATIVE? (I thought about the pedo-page scandal that hit washington not long after that. Then, I thought about the Franklin Coverup, that actually happened while I lived in Nebraska way back. Huh.</p>
<p>5) And when a STATE REP moves up to be a FEDERAL REP;  if a tight hold on Washington is absolutely worth killing for, ( just  like taking over a nation in any war), what, exactly kind of thing do you have to set up to blackmail everyone in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches that you can?</p>
<p>Now think like a real investigator. I had to actually get my head in place of the criminals to ponder it. Just pretend for a minute that you are one of the sick foreign murderers,  or sociopathic murderous criminal Americans. You want to take over the US.</p>
<p>It sure would be nice to have that military under your control and use it against your enemies.. right? </p>
<p>But, maybe you have no military. Besides, making it look like &quot;America&quot; is the bad guy, works in your favor. </p>
<p>Now, lets suppose you are SOROS, or ANYONE in the NWO who wants Global Government for that matter.... and you want the American Citizens to take their own government apart for you. Huh. </p>
<p>What kind of money would you spend hunting down real pedophiles and murderers for hire to get your blackmail job done on a scale that would give you control over most heads of about every branch, and even control of as many state governments as you can?
It has to be so bad, you can threaten them with WAY more than divorce.</p>
<p>Life in prison, or.... or... the chair?
The objective is to keep them alive, and in &quot;power&quot; to do your bidding, you would also offer them lots of money if they agree to cooperate. Is this why we see Paul Ryan and Governor Kasich taking money from George Soros, even though Soros is a Far Left Democrat leaning Global Communist Sociopath?</p>
<p>My last thought was.... the fact that our Constitution has no protection against this kind of Federal takeover. I don\'t think the Founders were sick enough to think of it. But, it looks like we the people better start thinking about pedophilia, murder and Satanism as very useful tools for very rich sociopathic international power brokers. There are about 300 families that own 80% of the worlds wealth. We would be good to start there, and maybe Trump did. Maybe he got a stomach full.</p>',

            It's amazing how few responses you've received.  Could it be that you hit the nail on the head?  I think so.  And it's the same for Hollywood and some of America's largest companies.  Everybody blackmailed or scared that the "n" word they said in 1969 was recorded and it was some "oversight" committee that recorded it.  Excellent post and summation of Washington's problems.
