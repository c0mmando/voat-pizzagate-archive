            Thank you very much for editing your post to include the new research that the embellishment of the facts in this case may be deliberate disinfo to frame pizzagate investigators retweeting it as agents of disinfo themselves and further drive the PG is "debunked" narrative.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On 4 April, this report continues, the SVR further reported that one of the most knowledgeable construction attorneys in Atlanta, named Trinh Huynh, was assassinated after she had filed legal papers with the US Federal Court requesting documentation relating to the I-85 bridge explosion for United Parcel Service (UPS), the world's largest package delivery company headquartered in Atlanta, in a force majeure action—that is a common clause in contracts that essentially frees both parties from liability or obligation when an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond the control of the parties, such as a war, strike, riot, crime, or an event described by the legal term “act of God” occurs.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <h1>
            In congruence with Pizzagate theory, however, they reported that a deep state operative matching her killer was also arrested, with child porn:
           </h1>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Even more critical to note, this report says, is that an SVR computer facial recognition analysis of Raylon Browning in comparison with that of the known assassin of Trinh Huynh, whose image was captured on numerous video surveillance cameras, showed no match being found—but did turn up an exact match when compared against a photo of a known American “Deep State” operative named Nicolai Mork who had just been arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, after his return there from Atlanta.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...Should Matthew Komatsu, however, write this book about Nicolai Mork, this report says, it will now have to include his arrest after returning from Atlanta to Las Vegas and his being indicted on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction charges after police found explosives “strong enough to penetrate a military tank” at his home—and
             <strong>
              whose other charges
              <a href="#s">
              </a>
              include his having 17 hard drives on a desk top computer which contained “child pornography”, “snuff films”, and images of him having sex with “seemingly unconscious women”.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             SVR analysts in this report explain that all American “Deep State” operatives, like Nicolai Mork, who are targeted for elimination have multiple and lurid sex crimes charges and allegations thrown against them in order to destroy their credibility should anyone listen to the truths they may offer in their defense—and that, also, includes “enemies of the state” the Americans fear such as Wikileaks leader Julian Assange.

              If we keep sharing our findings, ultimately they will be exposed. I think we need a megathread vetting the sites that are purveyors of disinfo that we can add to over time, with archived links to the evidence. If the community made such a thing, it would greatly help mods discern Rule 2 violating posts and remove them, citing the link, of course. It would also discourage ignorant noobs who think they need Contribution points like on Reddit from posting shite in the first place.

              should start that thread. Be sure to spell out this is important to the investigation of elite pedophile rings due to their demonstrated ability to wage information warfare by discrediting their accusers. :-)  Let me know if you need supporting links for that.

               "megathread vetting the sites" that would have some serious cons, like for example: Even the worst clickbait sites repeat also valuable stuff sometimes, and even more trusted are vulnerable for spreading disinfo (by mistake / by being paid etc).
              </p>
              <p>
               So, I'm not into putting up a thread listing "bad sources" - what I could help with regarding rule 2 might be a guideline for "How to validate accuracy of information" or "How to check a source". Reputation plays a very minor role in this.

                I hear what you are saying, and it is a valid point. Let me clarify: I'm not suggesting we blacklist or whitelist sites -- just that we create a central place where people can do what you did with the Trinh Huynh posts. If we don't pool the data, we won't be able to see the patterns of misinfo or disinfo. That is all I am suggesting.
               </p>
               <p>
                I really like your How-to ideas. That would also be very helpful for people.

                 Oh I got you wrong then, sorry. Now that sounds like an idea worth a thought. There are several patterns but some are more common.
                 <strong>
                  The most efficient pattern is to include a single fake claim in the news having all other parts accurate
                 </strong>
                 . In general, talking about
                 <strong>
                  misinfo
                 </strong>
                 , news can be catogorized to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  Accurate, sourced

Most of the important news regarding our investigations should be considered with these in mind, which makes your idea even more worth it.

                  One suggestion for pooling such data comes to my mind... Could we somehow get our "individual fact checkers" to use a common tag in these kind of posts, which would able pooling via search. The tag should be unique, like for example [pg-fact-check] so that any other posts couldn't mix the pool.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This might require some visible side-bar guidance, and even a sticky guide post for a while (until ppl are familiar with the tag). Additionally, each such post could include "when writing similar posts, please use this tag" or something like that.

                  One of the things I've noticed with a number of these fake news purveyors is they like to use Wikileaks as a source, without linking to the Wikileak email in question.

                   I gave a second thought to address the idea (the first was
                   <a href="/v/pizzagate/1777480/8731292">
                    right below
                   </a>
                   . Your suggestion was actually the launching idea for
                   <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatejournalism">
                    /v/pizzagatejournalism
                   </a>
                   - to help on fact checking. Will sure help regarding the patterns, if just some people start to post there. Might take a while, but you're not in a hurry I guess.

            It would be nice to have some verification that she was actually 'suing an elite pedophile ring' or something close to that, beyond the say so of yournewswire.com. So far we can believe that she was passionate about trafficked immigrants, no more. However, the idea that so soon after the I 85 disaster she could be ready with relevant FOIA applications and be recognized as a serious threat to the scheme is implausible.

            This is about the I-85 bridge. They are giving a similar story as in 9/11 about steel melting. This bridge completely disintegrated.,They are trying to say it was from some arson fire. Impossible to melt steel beams and just like 9/11... there would have to be some sort of bomb or explosion. There are a large quantity of refugees in Georgia hurriedly placed in there Obama. The attorney that was assasinated was helping sex trafficked victims but also was demanding answers on the bridge because of possible terroists involvement and all of the truth was once again was withheld from the American people.

            I read that the attorney was a very well known construction attorney in GA, and that she had just filed with the court for all info related to the I-85 bridge fire/collapse, not anything to do with pizzagate - outside of the fact that she would likely have been investigating the deep state over the bridge incident, and it seems the deep state are a sick pederasty of pervertedness.

             She just happends to get murdered by a possible Deepstate operative while also suing an Elite Pedophile ring.. Nothing to see here guys! Pizzagate is Debunked like Wikipedia says, we can all stop digging.

              I'm questioning the source because everything that came out after the assassination was about the bridge. Don't take it personally.

               But this is the same guy on film who was found with the murder wapon who killed attourney Trinh Huynh who was suing Elite Pedophile Ring... So yes it does have to do with Pizzagate, as he seems to be operative/hitman from Deepstate.

                Ok, I never act  as a mod, and I'm pretty sure the mods aren't happy about that. I was just wondering if there are more sources for what she way  doing doing/why she was killed - I would need them as well. Clearly I did not articulate myself well enough, thus the communication breakdown. We're both on the same team. Please accept my apology- I'm sorry! Peace

            They say he was a Deepstate operative and trained hitman and many many more info.. The arrested suspected killer is in hospital after a fight with an inmate in jail, wich is strange because suspects from murder-cases Always get locked-up solitary.. Seems like he is tried to be made silent. They also found 17 harddrives with CP / snuff etc in his house. He is also a suspect in  I 85 "collapse" bombing. Very interesting stuff they say! This seems a very big rabbit hole. Please dig people!

              It is what he said in the video haha. Whether or not it is true is another thing. But its pretty compelling. It would make sense the CIA would burn their own operatives with child porn if they became compromised. That way they can claim he operated on his own or some shit and was rogue/insane.
