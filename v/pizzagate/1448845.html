<a href="http://goathill.com">A website</a> 
Look very carefully at the imagery on the homepage. It is heavily covered with suggestive occult/satanic and pedophilloic imagery. The photos on their website and Facebook seem to indicate it is a very &quot;child friendly&quot; environment. Same thing happens when you google image them. Theirs more pictures of kids than adults, including a few celebrities hanging out there. Of all the places for celebrities and high level DNC members to congregate in a big city like San Francisco. A humble pizza place? I feel it is also significant to mention that San Francisco is the city where the church of satan was founded in 1966 by Anton Lavey, who wrote the satanic bible and was an advocate for these types of disgusting behavior.
I suspect that their could have even been a mass purge of even more incriminating images, given all the pizza gate revelations recently.</p>
<p>One of the owners FB. Note that he has a ping pong table in his personal pics.

<p>Another owner who is affiliated with the DNC and he seems to be very wealthy for being only a part owner in a small pizza chain. Yes, a chain, theirs three different locations.

<p>All of this evidence is highly circumstantial but given the uncovering of pizza gate and the obvious connection to the DNC, I believe this place and many others are engaging in these heinous acts. So this is a call to all amateur sleuths and private investigators! Tear this new lead apart and scour the earth for evidence like you did with Comet because that was just the tip of the iceberg. I would be willing to bet these are nation wide and most likely to be based in big DNC lefty type cities. Sanctuary cities might be a good place to start looking.</p>
