            Just throwing this out there.  The attorney's job is to present the facts they are given, they don't investigate anything other than whether something is legal or illegal.  Right now we have a ton of circumstantial evidence, a LOT of coincidences, and an abundance of creepy and abnormal stuff.  Actual proof of criminal activity is what we don't have yet.  There is nothing that anyone can actually prosecute.   I'm fairly confident that people higher than us in the law enforcement community DOES have that proof however.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll also add that no private eye would do a better job than the collection of people currently investigating this on the internet.  I'm 100% certain of this.  There are a lot of newbs and lurkers who don't add much but there are a lot of people who amaze me with what they come up with.  I have no doubt that the truth will eventually come out, whatever that is and the people here will be the ones to uncover it.
