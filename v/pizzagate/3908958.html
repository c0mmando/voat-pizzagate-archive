            The question is always, "who controls the "late" Epstein's extensive, blackmail, video vault?" But it's not only the Secret Services — Mossad, the CIA, MI6 and others — whom might have all or portions of blackmail material, but also the technicians who ran the systems at Epstein's mansions and islands.

           <p>
            Would they not have filched copies along the lines of what Chelsea (nee Bradley) Manning did, by pretending to listen to Lady Gaga while secretly recording material, if only for their own and their friends' amusement?

             Exactly. On another note, Maria Farmer confirmed Epstein had video cameras from inside of the Victoria’s Secret flagship location change rooms and could view them at any time. Meaning the mirrors in the change rooms had cameras behind them. This makes sense considering the home once belonged to Wexner. Can you imagine how deranged these fucks are.

              The usual use of lead in domestic construction is to hang sheets of lead for soundproofing, as in a recording studio. Though we must allow Wexner may have had a large X-Ray machine in there to inspect the innards of potential Victoria's Secret models or perhaps he was ahead of his time and ran a domestic nuclear reactor.

              It was recently revealed that the English, during WW#2, had some of their best torture chambers located in high-end residential properties, instead of traditional dungeons. Presumably they'd also need lead lining to avoid disturbing the neighbors.

               I wasn’t aware of the x Ray machine... wth were they doing with an X-ray machine? Perhaps checking people wearing a wire or video taping device when coming into the home for a meeting? And the English having torture chambers in high end homes doesn’t surprise me in the least as many are devious folks. Yes, these people all think they are next in line to Lucifer being so godly and lord like. After all, they descended from the Nephilim.

                Sorry, I was joking about the X-Ray machine. Just trying to think of others uses for lead shielding. Perhaps Wexner was old-school discreet and wanted to protect future Victoria's Secret models from anyone overhear their farting. It is a fact they do fart nosily, illustrated in the movie
                <em>
                 Boys and Girls
                </em>
                (2000). Sorry again — another bad joke.
