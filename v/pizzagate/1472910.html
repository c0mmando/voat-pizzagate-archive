            I'd say, VERY. It's obvious he's controlled by the globalists and I think all the big globalists, including such people as the head of the United Nations and other powerful internationalist organisations, would all be implicated too. It just stands to reason that this sort of thing is the 'glue' holding the enemies of sane governance together.

            Not very. The author, Judy Byington, has dedicated a lot of time to studying MK Ultra mind control &amp; ritual abuse, but her sources are suspect. When I was researching the Pope Francis thing, I came across a few sources claiming that the International Tribunal of Crimes Against Church and State (itches.org) "is not actually an international tribunal at all, but simply a blog maintained maintained by a single person (Kevin D. Annett)".
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I am not sure whether these claims are true, as the above quote came from Snopes, and their motives are also dubious. From what I gathered, though, is that the ITCCS (aka Kevin Annett) accused and convicted the Pope of these crimes of his own accord and there was never an official trial or anything.
