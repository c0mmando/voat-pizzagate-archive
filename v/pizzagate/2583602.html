Inside video source is an article with more sourced links, photos, connections, etc.
This connects to Pizzagate (which I refer in most of my work as Pedogate as it is a Global issue of pedophilia) through Clinton ties to CEMEX, which was in part 1 of this series.  <br />
The Bronfmans and Rothschilds have holdings in CEMEX and are friends with the Clintons.<br />
CEMEX has donated to the Clinton Foundation.<br />
Epstein and Zombrano were on the Trilateral Commission Executive Committe
Both Epstein and Zombrano friends with the Clintons (there is a photo of Hillary with Zombrano prior to him passing away in 2014)
Epstein, Clinton, Bronfman all have connections to Raniere, the NEXIVM leader I did reports on previously with sources and links.
Clintons connected all over the MAP to pedogate or even the pizzagate part of pedogate with their dealings in Haiti and their close connections to Podesta, Alefantis and his ex media mogul of the mockingbird media Brock of media matters

CampTucson, Operation Backyard Brawl found child items, restraints, local news info photos and links news footage and eye witness testimony. There is also a link to an article so you can see all source links, news clips, photos and related info in one place. Speaking with local police, Craig Sawyer, members of the VOP. Information on the underground bunker and what appears to be a holding cell for a child including child\'s bed. infant and child toys, items like strollers, carseats, backpacks even a kitchenette, etc. Experts reporting investigation is needed and at this time police have obtained photos and info and are claiming to investigate. In the meantime, the VOP is searching the area and has requested volunteers if people can get there. They have requested those who cannot share the information out. They have made it clear they do not want any political fighting, this is about the kids and they are staying focused. Latest update shows a skull and bones found. Their live feed link in here also.

            Just FYI if this thread does not grab traction and garner attention its probably because there have already been a lot of threads on the subect.

             That's okay.  I'm used to that.  I usually look at different angles and at times approach from a different viewpoint.  It is up to each individual if they want to know different aspects.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm more about connections, details in certain areas and generally am dealing on other platforms where I answer questions from those not fully awakened or just waking up.
            </p>
            <p>
             No problem if the material isn't needed here.  I have plenty of questions and information to attend on other platforms.  So no worries.
