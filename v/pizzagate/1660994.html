            Doing a google image search for 100 dollar bill, that bill is one of them. So lots of people use it when they need a high res image of a 100 dollar bill.

            You notice all that and don't mention that they'll do a show at a location of your choice for $1,000 and show a picture of a child's jumper house thingy that are at birthdays? That's odd considering the sexual nature of the band.

            I just checked it out, I think what you are explaining is the video compression around the finger. They have blurred the tip of the finger completely from about 3/4 of the way up the fingertip. It is however, a real fingertip and fingerprint - you can make out a small scar if you zoom right in and mess with the levels a little...
