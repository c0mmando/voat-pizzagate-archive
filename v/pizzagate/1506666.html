            The United States has a systematic problem protecting our most vulnerable citizens that many of us are not aware of. Out of all the advanced statistics that are uploaded to the FBI each month there is one that is shockingly nowhere to be found: Missing Children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over 800,000 children in the United States will go missing in 2016(1). Many of them will be returned to their families and guardians, but there is a large number who are never heard from again and are swept under the rug of a judicial system and government that has a history of making these controversies disappear or never even heard of.
           </p>
           <p>
            The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) is a private non-profit organization in charge of keeping up with the statistics that will be used by the FBI. Why is a statistic this important monitored by a private organization? The FBI has all the tools, money, and manpower it needs to actively keep track of it themselves. When police departments are uploading the current month’s stats to the FBI databases is it that much harder to add one column in the spreadsheet to keep track of?
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to propose to the United States Government that we start to finally hold our Criminal Justice agencies (mainly the FBI) accountable for keeping track of missing children in their own databases that will be open and available to the public. These statistics will be uploaded every month so the public may look for their own answers and possibly assist in finding the child.
           </p>
           <p>
            The following categories are what I propose the FBI updates each month in a public database for the public to search:
           </p>
           <p>
            Actively Missing – searchable database explained below
           </p>
           <p>
            Number of cases that were Kidnappings by family members
           </p>
           <p>
            Number of cases that were Kidnappings by family members, child returned
Number of cases that were Kidnappings by family members, actively missing
           </p>
           <p>
            Number of cases that were Kidnappings by Strangers
           </p>
           <p>
            Number of cases that were Kidnappings by Strangers, child returned
Number of cases that were Kidnappings by Strangers, actively missing
           </p>
           <p>
            Total number of missing children younger than 21 for current month and year to date.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to these statistics the FBI will be in charge of keeping an actively missing person’s directory that is viewable by the public. When viewed, the public will be able to go and search by date missing, name, last known location, etc. When you click on a specific case # it will bring the public to a page with the child’s info and any relevant tips that may assist the public in finding the missing child. This is a great alternative to making the parents of the missing child go through setting up a website to try and get publicity to find their children at their own cost.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why you may ask? Accountability. Someone in the Federal Government has to start explaining to us why so many children go missing but are never returned home. That agency also needs to not be allowed to be a private organization that the public cannot look into. This issue calls and demands for transparency. Putting this in the hands of the Federal government holds them responsible and forces them to answer the questions as to why this systematic issue only seems to be getting worse every year.
           </p>

            You correctly highlight the main problem. Being compromised through paedophilia or satanic ritual abuse appears to be the price for access to the corridors of power.  The Rothschilds et al may delegate power to others, but it always is granted at a price!

            Great idea and place to start. Interesting as we go through this process how many of us seem to be on the same page/path and arriving at similar conclusions. Know far more than enough right now to be convinced the world is essentially run by and for the benefit of a lengthy history of pedofiles. Must stop and don't need to wait until Trump is president or people realize Pizzagate is real. Considering the number of people who are still grieving about Trump as our next president and many stuck in anger, it is going to take a while for this to really set in what it means we all need to do.

             Well said.  I think (and hope) that a critical mass of consciousness has been reached with all this stuff.
             <br/>
             As I look deeper into this 'pizzagate' thing the evidence (though circumstantial) gets ever more compelling.
             <br/>
             I do not have the arrogance to try to convince anyone of anything, but I do suggest that everyone follows their own path of inquiry.
             <br/>
             Once found, the truth seems obvious. Before that, it seems impossible!
             <br/>
             The Podesta brothers are the key to unlocking all of this, that is a good place to start to uncover the truth for yourself.

            I heartily agree with you, and I am seldom moved to make comments online.  When we fail to care for our children we fail as a civilisation.
My own view is that failure is not an option. The awareness of the many will overcome the perversions of the few!

            You guys need to take a break from pizzagate investigation and relax until you're rejuvenated and ready to go. Staring into the darkness for too long is not healthy for mind, body, or soul.

             You make a good point. As Friedrich Nietzsche said: "When you look into an abyss, the abyss also looks into you."
However, I think the greater problem is that we have been averting our gaze for too long.
Sometimes the sword outweighs the shield, and love itself must rest.
But this is not the time for such comfort, the screams of children do not wait for our convenience!

            I strongly disagree. For instance I've recently called my reps and senators to support a bill I strongly believe in, and was taken aback at how their tone of voice would drop when I mentioned it, and how they just seemed to be trying to hurry me off the phone. Pointers:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              If you're not in their district their office lackies aren't required to do squat in terms of contacting you back or forwarding your messages.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Make sure you get them to recite the name of the bill's author, the name of the bill, and that you will be receiving some form of contact from the rep or senator. Get them to say it on the phone.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Give it some time, a week or two time permitting, and call them back again.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Go ahead and call them now before the next session starts. If you know the bill is going to be introduced in the upcoming session, you can pressure them to sign it when it happens. You don't have to wait for the bill to be de facto introduced.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Not only that our reps and senators are not above the critical eye, but consider also their office workers who we as citizens are told nothing at all about. They could be jihadists, pedophiles, anybody and
              <em>
               whoops
              </em>
              into the shredder it goes.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Thinking everything is predetermined and overly corrupt is just too much of a good thing. If this voater believes that nothing can be done, they are not wrong in that assumption. It does them more good than harm to completely forego the democratic process and just stick with what they know works. I also disagree with them but more strongly disagree with you for suggesting that they're "bullshit".

           <p>
            Makes me want to look extra close at that bill and everything that gets tagged onto it while it's being passed around. Which I urge all of you to do, as well. Sick shit can accumulate on an otherwise lovely bill in practically no time. This whole idea that a Republican-controlled Congress is going to somewhere be Teflon-coated White Knights is bullshit, Republican elites are just as complicit. These people take law school, hold no other skills or reliable businesses at all whatsoever, and we blindly elect them to Congress again and again and citizens wonder why no matter who gets elected the country always gets worse.

              Your spelling mistake points to a darker truth.  There is indeed people who 'love this nightmare' that is visited upon so many children.  They have to be stopped.  Every effort, that even the least of us can make,  will help to end this hell on Earth for our most innocent.

            There is absolutely no reason why anyone should refute what is being asked of you in this thread. Also Yule is accompanied  (typically) by Mõdraniht. Mõdraniht requires sacrifice. This is what may be conveyed to people whom may otherwise be skeptical. Yes, pagans exist. There is a HUGE revival of paganism which has taken place alongside the new age movement.

             Yes, a lot of politicians on all sides of all issues go silent on media during Saturnalia. I supposed they are having themselves some pretty raunchy parties. I used to be jealous of that sort of thing until I learned that they typically involve children in, with for some reason the older they get the younger they are inclined toward.

             Personally I tired of the strongly Christian rhetoric that surrounds pizzagate research. It's very off-putting. Christianity is riddled with pedophiles, for one thing. For another, religiosity should have nothing to do with it. We're mainly trying to establish as a fact that our government is full of pedophiles. We should take the same tack as the founders did: establish a clear delineation between church and state, taking into consideration many of the founders were obviously up to something quite outside both christianity and masonic brotherhood back in the 18th.

              - The macabre substance coating the torso and parts of the remaining limbs is called adipocere, a fatty, waxy material that sometimes forms from a decomposing body's soft tissues. Adipocere is familiar to investigators — it can make identifying a body and pegging its time of death tricky — but it is foreign to those of us who don't come into regular contact with decomposing bodies.

                 Okay, so what is the address of the basement near to Comet Ping Pong that DOES have a basement, where James Alefantis said he actually stores all of CPP's food in a walk-in freezer, the other establishment Alefantis owns? I thought
                 <em>
                  that
                 </em>
                 was Pajama Factory.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Sorry for the mix-up. So yes, it's crazy weird that Pajama Factory, where somebody died, sells a soap that tries as hard as it can to come across as corpse wax.

                   Bucks Fishing and Camping is where I'd focus attention if I didn't suspect they had already cleaned the place out and that James Alefantis will be running a clean operation for presumably the next two years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   On that note, I'd pay attention to where James Alefantis travels for the next two years, except I also suspect it will no longer be easy to do so because he will have his social media on lockdown and will be much smarter with what he puts online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I think one of the main problems with pizzagate is that because it blew up and became so public, now it's going to be very hard for any non-hacker to get any further information.

              It's not that Christianity is riddled with pedophiles, it's the entire fucking world. The UN&amp; NGO's are the ones behind the trafficking. The foundation of the U.N. is Lucis  Trust. Formerly known as Lucifer publishing. You don't need to believe in anything, but remember the most powerful in the world believe in fucking Lucifer. Its on their website. I thought Satanism and all these labels took away from the credibility of the investigation but guess what? They sacrifice to Saturn, aka. Moloch aka. El of canaan. The new age wave is all kabbalistic. Apparently there is some truth to &lt;REDACTED&gt; Stop discounting the blatant occult aspect as if they're not trying to acquaint us with something dark. As the conspiracy theorists say, wake the fuck up.

               I promise I'm not and I'm not telling you what to write. Its just there are only so many rabbit holes you can expect a nonbeliever to jump down. Some non believers get super turned off when Satan is brought up. But They can't argue with the common sense of this Bill. My plan is to win over people with common sense and then present the Satanic aspect soon after Christmas.

                Stop derailing. It's pathetic. I'm no Christian, the images presented by the main "suspects" of "Pizzagate" are riddled with pagan/occult symbols.

               This is faulty logic - one segment believing in the ethereal does not automatically make its opposite any more valid without evidence -no matter how widespread.

                 Whoa, jumping to extremes is also no beuno. Consider taking criticism not as an attack on your character, but an effort to vet information being presented. What you said is relevant, but you discredit yourself by making assumptions.  I won't explain anymore, hopefully you can spend some time and really think about your convictions and what evidence they're propped up by.

                  I'm taking criticism, I understand and acknowledge that it is faulty logic, i.e. it's an opinion.
However, the foundation company, Lucis Trust, is a foundation company of the U.N. This is no assumption.

                  I could care less if I'm discredited, as long as a true investigator sees a fraction of the information I've put forward, the focus from pedophiles and pizzagate will shift to the U.N. &amp; NGO's &amp; Child Trafficking. It is not O.K. to ignore these things. Good &amp; evil are subjective, the battle between the two is a creation from the Kaballah, which is the foundation for all mystery schools. No assumptions there, just the facts. 
Now please back to the original thread, stay on topic.
 Focusing on my comment is, in my eyes, an attempt to derail. If you wish to see what I've put forward, go to my voat thread and lay out your constructive criticism there.

              There is a spiritual war raging out there. In modern history it's probably never been so openly  exposed as the events that have started to take place right now.

               This, right here. THIS is what I'm getting sick of seeing.

              <p>
               I get it that you're Christian. I get it that every damn last boogyman is "Satan" to you. And I get it that voila, here we have a boogyman that is outwardly Satanic at least in image if not in actual practice. However, that doesn't make them actually Satan incarnate. I get it that you want it to mean that, but it fucking doesn't mean that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now we're seeing bullshit posts about Marina Abromovic being an actual immortal vampire who found the fountain of youth. Are you seriously fucking kidding me?
              </p>
              <p>
               A "spiritual war"? What the FUCK is a "spiritual war"? Can you put it in simple fucking terms that a non-foil-hatter, non-holy-roller, normie can understand or not?
              </p>

               As soon as you go down ANY of these religious whacko avenues, you end up down ALL of them.
              </p>
              <p>
               You end up going "oh, there is something supernatural at work here and that's the real lead, ohhhh yeah, that's the rabbit hole I'm talkin' about, dive down the rabbit hole with my brother pilgrims! We're gonna burn us some witches!"

                A spirtual war is the war that has been going on since the beginning of man, the war between good and evil. The globalist agenda isn't about land, or money, or power, it's a war over individuals.
               </p>
               <p>
                I get it, it sounds crazy. I was just like you, I considered myself agnostic, that the existence of God can neither be proven nor disproven. Until about a month and a half ago that is, when I threw all my preconceived notions out the window in a search for truth and a fire was lit inside me. I'm not 100% convinced anything is true, except the existence of God. That's the only thing I know for sure is true.
               </p>
               <p>
                To me it's strange that you're open-minded enough to see that there's a worldwide pedophilia ring among the most powerful and rich people in the world, and the great lengths they go to cover this up. Yet you are so certain that religious people are whackos.
