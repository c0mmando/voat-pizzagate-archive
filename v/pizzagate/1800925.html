<p>The basic principle is that there is a mountain of evidence of systemic abuse of children by government agencies already out there. We can build public acceptance for the existence of Pedogate by pointing to these mainstream sources. There are tons of people who respond to Pizzagate by saying, &quot;That\'s crazy, we would know about something like that.&quot; What we want to do is reply, &quot;Oh? Did you know about this? Or this? Or this?&quot;</p>
<p>For example, Psychanaut found <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1795429">data supplied by the Children\'s Bureau</a> going back more than a decade on various kinds of child abuse, including about 58,000 cases annually of child sexual abuse. What is very suspicious is the sub-section that relates to foster care. The Children\'s Bureau has consistently reported since at least 2005 that the rate of abuse among foster kids is 1/3rd to 1/4th as high as in the general population. It doesn\'t even break out sexual abuse of foster kids as a category. We know that this is crap. There are endless mainstream media stories specifically about sexual exploitation of foster kids, like these ones:</p>
<p><a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/15/new-york-foster-care-system/">NY Grand Jury Says Foster Care &quot;Woefully Inadequate&quot; After Man Abuses 100 Boys</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.houstonpress.com/news/there-s-little-outrage-for-12-000-kids-suffering-in-the-texas-foster-care-system-8161341">Judge Orders Texas Foster Care Reformed After 12,000 Kids Exposed to Physical, Sexual, and Psychological Abuse</a></p>
<p>Okay. So I am working on a lengthy press &quot;backgrounder&quot; that will explain these issues. It will reference the missing DC girls, the surge in sex trafficking arrests since Trump\'s executive order, the totally inadequate federal-level data tracking, and stories like the ones above from every major city and state. When it is ready, I will post it in this thread and everyone can critique it. Meanwhile, however, I need two things:</p>
<p>1) Links to stories about kids in foster care being abused.</p>
<p>2) Technical help. I\'m good with writing and Google, but my Internet security skills are weak. This needs to wind up in PDF format, like a standard press backgrounder. Unfortunately, I\'m likely to leave my fingerprints on it somewhere if I generate the PDF. (There\'s always some metadata field that I manage to miss.) Is there anyone who could take the raw text I post on Voat and make it into a nice, media-ready document that can\'t be traced back to anyone?</p>
<p>Other comments and suggestions would be VERY welcome. Thanks.</p>',
