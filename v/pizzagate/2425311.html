<p>SGT Report. I like this guy, but he can be repetitive. I have enjoyed about 70% of his work. He does talk about some polarizing elements: Christianity, financial stuff and the occasional ‘out-there’ conspiracy theories. However, he BOLDY delivers the pizzagate narrative and constantly has relevant speakers.</p>

<p>Corbett Report. This youtuber is very smart, and informing on conspiracy. Heavy on government crime, big business corruption, medium on pedophilia.</p>

<p>There are other good youtubers who have at least one pizzagate video or two that are worth watching: </p>
<p>project veritas. They followed Luke Kuhns (If i remember correctly) into comet ping pong to tape some antifa dudes plotting to stink bomb the inauguration. Here they are posing as pimps and getting government assistance for their underage brothel:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UOL9Jh61S8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UOL9Jh61S8</a></p>
<p>Fiona Barnett. Not a youtuber, rather a victim coming forward. Her videos are informative, and a strong accusation awaiting corroboration and justice. I found her compelling.</p>

<p>Other useful websites:
This site has has been in several posts, and I believe it is legit, but it is entirely possible that one or two bogus stories have slipped in. There seems to be some disinformation attacks trying to discredit this site, much like us! </p>
<p><a href="https://medicalkidnap.com/">https://medicalkidnap.com/</a></p>
<p>Henry Makow, Phd, blogs about satanism, as well as publishes lots of work on the subject. I didn’t spend too much time looking into this, but it seems a worthy reference.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.henrymakow.com/">https://www.henrymakow.com/</a></p>
<p>David McGowan wrote a lot that connects several famous people to government, military, CIA, satanism and pedophilia. He also has plenty to say about MKULTRA and American serial killer history; exposing many surprising connections.</p>

<p>(Strong stomachs only, couldn’t finish)</p>
<p>Abby Martin Exposes Podesta’s corruption. I guess RT’s channel isn’t popular in the states, lol, but Abby really kicks Podesta in the crouch with this vid. She doesn’t go into pedophilia, however.</p>

<p>This is BY NO MEANS an exhaustive lit. Neither is this an authorized or authoritative list. Rather, it is an invitation. Let’s scratch some names off. Let’s add some that we agree are good. Let’s hash this out. </p>
<p>One last bit. I have a reference that is to be avoided:</p>
<p><a href="http://itccs.org/">http://itccs.org/</a></p>

<p>I am fairly sure that this guy, Kevin Arnett is not on the level. His reports mix about 50% real stuff with straight up imaginary stuff. As far as I have seen, he is the ONLY person referencing the ITCCS or the International Child Abuse Tribunal or the Ninth Circle of Hell cult. There was a suggestion that he is connected to Podesta.</p>
<p>ADDED: Mr. Gunk. This video, reporting on circumstances, facts and rumors surrounding Spielberg, Hollywood and child stars with mysterious circumstances, etc. This is one of the most detailed and well researched that I have seen, up there with “An Open Secret”, etc.</p>

<p>EDIT: I was politely asked to include a bit in the title, so I had to delete and re-post. Here is a comment that came along from the ride, from “anonymous”:</p>
<p>Made an account to add to the list. I have done loads of research and only really share it on endchan and sometimes 8chan.
I have made a couple of documentary style videos about masonic ritual abuse etc. I also host a board called /horror/ on endchan.and we have been making leaps and bounds. Fuck youtube here is a chan that you can upload up to 350mb video files.
Not sure if voat plays sound in webms if not I linked a preview to hear the sound

plenty more in this thread <a href="https://endchan.net/horror/res/16.html">https://endchan.net/horror/res/16.html</a> /horror/ Is a little meta a little meme-esque I do also have a /pizzagate/ board <a href="https://endchan.net/pizzagate">https://endchan.net/pizzagate</a> where I have screencapped over one thousand cultist instagram posts and mirrored important pg vids. Would love to have more eyes on both boards.
I wont ban anyone unless they break endchans global site rules which is no rules except anything that is illegal under us law. Also its anonymous so if you are used to chans but want a longer thread time this would be perfect for moderate researchers. Please give comments and add into the research we are only a couple of posters. At least lurk for fuck sakes we have masons trying to correct us and whatnot it gets amusing to see the limits the masons go to defend their cult.

           Abby Martin Exposes Podesta’s corruption. I guess RT’s channel isn’t popular in the states, lol, but Abby really kicks Podesta in the crouch with this vid. She doesn’t go into pedophilia, however.

           This is BY NO MEANS an exhaustive lit. Neither is this an authorized or authoritative list. Rather, it is an invitation. Let’s scratch some names off. Let’s add some that we agree are good. Let’s hash this out.

           One last bit. I have a reference that is to be avoided:

           I am fairly sure that this guy, Kevin Arnett is not on the level. His reports mix about 50% real stuff with straight up imaginary stuff. As far as I have seen, he is the ONLY person referencing the ITCCS or the International Child Abuse Tribunal or the Ninth Circle of Hell cult. There was a suggestion that he is connected to Podesta.

           ADDED: Mr. Gunk. This video, reporting on circumstances, facts and rumors surrounding Spielberg, Hollywood and child stars with mysterious circumstances, etc. This is one of the most detailed and well researched that I have seen, up there with “An Open Secret”, etc.

           Made an account to add to the list. I have done loads of research and only really share it on endchan and sometimes 8chan.
I have made a couple of documentary style videos about masonic ritual abuse etc. I also host a board called /horror/ on endchan.and we have been making leaps and bounds. Fuck youtube here is a chan that you can upload up to 350mb video files.
Not sure if voat plays sound in webms if not I linked a preview to hear the sound

           /horror/ Is a little meta a little meme-esque I do also have a /pizzagate/ board

           where I have screencapped over one thousand cultist instagram posts and mirrored important pg vids. Would love to have more eyes on both boards.
I wont ban anyone unless they break endchans global site rules which is no rules except anything that is illegal under us law. Also its anonymous so if you are used to chans but want a longer thread time this would be perfect for moderate researchers. Please give comments and add into the research we are only a couple of posters. At least lurk for fuck sakes we have masons trying to correct us and whatnot it gets amusing to see the limits the masons go to defend their cult.
Pic related some of the deep shit we have found recently
