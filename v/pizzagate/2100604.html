<p>Yet another State employee is found mysteriously dead, his body pulled from the Potomac after being reported missing. This is related to PizzaGate as possible ties to the child trafficking and the criminals behind the numerous email and fraud related \'mysterious deaths\'. There are clear links to overseas child trafficking hotspots, recent mysterious deaths related to the DNC / Clinton / email scandals, links to Clinton\'s state dept.</p>

<p>OSAC Diplomatic Security:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Diplomatic Security has a broad scope of global responsibilities, with protection of people, information, and property as its top priority. Overseas, DS develops and implements effective security programs to safeguard all personnel who work in every U.S. diplomatic mission around the world. In the United States, the Bureau protects the Secretary of State, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, and foreign dignitaries below the head-of-state level who visit the United States. DS develops and implements security programs to protect the more than 100 domestic State Department facilities as well as the residence of the Secretary of State.
DS investigates passport and visa fraud, conducts personnel security investigations, and issues security clearances. The Bureau also assists foreign embassies and consulates in the United States with the security for their missions and personnel.</p>

            Let's not disparage DS agents. They protect diplomats and diplomatic facilities abroad, investigate visa and passport fraud, etc. They are underpaid, work brutal hours, and it's a more dangerous job overseas than domestic federal agents face. Not to say there isn't something fishy in this guy's death, but a little respect for DS agents is deserved.
