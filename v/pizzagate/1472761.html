            Shills? Generally that be "Hasbara Shills"
           </p>
           <p>
            I suggest all google "Hasbara offers $2,000/month for college students to shill on the internet"
           </p>
           <p>
            There are people who care, and there are people that make their living off mind fucking the general population.
           </p>
           <p>
            US NON-SHILLS are not paid to bullshit, thus the existence of SHILLS ( HASBARA SHILLS IN GENERAL) should NOT be ignored.
