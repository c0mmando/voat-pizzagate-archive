            Possibly interesting about his mother's death and will.  The article was written on 3/12/2007.  So we can assume she passed around that time.
           </p>
           <p>
            I did a search on dccourts.gov and found her will was entered into the docket on 4/11/2007.  Here is the quote from the search: "ORIGINAL Will dated March ?, 2007, filed on April 11, 2007; Entered docket on April 11, 2007."
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is there a question mark on the date?  Did she really sign her will a few days before her death?
           </p>
           <p>
            Final interesting thing is that the filing is still open. Disposition: 	Undisposed

            Not that I disagree with your rationale..because it is very rational...but read VieBleu's post...there is an occult aspect to this IMO, because of the "Thelema" email and there are emails mentioning "book clubs" in other cities...

           <p>
            I'd like to weigh in here - there are links to a slightly fuller version of this in this thread but here are the main points-
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Who were the 25 mother Mary Podesta "adopted"? Was it a group of devoted Satanists that she assumed a leadership role over as an elder female High Priestess? Let's take a look -
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            At about 4:55 in this video
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdRx4nRUJg8">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdRx4nRUJg8
            </a>
            you are viewing a Podesta wikileaks email originally written by Tamara Luzzatto, the DC lobbyist and the mom who assured Podesta that for a dinner party "the kids will be in that pool" when he visited. Here, just after wife Mary Podesta is involved in a car accident in May of 2010, Luzzatto offers that since she is "...hearing from book people galore, I thought I'd better send this out.
            <strong>
             At your and Mary's service to guide a circle of 25 or so totally devoted fellow readers, but also friends, and again, anything else I can do to just keep people informed. I hope I worded this suitably or aptly or whatever."
            </strong>
            Here Tamara is afraid to misstep and so hopes she speaks carefully enough - why? And here is a specific reference to 25 - the 25 that Mother Podesta "adopted" perhaps? Finally she offers "pain for her pain" which isn't the most common way to say Get Well Soon, but makes a bit more sense in light of our new understanding of "spirit cooking" circles. Marina Abramovic's theatrical blood ritual performance art uses similar lingo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later in the video we see an email (5:56)Luzzatto writes to John Podesta about the accident of "OUR Mary" - Mary Podesta who is in "our own circle", and who drives her to their "book group" of "devoted readers". She writes that she is at Podesta's service "to guide the circle of 25" This is likely the string of about 25 names (26 plus Luzzatos email) that is also shown.
           </p>
           <p>
            She informs the group (4:35) that in her talks with Mary who drove her to the "book group", Mary declared her "love for her family, Truckee, AND our own circle - we really did talk about all that, SO I will refrain from saying what I REALLY think about a vehicle hitting her or why this all happened to her." Since they REALLY did talk about that, does that mean that the 25 the email went out to can be assured that Mary's devotion to the group is not in question... The whole train of thought and speech is decidedly odd. Truckee is a rural town where there seems to be a retreat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Earier in the video (2:34) Luzzatto writes to Podesta - "I will try to keep sending word, or find a way that you get word, and when we can all do something to help. I and our other Mary Followers will round up ways to truly help" Sorry, this just isn't your usual book club or bible study group.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thelema Favor email - (2:09 same videoYouTube Is a forwarded email from wife Mary to John with the subject line "Thelema favor", a hard to explain away reference to Aleister Crowley's (self-proclaimed Beast) cult religion of ritual Satanist worship called Thelema. At the top of this email, it is clear that Podesta has recently changed his email so the writer, another "John" goes through Podesta's mother Mary to reach him. This favor is no small thing - a meeting with the US President for the mother of a friend's family doctor who is in "Love" with Obama. Really? Of course Washington runs on favors, and a "Thelema favor" must be a special one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do these emails help us reconstruct the barely suppressed lingo of a cult group of about 25 or so close knit people who meet regularly but not in a way that can be openly discussed? This is a group that you have to worry about how you are "aptly" phrasing your words, in fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now here's where it gets even weirder. From "Spellbound: Women and Witchcraft in America, pg. 255)
            <a href="https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=ZVd7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;dq=aleister+crowley,+25,+coven&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=72M34_V_Ny&amp;sig=viPE4iW62GxHM_4qh8Se0wFEPfc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxm9mM8v7QAhWMlZQKHcUwAtEQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=aleister%20crowley%2C%2025%2C%20coven&amp;f=false">

            </a>
            Gerald Gardiner was an admirer of Crowley, and elaborated on Crowley's Thelema witchcraft rituals by being "the first to promote and publicize a magical-religious pantheaon headed by The Goddess, an idea which he seems to have gotten in part from the writings of C.G. Leland, a folklorist who described late 19th century witch cults in Italy....Gardner's rituals had a number of Crowley-like aspects: Rituals were to be done in the nude; sexual arousal was a source of magical power , the High Priestess was to perform sex acts with the High Priest (if not the whole of the male congregation); flogging and brandishment of knives (dominoes?) went hand in hand with a mythology of ritual incest (mother/son) and human sacrifice." Is this what happened at the Truckee retreat with Mother Mary Podesta presiding as elder female and High Priestess, the symbolic Mother Of 25 Mary Followers?
           </p>
           <p>
            It should be pointed out that the Gardinarian tradition has a strong tradition of female leadership (reference same book and page as above), and this string of emails underlines the importance of Podesta's mother, his wife, a female doctor's elder mother, and the central role Tamara Luzzato plays within this "book circle". The fact that many of these women come from Italian heritage is also interesting, considering the Gardnarian connection to Goddess oriented witchcraft from Italy as recently as a century ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Final thought - Politics and Prose comes to mind when discussing a "book circle" that would be right on ground zero of the connected compounds.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could use assistance finding the original emails in wikileaks - I will archive and update this post.
           </p>
           <p>
            UPDATE: The emails discussed are now linked instead of having to look at that video. (sorry about that but the video does also go on its own track about these emails, which can be interesting.) THIS ONE is the "OUR Mary" email about M. Podesta's accident, and lists 26 names that T. Luzzatto is informing about it aside from another Luzzatto email which I didn't count. So it is speculated that this may be the "25 adopted children" and "circle of 25"?

            <strong>
             ADDED UPDATE
            </strong>
            It is really hard for me to wrap my head around old lady Podesta really leading an occult circle in some ways.  I've seen a photo of the "book circle" and they just look like an average bunch of old ladies.  No fangs, no horns, no visible claws.   Tamara Luzzatto?  I have a lot less trouble picturing her and her freaky mother-in-law with the Evie's Crib website in an occult ritual setting.   The thing is, this is our natural tendency - to dismiss as fantasy what we know actually does happen somewhere, somehow.   If I absolutely had to bet, I'd say I'm willing to believe that yes the Podesta family got involved in occult ritual magic at some point, maybe through the pressure/seduction of an established DC coven run by the Luzzattos.  Something has to explain Skippy's total weirdness, his brother's ritual magic death throes sculpture and other art, and the weird Luzzatto family and emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with what
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/EvaEverywhere">
             @EvaEverywhere
            </a>
            says in this thread - yes people form groups to get ahead, like the Survivor show.  There is no reason why some of those groups might not gravitate towards black magic if they think it will give them an ounce more power over their rivals, or if it was ever in their faimily already and they believed they gained power, wealth and prestige through it.  No reason at all actually.  It has to have happened.  To say this could simply NEVER happen is ridiculously naive and also against reasonable odds.  Maybe we are seeing some traces of such a group left behind in these emails because of Tamara Luzzatto's sloppiness, a lot like Alefantis' sloppiness.

            That wasn't meant literally as stated before. But
            <a href="http://archive.is/Mq5LI">
             Tony Podesta adopted 3 kids with his first wife who he gave up for adoption after they divorced.
            </a>
            That was 4 years after he tried to not let them get the financial support they would deserve. 
This is the kind of good father figure he is.

             Excuse me...  the ORIGINAL story, told by all in DC through her lifetime,  was 'children' and not 'adults'.

             There has been an effort to flip the story into 'adults' ever since PG broke.  Who the fuck adopts ADULTS, anyway ?

              Please show us anything that can substantiate your claim. Wheres the original story? IF there is an original story, why wouldn't you post it?  The article in question makes it OVERTLY clear that she did not literally adopt anyone. You claim there's an article that does... but you don't post it? Why the fuck would you think anyone would take your word for it? You don't have the wherewithal to post a source when making such contradicting claim? I just don't get it.

                Hahahaha for not understanding my comment. I wasn't commenting on the quantity she allegedly adopted, I was simply stating the fact that people DO adopt adults! It's really a thing, however there has never been any indication that she legally adopted anyone.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               In places where adult adoptions exist, it may or may not transfer filiation in addition to inheritance rights. For example, in Colorado, one can adopt an adult of age 21 or older for inheritance purposes, but filiation will remain unaffected.[7] However, adoption of a person between the ages of 18 and 20 (inclusive) transfers both inheritance rights and filiation.[8] In most other American states, both filiation and inheritance rights are transferred.

              Have to agree, what the fuck is the reason to adopt 25 adults into a family.

            That statement was not meant literally. I wish I could remember where it was I read it but somewhere it was stated that friends of the Podesta brothers adopted her as a mother figure and called her mama.

             Only now is there this push to tweak this story.  See the forest for the trees, my friend. Take the information provided in this investigation and come to a conclusion on the real identity of this BITCH.  In other words: WAKE THE FUCK UP.

            Adopt in these circles means MKULTRA torture and imprinting them as slaves.  I figure when the witch died one of the Podesta Satanist took control of her slave assets and is running them as we speak....hell they would be anyone....James Comey is a good a thought as anyone.  They will push their slaves into higher office and they will get promoted because they control who promotes them.  They could be wormed all through the government.  Podesta has to occasionally visit with them.  Probably once or twice a year.....party.....screw some kids and flash the lights and take the mind control drugs and make sure it is all running smooth.   Then on to the future!!!

            Ha !!  Looks like a massive cover up. The story of her death and the obituary would have never gained wider scrutiny if it were not for the Wikileak of Podesta's emails. There are no adopted brothers or sisters in the record for John and Tony. But there is no doubt, that a story was fabricated to explain the huge number of children at Mama Podesta's house over the years, and it became DC legend. Now, they avoid that story like the plague!  Her story and her 'sons' for that matter, appear 100% fabricated and contrived. You know what I think? I think her house was an original kid hive for the DC elite and brownstone operations.

             I usually like to extend the benefit  of the doubt but as you say the timing of this release of info matters. As other posters noted the reference COULD be figurative but I hate  to say it--your theory is very credible given what we know about creepy Podesta-molesta brothers. However, if she is just a food loving' crowd pleaser, perhaps the food tie in to political fund raising originated all those years ago. I read once that mediterranen culture values deep talk at the dinner table--they don't generally brook small talk.

            Yeah, that was "discovered" months ago.  To date, nobody has fingered a single adoptee of hers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, it's unclear whether that reference was literal or stylistic.  The "tribute" is written rather strangely so it's hard to discern.

             It's quite clear she did not literally adopt people.   These were adult friends/colleagues of the Podestas and they would gather at her house, because she loved to cook for them and "mother" them.  The adoption part is meant as a tribute to her warmth and hospitality.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is obvious that Tony Podesta said that metaphorically.   One the giant failures of the Pizzagate investigatory style is ignoring metaphor, humor, sarcasm, irony, insults and probably a dozen other verbal devices that make up how people live and speak these days.   Literalism contributes very poor comprehension what is actually going on with a lot of the evidence cited.

             <p>
              She had two sons, but she adopted another 25 people during the time she
came to Washington, said her older son, Tony Podesta, a Washington public
affairs strategist.
             </p>
             <p>
              "She had two lives. She was a wife and mother in Chicago, but then she came
to Washington and became friends with presidents and senators who always
enjoyed her wit and willingness to say anything to anybody."

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             If you're able to interpret that as her literally adopting ANYONE, then it's time to step away from the keyboard.  If there's other evidence to suggest she adopted ANYONE, Than please share that information.  This article does not say she literally adopted anyone.

               I find it very interesting that Killery's mother was "adopted" into a family when she ran away from her grandparents.

                At 14, Dorothy escaped her grandmother’s strict domain for the unforgiving America of the Great Depression. She cooked, cleaned and nannied for a family in San Gabriel, Calif., in exchange for room, board and $3 a week. She lived in near abject poverty, but in that household Dorothy learned what family was.

               Not sure what the whole story is behind her finding the family who adopted her, or how they found her, but it just goes to show that it wouldn't be difficult for Mrs. Podesta to find a bunch of kids who felt unwanted to come live with her. Runaways happen everyday and don't know enough about the world to realize that those who appear friendly and generous are actually monsters in disguise.

               Sometimes, things go horribly wrong when you start living with another family, whether you're a runaway or your family has entrusted that family to care for you. Here's one of the worst accounts ever to see the inside of a courtroom:
              </p>
              <p>
               <em>
                The murder of Sylvia Likens took place in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States in October 1965. The 16-year-old Likens was tortured to death by Gertrude Baniszewski, Baniszewski's children, and other young people from their neighborhood. Likens' parents, who were carnival workers, had left her and her sister, Jenny, in the care of the Baniszewski family three months before her death. The Likens' parents were paying Baniszewski $20 a week to care for the sisters.
               </em>
              </p>
              <p>
               <em>
                Baniszewski, her daughter Paula, her son John, and two neighborhood youths, Coy Hubbard and Richard Hobbs, were tried and convicted of torturing and murdering Likens. The case was described by the prosecutor in Baniszewski's trial as "the most terrible crime ever committed in the state of Indiana".
               </em>

               People who take in children for whatever reason can be good or bad, but as we're seeing with Pizzagate, this gives evil people a perfect opportunity to abuse, torture, and anything else their sick minds can imagine.
