<p>I am exposing one Satanist FB account. I\'ve been conducting searches through keywords. I had a feeling that if someone were hell-bent on disinfo that the synagogue shooting wouldn\'t be turned into propaganda. That\'s how I found this. I first read the rhetoric, saw this image: </p>

            I know a lot of Christians want to portray devotion to the Virgin Mary as idolatry but please consider the source of that error and consider that her violent enemies have been the institutional elite, masons and the like. Consider that she is the chosen Daughter of the Father, the Spouse of the Spirit and the Mother of His only Son - there is no closer human to God, and He on the cross gave Her to us as our Mother as well. She is not a god, but she watches over the world at His side and suffers for it; she will pass on our polite requests for help to Her Son, interceding on our behalf. Anytime I wonder at something, I look at who is opposed, especially violently - and look how her sanctuaries have been targeted and blown up, her followers attacked and her own purity insulted by the cabal elite and masons. Don't take my word for it, of course, I only ask you to consider, pray for guidance and then decide.

             The Virgin Mary is crucial to Christianity.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have no idea why anyone would not pray to her or dismiss her in any way. She is sacred ... she is holy.

              The Bible clearly fails to say she is God.  If she's God, I'll pray to her....
What you guys keep trying to do is suggest that we should pray to her/treat her as God...but then you want to deny you worship her.
             </p>
             <p>
              There were very few people closer to Jesus than Peter (best friend, ALWAYS right there...) and his Mother.....
             </p>
             <p>
              Funny how Satan, in his hostility and hatred for Jesus, chose to demonstrate that hatred by making both Peter AND Mary into key parts of his deception in the Catholic Church.

               Actually, the church vilified Mary Magdalene by calling her a whore. She was actually his closest disciple and very much not a whore. She was a wealthy woman and highly respected. Norma Lorre Goodrich has written extensively on her background and her devotion to Him. The Dead Sea Scrolls back her up by pretty well demonstrating that. Peter thought he was the closest because Peter was ... well, Peter, and very jealous of Mary Magdalene.

            Just wanted to say I don't think its accurate to equate the democrat party with the pedo elites necessarily.  Republicans: child sexual abuser Dennis Hastert, everyone involved in the Franklin Scandal, etc.  Evil on both sides.

             The Democratic Party is leading the charge. They are the ones holding the blackmail. Yes, some Republicans are dirty, but you know darn well the Cannibal Queen was leading the charge. JA was helping and aligned with who again? The Spirit Cookers were who again? The PedoWood Elite are backing who again? The Dems are up to their Baphomet horns in this. To say anything different would be disingenuous.

            Check out Walter Veith's take on this whole struggle, how the Christian religion has been under assault by people like this since it's creation:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTSKfXzdiuE&amp;list=PL95B1BB23B7A3C795">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTSKfXzdiuE&amp;list=PL95B1BB23B7A3C795
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't agree with everything he says but he certainly explains a lot in regard to the prophecy of Daniel and Revelation.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's interesting that they choose to fight Christianity when it stands for such principles as Liberty, Justice, Mercy, Love for all (non-sexual kind), Loving the sinner and hating the sin, Truth, Peace, Order, etc. These people want to turn the laws of God around, because they want the freedom to abuse the innocent with no repercussion. If God is in charge, they can't change his laws. But if the government is the only ruling body, they are free to change it according to their pleasure. They want nothing set in stone, other than the destruction of Christianity.

              Yes. The only downside is that there are 20-30 videos, 1.5 hours each. I'm less than halfway through but they are most interesting

               Sadly veith blames entirely the catholic church and never ONCE questions jewish subversion, which is a massive part of how the catholic church became so demented. He ignores a lot of history and his interpretation of revelations in particular is very personal and speculative. He believes a lot of the events like "Stars falling" have already happened in the late 1800s / early 1900's. There really isn't much proof for this tbh. I've studied this stuff a long time. It isn't easy and I have heard almost every possible combination of explanations for the different prophecies.
              </p>
              <p>
               Walter veith may be one of those 95% truth with 5% misdirection types. Be careful with him. I've seen every single one of those videos BTW- I was initially a big fan of the guys work. It isn't without merit but just be warned he overlooks and dismisses A LOT---A LOTTTT of history.

             Well, Christ really ruined their fun. If you read what was going on in Sodom and Gomorrah, you get some idea of the perversity going on. He really did present a new way to live, and he did it without tyranny. He ''taught'' and ''instructed'' those who listened preaching love so you are correct.

            I once saw a documentary. I want to say it covered the jasper county dragging, and other "neonazi hate crimes". I could be mistaken it was a long time ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            A cartoonist was sentenced in a crime because the cops found a magazine in the murders residence that had a cartoon of a lynching. They claimed it inspired the crime and sentenced the cartoonist to life.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't find any mention of it on the internets. If the documentary was real and if the scenario actually happened. It would set a case to have people who write this shit, locked up. Unfortunately, I don't even remember the name of the documentary, I just remember it was about "white supremacy".
           </p>
           <p>
            I continue digging around to see if I can find it...

             t's not so much I want them arrested for speaking, I want them arrested for what they are doing ... IF they are actually engaged in criminality.
            </p>
            <p>
             If someone is a Satanist and part of this agenda, there's a chance they are engaged in more than posting. But I totally believe in free speech. They tried blaming lyrics to music at one point. But let me also state, that if done right, the victim is influenced by negativity. Like someone being bullied. You strip them of happiness, create a paranoia and self-hatred, and then suggest suicide.
            </p>
            <p>
             So far this person has only demonstrated that she's a Satanist and involved in disinfo and supporting ''The Agenda''. That is not and should not be a criminality. But when you get enough people on social media influencing in this way, we need to find a way to counter it. It's one more peg in a hole that they have that we haven't been effectively fighting against. We've been following JA's friends/associates, but there hundreds of little punk asses across the country doing identical things.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now she's ''jokingly'' referred to fake blood-splattered sheets, but this most likely is dark humor, but then again, I don't know. So I don't want anyone getting the idea that I think what she says is illegal. I'm only exposing this to show what is going on and for us to be vigilant in countering the rhetoric.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hope I'm being clear. Because I followed that one guy, I had no idea this was being done. Now I'm aware and on it, and I'm trying to make sure others are being made aware also.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks.
