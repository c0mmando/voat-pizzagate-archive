<p>showing links to pizzagate and Sandy Hook.  Guys whether you want to admit it or not, this is where we get them!  Millions of people have given money to Sandy Hook &quot;victims&quot;.  If you look at my post you can see the obvious connections to what our government did at Sandy Hook and the elites.  There is pedophile symbols in the town and I have shown a few things I have found on my post.  There is SO MUCH proof of Sandy Hook being a government operation and I just actually started looking into it right before the election.  I was threatened on Twitter that they would find me when I started posting videos proving it was a government operation.  I was told I would be like Jonathan Reich and on that same day he was arrested and is currently in prison in New York.  United States Marshalls stormed his house and shackled him and even his dad who is an attorney is not allowed to see him.  He was investigating Sandy Hook and he\'s only in his early twenties.  So much money has been given and it is a proven fraud. </p>
<p>One of these posts I posted yesterday got me attacked here on Voat last night and that should tell us all something.  Please help me by upvoting my comments.  I also recommend that we do not make comments like &quot;thank you&quot; or even &quot;good find&quot; because those comments leaves us vulnerable to these same attacks they did on me last night.  Maybe we can comment to a person in messages but right now I can\'t even message because I have so many downvotes.  Please help me and I will help you when you need it!</p>',

             Are you completely serious right now? We have human trafficking ALL over our country, ONE branch of our Dept of Agriculture (US Forestry) alone had over 600 complaints of sexual harassment launched against its employees.  Hearing just a couple of weeks ago!
             <a href="https://youtu.be/zHnxJYrHOEU">
              https://youtu.be/zHnxJYrHOEU
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             That is just a small portion of the hearing.  One female employee complained that one of her coworkers had harassed her for YEARS even going so far as to lift her shirt and poke her breasts with a letter opener.  He was allowed to retire and then came back in as a motivational speaker!  Just a few weeks ago a house was raided in Arizona for "mail fraud" and SEVERAL children were caught on camera leaving the house on camera by a reporter.  Here's a link to the article
             <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2016/11/01/reports-human-smuggling-ring-busted-ahwatukee/93116664/">

             </a>
             The article says:
            </p>
            <p>
             Phoenix Councilman Sal DiCiccio originally told reporters that at least a dozen young people were found inside the home, near 35th Street and Equestrian Trail, about 6 a.m. He said he learned from neighbors familiar with the house that the teens were suspected of being involved in a scam that purported to sell products door to door, although he said it was unclear what they might have been selling.
Representatives for DiCiccio later told The Arizona Republic that the councilman made comments about the operation after speaking to law-enforcement officials and neighborhood residents. He was subsequently asked by Phoenix police to not use the phrase "human trafficking" when describing the incident, one of his representatives said.
            </p>

             I shouldn't have to tell you all the atrocities that are located on this thread because they are all here for your perusal.  So if you don't think it odd that a twenty something year old kid who was actually investigating a potential coverup of our government gets his doors knocked down in the middle of the night, shackled by the United States Marshalls office, taken to Reichers on a $100,000 bond on a bogus misdemeanor isn't strange, then you, my friend, have the problem!  They won't even let his dad (who is an attorney) or anyone else see him.
            </p>
            <p>
             The only thing worse than living in a country that's not free is living in one that you think is free and then finding out that it's not!

            Purely form a strategic standpoint, getting Sandy Hook involved is a terrible idea, whether true or not. It's just going to play into the hand that we are radical conspiracy theorists that shouldn't be listened to. And now you up the burden of proof, because not only are you trying to prove #PizzaGate, you also have to prove the Sandy Hook conspiracy. And now our argument really does become an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence, where just #PizzaGate doesn't require that. I also don't see the necessity of getting Sandy Hook involved. Society doesn't accept pedophiles, so people will be outraged enough if he can offer good evidence within #PizzaGate.

              Calling a Men's Rights Activist a panderer is hilarious...and hilariously stupid. It's that I want this investigation to actually go somewhere and not fall on deaf ears. I've seen everything from Sandy Hook conspiracies to a Jewish Khaballism to 9/11 conspiracies to Illuminati conspiracies, to lizard people, etc. Throw all these onto #PizzaGate and nobody will listen. Not to mention, that's terrible for focus anyways. As you said, picking ones spot is reasonable, and that's exactly what I'm talking about. I'm not sure how you arrived at the conclusion that I have a pandering mentality. I'm also not an idiot, so I realize that a lot of conspiracy theorists see this as an opportunity to gain viewers and credibility...and an opportunity to make money as well.

               I think the point is that IF the Sandy Hook shooting was really a hoax, it would probably be one of the many unraveling threads of the tapestry in relation to pizzagate. We are speculating about elites with far reaching powers participating in massive conspiracy against the people of the world. I'm not saying we should be discussing Sandy Hook at length here, but I think that if pizzagate turns out to be totally confirmed then the Sandy Hook false flag would also have a higher probability of being true. And if Sandy Hook is proved, it probably has ties to pizzagate as well.

               It's attitude vs. tactics. Don't change the message (truth). Find a way to make it palatable to the masses.

                Truth isn't a message. It's a result. And combining all these conspiracy theories into one big thing isn't a good way to bring up about the truth anyways.

             At best, leave Sandy Hook to the fact the end goal was to cover up Obama's SS#. It is clear how they leverage the power to pull of these ops through pedophilia. And for whatever reason, feminists will kill to keep the cover ups of this and many other ops. We have to mind we don't fight on too many fronts at once.

               CT laws changed immediately after in light of the attack, to cover up death records. Obama, though never lived in CT, had a CT SS# that is reportedly belonging to a Harrison J Bounel who died in 1978.

                 Thats one of the key things I want to see from Trump. Hang traitors and treasonous politicians.

                <p>
                 If he doesn't order a full investigation into HRC and Obama with multi shadow agencies to over sight each other at every step. If I don't see Obama get a conviction, I will grab my guns and I expect everybody to join me!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Trump is the last straw, no more pussy footing around!! If he fucks us over, full on war! No two ways about it!! This is the last straw!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Obama has committed crimes and acts of treason right in front our faces and NOTHING has been done, IT MUST BE DONE !!

                  Hopefully a future gunsmith here. I'll bring the Barret's. I bet it is extremely difficult to make firearms, but I would love to.
