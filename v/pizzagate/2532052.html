So I have been rewatching scientology and the aftermath, and from the first episode, some comments have been made or the way things have been worded imply that a large amount of the people that are on this show have been sexually abused since they were children! Leah came into the church around 14, And almost immediately gets picked to be in the commercials and get head shots and other perks, how much do you wanna bet that there was some Harvey Weinstein type situation going on with whoever it was that was giving her the success.. the guy mark, said he was in the church since 4 yrs old! And then he was &quot;hand picked&quot; to be one of hubbard\'s &quot;boys&quot;... a comment by the hammer throwing guy was literally! &quot;The church RAPED us, what were we supposed to do!&quot;... I\'m only on episode 7 of season 1, and there are so many vague comments made, like they had to edit out the &quot;legitly awful&quot; stuff due to legal reasons... what if the church is nothing but a child sex trafficking ring?! That literally everything that they do is to groom people into being sexually assaulted and stockholmed! Is the FBI looking into this? Does scientology supply the children to high up elites? Has any scientology boat docked at &quot;little st james island&quot;? They separate the kids from their parents, insert themselves as the authority, many of these people who have been in it since childhood are reporting sexual abuse... all of these things and more are adding up to intentional grooming of families and children to facilitate sexual perversions of the scientology leaders... scientology preys on people with &quot;familiy&quot; issues, especially single women with children... 
Like what if a bunch of high up celebrities are friends with scientology celebrities just to use scientology for their endless supply of meek, obedient, parentless children.... and when they threaten to expose scientology, they are suicided...</p>',

            One of my friends was forced into this crap when he was 14. He knew all about L Ron's Life as bullshit. He was forced out when he started  fucking with them. During an audit, and most other activities. They make you leave all your personal shit in a different room. Blockage or some such nonsense. He knew they were going though his shit while he was away. (Tied light thread to his back pack zipper.) So he started leaving odd coded notes, strange symbols and such in his backpack. They got a lot more leery around him. Finally he left "QUIT GOING THROUGH MY FUCKING BACKPACK!" And sure enough the next week he was asked to leave. So he goes out of is way now to fuck with them. He knew how to spoof phone numbers. He would call local sciencetoligy building and spoof The Department of Mental Health's number. They would never answer. Good times.

            I'm ex-Scientologist, was in as a kid, parents were in since way before I was born, both in pretty high up positions, and I gotta say, I just don't see it guys. I've still got family deep in, many friends both out and still in- not one of them has shown any sign of the type of behavioral problems that child rape victims generally exhibit. Scientologists are really puritan, honestly. I never read anything in the religion to give me the idea that child rape would be condoned, in fact any and all perversion even pretty basic kinks are considered aberration from sanity that you need counseling (auditing, in Scientology terms) to stop exhibiting.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, Scientology has been a long-time enemy of the cabal, at least on surface inspection. Cabal controlled nations have historically tried repeatedly to outlaw and destroy the religion, and LRH considered the CIA to be the most evil organization on earth, and developed his own intelligence agency within the religion for the express purpose of countering their attempts to destroy him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, don't get me wrong, LRH was a loon, and his character flaws have become the flaws within the religion he started. It has good parts, but it's obviously not the answer to the salvation of man that LRH claimed it was.

               Well, sorry to hear that you've been born into and wasted your life for 20 years in a known cult run by an absolute power hungry freak and then later on an even more power hungry freak.  When one listens to Ronnie spouting off about xenu and knowing that people believe his stories, it is simply laughable to those outside of the cult.
Every cabal controlled government trying to outlaw scientology????  Oh, then you are talking about every government in every country on the planet.  Do you honestly think that the 5 foot nothing little twerp that is in charge now, isn't in deep with some government cabal?  He certainly is connected with hollywood and when one is connected with hollywood........well, it's just evil at it's finest.    You are brainwashed to think that scientology isn't involved in some way with some pretty nasty stuff.  I wonder how much money they've stolen from you to take their ludicrous courses.  They remind me of the freemasons.....you go along with it, doing your duty to the cult and then you get to a certain level, you know the level that makes you question everything because what you've learned or what you are asked to do goes against every fibre of your being.  Pride and ego are very very powerful and to admit that you've been duped is difficult and perhaps the payoff is better than admitting one was wrong.  Never trust a cultist organization, especially one that keeps taking your money and expects you to continue bowing to the master even though you know deep down there is something terribly wrong with it.

                Pretty much, yeah. DO you see every government treating the Catholic Church the same way?

                About $15k. Courses done while on staff are free (though you get paid almost nothing, of course). I'm not filled with regrets about it, I make plenty of money, and it wasn't ever a significant financial burden on me or my family.

                Yeah, that's exactly right. The lower level stuff is actually pretty common sense stuff, and by my experience really helps people. Then they get complacent about questioning it, and start thinking "if LRH was right about all this stuff so far, he must be right about this crazy stuff now." As I said earlier, most people never got to the crazy parts.

               <p>
                I agree completely, but when I was in I never felt like I was bowing to anyone. Believe it or not, Scientology can have a very positive atmosphere where self determination is respected and supported. When I was on staff, I witnessed it turn further and further away from that sort of atmosphere towards fanaticism, that's why I left. There are good things about Scientology, but it is sabotaged by the flaws in the religion which are based in LRH's character flaws.

                 Hollywood is one of the roots of depraved evil and I do not doubt for a minute that any known celeb signs in blood just like the music industry.  I truly despise anything that spews from it's ugly, self-absorbed nonsense....people and the movies they produce, the whole gamut.

                <p>
                 I understand there are good things about Scientology...I really do.  I've read every book I could get my hands on,even though they were written by ex-scientologists.  There wouldn't be such a mass following if there wasn't something good in it.  It can rid some nasty thought processes but so can devoted meditation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I just do not believe that the 'leader' is on the up and up.....at all.  And you confirm it in a way by saying that you saw it turn further and further toward fanaticism.  The problem in any organization almost always stems from the top.  When you start to add hollywood celebrities, build a separate place for them, there is something about it that stinks.  Most cults are the same however.  Anyone famous is always exalted.

                 Catholicism is protected because they've given it all over to the luciferians.  The rape of children in the catholic church has gone on for centuries.  Perhaps scientology hasn't been around long enough for some of the dirt to be dug up.

                  Scientology auditing is a bit like guided meditation combined with cognitive behavioral therapy. It's surprisingly effective, and probably the root of most Scientologist's trust in LRH. I wish LRH had been a rational and normal person and just funded real science into the use of an e-meter in psychological therapy rather than gone off the rails.

                  LRH and Scientology have a thing about artists, they're considered a bit sacred. The stated purpose of "Celebrity Centre" was to aid artists in controlling their life so they don't crash and burn, and avoiding the type of people who leach off of artists and make them crash and burn. The idea being that when people see that Scientologist celebrities are stable, decent people, as opposed to the crazies throughout the rest of Hollywood, it would be positive PR for the religion. That's a noble goal, on its face, and if it was true, would be a fine thing. It falls apart if the religion is false, and the pursuit of celebrity becomes tainted with ulterior motives besides genuinely wishing well for talented but spiritually vulnerable people.

                  NXIVM was protected, it's far younger than Scientology. And, there are thousands of ex-Scientologists who would be willing to spill the dirt, and have. There are entire websites devoted to ex-Scientologists talking to each other about their experiences and comparing notes to put the dirt together to hopefully crash the religion. I've never seen a shred of pedophilia or even any sex perversion mentioned.

                 Freemasons are a known Illuminati captured organization, so what is the implication if the Freemasons hate Scientologists? The upper ranks of the Freemasons are all satanic child rapists and child murderers. What do you think Scientology has done which is worse than that?

                   Hey Idiot. Scientology is based off freemasonry and satanism. Hubbard lived with Jack Parsons was and his family was into Crowley black magick.

             I for one, see through your little attempt to dissuade investigation. You can act offended and say that I'm wrong all you like, you might even convince others with such an act, but, not me.

              Yeah, I'm not a shill, so you don't see through anything, you're making things up to justify your own opinion.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't dissuade investigation at all, everyone should investigate everything and everyone they suspect. I'll change my mind the moment I see evidence that makes sense to me. As it stands now, I don't see it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not offended at all, where did you get that idea? You're acting way more offended than I am, all I did was express my doubts about your theory. If you can't handle that, perhaps your theory isn't that strong? Go investigate and find something better than "They said rape, but in context meaning not actual rape, therefore definitely actual rape!"

               As expected, you're using a condescending tone in order to undermine the better judgement of people here. I didn't say you were already acting offended, I said go ahead and do it, here you are now doing it. Sure, you're not overtly displaying it, but, I know how your kind works and the ways in which you try to bypass the reasoning of others when you're in damage-control mode.

                Absolutely, and I'm among those who explain that. But, there's a big gap between making people disconnect from their families, and screwing people out of tens of thousands of dollars, to being a pedophile rape cult. I have hours and hours of stories and explanations for how fucked Scientology is, and not a single instance have I heard of even a shade of child rape going on.

                 The difference here is that I'm not at all hiding my attitude - I'm not trying to deceive others here, I'm being entirely up front.

                 You on the other hand, continue to try to mask what you're trying to do in defending Scientology while trying to curry favor by denigrating LRH. But then you try to make it sound like the gaps cannot be filled, a clear attempt to dissuade others. Ironically enough, I personally am already filling in those gaps, but, I'm sure you know that hence your attempt to muddy the waters.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You told me to go investigate and yet I have already done so - if you had done so yourself, you'd POSSIBLY be able to make the same connections I have, but, given your approach here, it's clear that your interest is in keeping people from getting too close to Scientology - whoops, too late.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                 If you truly had "20 years" experience with Scientology, you'd know just how small the so-called gaps are and how easy they are to fill. I'm calling bullshit on your little story. You're a fucking pretender - the irony there being that LRH was also a pretender.

                  You're full of shit. No one should join Scientology, and the religion should abandoned by everyone in it. I'm in no way trying to win any points, that's just the truth. But that's still a long way from Scientology being a pedophile cult.

                  Oh please, as if anyone like you is going to be dissuaded. Any attempt to dissuade you will simply make you feel vindicated and energize you to look harder. I'm only saying that what's been posted so far doesn't support what the conclusions being drawn. Anyone who disagrees should look for better proof.

                   Already have and am, again, you know this, hence why you're doing what you do best, which is try to confuse the issue and otherwise attack me for not spelling it out right here in this exchange. If you're not a shill(which I sincerely doubt, given that you're going through all the same motions of a shill), you need to take a look around, because as I said, I'm already looking into the fuckery that is Scientology/NXIVM(et al) which you're so determined to say is not related here, because too many gaps or whatever the fuck your reason is.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Saying you're an ex-Scientologist with "20 years" experience while bashing LRH, does not automatically mean we have to take your word for it, especially when you follow up with claims that there's too many gaps but then demand to be spoon-fed when faced with the thought that "oh fuck, maybe someone already filled them!"

                  <p>
                   You're the pretender here - as I said earlier, you might be able to convince others, but, not me. I've seen this same tired old routine from people like you, countless times in the last few years. You're just another in a long line. On the minuscule chance that you aren't the shill you come across as, you need to have a good hard think about why your behavior is striking not only myself, but others downvoating you, as shill-like.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I'll say it again, not that I have authority over you or that you need to listen at all, but, fuck off.

                  <p>
                   I'll also do you the courtesy of informing you that I'm now blocking you, so that you aren't filling up my notifications - you will probably determine that to be rude and/or a victory for you, go right ahead, you can't stop what's coming no matter how hard or how subtly you try.

             So, question for you: if Danny Masterson, and Laura prepon are scientologists, does that mean that Ashton Kutcher and mila Kunis likely are as well? Is ashton's sex trafficking takedown org just a ruse in order to deflect attention away from ( and catch before FBI involvement) scientology? I have noticed that ashton's efforts have been going on for quite a while. I have also noticed that in the year, a large amount of sex trafficking rings have been busted. I dont know yet whether the correlation is negative or positive. I doubt the latter.

             <p>
              Currently, I have absolutely no trust in Ashton Kutcher and know very little bout Mila Kunis other than her role as Meg in Family Guy - nonetheless, I've just looked up all 4 names mentioned, very intriguing. I've spoken of my distrust for Kutcher before, especially with regards to Senator Cory Booker and the use of black magick - last revisited at the end of
              <em>

              Scientology seems to be kind of a bargain bin cult - not as smart or well thought out as some of the more archaic orders .. it seems if Ashton or Mila were Scientologists, we would know because Scientology uses the celebrity of its members to validate itself to existing and potential members
             </p>
             <p>
              but both Ashton and Mila started in Hollywood fairly young, and I'm sure they've seen their share of the abuse coming from some cult operation (unfortunately) .. not sure about Kutcher's organization, idk if anyone here has looked into it in particular

               Ashton Kutcher and his Thorn was invited to Congress to talk about his org. and he threw a Butterfly Kiss to McCain.  That sealed it for me.  Ray Chambers of the United Nations is on the Board of Dir.  Demi Moore is a co founder and was in Epstein's Little Black Book.  Some of the Partners are Google  Microsoft Amazon and Google. Pretty telling.

             I found this link to an article that suggests that white was newly into scientology. Scientology pushes people to reach out to their "celebrity" connections in order to bring them into scientology for $. So even though they knew it was a toxic relationship for her, they pushed her to reconnect with him in order to bring him into scientology. I wonder if hubs is in it. I wonder if scientology was behind the civil suit against carrey in order to pressure him into joining the fold due to possible evidence (the drugs she od on). Or maybe she realized that scientology was using her as sex bait, and she threatened to go public, so they killed her to cover it up and made it look like a suicide, which they may or may not have done dozens upon dozens of times. I read the ones you linked (well, mostly, some of it was hard, for me, to read). Nice work though! Keep it up! I appreciate your obvious hard work and dedication!

              Cathriona had indeed gotten involved with Scientology, no doubt during or just prior to/after her work on "The Online Gamer", where she worked alongside many other Scientologists(apparently the cast and crew was made up of a lot of them), including Mark Burton, who she would later marry in an attempt to secure her citizenship - it has been said that either Cathriona or her mother, Brigid Sweetman, paid Burton up to $30,000 to marry Cathriona - after which they promptly resumed their own individual lives away from each other.
             </p>
             <p>
              The relationship became toxic when Cathriona forged her medical records in an attempt to claim that Jim Carrey had given her herpes and/or other STDs - it seems very apparent that even this was something that Scientologists would have put her up to.
             </p>

              Not a doubt in my mind that Scientologists(including Mark Burton) and Michael Avenatti knowingly and fraudulently manufactured the circumstances and "wrongful death" claims filed against Jim - incidentally enough, there was a 4th pill bottle found with Cathriona's body which was not prescribed to Cathriona or the name suspected to be an alias of Jim; there was something else in her 'suicide' concoction, which she should not have had any access to - rarely mentioned anywhere except in a single article.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've every reason to think that any "possible evidence" against Jim was fraudulently manufactured and/or taken out of context so as to continue with Cathriona's initial attempts to extort Jim - the question remains, was Cathriona trying to extort Jim of her own accord, or, were Scientologists threatening to expose her to I.C.E if she did not succeed in extorting a substantial amount of money from Jim? I believe it was the latter.

              It's quite probable that she did realize this at some point and that she was willing to go public after reconnecting with Jim - indeed, Scientologists may have seen her reconnecting with him as a sign of weakness - that there was a growing risk of her telling Jim everything about her involvement with Scientology. Scientologists have indeed gone to very extreme lengths in similar campaigns of subterfuge and character assassination; see: Operation Snow White/Operation Freakout, discussed in
