            I have those traits. I don't have any sympathy for idiots once they are told once. I am competitive, and I am generally brutal when I stop trying to have decency. I don't like using curse words, but doesn't mean I don't know how to use words to make a person feel stupid, insignificant, and question who they are at times.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also have a twisted humor since I laugh when people are happy, when people are sad, when they are angry, when they get hurt, when they feel suicidal, or when they are lusting after something.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have trained myself to do this only to people like myself(I am just honoring those that raised me).
