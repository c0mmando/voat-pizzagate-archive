            "Glenn Beck is also a Mormon who will lie, cheat and deceive as he serves The Great Deception and pushes the real Agenda."
           </p>
           <p>
            That's quite a blanket statement. Most Mormons I know are good and honest people, in fact, I was raised in that Church and they do indeed believe in Jesus Christ.
The problem is detailed here:

             Glenn is a nice likable guy who buys into his religion. I respect that. My family is SDA and they are pissed I finally figured out what a sham the religion is. The difference I don't respect is that my family are totally dysfunctional and intellectually dishonest. I don't respect that. When I presented them with hard core facts and sources that totally rocked the church they didn't bat an eye other than attack me.

             Here's what's odd about Mormons, Seventh Day Adventists and Jehovah's witnesses. They all have their origins in the  Masons. Yes, I know, J. Smith was kicked out of the Masons but my theory is still valid. James White, husband of Ellen White was a Mason as were his sons. Russell was also a Mason. This is open source available information. Ellen White copiously copied writings of J. Smith. Her cousin was married to J. Smith. Known verifiable fact. All available online sources you can find yourself. It's my birthday, my estranged mom is dying and it's mother's day. My friend just dropped off three beers so, forgive me. I'll check up on your links tomorrow. Uh, my birthday ended fifteen minutes ago but same thing. G'night.

              Still, Walter Veith's 60-hour series proves beyond all doubt that mainstream Christianity is being led by Jesuits; and I do believe everyone was a mason in those times. It doesn't prove much about a person's character, since Freemasonry is rather inert and is not the conspiracy behind world events, it's just a middle-man. I'd say most Freemasons are not initiated into the OTO.

               " Freemasonry is rather inert and is not the conspiracy behind world events" That's what they keep telling the world.  I know the SDA church very well having grown up in that false religion. Many high ranking leaders and founders of the church were heavily involved in the Masons which you can see by their photos. Worth taking notice, the SDA church consistently condemned the Catholic church but never critiqued Islam. They are anti second amendment. The founder was a known racist. They are silent on  abortion.

                 Hey, I did go skim through the article you provided. He seems like a well meaning sort of guy, but this kind of stuck in my craw: "I’m an SDA because there’s no where else to go. If you want to follow the truth, you have to become an SDA. Even the Roman Catholic Church says that if you want to follow the Bible, you have to become an SDA. If even Rome says that, there’s no other choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You can argue and you can say whatever you like. But if you really study it, there’s no way out, you have to be an SDA.".
                </p>
                <p>
                 Such silliness. I found more truth and honesty talking to people at a Messianic Jewish Synagogue. It was mostly populated by Russian Jews. The leader, if you wish to call him that was also doubling as a tax accountant which was how I met him. I enjoyed discussing scripture with him, my thoughts on my personal studies and participating on Shabbat. What I found was that they didn't have any set doctrine aside from what's in scripture. Discussion was allowed, anyone could share their views from the  front, and everyone at one time or another was allowed to have something to do.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I can go to an Adventist church and it doesn't take long before there is hostile push back if I touch on a hot button topic.

                  I'm not saying I'm pro-SDA or everything Veith says, I'm just reporting that he demonstrates beyond shadow of a doubt what Revelation and Daniel are talking about and that they are in fact correct prophecies.

                   The  entire SDA church takes their interpretation of Daniel and Revelation from Ellen G. White. She got it wrong because the books were sealed from interpretation and understanding until 1948. For starters, they used the Roman calendar for their timeline so they didn't understand when the prophesies would come to pass. They should have used the Jewish calendar.

                 Sure, SDA church uses this bit about tares to excuse foolish doctrines they invented or Ellen G. White invented but then, why not just rejoin the Catholic church?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I would no sooner have the SDA church destroyed than I would any other protestant church. It's better they exist than not. But, it would be more useful if they would be open to the idea that they have much of the gospel wrong, spend more time in honest study and less time proclaiming the Holy Spirit showed them a private interpretation of scripture. It's right there in scripture itself that it's not open to any private interpretation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you disagree with SDA church on doctrine based on your own straightforward reading of scripture they will straight up tell you that you don't have the Holy Spirit and condemn you. For every disgusting thing EGW dreamed up they have a clever lie to excuse it. That's why I had to disengage from my family's religion.

            I understand wanting to help people but he's put out some news about his kid that will cause people that know his famous dad to question if he was molested or anything inappropriate took place. That's really humiliating for the kid. All his friends at school will know. That's private family shit, GB.

              Um...so will kids who have been molested. That's sure not a very compassionate mind set though. This is a child we are talking about and their dignity is important, especially at adolescence when they're trying to become adults. I'm just trying to imagine the kinds of comments unscrupulous teens make (dude some thirty year old wanted your ass, are you like gay or what?!) at a time when this child already almost got lured into some bad stuff, then this dad is screaming at him and weilding a gun, then the cops ask all those embarrassing questions....ugh. Then they get all your convos off the device. Privacy invaded. Innocence shattered. Sexuality called into question. This is a perfect storm for psychological upheaval and not everybody bounces back from that shit.

               As a teenager we didn't have internet. At bedtime, my greatest sin was being caught in bed with a flashlight and a book after lights out and getting yelled at for not sleeping as ordered. In summers we went to the shop every day and worked in the family business. By 16 I was running a food processing plant. By next summer I was in charge of everything including shipping, driving ten wheeled trucks to pick up supplies, inventory, weighing out batches, recording batch numbers, Tare, Gross and net and repairing conveyors. At boarding school I got the keys the entire campus, repaired anything and everything, built things on my own, painted houses, and ran a dump truck.  So, ya, tell me all about how brutal it is to get caught going online and one in the morning and talking to faggots. Kid should be barred from the internet until he leaves home and you should be neutered to keep the gene pool clean.

               Oh gee. I've had people tell lies about me all my life. That's just life. BTW, if my kid was online talking to sexual predators I would take his shit and destroy it before he knew what was going on. No child needs to be online in the middle of the night. That's enough to confiscate all electronics right there. He certainly shouldn't have that shit in his room. That's Glen Beck's first mistake. I'm not crying over Glen Beck's poor abused son. I've better things to worry about.

                Then go worry about those better things you have to do, such as apparently dogfighting with everyone in your sub who says something you don't like. You're right, that's so much more important. 👍

             Hmmm, ya, there's that. Thing is, GB should have been on top of this. Also, another factor, his son at first lied to him. What kind of a fucked up relationship does he have with his son?

               My Grandparents were hard core Seventh Day Adventists. I didn't lie to them but I did get beat for being honest. So, I guess that's how I live. Be honest and get beat or banned from twitter.

             Like millions of other idiots across the country who give their kids gaming systems, full internet access, cell phones and all  to expose them to the entire world. It's not much different than letting your kid wander around downtown by himself. No one in their right mind would do that but since your kid is "safe" at home, most people just don't see the danger.

               Parents who let them play with electronics all day. When I was a kid raised by my grandmother she bought a color television. I would watch cartoons all afternoon after school. She noticed and suddenly, the TV vanished. I asked what happened and she told me she was concerned I watched TV too much and sold the TV. I began hanging out with my friends and playing again.

             I don't know why I got downvoated.  It is the truth, Beck said so himself on his damn radio show.  He was also amazed at all the data the consoles have on them.
            </p>

             Mine's locked down so my kids can't chat in the MOBAs they play.  It's also in the living/great room, (I'll be honest, it isn't that great of a room) and I have final say on their gaming habits.  If I'm remembering it right, Beck let his kid set it up in his bedroom.  That's the stupid part and shows how ignorant Beck is.  He's clearly never told his kid the why you don't give out personally identifying information online talk and only focused on the don't talk to strangers.  He also hasn't had "friends online are strangers" talk either.

              Well yeah, but then why single him out? Most parents in the US exhibit this behavior.

               I'm not singling him out.  OP mentioned Beck by name.  I have the same view about the millions of American parents who do the same thing with the same "It won't happen to my kids" attitude.

              Don't sweat the downvoats.  It comes with the territory of voicing your opinions.  It happens all the time to all of us.  Glenn is a Tool just like all of the other psychos they have trained to jump through their hoops.  Here's an upvoat to make up for your downvoat.

               It doesn't normally.  But something like this just irks me to no end.  Beck literally told the world everything he did wrong and never once admitted to doing something wrong.

                He surely is well provided for as long as he keeps playing along.  I wouldn't put it past him to engineer the whole video. Just to make us think he really cares about his Children.  This is the game they play, to make us think they are one of us.  Also, he loves being in the limelight as they all do.  They are Narcissists after all.

                 Beck's radio show has a horrible pattern to it, and I suspect it is to get better ratings.  After the change of month, he gets extremely preachy.

            Don't compare us to Glenn Beck. That man went to war with his own peers and doesn't speak without a corporate angle. Of course if you join the fray against the Swamp Cockroaches like Pelosi you will get a marker. Let's be real though folks, Pelosi is like the Family Circle Version of the Sopranos. She's just there to entertain the adults every week, and synergistically her entertaining drug fueled rants make a comfy funny little map of the neighborhood.
