           This is going to be controversial but allow me to explain. Don't just think about the words that were said. Think about what was shown. Think about it in terms of persuasion.

            It certainly doesn't help his case. He was well coached, but he keeps looking up and to the right while telling his clearly rehearsed story. That is a tell tale signs of a liar.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also when Tucker Carlson covered pizzagate, they called it fake, but the sarcasm was overwhelming. No media outlet is going to back it right now, due to the risk of triggering false flag incidents.

             You're wrong, looking to the right is remembered, and up to the right is visual remembered (if looking at them, just google it).
Not saying he's not lying but you have the wrong cue.

               Does it change the orientation? I thought it was based on the parts of the brain, a left handed person wouldn't have their left/right hemispheres flipped would they?

            I wouldn't overestimate the media. They sincerely think their audience lacks more IQ than they do. They actually count on those viewers
           </p>
           <p>
            Showing wrong things with commentary of how right those things are might actually be them trying to "tell' people what fake news pizzagate is
