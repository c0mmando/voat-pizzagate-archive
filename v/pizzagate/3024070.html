             They call it a pharmacy but he was just producing bottles of Passionflower herb capsules, and water.  I spent about half a year in Abadiania many years ago, going to the Casa and know all about the place and heard about the sexual abuse over the years. No one would listen. I and others have been sick since our "healings" and "spiritual surgeries" they do there. There are many people online talking about feeling worse about seeing John of God.  I believe everyone has to take the Passionflower herb to make people more spiritually open and vulnerable to the "entities" (demons) that are working on people. I even had a remote surgery when I was home and had the herbs sent to me. I immediately felt worse afterwards and I still haven't recovered.  So besides all the sexual abuse on girls and women, he has made countless people sick just from seeing him and ungergoing his treatments.

             I couldn't believe it when i saw NBC (or ABC) and Oprah both do separate shows on JOG, promoting him, and afterwards there was a ton of Americans that came to see him, turning Abadiania into even more of a spiritual Disneyland than it was already.  My friend wrote about JOG and all that went on there on a page called Volconvo and eventually they removed that specific page without any explanation.

                I don't buy into any of the mumbo jumbo, but I also know that they do. I know of a warehouse full of crystals in Mena, Arkansas. Simple property search or ask, can determine who owned the property. Basic square metal building. It is on the South/East side of town? Town was named after Wilhelmina? Could be, but Diodorus Siculus stated that Menes had introduced the worship of the gods, and the practice of sacrifice.

            So de Faria claims he channels Dom Inácio de Loyola, aka St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order.
           </p>
           <p>

             https://www.britannica.com/biography/St-Ignatius-of-Loyola
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Loyola is the 'spiritual patron of the clinic'.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of 'conspiracy theories' feature Jesuits as arch-villains. Here for example we read Loyola was a crypto-Jew and cabalist:

           </p>
           <p>
            Don't know if de Faria had any connection to the actual Jesuits.

            123 we will vomit together.  I changed my view of abortion a few years ago and what I have been reading is sickening.  Some of those babies born on the Baby Farms must be aborted, for not all of them will be healthy.  What becomes of those poor little babies?  Sold?  To whom.   This guy Sanger should be hoisted on a petard.  I have my ideas about who gets the top picks of those healthy babies too.  How about some of those Pedowood Moms that have amazingly flat tummies after giving birth.  I would love to know if there is a file on babies sold.

             I am split in different ways on abortion. There was some spoiled kid that was riding around on crotch rockets and raping joggers until he got caught. He was adopted by a pilot and his seriously evil wife. Was his real dad a rapist too? No one will ever know ... because of the system. What they are doing? Oh, Hell no!

              I know what you mean. I get it but out of all the Babies 👶 that we’re aborted well many would have turned out ok. We can’t decide who gets born and who doesn’t. God sends them and we should really supply the right kind of help for these single Moms. By that I mean parenting classes and setting them up with basic supplies. We have the money. It just goes into the wrong pockets.

               Women take care of kids with Menfolk helping. that is how it was. Family is a man and a woman unless some tragic event like a felled tree fatally strikes the man or woman.Then the Family, and or community takes over. You ain't got that and you ain't got squat.
