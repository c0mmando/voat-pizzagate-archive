<p>February 1, 2018</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussing an Oklahoma bill that would outlaw “products that use aborted human fetuses&quot;, Silverman said: “If anything ever <strong>made me want to eat an aborted fetus,</strong> it’s this law”. She made the comment in a game of *“sh<em>tty abortion charades”</em> on a telethon titled <strong>Life Is a Living Nightmare: A Telethon to Fix It,</strong> hosted by the Lady Parts Justice League. </li>
<li>She also mocked a law that would call for the burial or cremation of aborted fetuses, saying: <strong>“Fucking funerals for fucking aborted fetuses?</strong> I would like to speak at those funerals. He lived the way he died. He died the way he lived. The size of a sesame seed with no discerning brain function&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>– In a 2014 PSA, Silverman performed a skit where she was visited by <em>Jesus, who gave his approval for aborting children.</em> Jesus said to Silverman: &quot;Fertilized eggs aren\'t people, people are people&quot;. </p>
<p>– At the 2007 MTV Video Awards, Silverman joked about Britney Spears\' children: &quot;Have you seen Britney\'s kids? Oh my God, <em>they are the most adorable little mistakes</em> you\'ll ever see. </p>

<ul>
<li>In her 2006 movie, Jesus Is Magic, Silverman made the comment: <strong>&quot;Kill Christ... I\'d do it again. I’d fucking do it again—in a second&quot;.</strong></li>
<li>In the final scene of the movie, she is shown sitting in a dressing-room staring into a mirror. <em>&quot;You\'re a star – and I\'m a star-fucker!&quot;</em> she says to the mirror, then <em>gives herself a passionate kiss.</em></li>

<p>When referring to <strong>9/11</strong> in her stand-up comedy, Silverman has said: </p>
<ul>

            I'm on the fence about certain comedians because so many of them do dark humor which is about what they know (from gossip) about people in their industry. It's fucked up stuff that happens outside of their immediate circle. This doesn't mean that her jokes are in any way obvious or funny, for the most part. I like the "first move" one only because it skewers the ubiquitous excuse of child predators to insist their victims were to blame. I mean c'mon prosecutors in Alabama (Roy Moore) worked to make sure the character of 12-year-olds can be questioned in a child rape case because "girls are no angels"... It's so blatantly ridiculous.

             It brings things into perspective when you consider that even Roy Moore probably would never talk about "deboning babies", eating featuses, or the way toddlers and children "fortify" him.

             Maybe you can imagine a comedian like Louis CK saying such things... but then we know what Louis CK is up to in real life.

              Louis C.K. is so self-hating that it seems to stop him in his tracks. He's into low key things. He's different than the people who indulge in social climbing associated with the Luciferians. I think he knows what is going on and this may explain his epic SNL sketch. Here's a clue: he bought a small boat. It's a boat within his means, but because of this, I'm keeping an eye on him... Watch for people living beyond their means or engaging in one-upmanship.

            burrying a fetus is retarded. i mean shes probably super evil. not arguing that point. but shes right about burrying a early term fetus. the thing is basically a tumor with the intellectual capacity of a jellyfish, and thats a stretch.
           </p>
           <p>
            to be fair though i just dont care about abortion at all. for one thing its a great way to slow the population growth of niggers and other undesireables. for another i have no religious beliefs so im more about the science of when a baby becomes potentially self aware. but im sure that i will be met with being called rabi and other such nonsense because i refuse to drink the religious kool aid.
           </p>
           <p>
            and to be clear, when it comes to any and all forms of pedophillia, i believe pedophiles should be executed without remorse and without exception.

             To some, it is nothing more than a lump of flesh, I suppose.  However, having been told I had a miscarriage when I was 2 months pregnant with my son (I didn't -- they were wrong), I can tell you that I certainly didn't view it that way at all.  He was planned and wanted and it was devastating to think that I had lost him.  I had a 2 1/2 year old daughter and even though he wasn't fully formed yet -- he was a potential child in my opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
             As far as abortion goes, I don't really support it as a just a back up method of birth control.  In cases where there is rape, danger to the mother's health, fetal abnormalities, birth control failure, I am okay with abortion on a limited basis.  I don't think any elective abortion (meaning you just don't want the baby) should happen once the fetus can live outside the womb.  As science advances, eventually, abortion may become virtually unnecessary (except for the rare exception like fetal abnormalities) as science continues to move towards saving even younger preterm fetuses.
            </p>
            <p>
             The problem really isn't abortion.  Abortion is a symptom of unwanted pregnancies.  Either we have to be willing to provide birth control and educate people on the right way to use that birth control -- or we have to accept that abortion will continue to be a necessary evil.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also think your comments about black people are repugnant.  I don't want to keep the population of any particular ethnic or racial or religious group down.  I would however like to see people who are psychopaths or just even assholes in general be prevented from reproducing.  It isn't the color of your skin that makes you a good or bad person.  You are proof of that.

             When you are a member of the tribe, you don't have to do quite as much dong sucking as the regular shiksa does.  Nepotism and being Jewish actually goes a lot farther than a blow job does in Hollywood.

             Yes, and I think the theory here is that her participation goes far beyond typical casting couch 'favors' for TV execs...
            </p>
            <p>
             Her comments seem to be about reveling in the death and destruction of minors. That's a whole different level than servicing producers in the champagne room.

             Could be, I guess.  I personally think she is just a really, really ugly woman (inside and out).  Imagine what she would look like without plastic surgery and professional makeup artists.

            She also mocked a law that would call for the burial or cremation of aborted fetuses, saying: “Fucking funerals for fucking aborted fetuses? I would like to speak at those funerals. He lived the way he died. He died the way he lived. The size of a sesame seed with no discerning brain function".    THERE is someone I know who's daughter gave birth at 41/2 mos.  The baby had webbed feet and the father held it and could feel it's humaness.  But the baby of course died.  They had a funeral just as if the baby was full term and had passed away.  I went to that funeral and never felt there should not have been one.  SHE  IS A TOOL for the NWO.  And I believe she has eaten a fetus.  The more I read about her statements the more I am convinced.

               Sadly, I don't think she is controlled at all.  I think she is a willing participant in whatever she does.  She is fully on board with the whole Satanic agenda.  Besides, how can you blackmail a person who has no morals or shame?

               Possessed?  I think Bill Clinton could be.  Sarah Silverman, she is not even human.  If angels can incarnate, the fallen ones can do the same.  Soros, Hillary, both demonic, you can't prove it, but you know it at a glance.

                My God.  There is another one on My List.  The list is becoming longer every day and many have crowded into the #1 Spot.  JK and the that Toddlers and Tiaras spot on his show with Tom Hanks makes my Barf.  They are not fooling people anymore.  Every day more are on to what they think are Their Secrets.

                   I believe some may be, but I'm not sure it is that amount. I was thinking yesterday about that actress( can't remember her name ) whose teen child that was in transition went missing. This was a couple of months ago I believe. I wonder if they ever found him/her? I really believe this is pushed on some of these kids.

                    Even if they aren't opposite sex, I fully believe that they purposely promote actors who are gender bending.  They like square jawed, masculine women (those with no curves -- straight like a boy except for fake boobs).  For men, they like the feminine -- almost pretty -- men like Johnny Depp.  That is the whole "metro sexual" thing.  Just inching us closer to a time when we will all aspire to be hermaphrodite like their idol, Baphomet.

                    Or he is getting his/her sex change.  I **shudder ** at the thought, but these people are sick and evil.  They are in so deep they could not get out if they wanted to.  There are more and more coming into view each day.  Oscar Night will be Freak Night.   If you look at the Oscar Statue he looks naked and unclothed.  No Sexual Organ.

                     I feel so sad for these kids. No wonder they are so depressed and many end up committing suicide. I'm not watching the Oscars. I haven't watched for several years now. I may look at some clips of it, but that is all I want to see.

                      I have not watched either.  I was not going to, but I was thinking of forcing myself.  But I know my stomach and my heart could not take it.  Nope. Will find something else to do.  Probably be on here as usual.

                       I can't stand to even look at some of them anymore.  I think I get upset with myself too, knowing how I was fooled by them. They are actors on and off screen. Wish more people could see it.

                        There are a few that are not pedos, but they are still dirty.  Greedy and still do vile things for money.  All Sickos.  There are those that are so deep in they cant get out if they want,and then there are those that cant get enough of it.  We have to stop them from abusing the children when they are young for that will stop it, in it's tracks.  The children turn into their Tran Robots When I think of all the babies they are having or stealing,  it makes me ill. :(

                         Makes me ill as well. These kids shouldn't be allowed to take hormones, testosterone or switch over to the gender they think of themselves till they are over 21. They are allowing children to make adult decisions or the adults that are screwed up make it for them. It's child abuse.

                          Yes.  So right.  Also the children are now thought of as "little adults".  Their parents treat that as such.  It must stop.

                             I know. It won't matter how many oppose it. If TPTB want it to happen, it will. This state is their trial run for it. I am so upset by everything I see anymore. Seems like it never ends. I'm just glad to see more people are starting to see what's happening. It's just not enough yet.

                                 Yes, if it all came out it would be lights out for this country. I wonder how long before it happens anyway. I have never seen so much divide as I have seen now.

                                  That link you sent me about the child deciding their own race and gender, in the comments there was something about a school that is ending different color caps and gowns for boys and girls.  No more white for girls and blue for boys.  This is being taken WAY too far.
