            Similar to popjam where parents are reassured their kids CAN NOT post selfies despite allowing a feature to do just this. Disturbingly selfies of 8 year olds had stickers on them asking 'hot or not?' And many comments under selfies of 8 and 10 year olds saying 'hot' ' how old are you' and 'send me your sc' (snapchat).

             Hi there, we are always receptive to former survivors. However, we have to be skeptical due to people LARPing in the past trying to find out what we were researching in order to cover the trails or just get us off on wild goose chases. A couple of things, without evidence it's harder for us to believe you. If you can give court records of your mom's drug use or even any other specific evidence, it will help your cause. TBH, I can't find anything on the internet when I search for "Brandon Henry Omaha NE" so it will be helpful if you can point us to other records of your past (e.g. old facebook page, high school graduation list, etc). If you have the evidence of the crimes committed against you, you may want to consider suing. Even if you don't, other evidence may be found in the course of the investigation. Obviously, if to much of the government is against you, that would not be advisable. It may be good for you see a professional counselor, as mentioned in this post.

              thank you! i realize the hurriedness of my post. i will be more than glad to share those records when i have some more time to gather them. i just tried paying $1.50 per search on the kansas judicial website for my mom's records + came up with nothing / can't afford to spend more money @ the current moment.
             </p>
             <p>
              I was raised by my grandma + know that my mom has had over six dui's + is a felon. there should also be record of my grandma winning custody of my brother + I when I was younger. I will be providing records when I can, I promise.

               This is more for people who happen to read this rather than directed at you. There is a fine line between presenting evidence and doxxing one self. Since you had already said your name, location, and age in the youtube video I felt okay asking for more info. Maybe you posted too much though. I hope I didn't make it easier for your enemies to find you. On the other hand you did lessen my skepticism. I'm kind of torn on this one.

            Unfortunately I have known about this for a while. Someone mentioned it in the comments of an article somewhere. I dug up a couple related articles. I found others but most of them covered what was already in the Chicago Tribune one.
           </p>
           <p>
            It was banned by an Australian girls' school in 2016:
            <a href="http://archive.is/992uf">
             http://archive.is/992uf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Chicago Tribune wrote a great article about it. Here are some of the highlights:
            <a href="http://archive.is/Ttsi9">
             http://archive.is/Ttsi9
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             CEO Alex Zhu acknowledged that "a lot of users, especially top users, they're under 13." That's a violation of the app's terms of use, and potentially puts Musical.ly in conflict with federal child privacy law.
             <a href="http://archive.is/Ttsi9#selection-239.42-239.252">
              http://archive.is/Ttsi9#selection-239.42-239.252
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             A Musical.ly spokesperson told the Tribune that COPPA [law that requires users to be 13+] does not apply to the app because it is directed at a general audience. Despite [CEO] Zhu's comments in London, the spokesperson said the company doesn't know how old its users are.

            </p>
            <p>
             [A Parent] deleted Musical.ly from his 10-year-old daughter's iPad three months ago after watching a streaming video in which a young girl was bombarded with sexual requests (comments and emojis scroll across the screen during a live stream).
He relented after ensuring that only his daughter's friends had access to her videos — a move that culled her fan base from 300 to 36

            </p>
            <p>
             Buffalo Grove police encountered a malicious use of the app last year when someone posing as a child communicated with a 9-year-old girl via Musical.ly and enticed her to send nude photos. The phone used by the girl's correspondent belonged to a 24-year-old man, said Deputy Chief Roy Bethge.
He said the department wasn't able to bring charges against the suspect for reasons he couldn't disclose.
