<p>So, this is a continuation of a previous post on the transgender agenda.  Here is a video of Dr. Van Meter who gave a talk in Australia about his perspective  from the viewpoint of a pediatric endocrinologist on current practises in transgender medicine.  His talk gives an historical perspective of how we got to where we are today.  <strong>Starting with the founders of this movement : Alfred Kinsey, John Money and Harry Benjamin: He calls them the 3 Musketeers and says they were ALL pedophiles and were interested in changing the \'landscape of human sexuality across the country\'.</strong>  The video is about an hour long, so I give a brief run down with some screenshots of the slides for a quick overview.  However, I recommend taking the time to watch the whole thing.  He mentions the NIH involvement. That\'s an organisation that we have written a number of threads about already on this subverse.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At home, the White House has already attracted a political who’s who, from U.S. Senator Patty Murray to Mayor Ed Murray (his first mayoral fundraiser was there) to Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. In August, the state’s entire Democratic House delegation is expected to show up for a “New Dems” soiree. Nyhus also puts on a regular “CEO Salon” series and ensures that a plethora of nonprofits, from local arts and parks to global health initiatives, benefit from White House events. For example, the South Lake Union–based, globally focused <strong>PATH organization</strong>. “It’s a great gathering spot,” says PATH CEO Steve Davis. He compares the house to D.C.’s famous social circuit. “There’s usually a dinner at a very elegant home in Georgetown with a mix-and-match of people. The conversations are quite interesting because you’re sitting next to somebody who’s an ambassador from X, as well as some congressman, or some scientist working at the <strong>NIH</strong>. Roger’s house has that same feel.”</p>

             A sequel, “Man and the Moon,” aired December 28, 1955. Another sequel, “Mars and Beyond,” aired December 4, 1957. Von Braun served as a consultant and contributor on all three shows. He also helped design the TWA Moonliner rocket that towered over Tomorrowland in Disneyland.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to Ward Kimball, director of “Man and the Moon,” President Dwight Eisenhower called Walt the day after the episode aired to request a copy to show to Pentagon officials. In the pre-NASA era, the Pentagon viewed rockets as a delivery system for weapons, not a transportation system for human beings. Eisenhower wanted to promote the peaceful exploration of space.  On July 29, 1958, three years after “Man in Space,” Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act and established NASA as America’s civilian space agency. Wernher von Braun was named director of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Shortly after World War II broke out, Eero became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He was recruited by a former classmate at Yale to join the OSS where he worked until 1944. It was the same classmate who several years prior had recruited Eero to work on the Futurama exhibit for the New York World’s Fair, an experience they now found directly relevant to their work at the OSS.
             </p>
             <p>
              At the war’s end, Eero returned to Michigan to resume work with his father. Their first major undertaking together was designing the General Motors Technical Center which was constructed in 1956. That same year, Eero landed on the cover of Time magazine, a rare accomplishment for an architect to achieve. He shared this privilege with other greats such as Bucky Fuller and Frank Lloyd Wright. Eero was 45 years old when he appeared on Time’s cover, one of the youngest architects to do so. His work was featured in other magazines such as Vogue, Esquire, and Playboy.
             </p>
             <p>
              With such publicity and success, it wasn’t long before other major American corporations were asking Eero to design their headquarters or corporate campuses. Eero accepted commissions from IBM, CBS, John Deere, Vassar College, MIT, Yale, The University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Chicago.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Secret Service has forbidden all presidents from ascending the Gateway Arch due to security concerns—it is, after all, a very tight, enclosed space. The only exception was Dwight D. Eisenhower, who signed the order for the construction of the arch in 1954. In 1967, when he was 77 years old, the former president visited St. Louis to give a speech. A trip to the top was not in his itinerary, but when he showed up early to the monument (after it had closed to the public), he insisted on riding the tram up.

His grandfather would become president of Columbia University (1948–1953), and later the 34th President of the United States (1953–1961).

            Transgender is becoming mainstream and it's being pushed on society. Films
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/14/butterfly-review-an-important-truthful-drama-about-a-transgender-child">
             like this one
            </a>
            are now being made about kids who want to transition.  This film is about a little boy who is lead to believe that because he likes pink and being pretty he must be girl. The mother is portrayed as the understanding one who supports this child in being a girl.  The father is portrayed as a fearful bigot who thinks his son needs 'fixing'.
           </p>
           <p>
            What The Butterfly doesn't do is tell the truth.  Studies by Blanchard clearly show that little boys who want to dress as girls when they are little are gay. If they are left alone and taught to accept themselves, they grow up being gay.  If they're indoctrinated by the adults around them into rigid stereotypes they're led to believe that only girls can wear lipstick and like pink, and the natural outcome is that they think they're in the wrong body.  There is NO such thing as a child being in the wrong body. Why aren't we teaching children that they're perfect the way they are, and that it's okay for girls to be tomboys and boys to be sensitive and kind?

            So, are you saying the "Trans" in TWA is related to a globalist agenda to sow gender confusion? Are you saying Van Meter is saying this? Or that Van Meter is saying the book author is saying it?

            You should add more of a disclaimer here than "interestingly". :-)  An implied claim is being made, and without more explicit framing by you, this post -- with all its very interesting tidbits -- is dancing on the hairy edge of confirmation bias, especially since you follow that lead down into the maze of information you've placed in the Comments. I get that you are dumping your raw gatherings to see what connects, but we want to avoid anything that makes serious research into the globalist swamp network look like a baffle-with-BS disinfo submission (which the submission rules are designed to cull). The best way to do that is to make a clear statement about why you're including stuff...i.e. briefly describe the research process you've gone through.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Here is an example of the baffle-with-BS disinfo shillery:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2349529">

             </a>
            </li>
            <li>
             My explanation exposing it:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2349529/11679619">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2349529/11679619
             </a>
            </li>
            <li>
             And here it's pusher actually admits to developing it as a tactic to disrupt this board:
             <a href="https://archive.fo/DfYe0">
              https://archive.fo/DfYe0
             </a>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            That kind of post wastes the time of both mods and researchers, is designed to exhaust people after playing with their emotions, and ultimately discredits the board as full of hogwash.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, the fact that you are using our past research to attempt to shed light on new leads is EXCELLENT. I wish everyone would do so! We have more evidence than we know.

              THE BELLS OF CAMP DAVID GOING TO THE CHAPEL -

              A $500,000 wood and glass chapel will be built by fall at Camp David, the Catoctin Mountains presidential retreat, a White House spokeswoman said yesterday.
             </p>
             <p>
              The privately funded, 150-seat, octagonal facility was proposed to President Reagan last fall by Kenneth Plummer, a retired area builder.
             </p>
             <p>
              "As a Boy Scout he used to camp in the area before Shangri-La {later renamed Camp David} was developed. It had long been a dream of his," said Elaine Crispen, Nancy Reagan's press secretary.Reagan not only approved Plummer's idea, but also made the first contribution -- $1,000 -- to the nonprofit corporation Plummer set up to handle what Crispen called "discreet" fund raising. After Reagan's okay, Crispen said, the secretary of the Navy, which oversees the operation of Camp David, authorized construction.
             </p>
             <p>
              Plans call for a separate bell tower through which worshipers will enter. The bell will be a ship's bell selected from an as yet undesignated Navy ship. The exact construction site, to be chosen by President and Mrs. Reagan, will be west of Linden Cottage, a guest house for visiting staff and others....
             </p>
             <p>
              Nancy Reagan has kept in touch indirectly with former White House aide
              <strong>
               Michael K. Deaver
              </strong>
              by sending him "verbal messages" through others and one note, which she wrote after his perjury trial ended with his conviction, her press secretary said yesterday.
             </p>
             <p>
              Denying published reports that Mrs. Reagan had "severed" relations with the man her husband once considered to be a "surrogate son," Crispen said Mrs. Reagan has sent him "verbal messages of concern.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Granted, she is not in touch because she was advised by the White House counsel that she should have no direct contact," Crispen said. "But she sent him a note after the trial ended in December, and other people have been in touch with him to relay her caring."
             </p>
             <p>
              ...
Nancy Reagan had to send her regrets because of a schedule conflict, but you can be sure some of her California pals haven't. Hot-ticket item in Long Beach next month is the intimate little dinner Britain's Duke and Duchess of York are giving aboard HMS Britannia.
             </p>
             <p>
              Like "Mum" on her visit five years ago, the royal pair will be exploring Reagan country, including a trip to Sunnylands, the Rancho Mirage desert estate of former ambassador to Great Britain Walter Annenberg and his wife Lee. One difference: Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip got lunch from the Annenbergs; Fergie and Andy will be house guests.
             </p>
             <p>
              For the voyage home, their royal highnesses can expect their very own advance copy, courtesy of the author, of "Dance on a Sinking Ship," the forthcoming novel of Michael Kilian, the Washington-based Chicago Tribune columnist.
             </p>
             <p>
              If that title sounds a little ominous, it should be pointed out that it's not the ship that should worry anyone but its passengers. On Kilian's fictional voyage there is also a royal highness, this one named Edward, along with a bunch of other not-so-fictional folks including Edward's soon-to-be lifetime shipmate Wallis Simpson and Lord and Lady Mountbatten.
             </p>
             <p>
              St. Martin's Press of New York brings the book out in March but meanwhile it's been bought for an undisclosed sum by the British publisher Sidgwick &amp; Jackson.
             </p>
             <p>
              Kilian's treatment of that earlier Edward isn't likely to rattle the palace. Less certain is his portrayal of "Uncle Dickie" Mountbatten, a particular favorite of the Windsors. Among London publishers the word of caution was: Anyone who wants to be a "Sir" might think twice before buying.

               The idea of NAFTA first appeared in public in 1979, to everyone's surprise, as Ronald Reagan's core policy when he announced his candidacy for President. But, curiously, it was then never again mentioned in his campaign. In 1979, Reagan's campaign was run by Michael Deaver and Paul Hannaford, who reportedly also ran a public relations firm that represented the right-wing Guatemalan group Amigos del Pais and its leader Roberto Alejos, who had provided the ranch used for CIA training of Cuban Bay of Pigs invasion forces in 1961. In early 1980 William Casey became Reagan's campaign director. Casey began his career directing OSS espionage operations in Germany and China in the 1940s, and he ended his career as director of the CIA. It is not common for US presidential candidates to be so managed by those so linked to covert operations.

             If we want to understand what is actually happening in the world today we have to revisit history with our newfound knowledge and pick everything apart.  So, the 3 musketeers were pedophiles.. that is not speculation, there is documentation on all 3 which confirms this.  Now we have to ask how did the three of them get together and why.

Nonetheless he maintained his investment business. In 1942 he went back to the aviation business establishing the C.M. Keys Aircraft Service Company and after World War II helped organize the

             I just found his inclusion of that book mentioning the name of the airline interesting and perhaps alluding to something more. We have been interested in the use of airlines in the trafficking of children. We know that the elite love their double entendres.  Howard Hughes owned it in the past.  Here are some voat posts about him:

              When Howard Hughes owned the Desert Inn and the Frontier it was rumored that there was a tunnel under LV Blvd. connecting the two hotels that allowed easy access to each property while avoiding traffic and, especially, the public. Wayne Newton claims to have used it but there are no known photos to prove it was ever really there. Someday I'll tell ya about the secret "underground house" that has existed for decades and was documented, with photos in the local newspaper here many years ago. Also, that goofy one about winning 10K and then keep winning and then start loosing til you get down to $46 to take a cab to the airport. Then the guy asks you if you ever brought a kid to Vegas. Then you get through a door and down the secret tunnel you go. That is really goofy. There is a lot of secret and sneaky stuff going all across this country. Tunnels everywhere. Droop Mountain if you remember is one of them.

             The address for them is 1- Howard Hughes center. This makes sense this is a centrally located series of offices. This is likely the agent that helped him set up the filings.

             Starbucks has made generous employee benefits part of its corporate identity, and it’s doing so again with an expanded coverage of medical procedures for its trans workers.
            </p>
            <p>
             While the coffee giant has covered gender reassignment surgery since 2012, the company’s health insurance policy will now cover procedures such as breast and facial surgery, skin grafts, and hair transplants, treatments viewed as medically essential by trans people but often regarded as cosmetic, and therefore not covered, by insurers.
            </p>
            <p>
             To get its policy right, Starbucks consulted with the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), which issues a 120-page guide for medical professionals treating trans people. Starbucks was the first company to directly ask WPATH’s advice, according to Jamison Green, the organization’s former president.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under the guidance of Howard Schultz, its former CEO and chairman (and potential presidential candidate), Starbucks mastered the art of turning social responsibility into a powerful marketing tool.

             Starbucks executive chair Howard Schultz had expected to step down last month, but a Philadelphia racial bias incident and the subsequent fallout kept him on for an extra few weeks. But on Monday, Schultz announced he will step away from the coffee company on June 26. The move immediately ignited suspicions about potential political ambitions, including a possible 2020 bid for the White House — speculation fed by his going-away message, which sounded quite a bit like a stump speech

            <p>
             Christopher "Chris" Hedrick[1] (born 1962) is an entrepreneur and expert in global health, international development, technology, and learning. He is CEO of NextStep Interactive.
            </p>
            <p>
             From 2014 through 2016, Hedrick was CEO of Kepler,[3] a university program based in Kigali, Rwanda that blends technology-based learning, intense local seminars and education-to-employment support to offer U.S.-accredited degrees at very low cost.[4] Kepler's aim is to dramatically expand access to high quality college education across Africa.[5] Hedrick led growth of Kepler from a start up class of 50 students to over 400 students on two campuses, one in Kigali and the other a unique program in partnership with the UNHCR based at the Kiziba Refugee Camp in western Rwanda
            </p>
            <p>
             Hedrick led the development of the Peace Corps/Senegal Food Security initiative which is the largest **USAID-funded Peace Corps **food security project in the world under the global Feed the Future program.[12] The Peace Corps program in Senegal under Hedrick's leadership was awarded the prestigious Learning Spotlight Award in 2010 for innovation in its training programs.[13] In 2012, he was awarded the Director's Distinguished Service Award, the agency's highest honor, for his work in creating and coordinating the Peace Corps Stomping Out Malaria in Africa initiative.[14] After partnering with Peace Corps Senegal in a major bed net distribution effort, the international NGO Malaria No More called Hedrick "part international diplomat, part community health worker, part development MacGyver" in its annual report.[15] Hedrick promoted the concept of the "New Peace Corps," the professionalization of Peace Corps programming and service, including enhanced partnerships with USAID and other development institutions and improved utilization of technology.
            </p>
            <p>
             From 1999 to 2007, Hedrick was the President and CEO of
             <strong>
              Intrepid Learning Solutions,[17] a Seattle, Washington-based learning services company which he co-founded with Dennis Heck.
             </strong>
             Under his leadership, Intrepid was named by Inc. magazine[18] as one of the fastest-growing companies in America.[19] Hedrick raised investments for Intrepid from venture capital companies Madrona Venture Group, FTV Capital, and Rustic Canyon Partners and from individuals including
             <strong>
              William H. Gates, Sr.
             </strong>
             While Hedrick was CEO, Intrepid signed a landmark contract to provide outsourced training services to the Boeing Company, landed other clients such as Microsoft, United Airlines, Autodesk, and Bank of America, and was named one of the Top 20 Learning Outsourcing Providers in the world.[20] In 2014, the training outsourcing arm of Intrepid was sold to Xerox to bolster its learning services division.

             Lee Minto (born 1927) is an American women's health activist and sex education advocate. She served as Executive Director of the Seattle-King County chapter of Planned Parenthood for 27 years, and was instrumental in Washington State Referendum 20, a referendum in 1970 that successfully legalized early pregnancy abortion in the state of Washington

            <p>
             In 1967, Washington psychologist Sam Goldenberg organized a meeting of medical, legal and religious professionals to discuss the health crisis created by lack of access to safe abortions, and Minto was invited to attend.[3][1] Aside from her work at Planned Parenthood, Minto was already aware of the need for safe abortions through administrative work at the University Unitarian Church,

             The transgender movement began as the brainchild of three men who shared a common bond: all three were pedophilia activists.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...In 2000, at the age of thirty-five, David and his twin brother finally exposed the sexual abuse Dr. Money had inflicted on them in the privacy of his office. The boys told how Dr. Money took naked photos of them when they were just seven years old. But pictures were not enough for Money. The pedophilic doctor also forced the boys to engage in incestuous sexual activities with each other.

             At the end of 1984, Spartan operated 287 fast-food restaurants as a franchisee of Hardee's Food Systems Inc., while Canteen provided food services to more than 950 customers. Hilton International, meanwhile, operated 89 franchised hotels in 44 foreign countries.
