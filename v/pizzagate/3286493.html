Nug. Or Nugget. I was reading an article about Kappy when I saw this, an invitation to a party hosted by Seth Green and his girlfriend Clare:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.neonrevolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/85e4f14fb23e016a6ee4b051e40c49d8811474dc4b69432b21f300e12a5fef3d.png">https://www.neonrevolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/85e4f14fb23e016a6ee4b051e40c49d8811474dc4b69432b21f300e12a5fef3d.png</a></p>
<p>They threw what they called a &quot;Nug Hunt.&quot; The flier has a picture of a creepy Easter bunny holding a small girl, with another person in an Easter bunny costume looking at them.  It seems like this is a sick play on the Easter Egg Hunt concept, but this would be referring to hunting children, or NUGS.</p>
<p>Here is a link to the full article:
<a href="https://www.neonrevolt.com/2018/07/27/isaac-kappy-blows-the-whistle-on-the-partymonsters-hollyweird-greatawakening-pizzagate-pedogate-nomore/">https://www.neonrevolt.com/2018/07/27/isaac-kappy-blows-the-whistle-on-the-partymonsters-hollyweird-greatawakening-pizzagate-pedogate-nomore/</a></p>
<p>Now remember, one of Isaac Kappy\'s earliest allegations was about Set and Clare being pedos. Kappy said Green showed him a hidden room in his house where he hides kids.</p>
<p>There is very little info to be found on this online, but I\'m pretty sure Nug or Nugget is referring to a little kid. Remember the word Chicken is part of their code vocabulary. Chicken-Hawk or Chicken-Lover mean Child Lover in a pedo sense, which has been discussed many times here. I actually just heard it used this way in a movie last week, and I wish I remembered which movie it was.  
</p>
<p>I actually went to Urban Dictionary and looked through the first 10 pages of slang definitions, and there was nothing pedo-related, so I don\'t think this has become known by the public yet.</p>
<p>Another reminder: Seth has a show titled Robot Chicken, which has also been discussed here. CHICKEN= NUG or Nugget, possibly meaning a Small Child.</p>
<p>This all set off some light bulbs and I remembered a long ago post here about Chelsea Handler:
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1987420">https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1987420</a></p>
<p>This post covers an odd instagram post by Chelsea Handler that shows the backside of a little girl in a swimsuit and is captioned something like, &quot;This is my favorite body type for a nugget.&quot; Pretty odd. As you can see from the comments on the PG post, no one knew what nugget meant.</p>
<p>There is also evidence of Chelsea Handler using the term affectionately tor a child she cares for, such as a family member:

<p>I am not here to implicate Chelsea Handler, but her posts are further proof of what Nug or Nugget means.</p>
<p>This is only somdwhst3 related, but researching this topic lead me to another discovery, which is a bunch of articles about pedos &quot;pretending to be chicken nuggets&quot; to lure children on social media:

I recall way back a video of people dressed up just like those rabbits doing a creepy dance around coffins.

            Nug Hunt is not new and indeed means hunting for weed but there is more in this picture. Two things jump out for me right away:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              If it’s a weed party (in essence) then why does this little girl appear on the poster? Inappropriate, wouldn’t you say? Drug parties and children? No? I think the child shouldn’t be on this type of party fliers.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Pay attention, in this poster the little girl is the hunted. Namely caught by the creepy white rabbit. And we know their association with rabbits.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            I call this one a great catch, well done. Not sure if it is a new pedo code now but in this regard it seems suspicious nevertheless. Need more digging to see how far back this term goes or where it came from originally.

            "nugget -porn"

            it was supposedly a fetish for two quadruple amputees....

            I thought it was ludicrous at the time, but now knowing about sex slaves and cannibalism, I could see some sick fuck doing this.

            Yeah I'm on the side that this is coincidence. The Chelsea Handler pic of the little girl butt is weird, but as far as the nug hunt, it's weed related. Towlie confirms it. I suppose there is room for the possibility that the weed connotation is a cover, and the party members "in the know" were aware it was referring to something else... But Occam's Razor says this is unlikely. I will say, the Easter bunnies in the pic are creepy. But that's kinda Seth Green's style.

            I think you're onto something. UrbanDictionary includes these definitions for nugget: E) Spontaneous nickname for a child who is excessively cute, funny, innocent-looking, etc.; F) Slang for any large sexual part on a girl's body.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chelsea Handler used the term nugget to describe her sidekick, Chuy Bravo, a man with dwarfism. Speaking of midgets, Handler has said, "I see them and I want to hold them down, cuddle them, be like, 'Come here, you little nugget. Who's you're mommy now? So cute!"
           </p>
           <p>
            Chelsea Handler and singer Kelsea Ballerini did an episode where they test tasted chicken nuggets from Wendy's, Chick-Fil-A, Popeyes, KFC, McDonald's, Burger King, and Jack in the Box. Kelsea Ballerini said, "Chicken nuggets are actually my love language." Handler said her only request to Ballerini was that she'd like her to write a song about ranch dressing - another code expression favored by this crew? Ranch dressing is "a thick white salad dressing made with sour cream or buttermilk," and a slang term for ejaculate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chicken nuggets were the subject of the top retweets of 2017. "A 16-year-old named Carter Wilkerson, garnered 3.6 million retweets in his campaign for a year’s supply of nuggets from Wendy’s. He came up short of Wendy’s target of 18 million retweets, but Wendy’s still gave him the nuggets and a $100,000 donation in his name to the Wendy’s-linked Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption." Given that Twitter has been accused of protecting pedophiles and that the cabal communicates in code words, numbers, and symbols, it seems odd that this was most re-tweeted subject of the year, and that chicken nuggets, Twitter, Wendy's, and an adoption foundation were involved.

            Btw and re: a lot of the comments here, I know nugget can refer to a chunk of weed. But there are more references and more evidence here relating to it meaning "children."

             I'll concede this as a possibility. Especially after what Kappy said. My suspicion on this one, though, is just some harmless adult fun of the non-pedo variety.

             Between this and the Hearthstone thread up right now, you're definitely running the saner ship.

            Hollywood has used this term somewhat subtly in tv/film.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know in the new Battlestar Galactica the 'female' Starbuck, formerly a male character, referred to new (young) recruits as nuggets.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can not recall specifically, but have a vague recollection of seeing it in another show/film.

            I'll take a stab and say few of the commenters likely have kids.  I have kids, we called them "nug" or "nugget" when they were little.

            You are reaching on this one.  Nug hunt is hiding weed in those plastic Easter eggs.

           <p>
            Nuggets or nugs are little buds off weed plants.

             Why would that Chandler woman talk about favorite body types for children, calling them nuggets? And "meaty"? Read the post next to this one: "Sometimes I meet a kid who feels about adults the way I feel about children, and then we bond"

            Considering that party is two days after 420, they could also be talking about marijuana nuggets. I've known of people doing Easter egg style hunts with marijuana on 4/20.

              Nug
Definition:
             </p>
             <p>
              A term adapted by the cannabis industry to refer to manicured buds from the cannabis plant. Nugs are the smokable part of the colas that are commonly referred to as flower. The term is also used as a slang reference to high-quality cannabis.
             </p>
             <p>
              Origin
             </p>
             <p>
              While there’s no definitive answer as to where the term “nug” derived from — or how it became ingrained in cannabis culture — the most likely explanation is as a shortened version of the term “nugget.” Originally, the word “nugget” was defined as a small lump of gold or other precious metal, but the term was eventually expanded to include small lumps or chunks of other substances, including cannabis.
             </p>
             <p>
              In addition to describing the size and shape of cannabis flowers, nug can also refer to the quality of cannabis. Nug is a term cannabis consumers typically use to describe buds of high-quality cannabis. The opposite of nug is “schwag,” or low-quality cannabis.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nugs make up the larger colas on the cannabis plant and have a relative density of trichomes far greater than leaves and stems or stalks. After the cola is harvested, the nugs are removed and manicured to clear away any leaves or stems that might be attached. Dried, cured nugs are sold for consumption

                 I've been here for 2.5 years. I've never seen you debunk ANYTHING. What are you doing here anyway? Why not find a board more to your liking? Why bother trying to convince us 'conspiracy theorists' if we're beyond redemption. God knows you've tried hard enough. Like I said, you've too much of a vested interest. Why Pizzagate? Do you spend as much time trying to debunk Holocaust deniers or 9/11 truthers? I think not. Glowing.

                  I've debunked the claim Clinton knew Silsby before she was arrested.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I've debunked that claim that Silsby got her kids from an Orphanage connected to the Maccoby family
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I debunked the claim that Bill Clinton intervened in the Silsby case.  In fact, I showed the one newspaper that reported that dropped that claim in like a week, after Clinton went back home and Silsby stayed in jail.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I debunked the claim that the NYPD had Weiner's laptop before the FBI.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I debunked the claim that pizza was a code word or that any code words were used in the Podesta emails.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I've shown that maps with pizzas on them is a very common image and that you can actually buy stock images with several different designs like this.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I've shown that pasta with walnut sauce is common dish from Liguria when Podesta's Italian ancestors were from.  I even posted John Podesta's recipe for this and video of him cooking it.  All of which existed before "pizzagate."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I debunked the $65,000 pizza and hotdogs story and showed that the guy quoted in that email hated Obama and was passing along right wing rumors and I even showed exactly what started these rumors.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I've shown that the stupid "spooky" wifi place in Hawaii has no connection to Obama or Clinton....they confused the guy in Hawaii's name with a similar name connected to Obama.... (By the way, the whole spooky Hawaii story was the ramblings of a methhead.)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Those are the ones I can remember.  Basically everything on pizzagate wiki has an alternate and logical explanation for it.

                 Not at all. You invest way too much time trying to debunk things you can't. You have a vested interest more than the usual shills. You've been here as long as I have and I've yet not seen you once agree with anything anyone has said.

                  I've debunked, root and branch, several of the foundational elements on this board.

                  Vested Interest?   My interest is no more than being disgusted at post-truth disinformation tactics being imported into our democracy, that and the witchhunt, anti-rational, conspiratorial mindset that animates this place.

                 It is because you are an unconvincing piece of shit and no one buys your pathetic explanations and denials of observable reality. Every single thing you post is fantastic bullshit. You have quite a gift to be able to post 100% faggotry all the time.
