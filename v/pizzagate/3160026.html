<p>Sound ok so i decided to watch it and was shocked by the storyline being about children being abducted by santa,
Kept in boxes till christmas and then shipped to rich elites in doll boxes all cleaned up for christmas morning.</p>
<p>I was shocked at how dark this programme was,  moreso because i know this stuff happens and is very real. </p>
<p>After watching the 1st season, it really upset me to think of kids being delivered in large doll boxes on christmas for rich peoples perversions. AND THEN I REMEMBERED THE PODESTA EMAIL ABOUT DOMINO\'S  ON PIZZA OR PASTA</p>
<p><a href="https://archive.fo/JBft7">https://archive.fo/JBft7</a></p>
<p>Most people focused on the bottom line about dominos.</p>
<p>But after watching this show about the boxes with kids getti g delivered on christmas.
Makes this email horrific. Heres the first paragraph from the email.</p>
<p>I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been &gt; long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape &gt; of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the &gt; square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it &gt; was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the &gt; return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that &gt; we can demolish them.</p>
<p>Why talk about strategies that have long been in place for recieving a christmas gift
Podesta was clearly not expecting  a square box mabye expecting a rectangle doll shaped one 
And the person who sent him his gift was the sandler foundation
Oh and the date is christmas eve</p>
<p>After watching happy i believe this podesta email to mirrors the show and can be understood much easier as to what podestas &quot;christmas gift from the sandlerfoundation was.
I wonder how many other &quot;gifts&quot; the sandler foundation sent out and to whom .</p>',

            Watched it through a lens and with a view that this shit is happening right before our eyes, these shows just tie it up in a nice little bow and present it as good TV and edgy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I often think about these writers and TV people who come up with these ideas, I mean one sketch in this show HAPPY a baby is killed by being put in a microwave, it is disturbing and sick.

            This reminds me of the TV series Altered Carbon; the elite could buy robots or synthetics (whatever they're called) with which they could use as sex slaves, which they could beat, rape, and abuse in any which way... including murder them.  I forget which episode it was (one of the last two), but one of the main character's found a CHILD ROBOT waiting in one of the perversion rooms for whichever client had paid for it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know how the show differs from the books in that regard, but it really did make me think the show needs another looking at for symbols and such.

            She was from one of the oldest families in France and her banker father raped her (2 siblings committed suicide later) and she worked with bodily fluids like Abramovic. There are other works like that one: cartoonish travelogues about being seduced and eating pasta (with Chianti - - note the 1983 letter is addressed to Clarice, associated with Hannibal Lecter).  Many others are intertwining serpents i.e. kundalini/Kabbalah.

            She married a novelist reliant in his works on secret society plot lines and who wrote a supposedly satirical autobiography called My Life in CIA based on rumors from his time in the Paris expat community. She founded a museum for her other husband in Basel.
           </p>
           <p>
            A funny coincidence is she did a mural on a pizza oven at a restaurant whose owner has recently left to start a children's charity called

             In 1996, she began building Gila, a large dragon-shaped children's playhouse for a San Diego private residence. This project was her first use of digital techniques to enlarge drawings into full-scale construction. Who's house was that, and is it still there? The Golem thing was obviously the first  weird children's sculpture. The film Daddy sounds a bit odd, but I am not sure if that would be an easy to find thing, being French and all.

            Its an "in you face" of what is happening around us. Everyone should watch it, but thru the lens of truth that we can now see the symbols and the linkages to what we know is happening to children.

            You think a tv show written after these events occurred has somehow provided otherwise unknown information about the emails? That doesn't make any sense. The shows writers would have to have this knowledge, and if so why in the world would this be the thing to do with said knowledge?

             A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down. Wrap a truth in obvious lies and they won’t belive the truth when it’s staring right at them.

             Sometimes I wonder if the satanism is a part of that. Let’s say the elites are involved in human trafficking and they don’t want anyone to talk about it, just couple the crime with something outlandish like occult devil worshipping and it suddenly makes the topic feel less credible.

             It may be a means to dispel or discredit rumors. After all, these guys have a lot of money and connections, so they can afford to run counter operations to discredit critics. by making a crazy tv show on the syfi channel, they can argue that critics "watch too much fantasy tv, and should get out more"
            </p>
            <p>
             That is the key line "Should get out more", because getting out costs money, and involves consuming. It reinforces the npc behaviors and makes npcs feel good about wasting their lives and money, while at the same time it attempts to shame inexperienced critics.

             What!  no i think the show is showing us what happens all the time to these kids.
And the podesta email on dec 24th is veery suspicious as podesta sends an email to the sandler foundation to firstly complain about breaking a long time served protocol on the shape of a gift
And i didnt say the emails were new knowledge, just that if u watch  the show then that email makes a bit of sense about podesta bitching about why he recieved that shape of box (square) as he was obviously  waiting for another shape of box (i.e rectangular box)

              Alright, but doesn't it make more sense that the box podesta received was just supposed to be shaped like something else? What about a 6 pointed star, or a big dick for all that matters?
             </p>
             <p>
              It's silly to draw this kind of conclusion from that email. Why would you ship a child in a box? The logistics don't even make sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              These people are sick and twisted, and probably have actually harmed children, but trying to explain the delivery of a box of cheese as being related to see trafficking without any actual evidence to that end is just another loony story that makes us all look like fools.
             </p>
             <p>
              The email is strange, and may or may not have a hidden meaning. We have no proof of a hidden meaning, and assuming we know what words might translate to is silly. We have no idea. The "map colored handkerchief" it whatever it was is certainly very strange, and quite probably means something, but we have no lexicon to interpret it.

             The constant pizza references for decades has no explanation except that advertisers and screenwriters are all Jews, ergo pizzagate is a Jewish cult.

              It became mainstream from the chans. "The mods are asleep, post cheese pizza", and the pedos would post child porn.

              I am wondering how old that slang is. Was it a regional thing before the internet, or have they been using it for years?

             Turns out the whole thing is likely operated by interdimebsional body-snatching insectoid beings.  This show is amazing.  I'm suprised no one talks about it on Voat more often.
