            THE COMPILATION OF JEWISH RITUAL MURDERS FROM BCE UNTIL 1932
The earliest of historians, Herodotus, informs us about the Hebrew cult of human sacrifice. He writes: “The Hebrews sacrificed humans to their God Moloch.” (Herodotus, Vol. II, p. 45)
The ritual murders that have been passed down through writings since before the current era until today are:
169 B.C. — “King Antiochus Epiphanes of Syria, during the plundering of the Temple of Jerusalem, found a Greek lying on a bed in a secret chamber. He begged the King to rescue him. When he began to beg, the attendants told him that a secret law commanded the Jews to sacrifice human beings at a certain time annually. They therefore searched for a stranger which they could get in their power. They fattened him, led him into the woods, sacrificed him, ate some of his flesh, drank some of his blood, and threw the remains of his body into a ditch.” (Josephus, Jewish historian, Contra Apionem)
418 A.D. — Baronius reports the crucifixion of a boy by the Jews at Imm, between Aleppo and Antioch.
419 A.D. — In the Syrian district of Imnestar, between Chalcis and Antioch, the Jews tied a boy to a cross on a holiday and flogged him to death. (Socrat)
425 A.D. — Baronius reports the crucifixion of a boy.
614 A.D. — After the conquest of Jerusalem, the Jews purchased, for a small amount of money, 90,000 prisoners from the Persian King Chosros II and murdered them all in the most disgusting ways. (Cluverius, Epitome his. p. 386)
1071 A.D. — Several Jews from Blois crucified a child during the Easter celebration, put his body into a sack and threw it into the Loire. Count Theobald had the guilty ones burned alive. (Robert of Mons, Mon. Germ. hist. Script VI 520)
1144 A.D. — In Norwich, during Passover, 12-year-old St. William was tied by the local Jews, hanged from a cross, and his blood drained from a wound in his side. The Jews hid the corpse in the nearby woods. They were surprised by a local citizen, Eilverdus, who was bribed with money to keep quiet. Despite this the crime still became notorious. (Acta sancta, III March, Vol., p. 590)
1160 A.D. — The Jews of Gloucester crucified a child (Mons Germ. hist. Script 520)
1179 A.D. — In Pontoise, on March 25th before Passover, the Jews butchered and drained St. Richard’s body of blood. Due to this, the Jews were expelled from France. (Rob. of Turn., Rig.u.Guillel. Amor.)
