<p>I searched Facebook and found said sister \'Patricia Labarbra\', who is indeed married to a Drew Labarbra.  What I found quite strange is that there is a lot of interaction between Catherine\'s sisters, except for Catherine, who is never mentioned by any of them.  It appears that there is only one picture on a different sister\'s FB, \'Ginny Mullin-Schultheiss\' (I will link everything below), taken quite some time back that shows Catherine.  A comment on this picture asks &quot;Whatever happened to Cathy?&quot;  To which, the sister, Ginny simply replies &quot;Cathy is fine&quot;.</p>
<p>At this point, I am wondering if Catherine is either \'bat-shit\' crazy or this family is aware of some very weird shit involving her sister! This whole case is a head-fuck at times.

            The names she lists...insiders. Most normal people don't know some of these people. She mentions Chuck Scarburough. Chuck Scarburough was married to one of Henry Ford's daughters.  Ford was definite Nazi sympathizer &amp; some think Nazi himself.  These underground Nazis are the ones pulling off the MKUltra programs. She also mentions an FAA insider among others. I'm pretty sure she was on the inside of some very scary things. Public records also seem to validate her information. Addresses &amp; court records line up in public databases.  I don't believe Joe Scarburough is related to Chuck Scarburough. But it would be interesting to find out about as there was a huge scandal about him having a dead intern found in his office by immigration officials some time back. Some people wonder if Joe murdered his intern....I believe a tweet storm about wether he murdered his intern ensued.

            Had someone very similar add me on Facebook, she is very clearly suffering from the self destruct mechanism of MKUltra victims that are no longer of use. Check it out I havn't dived in yet most seemed like babble but just like Agnew there may actually be some gems in the confusion. She specifically says she a Hillary torture and rape victim, crazy shit.

            it would go a long way if maybe you could clear up some of her claims and possible reasons as to why she'd think some of the things she does. I realize there may be mental health issues at play so unlike the other posters I'm trying to be sensitive to that, but since you happen to know her, I think all of us in this thread would really appreciate a bit of clarification and/or background. I'm not trying to nitpick but simply coming on here and stating "she is fine and not in Oregon" without addressing any of her claims just raises more questions, rather than answering any.

            Sorry to Jack but...........

            Thought this was interesting. Catherine's most talked about person is easily "Admiral Mullen" and refers to him as Mike numerous times. Well google Admiral Mullen and up pops Admiral Micheal Mullen. Look at his wiki and during 2011 he worked for the Joint of Staff. To take it further Joint of Staff to this day follows "Deborah Mullen" for whatever reason. During all her 2011 accounts she follows Joint of Staff and only Joint of Staff. So its pretty clear he is 100% the Admiral Mullen she is talking about
           </p>
           <p>
            Shows her following JoS

            Admiral Mullen had a Twitter back in 2011 but its protected

           <p>
            If you search on Twitter "Michael Mullen" for some reason the first result is Joint of Staff

           <p>
            "In December 2012, one year into his retirement, the Admiral was in the news again, for having been the target of a computer hacking, a situation that led to subsequent FBI investigations". Wonder why they targeted him?
           </p>
           <p>
            He works as a Professor at Princeton University. Dare somebody to find his work #, which should be accessible, and call and just put him on the spot and ask him if he knows Catherine Agnew. Record it if you do

            ....suuuuuuure you are..... what a strange handle name - and yea, thanks for telling us none of these hypothesis are true... I hardly think If I knew someone that had conspiracy theorist in an uproar, and knew it all to be untrue, I'd jsut leave that part hanging and say I'd said enough.  You are god damn liar.

            Is there anything you can tell us about her history? (you don't have to go into to much detail) Like, how she came to start tweeting about these politicians and other "higher ups"..for example the 7th floor group, and the podestas? She seems to know alot of useful information, and she tweets as though she was involved with these people.

            So she talks about her sister being killed and I think her parents too. Was that all in her head? Or is this just the remaining people alive? I think she had a lot of sisters tho. Interesting

              It seems like she's been under so much mind control that they make her seem crazy, but they are the ones making her crazy. She knows too much and so many names and things we know they do with MKUltra victims that at least some of what she says I think is real. I wonder where she is now and what is happening to her.

             This is an old picture...like the late 90s.  Her sister (Margaret?) referenced as deceased in tweets is also mentioned in comments on another picture stating that she would have been 56 had she not died....etc.

            To upload an image, first go to imgoat.com 
Then dragdrop photo into blue bar (or upload from photo album on mobile). Once it processes, copy the URL and paste it into the post.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are other image sites too.  But I want to give the imgoat developer a shoutout!

             It's a CIA family.  Does make u wonder if MKUltra as well.  Probably if she went through the abuse she claims.
