           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Jean-Marc Houdmont,
            </strong>
            a filmmaker who was recycled in the exotic fish trade, was also questioned during the CRIES investigation because his name was included in the network's address book. He was also involved in the case of the disappearance of Elisabeth Brichet [4], because he lived next door and was already known for his pedophile activities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Houdmont is one of those many witnesses who had the good idea to die before testifying in the Dutroux case, in this case a car accident in February 1997. While he had been calling the cops the day before, make revelations. As there was no sign of braking, it was concluded that there was suicide. The father of Houdmont and that of Dutroux lived at the same time in the same village of Congo. Houdmont was suspected of trafficking in porno-pornographic images, such as those in his cottage, set on fire in 1990.

             A UN. "Children's rights Convention"  "Tool for Perverts."
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The late James Grant described the Convention on the Rights of the Children as a "Magna Carta for children, an instrument of far-reaching significance for needs of those who are humanity's most vulnerable."
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               However, the North American Man-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA), which seeks to legalize adult-child sexual relations, sees the Convention as a way to pry children from the safety of the home.
              </p>
              <p>
               Canadian journalist Celeste McGovern notes that NAMBLA agitated on behalf of Canada's ratification of the Convention, because the group believes that "the convention could be used to support its belief that children as young as six have the right to chose to have sex"
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Defenders of the Convention may protest that the document condemns child pornography, child prostitution, and other varieties of sexual abuse and exploitation.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               <strong>
                However, on July 30, 1993, the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) effectively endorsed the pervert lobby by granting "consultative status" to the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA), a coalition which included NAMBLA and a Dutch pedophile organization.
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The decision to admit ILGA was approved by representatives of 22 governments, including the Clinton Administration. ...Every child is our child. So asserts the United Nations Children Fund, or UNICEF, the UN's showcase "humanitarian" organization.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              On June 18, 1987, Jozef Verbeek, the head of the Belgian UNICEF committee, was arrested on charges of "inciting minors to debauchery" in connection with the use of the organization's Brussel's office buildings to facilitate child prostitution and production of child pornography. Shortly thereafter, UNICEF volunteer Michael Felu was arrested and charged with taking the photographs, many of which depicted children ten years of age and younger.
             </p>
             <p>
              Before joining the UN organization, Felu had been repeatedly prosecuted for child molestation. Police confiscated 19,000 pornographic photographs and a mailing list of 400 names in 15 countries which had been compiled on the UNICEF office computer.

              The center was founded by Philippe Carpentier, a former translator at the court in Brussels, in the early 80s.

              The CRIES was therefore a center for lobbying for the cause of paedo, for example by normalizing the sexual act with a child who, according to them, thrive in sex with old pervert. In their language, it gives :

              <p>
               "A relationship made of tenderness and sensuality can be fulfilled for young people, whatever their age or sex, a highly positive experience, if it is lived in freedom, free from any form of coercion, but also free from taboos and guilt that our society places too often sexuality. "
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              These guys take their fantasies for reality, and they are completely crazy: "If children fascinate us today is that we want to recover from them all the wealth of experiences of childhood, beyond our own youth. " Of course, they will say they are only responding to the advances of the kids, and that if things go wrong (for them or the child), it is because the entourage of children understands nothing about this "love."
             </p>
             <p>
              All these theories smokers were in the review of CRIES titled "Hope" . But CRIES, it is mainly a distribution network and location of pédopornos movies, photos, and prostitution of minors.

              He served as a volunteer soldier in the NATO base at Limoges, France, where he had time to perfect his French. After one year of pastoral and humanistic studies at Stenonius College (also known as Europaseminär, a Roman Catholic seminary today extinct) in Maastricht, the Netherlands, he began his conversion to Protestantism around 1966.

              His Centre du Christ Libérateur was a ministry to sexual minorities. The center had support groups for homosexuals, transsexuals, sadomasochists and pedophiles.

              Doucé was killed and the murder has never been solved. According to Doucé's lover, he was taken away by two men, who showed police badges on July 19, 1990. The body was found in a forest in October 1990.
             </p>
             <p>
              The killers are thought by some to be a unit of the French police, Renseignements Généraux, who investigated Doucé because of his support for pedophiles.

              Still a state scandal stifled under the cover of a closed legal file. The justice, by the hand of the investigating judge Marc Trevidic, signed on October 24, 2007, a dismissal in the case of Pastor Douce, the homosexual militant priest who disappeared in July 1990 in the forest of Rambouillet. 
Only his body had been discovered, three months later, but the assassins, still anonymous, are still running.

              Joseph Doucé, the founder of the Liberating Christ Center, a place dedicated to sexual minorities, was monitored by the Paris General Information, including a cell - the GER, Investigations Group reserved for twisted, filoché, and perhaps killed: soon after the disappearance, Jean-Marc Dufourg, patron of this cell, and three policemen had been placed and heard, but their guilt was never established.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dufourg was still dismissed from the police in November 1990 by the Minister of the Interior, Pierre Joxe. He was also sentenced in 1992 to 20 months' suspended prison sentence for "violence and assault with a weapon" for shooting in the door of the apartment of a close relative of the pastor. Seventeen years after the fact, the investigation remains at a standstill.

              In his book of interviews published in October 2007 ("I do not know anything ... but I will say (almost) everything", at Plon), the former boss of the RG Yves Bertrand returns to this case. All in convolutions, as often the RG when they do not know how to deal with a burning file: in this case, a "scandal that has hit us hard and will tarnish the reputation of the RG for a long time", writes the one that Sarkozy called "Grinch", because of his small size and thick eyebrows, in memory of "Snow White and the seven dwarfs" ... As often at the RG, Yves Bertrand, to protect the memory of his dear service - by train to lose his soul by merging with the DST - begins by discrediting the victim. "He was a controversial character who organized religious ceremonies in a pornographic theater (...). In fact, this bookshop was the antenna and the link of a powerful pedophile network, whose trace was later found in the investigations related to the Dutroux affair ".
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Just that. Yves Bertrand continues in the same vein: "Doucé knew and protected a large number of pedophiles, in France and abroad, but also sadomasochists and violent perverts. A well-filled address book. Ten thousand names, it is said, from the milieus of politics, the show biz, the magistracy. This mania for filing is undoubtedly what caused his loss ...

            With people like Peter Ustiov and Danny Kay heading UNICEF in the past, why are we all surprised.  Every head should be investigated.

            <p>
             The Belgian director of UNICEF, the United Nations' arm
for the ostensible protection of children, was arrested June
18 (1987) for participating in an international pedophile ring which
used UNICEF facilities to supply children to wealthy pedo­
philes. Belgium's UNICEF director, Josef Verbeeck, was
only one among 12 individuals arrested in connection with
this child pornography and procurement ring.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the Belgian police, the ring spans the at
least 16 countries, where investigations are now beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
             As shocking as this news may be on purely moral grounds,
what makes the case explosive is the fact that UNICEF's
pedophile activities appear intimately intertwined with intel­ligence operations.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Unicef said it was investigating charges that the Belgian committee was linked to an organization producing pornographic photographs of children and distributing them throughout Europe.
             </p>
             <p>
              The scandal erupted last week, when the Belgian police arrested Jos Verbeek, 63 years old, the director of Unicef's Belgian committee, and charged him with inciting minors to debauchery.
             </p>
             <p>
              The arrest followed the discovery of a secret photographic studio in the basement of the Brussels building where the committee's offices are housed. The studio was used to take pornographic photographs of children, many of whom were of North African origin, the police said. #1,000 Photos Seized The police said more than 1,000 such photographs were seized, along with a mailing list of some 400 names in 15 European countries that had been prepared on the Unicef office computer.
             </p>
             <p>
              Similar photographs found in several other European countries appear to have been taken in the Unicef office in Brussels, according to investigators.
