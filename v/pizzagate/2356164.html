             Thank you.  Several reasons for taking time out, one includes shoulder pain, I speculated whether or not being glued to computer was a factor! lol.  A tsunami of things to do elsewhere was one other reason.  December was crazy.

              You may be on to something there.  Yeah, Dec. was nuts for me too.  Lots of people getting mad I did not cater to them as usual.  Too bad.

               You nailed the other reason.  The few times I went to post a comment, the vitriol going on wasn't something I wanted to jump into.  Especially since I saw some good points on both sides, I think any comment would have been misconstrued.  All the drama was a distraction imo.  I wasn't (and still am not) taking sides in the battle of personalities.  Who wants to step in between that level of profanity?  ;)  Too many other things going on.

                I hear you.  But around here whenever there are comments, the other person knows it won't do them any good.  I have a mind of my own.  Haha.  That is something that is known.  So now back to biz.

            Where not those released foreigners part of the Underground Railroad?  Or am I mistaken.  I remember they went from many arrested to about 12 to all being released.  Very speculative really.  Very strange.  This has happened quite a few times.  The Underground  RR. Group turned out to be Fakes actually.

              The beginning of the first link with Doran, made me sick.  Sick to think of those children 8-12 servicing their captors.  It made me reel.  Made me nauseous.  You force yourself to read these things because someone has to.  Because you want to know what they are exposed to.  But then it hits you right in the heart.  DHS and the UN and the CIA and the Clintons and the Haiti Govt.  and Save the Children, OUR  are  all involved in this Nasty Business.  Not to mention Glen $eck.  We here have compiled so many links and evidence that can be connected that I wonder if there is someone or some that are taking our info.  Hopefully they are using our posts and comments to Turn Against Them.

                After a long investigation into a human trafficking network in Haiti and a key information last week that young girls were going to be sold by a network of human traffickers, the Port-au-Prince Public Prosecutor's Office launched on Sunday afternoon, a joint operation involving the Central Directorate of the Judicial Police (DCPJ), the National Police of Haiti (PNH) assisted by United Nations police officers (UNPol), the Brigade of Protection of Minors in the presence of Me Myrlande Prévost Dupiche, Deputy of the Government Commissioner to the Court of First Instance (TPI) of Port-au-Prince.

The fabrications of Russia Crap is meant to tie up the DOJ and Sec. of State Depts. so serious stuff like Haiti and Sex Trafficking and Charity Orgs. will never be looked at.  I hope they will not be a "Can Kicked Down the Road"  and lost for decades again.  All this evidence just waiting to be brought out but it never makes it to their desk.  AARRGGHH!!!

             PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (sentinel.ht) – Four district attorneys, known as “Substitutes of the Government Commissioner”, were fired by the Minister of Justice on Thursday for what the ministry said was a “grave mishandling” of the case involving the Kaliko Beach Resort where 33 girls, many of whom were minors, were rescued by police in a sex trafficking sting.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Following the February 2017 sting, where 33 girls were found in one hotel room, several foreign nationals, involved in the trafficking arrangement, were detained but released by sunrise the following day. It made widespread local news when then Chief Prosecutor, Government Commission Danton Leger, to his dismay could not account for their whereabouts of the suspects or if these persons were even still in the territory.
            </p>
            <p>
             The integrity of Commissioner Leger was not in question then or now. He criticized a breakdown within his department for the mishandling of the arrests and the securing of all suspects.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Sentinel reported that only 8 Haitian nationals, including the driver of a bus who transported the girls, were actually arrested. The driver was released after a few days for lack of involvement and sometime since, the other individuals were released.
            </p>
            <p>
             Commissioner Leger had also detained the proprietors of the Kaliko Beach Resort but was unable to hold them. In August 2017, the resort announced it was near a buyout deal to be transformed into a Hilton Hotel. It had suffered huge financial losses due to the events of March.
Sources close to the matter, who furnished scans of these actual letters of revocation to the Haiti Sentinel, say inside the halls of the Palace of Justice, it is believed that the four prosecutors fired were paid to release the detained foreign nationals and were signatories for signed releases for the arrested non-foreign nationals.
