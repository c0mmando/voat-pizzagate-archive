            In case you guys forgot, a while back some investigators had discovered the James Alefantis was connected to an old cult known as "The Moonies" (aka The Unification Church) through his purchase of the Pegasus Museum building. These fucking cults are everywhere!!

            question, from a long-time River Phoenix fan.  Has it been speculated this whole time that River may have been murdered?  Have you all heard that before?  I never heard that mentioned until this post, but now I want to learn as much as I can

            Wasn't he handed a speed ball Frusciante?. He then realised he was overdosing and tried to get out of the club. But someone gave him something else outside.

             I tried searching for info last night.  Some people are saying he was handed a drink and immediately fell ill, then went outside and went into convulsions then died.  what a great actor.  supposedly his former co-star of My Own Private Idaho confirms this story.

            <em>
             Anthony Vivien Fox, co-founder of the Viper Room, disappeared on December 19, 2001. His truck was found abandoned a few weeks later but his body was never found. He was scheduled to testify in court shortly after his disappearance, and was in the process of suing five people over financial problems with the Viper Room, one of which was Depp. Fox accused Depp of defrauding him of millions of dollars in profits, but he disappeared before the lawsuits could be brought to any conclusion.

             The drugs were given to River by people he trusted. Yeah, he took them, but he didnt do drugs while making movies, it was usually after a film was done. so this was intentionally done. it was by two people not just by frusciante. another person was involved. and no matter how you look at it. the drugs were given to him, he trusted the wrong people obviously and died on the spot at Depps club. any way you look at it, slice it, it is called murder

            <em>
             Depp had something to do with Rivers death! He was the one that told Flea to tell Riv there was ” no room on stage” and was then handed a cup laced with a lethal drug. Samantha Mathis saw the whole thing but did not say anything about the cup until a few years ago. River even asked what was in it and yelled out to Depp that he was going to die.

            <em>
             A friend of mine in another L.A. cabal told me in the late 90s that River's death was a sacrifice ordered by Anjelica Huston to consolidate her power when she was taking over the world leadership of the group. They had been working on it for some time and Depp was the designated facilitator. 
The entire Viper Club set-up was created for such purposes. I can't tell you how many people disappeared from the place over the years. My friend told me they had a kill room in the basement - a chapel, really, with a stone table or platform. Phoenix originally was supposed to be put down as part of a ceremony - they had been cultivating his drug habit - but they got the final dose wrong. He realized something was up and tried to escape, but once on the street one of them delivered a quick injection and they did a fast impromptu sealing to secure the juju.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Huston, who was down in the chapel, was livid and had four of the staff taken out right then and there. If you check the news stories from the week after you'll read about the four "unidentified" bodies found in the desert. Depp was off the hook because she decided it wasn't his fault, but he had a huge pay-back debt he had to work off, which explains the films he's been in ever since. Huston had approval on every one of his projects and she ensured every one was something dank and, ultimately, satanic.

             I haven't been posting my experiences for quite a while - I had heard someone was figuring out who I was. But I saw this thread and had to say something. I really like River - he was a sweet kid. Keanu never got over it, you know.

              this article also has this interesting piece of information:
             </p>
             <p>
              Anthony Vivien Fox, co-founder of the Viper Room, disappeared on December 19, 2001. His truck was found abandoned a few weeks later but his body was never found. He was scheduled to testify in court shortly after his disappearance, and was in the process of suing five people over financial problems with the Viper Room, one of which was Depp. Fox accused Depp of defrauding him of millions of dollars in profits, but he disappeared before the lawsuits could be brought to any conclusion.

            I can't find the link now but will post it as soon as I do. One witness has stated that there was a basement to the Viper Room, complete with altar and used as a ritual place for the Satanists. River was due to be the sacrifice but got wind of their plan. He tried to leave the club to escape but was injected and died. Huston was livid and flew into a rage. Four witnesses to the event all subsequently died in mysterious circumstances. River was a sacrifice gone wrong.

             I don't understand what Angelica Huston has to do with all of this?? Although I have to say I do not like her, and that largely relates to her lack of concern after her "friend" Roman Polanski was caught raping a girl in HER and Jack Nicholson's home, I believe

            My feeling is that it truly was a drug overdose, but that the overdose and drug abuse was largely related to growing up in the cult and being sexually abused as a child.  I could be wrong.

            The Children of God known also as "the family" has roots in many different locations. River &amp; his brother tried to escape by becoming Hollywood stars. He died at Johnny Depp's nightclub "The Viper Room" when Johnny was there. Several former child stars who have spoken out about pedophelia in Hollywood in the movie "Open Secrets" last year refused to name names but repeatedly stated there are "vipers" everywhere. Research the Viper Room and Johnny Depp (who should have his own seperate thread by now)
           </p>
           <p>
            Wikileaks Julian Assange was a child raised in the Children of God cult in Australia. There have been numerous citations linking them to intelligence agencies. In the 1990's the cult visited the Bill Clinton whitehouse taking a picture with Hilary Clinton. Does anyone really believe they were not aware this was a cult.
           </p>
           <p>
            Might give a better understanding of why Julian Assange hates secretive intelligence agencies so much and Hilary Clinton in particular.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: The following letter was written as an open letter to then President Bill Clinton and Hilary Rodham Clinton in 2000 the last year of his presidency. The letter calls into question why they have had "The Family" singers to the Whitehouse for the past seven years and explains in some sickening detail their pedophile practices and sexual abuse of children even infants. The author goes on to explain how "The Family is just a renaming of the Children of God cult. For anyone who believes the President of the United States &amp; HRC would have no idea this was a cult from the Children Of God pedophiles do not be misled. Nobody visits the Whitehouse with backgrounds such as this not known. Again this is clear indication of a finders cell or CIA front.

            It's very likely true. I remember that his peers and the elite of Pedwood were making fun of him when he died. Treated it like a joke. There was a massive level of disrespect so he had to be considered a betrayer.

              Really, I don't save these things. It happened contemporaneously to his death, so it wasn't recent. A lot of people think he could have been saved had helped been called. Here's one link for that:

             </p>
             <p>
              The thing is: (1) he died on Halloween. Really? Can't get much more occult than that. (2) he was going to quit Hollywood. Nobody quits Hollywood unless the Pedo Elite give permission to quit and they weren't done with him. And (3) he'd already talked about abuse, pedos, etc. Can you imagine what he would have said when not in that environment?
