            That's the first time I have heard Louise Mench described as left wing, she is an extreme right wing nutcase and far to the right of Vlad the Impaler. She is only in the USA as no one in Britain wants her anywhere near them.

            Morning Joe is a fucking douchebag. Likes the sound of his own voice way too much. He's a liberal mouthpiece masquerading as a man's man. And his bubbleheaded co-host twat-to-be Mika is a screaching owl if there ever was one on morning news. He should wear a leather glove and let her perch on his hand while he feeds her mice.

            I think what makes it further irritating is that they've created yet another hurdle to red pilling someone on PG. Consider a conversation with someone when you're telling them that the Russian narrative is total BS - which it clearly is - and the real story is a global pedophile ring that is run by the elite and is also tied to satanic rituals. Ugh.

            You probably want to factor in today's story.  What should we put this under Treason or Appalling Incompetence.
           </p>
           <h1>
            Trump revealed highly classified information to Russian foreign minister and ambassador
           </h1>
           <p>
            President Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting last week, according to current and former U.S. officials, who said Trump’s disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State.
           </p>
           <p>
            The information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government, officials said.
           </p>
           <p>
            The partner had not given the United States permission to share the material with Russia, and officials said Trump’s decision to do so endangers cooperation from an ally that has access to the inner workings of the Islamic State. After Trump’s meeting, senior White House officials took steps to contain the damage, placing calls to the CIA and the National Security Agency.
           </p>
           <p>
            “This is code-word information,” said a U.S. official familiar with the matter, using terminology that refers to one of the highest classification levels used by American spy agencies. Trump “revealed more information to the Russian ambassador than we have shared with our own allies.”
.....
In his meeting with Lavrov, Trump seemed to be boasting about his inside knowledge of the looming threat. “I get great intel. I have people brief me on great intel every day,” the president said, according to an official with knowledge of the exchange.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump went on to discuss aspects of the threat that the United States learned only through the espionage capabilities of a key partner. He did not reveal the specific intelligence-gathering method, but he described how the Islamic State was pursuing elements of a specific plot and how much harm such an attack could cause under varying circumstances. Most alarmingly, officials said, Trump revealed the city in the Islamic State’s territory where the U.S. intelligence partner detected the threat.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Washington Post is withholding most plot details, including the name of the city, at the urging of officials who warned that revealing them would jeopardize important intelligence capabilities.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Everyone knows this stream is very sensitive, and the idea of sharing it at this level of granularity with the Russians is troubling,” said a former senior U.S. counterterrorism official who also worked closely with members of the Trump national security team. He and others spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject.

             the constant drumbeat that there is some FBI indictment waiting for Trump, along with these kinds of statements, part of an over-arching psy-op intended to discount pedogate when (or if) it finally breaks?
Who's defense?  Joe Scarborough's?
What finally breaks?  The indictment or pedogate?  Only one of them has a chance of breaking.
Where is this constant drumbeat you mention about sealed indictments?

            Almost two months ago the Department of Justice confirmed there is an investigation into Russian interference in our election and 
"the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia’s efforts."

             Neither of the two people I mentioned are on the left? Give me a break. If you think Mensch is on the right, you're reading the wrong twitter feed and Scarborough is left of center for sure at this point. The constant drumbeat I'm talking about relates to twitter. People like Claude Taylor, Mensch, Lawrence Tribe, etc. This is not the press doing its duty, but a calculated onslaught intended to undermine Trump and anyone who takes on the deep state. We know now that Podesta and Mook cooked this up within 24 hours of the election loss (

               Mensch being a conservative MP does not make her right. Read her tweets, the woman is definitely on the left. "Conservative" in the UK looks nothing like conservative right here. You could argue Scarborough, maybe? But he's been drifting more to the left everyday. He's a textbook RINO. And listening to him recently only confirms his shift in ideology.

            I see your point. But all the mud the Deep State is slinging is just to sow reasonable doubt. That have to keep slinging it true or not to keep their captive Liberal audience on side. I see this all the time with my Liberal relatives who despite their education are acting like trained salon monkey's when it comes to Trump and "The Russians!(tm)". Sometimes I feel like they joined some whacked out religious cult and are still under some type of hypnosis. Even still they're slowly waking up but it's taken forever for them to accept reality. Anyone who voted for Hillary Clinton really doesn't want to listen because once they do they'll feel partially responsible for giving the Spawn of Satan the time of day.
           </p>
           <p>
            With that said I wouldn't worry about any crime Trump may have committed. The biggest reason is they would have used that dirty laundry already. Big picture is there is no doubt Trump has broken the law at some point. Behind every great fortune is a great crime. But Trump doesn't have any great fortune. He's more like the nouveau riche successful Dentist buying a vacation home just inside the West Hampton, Long Island town line coming from the city at the location the makes the distance to any beach North or South equidistant. In other words as far away from the water as you can get and still be on Long Island. Trump is new money. Deep State is old money. Trump's crimes are like graft and greasing the palms of the Teamsters to get his hi-rise in Mid-Town Manhattan built quicker. That's about as minor as it gets in the rarefied air these people are all breathing up there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anything Trump has done will pale in comparison to any Deep State competition thrown at him. In fact the difference is so great it's meaningless. In Clinton Cash we learned Hillary &amp; Co may have stolen 98% of the relief money meant for Haiti. That's not even in the same Solar System as Donald Trump buying a building inspector a hooker and a free weekend at the Bellagio in Vegas. (And I just made that up, I have no idea of any crime Trump may or may not have committed.)

             My thoughts exactly.  I would say though, if the deep state sells it hard enough it may cause a little civil war. They could even kill high profile people like Obama and Hillary and have a Russian patsy who get immunity for implicating Trump.

             If they can make the left think Trump is Hitlering, they may fight back.

             It's being downvoted because you are absolutely correct. They are framing plausible deniability defense. They will literally say Russia planted fake CP videos. Fuck them though, their plan is stupid and will only incriminate them more.
