            Madesafe would be a great choice.  Has anyone used it?  Perhaps the community can chime in and we can all make a group decision.

             Yes this looks really nice, it's good to see there is a client you need to run to participate in the network. This is what blockchain solutions should look like.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is one thing that worries me btw:
            </p>
            <p>
             Network storage during alpha phase
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Data on this alpha network may get lost and MaidSafe will decide or require to wipe the data and restart the network with each alpha release. We will communicate these events via the SAFE Network Forum and on MaidSafe's blog.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             It's still in alpha. But we can try it out and migrate it once there are more solutions available.
            </p>
            <p>
             One thing to keep in mind: Blockchain is the way, but there should be an option to participate in the network otherwise it's still centralized
