— Former CIA Director William Colby</p>
<p>This quote is from former CIA director and Cercle member William Colby giving advice to his friend, senator John DeCamp, urging him to quit his investigations into the Franklin child abuse affair and to write a book about his experiences (The Franklin Coverup, 2nd edition, foreword Second Edition: First printing, December 1996).
WASHINGTON, May 6, 1996— William E. Colby, who as Director of Central Intelligence chose to disclose some of the nation’s darkest secrets to save the spy service he loved, drowned on April 27 in a tributary of the Potomac River in Maryland. He was 76 and lived in the Georgetown section of Washington.</p>
<p>When Colby vanished in rough waters on a late-night, solo canoe trip in 1996, local sheriffs ruled out suicide before they even found his body. A lifetime of espionage meant Colby had enemies from Baltimore to Bali, and conspiracy theories about his death still circulate between Georgetown mansions and CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., today, despite an official ruling of accidental death.</p>

             Great article on his mysterious death. Thank you.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think the relevance to PG is Colby's relationship with DeCamp in the Franklin Cover-up.
            </p>
            <p>
             All roads lead back to the Franklin Cover up, in my honest opinion.  By studying it in depth, it can offer far more understanding to the larger picture of PG than lots of the social media scouring and guerrilla video of the back of Comet that has been posted.
