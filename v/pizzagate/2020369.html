            Did you know that HoursCenter has no HOTDOG  listings. None. Do a site search. Zip. One of the Franks Franks listed in San Diego is a massage parlor/HairColor shop on 5th, a few blocks west of Balboa Park. Idk if this is just a search engine error, as some have supposed, (with supporting research) or something more. Found photo link w/ pics of these adults costumed up like Elsa &amp; crew, went for Elsa ( wonderwoman) and got no joy, but her son, Daryl Patric Bujak,  the x-Babtist pastor, convicted child molester, did not appear connected to FsFs. Just Odd.

            I was very intrigued by the whole "Joseph's Bistro" phenomenon when it posted, so I decided to make a list and map of all the locations in Albuquerque.  There were 87 locations listed, if I remember correctly.  Google Maps has a great feature where you can import spreadsheet data with addresses in one of the columns to make a custom map, so I did that.  Then I started using Google to look up the phone numbers.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first thing I noticed is that some of the addresses don't exist -- like it will say "Suite 213" or something, and the actual building has Suite 200 right next to Suite 300.  I also noticed, as others have observed, that a lot of the phone numbers / addresses are associated with lawyers, dentists, elder care, and other businesses that have certainly come up in pizzagate contexts.
           </p>
           <p>
            But here's the thing: at least 80% of the addresses (again, I only checked the Albuquerque ones) could be found directly with a simple Google search on the phone number.  In fact, even the ones with nonexistent addresses had those exact nonexistent addresses listed out there in searchable webspace.  In addition, at least 80% of the Albuquerque addresses are associated with the name Joseph: either the business owner has the first name Joseph, the Doctor's office is associated with a St. Josephs, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            It still might be interesting to look into some of the people and places involved, and I'm not saying that there couldn't be something sinister going on.  Heck, maybe the data is deliberately 80% garbage, to hide the ones that are associated with actual criminals.  But one thing I will say is that this data really does look like computers fuckin' up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe a worthwhile way forward for me would be to take the ones that don't appear to be duplicates of data found elsewhere on the web and investigate those.

            Synt was a site like Laughing horses orifice headquarters. It's  like a puzzle and you have to go through it all to understand this chopped up jargon . It makes sense to me now I understand it all, except for Joseph and most of the coded cyphers.

The sound of the Sr71 aeromorph is what created chaos in Libya. The Heile myspace shows how some liberals have become wacky twisted mk ultra'd nut jobs as we have seen during protests, the radio is refering to college radio brainwashing the students to be whiny crybabies. Xxxtention is stirring up hate in his music intentionally, and they use some type of tool to darken his eyes to make him look more angry. Mcdonalds is poison the amount of sugar in the soda's is life threatening, and you can see it in size of womans necks now. Osamu  made the music to Sonic the hedge hog and it has an mk ultra lsd effect on the brain. It list the names of a few tech savy pedos who can't be charged (I think they were working for the pentagon) but today can be found on youtube all marketing MRE's. Thats all I can think of right now off the top of my head, I can't see the actual post as I type this.

              My conspiracy side says this operation was to big to go unnoticed, so someone with power had to be in control or paid off  to begin with.  I've heard stories of kids being smuggled over the border and government officials putting them in prostitution while they should've been in protective care, not saying thats the case here.
             </p>
             <p>
              The strip clubs could it be mob related?
             </p>
             <p>
              But he was branding them with tattoos  so I think cult related.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for the guy on the run it would be a guess South America or South Florida. I really don't think he would stay were he is or go to Mexico.

               If pizzagate wants to start finding people, go

                south

               first (just to start). You're thinking of the catch and release scheme. Unaccompanied minors cross all the time and are sent to who ever they claim is a family member in the area. If they say they don't have anyone they go into CPS but who would notice if a couple disappeared in transit?
              </p>
              <p>
               Notice how who he works for is absent. It's unlikely he's a lone wolf. He probably works for/with one of the gangs/cartel. The articles are somewhat glossing over the fact that this was specifically an underage club. All of the girls rescued were underage 14-17.
              </p>
              <p>
               A few specifics that stand out $500 per hour for minors and charges were based on age. Prices were also set around how "fresh" they were meaning he was cycling in new girls frequently enough to make a point of this. This was specifically a child prostitution ring catering to pedophiles.
              </p>
              <p>
               The main club in front Las Palmas II was a cover for the real club in back called La Feria Club.

               Scanned the reviews. There was a mixture of people who were confused because the club was so shitty (Las Palmas) and others who made veiled hints about the secondary club.

               All of the strip clubs along Telephone rd offer prostitution. Many of them have been busted already. The FBI also raided 8 other businesses related to this but didn't disclose where.
              </p>
              <p>
               Some info has been scrubbed. There appears to have been a computer that was seized.

               He had multiple clubs/bars.

               A warning system was in place with blue lights and secret escape route to flee the police.

               The police had been previous called to Las Palmas for the murder of a DJ a few years before (while this site was in operation).

               Several people in the area noticed the young girls before and did nothing.

               -This makes a good model for things to look for.

            Well organized post -I'm so glad you put this up - i had not read anything on the topic yet.

            Bottom line, this is a shady operation that definitely does not pass the smell test.   Keep at it.   Also what came to mind to me as I looked through the post was that weird dentist office in Alaska that had the pedo symbol logo prominently displayed and seemed to never be open.   I wouldn't say it was linked, rather it is a similar type of shady local front operation.

            I'm sure it's just coincidence that every time the bistro lead is posted, the post slides.

            Relates to Pizzagate due to the potential of a trafficking network hiding in plain sight and using a low-key website as a black book of connections.
