            Anyone who thinks anything out of Hollywood is ON YOUR SIDE is deeply deluded. This post is trash. This movie is trash. Stop spreading propaganda on this sub.

            Furthermore, this absolute nonsense about Bennington and Cornell being whacked because they were about to expose the Pedo Cult needs to stop.

             Joaquin Pheonix is clearly on the fringe of Hollywood.  Here are his thoughts in regards to the Oscars (ie the pinnacle of Hollywood):
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              "I think it’s total, utter bullshit, and I don’t want to be a part of it...I don’t believe in it. It’s a carrot, but it’s the worst-tasting carrot I’ve ever tasted in my whole life. I don’t want this carrot. It’s totally subjective. Pitting people against each other"
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, from what I gather from the preview, the politician gets murdered but the media claims he committed suicide.  Sound familiar?
            </p>
            <p>
             I dont believe all politicians are involved.  Its only a large percentage, and that percentage has ALMOST full control of the mainstream media(ie public awareness) which is why it might sometimes seem like an insurmountable task. The odds are most certainly stacked against us, but what choice do we have?
            </p>
            <p>
             Choose your battles, win the war.  And the enemy of your enemy is your friend.
            </p>
            <p>
             Believe me I understand your cynicism. But what better way for them to try and awaken the masses to the idea that people in positions of great power are involved in sick twisted shit of the highest order?  I believe the Weinstein thing falls under that category.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 'Q' thing is not obvious to most. Not to the degree that it can be written off as "Oh yeah dude I saw that movie...lol".  It is symbology shown in a blink and you miss it scene.  It is borderline subliminal.
            </p>
            <p>
             I just think you are barking up the wrong tree here.  This is not going to be the next blockbuster must see movie.  It is an R rated movie, and will likely get little to no marketing other than word of mouth.  This means most people will probably never hear about it unless you recommend it to them...which I most assuredly will be doing.

               You seem to have good intentions in your post so not interested in picking a fight with you. But Im confused that you are about to call me a shill because Im recommending a movie.
              </p>
              <p>
               Joaquin Phoenix is not mainstream hollywood. His parents were in the same pedophilia cult that Rose McGowan, and Julian Assange' parents were in.
              </p>
              <p>
               Choose your battles. And I recommend taking occasional breaks when it seems like the whole world is against you(it isnt)...I would recommend going to the cinema, but that doesnt appear to be your thing.

             You are confused.  The American Military has figured out the Jew since the Korean War.  They tried to save us with JFK but the Jew killed him first.  Then Reagan was another attempt but Nancy the witch and Bushy Boy stopped that shit.  So they went back to work and figured another way.  The internet was a part of it.  It was designed by the Military to be unstoppable.  Your wrong if you dont understand there has been a deep force working behind the scenes getting the people ready to flip the script.  Your wrong wrong wrong.  But you will see the truth soon enough.

                Imagine some movies are propaganda put out by a group of people intent on opening the mind of the people to the fact the world they are in is in fact fake.  Films like The Matrix and FightClub are allegory of the real truth.  Rewatch fight club tonight.  Imagine that it is a military training manual of how to organize a secret group for a world wide coup.  Re watch it.  That movie tells you exactly what they have been up to behind the scenes for decades.  Allow yourself the jump in logic.  They have been doing this for years.  Mr. Robot is a show that shows exactly how to fake a 9/11.  Rick and Morty is a cartoon that is setting the stage for kids to be redpilled.  To really understand what is happening is a major event of humanity.  Probably the most important event in the last 6000 years.  It was going to happen with or without Trump.  Trump was drafted to take the job.  This is the truth.

                   I consider myself aware, what you're saying is a coup is occurring,  what I see is business as usual. Who, praetel is in charge of this "coup", are they borrowing money from a bank to do it or just using your superior intellect.

                    LOL.  You actually think your smug snarky reply is smart.  But you have no idea what is real.  Soon everyone will know the truth.  Who is in charge of the coup?  Well that my friend is fairly well hidden.  But I imagine it involves many many people.  Headquartered in Alabama.  And you will see the fruits of their efforts soon enough.  They already took down Saudi Arabia.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Think about this.  How could you get people into your group?  You approach a friend in the Military....someone you work with.  You get to know them....if they look like a good canidate you have them come to a special meeting.  There you show them some top secret video......of people they know politicians and the like discussing the real way the world works...then you show some hidden video of some of these people fucking kids and killing them.  Then you ask...."are you with us or them? "  then you read them the oath they swore to when they joined the military to "protect the constitution from ALL enemies FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC"  and there you have the creation of the group.  They have been around for seventy years or more....small at first...but in the last five years or so they went big and WOKE the military up.  One man at a time.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But dont imagine this is just an American thing.  Dude this is world wide.  Millions of people have the understanding the Jew/Masons Luciferians are culling us.  They knew...and they war gamed how to get out of this "fantasy" world.  And this is how they do it.  It cant be stopped.....it is happening no matter what.  So swallow the red pill or not.  It is going to be shoved down your throat soon enough...lol.  Good luck.

             I wouldn't be surprised if all the children in that family were molested. They lived in a cult compound for a while. And if I remember correctly Rose Mcgowans family were also members...

              Joaquin Pheonix, River Pheonix, and Rose McGowan were all born into the same cult. And pedophilia was rampant in that cult.
             </p>
             <p>
              If they were personally abused or not is not important at this stage. But it is now obvious to me that, because of their upbringing, they were all definitely awakened early on in life to the fact that people in power(of the cult in this instance) are capable and guilty of pure evil.

              By the way.  The cult disbanded shortly after the murder suicide of the cult leaders son Ricky Rodriguez. He admitted that his mother had routinely sexually abused him as a toddler before killing his caretaker who had also abused him as a child.
