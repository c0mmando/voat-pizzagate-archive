            I'm writing in a already closed area, but think it will get to you.   Try the writing technique described in PTSD by Cathy O'brien available on Amazon.  Write your memories out, with how you got into it and how you got out in the story.  Writing changes the memories into a narrative form, a story that will settle back in your brain in that way, instead of hitting you like an emotion laden kaleidoscope. Don't get it right, just get it written!  Then you can speak of it to others in a less emotional way.  It won't re traumatize you or them in the telling.  It's very freeing and free also.  Please try it.
I've been where your at, it gets better. Chow.

            I will be sharing your story with all who will listen and I will pray for you. May I suggest that, if you can tolerate it, a reputable Brazilian Jiujitsu school could turn that anger into a useful tool. Will also give you the confidence to look people in the eye as you will be so completely confident in your ability to handle attackers much bigger than you.

            , I'm sorry but I need to remove your submission per rule 2: posts without sources are not accepted to this subverse. I know this is not necessarily easy in your case, but if you could source your story or verify yourself in any way, it would be much appreciated and we could allow you to resubmit this to this subverse. Otherwise, please resubmit to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             /v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            , a subverse with much less strict submission rules. Thank you.
           </p>

            I'm also flairing this as
            <em>
             Unverified
            </em>
            per the above.

             So my own experiences can't be posted? How do you actually back up and source something like this. Do you need my DNA records? How about the volumes of paperwork through dhs they refuse to let me have? People want to hear our stories but when you have ops telling you not to post your story because it can't be verified? How about medical records attesting to extreme sexual abuse? What do I have to submit? I really don't understandundis at all.

              This is an investigative subverse, not an everything-goes subverse, the main focus of which is to collect evidence on organized child sex trafficking. As such, objectively verifiable sources are of the utmost importance, and the types of posts that haven't been or, due to their nature, cannot be sourced belong on different subverses. One such subverse that we're associated with is
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               /v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, we wholeheartedly welcome and encourage survivors coming forward on
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               /v/pizzagate
              </a>
              , if they can
              <em>
               somehow
              </em>
              verify their stories, or, alternatively, put themselves out there like
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ2WchHhGBXo7AF8z9lS5aA">
               Becki Percy
              </a>
              did. It is understandable if you, unlike her, don't want to use your real name and face with your testimony though, but in that case you will need to find another way to verify your story.
             </p>
             <p>
              I won't necessarily be able to tell you how
              <em>
               you
              </em>
              , in particular, could do that, since only you know what kind of objective facts you have in your possession. Medical records of extreme sexual abuse are actually a good example if you're comfortable sharing those (with your sensitive information blacked out). But it could be something else that backs at least one of your more substantial claims.
             </p>
             <p>
              If there is nothing you can think of that you could and would share, I would still encourage you to resubmit this, just do that on the right subverse is all I'm asking. Thank you.

            Thank you for your story.  I think you are an important witness.  Everything you wrote is significant, but the fact you met Johny Gosch is mindblowing to me and presumably many others.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know it is painful, but when you have time, could you draw or paint your memories of the SRA and the other abuse you described?  Somehow visual evidence cuts straight through to many people in a way mere words can't.  Drawings and paintings of remembered abuse help the pizzagate/pedogate message spread to the wider public.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please look after yourself and stay safe.  Also I wonder too if you still play music.

            Thank you for writing, and sharing. I feel for you, I can't tell how much. As a survivor, what can we, the good people of now, the good people of this world who want this to STOP, do to help ? We want to, we
            <em>
             need to
            </em>
            . What can we do best?

            I believe I may have met you on FB, if not I referred someone with close to your story, to come tell her story here because I believe we all can learn from victims like yourself. I pray that you have found some peace, and never let this define the person you are! Just stay strong and keep telling  your story!  There are plenty of us that believe you and stand behind you and all the others that don't have a voice!

            I am so sorry for what you've been through, and I thank you for sharing your story with us. Every time I read one of these SRA survivor stories (e.g. Fiona Barnett), I simply cannot help bursting into tears. I cannot even imagine what you must feel having actually gone through it. I'm not even sure what more I could say that would be helpful, just please remember that there are good people within this community who are continuing to investigate and raise awareness in whatever way possible. While the overwhelming majority of responses to this post have been quite supportive, please don't let the naysayers/non-believers get you down. I'm sure many people over the years have tried to "change your memories" by telling you that certain things didn't happen, for example, it's your "imagination", it was "just a dream", etc - just keep in mind that YOU know the truth, and there are those who genuinely care and want to help.

            Read your story and cried for a long time.  For you and for so many who you represent. For victims of these unspeakable acts that need your honest words. No greater power than living witness and you are. Courageous and not broken in everyone's eyes. Understood and am sure touched many hearts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wish you could know someday that there are good guys inside as well. Ones that have stood against abuse of power. Hope you meet heros someday that can restore this truth.

            As more and more witnesses and victims of this SRA come forward they are finding ways to move to healing.
In a sense, it may be somewhat like what you are saying, that you will heal yourself but as each one progresses it may help the others.
I think it's important for all to know that vast numbers of us are listening and trust that we will move officials to stop this insanity.
Children don't have a chance against these forces which count on the fact that children can't defend themselves.  And they count on the fact that children find it impossible to even describe what has happened to them at such young ages.
And when they are caught they can also count on higher up's protecting them.  They are immense cowards preying on kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems that so many therapists have now seen so many patients dealing with SRA that it has had to be accepted as reality.
That it is so way beyond what we have ever even thought we understood about pedophilia that it moves this abuse to a different plane.  Children must now be believed when they tell these stories.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you for letting us know what has happened to you and the reality of what has been going on.

            You sound just like me. I've always prayed to God not to let me remember, but i've asked for hints so i can know for sure (what my therapist insisted had happened to me, based on behavioral symptoms and interviews she did with my family) as well as what age the incest started. I was shown exactly when it started through a dream - i saw myself in a bassinet, with diapers thrown aside and my bottom all red. The day after that dream, I asked my mom if there was anything strange she could tell me about my being 6 months old, anything to do with my father? And she literally right off the bat described coming home and seeing the scene i just described from my dream. A few years ago i did some acid and that block between my past and now just disappeared, and memories started whizzing by me, through me, at a dizzying, completely uncontrolled pace. Some were happy, not many, most were of me just being in a world of grey depression wishing for death and acting out. But some were of what i can still only describe as the grossest thing ever, something i can't bring myself to say. I don't know how people deal with this if it's impossible to talk about, to acknowledge even to ourselves. But one thing i do believe is that God can heal all of this, it will just take time. I was inspired to write because you mentioned the cloud of hatred and fear that never made sense. I'm kind of experiencing that now. Pizzagate is cathartic, but it does bring up a lot of rage.

             God can and will heal you. Let the rage come. It is justice. It is cleansing. We should all be full of rage for every person who has suffered. But Vengeance is the Lord's. There will be a reckoning.

            You were dealt a very bad hand. Any of us could have been in your shoes had we been born into a den of lunatics. It's pure chance, not predestination. You did not deserve this, you should always know that. You deserve to be loved and you deserve to love yourself. If I were you I'd get a new identity so I didn't have to a live like a nomad. Thank you for telling your story. It doesn't own you, don't forget that.

            I am sorry to hear about what you went through.  Do you feel it had anything to do with Freemasonry/Illuminati?  Also, do you feel the the people involved were Luciferian in that they worship Lucifer?  I ask because people always mention Satan, but I believe it is Lucifer instead.

            Becki is an amazing young thing and maybe the OP would like to hook up with her?  She's a legend and incredible role model of the positivity that can come out of the darkeness into the light : )

            Thank you for sharing. It's so important for victims to know they have a safe place here to share so that they can educate more people and also for them to have the opportunity to talk about their experiences to aid in the life long healing process. I wish we could all go rip your abusers out of their lives and expose them to what they deserve.

            There's no statute of limitations on murder, regarding the dead girl you saw. There shouldn't be one on torture either. Pizzagaters, that's something we should do, change the law for victims of torture.

            It made me sick  and sad when I read your story.  Your story is what I think of when you hear of all these children being with abusers and Satanists. The children that feel hopeless and in despair.  Not knowing any other normal.  Then there are kids like you that you can abuse them relentlessly, but never break their spirit or their desire to continue to live.  I hope you continue to use this strength to put down all these bastards by helping other children make it out of this hell. Stay tough and strong.

            Gentle hugs to you, and thank you for sharing your story with us. We know who we're fighting for but it's so important for the victims to have a safe place to get support. When the truth comes out, there will be many more victims coming forward and you will be needed more than ever-- for guidance, insight, and inspiration to them as well as to those who at this moment have no idea about any of this.

            Friends, please hear me. That we are investigating all of this, and understand what a victim of RSA must go though, when a person who's experienced it rocks up and tells us
            <em>
             what it's actually like
            </em>
            , please, please let us be easy on them.
           </p>
           <p>
            That people question their authenticity when it's possibly the first time they've expressed what happened to them, isn't maybe the best approach.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please, please let this place be a place of peace and understanding, and a place all people who have had experiences like this, feel safe.
           </p>
           <p>
            It makes us all stronger. Together.

             I disagree. Something of this nature should not be taken seriously until authenticated in some way.

            Thank you for sharing.  If you can find meaning in all of your suffering that may be the best way to redeem the wrong. This community and the overall awareness being raised may be an outlet for you to create more and more meaning from such evil imposed on you. As a community, we stand against your abusers and the evil that they subscribe to.  You are a valuable human being.

            I wish it was rpg. This is my life. I have nothing but my experiences. I told a whopper once. It has shamed me for life, now I speak only the truth , if I can't tell the truth than I keep my silence but I refuse to have a liars tounge. But I get it .. I do. Even repeating my story I am able to disassociate from it, a knack of a survival skill. It almost seems like I'm talking about someone else at times.

            The grit required to survive thru all that is amazing. I'm sure there is pain that I'll never understand, but know this: I'm glad that you're still here. And I look up to you for having the grit to keep going.
           </p>
           <p>
            You are not alone. Many go thru such trauma. It has been happening since the beginning, generation after generation. As long as bad people can hide the bad things that they do, it will continue. The only way that it stops is by shining a light on it, by exposing it. By telling us your story, you have shone light on it. This could be the last generation that goes thru what you went thru - because you and people like you speak up. I look forward to the day when bad people are exposed for what they are, and the next generation of children can live the life as they should.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you. I'm just some nobody on the internet, but you have my utmost respect. I'm sure it wasn't easy to write that, but the more people know, the better chance of all this hitting the critical mass necessary to keep rolling on it's own.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep going. Survive. Keep working thru it. Thrive.

            Thank you. I believe in god, but not religion. Institutionalized religion is a tool of the masses, I was raised Catholic so.. There's that..

             I was raised catholic too but didn't actually become catholic until I was 21....evil people, some priests/bishops included, subvert it and use it for their own disgusting aims. But there is so much truth and healing in the body of Jesus in the Eucharist. I still am healing (not from anything close to what you've endured) and the greatest peace I've ever experienced is sitting silently in an adoration chapel.
I'm encouraged to know after all you've been through you still believe in God. I've tried to understand so many times why he'd let kids suffer the way you have. Thanks for continuing to fight and for sharing your story on here &lt;3

             I just have to say WOW at your amazing understanding! I totally understand what you are saying. It is very hard for me to explain this but I will try. It is this religion that does this to people. I saw immediately when you said you were raised Catholic where the opening to satan came from in your life for this torment to take place. It is so sad to see this happen to people and it just causes me such sorrow. I'm glad you found your way to God!!! And not religion. This is our real answer to stopping all this.

             you're right. today, being spiritual is the opposite of Institutionalized religion, especially when being a pedo is part of the job description. they're demons, one way or another.

              "Being spiritual" in many cases (not all), is just another way that people claim to be their own popes, and for some non-Christian faiths, there is no idea of god per-se...just a self satisfying way to be a "spiritual" atheist.  Painting so many people with such a broad brush as you have is the worst symptom of self righteous pride.

              Not really, it's false teaching that enslaves people, organized or not.  Orthodox Christian teachings are freedom for me...brought healing and wholeness.  However, there's also the realization of depths of evil within the world...so yeah the red pill part of it isn't what most people care to learn.

Myself included, No child deserves what was done to you. And there are so many nameless victims out there, I stay up at night worrying about them. I can't believe you you made it out. Thank god really! You are clearly a very strong and special person. Be careful and stay vigilant , you have been able to  stay one step ahead of these evil people. Don't give up, I believe your story.many will believe you here.  I myself will keep you in my prayers, and I will not forget. thank you so much for sharing this, ! Wow it's baffling and a miracle....the darkness could not win. I pray you see justice served one day, in the meanwhile please be good to yourself and know we here are so grateful you survived.  We care and we cry for the children everyday, none of them deserve it. Thank you again.

             A thousand times I'd upvote what forget menot said.  I cry at least once a week for the children and pray everyday throughout the day for them.  My heart is broken and my life has not been the same since October.  Learning the horrible truth has affected me greatly.  I cannot find peace nor can I get much accomplished until the evil predators are brought to justice or at LEAST investigated for a start.

              I found peace through my faith. Somehow in  some impossible way these children reawakened my faith. It's true that out of chaos and darkness god made light. At least for me it's what helps me to find peace and some sort of sanity.

            I am very sorry you were robbed of your childhood and in turn the horrific things you had to endure. Thank you for sharing your story. I hope more people feel comfortable coming forward, and are able to find solace with others who have survived, and too from those like us who are here to help however we can. May you find peace in your heart.

             I remember him . very well. It wasn't just him though and he never abused me himself that I can recall. He was one of the teens that used to take us back to the man at the armory.  It would have been Waterloo Iowa, my memories that I can confirm were around 83-84.

              Probably you have read Noreen Gosch's account of the kidnapping and that one of the local police officers let her know that the local police were told to "stand down" at the time of her son's kidnapping.
Years later, she discovered that her husband was involved in some way in setting up their son's kidnapping.
Another MKULTRA victim Paul Bonacci asked his lawyer to let Noreen Gosch know that he was forced to take part in the kidnapping in luring her son into a car.  Wasn't the first time that Bonacci was forced to do this and he says that the kids were usually immediately put to sleep/drugged.

               https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Paul+Bonacci
              </a>
              Also Noreen Gosch later related that her son did visit her on one occasion and discussed some of what had been happening to him.  Don't know if she revealed it all.
Not sure if Noreen Gosch is still alive but she has done more on this issue than anyone else.
Noreen Gosch and the Discovery:  Years ago one of our regular PreventingAbuseConference speakers,  Noreen Gosch, mother of kidnapping victim Johnny Gosch discovered her son was abducted by a national pedophile ring (30 years ago). A few years back she uncovered a massive Internet pornography network resulting in hundreds of arrests.    Below is a statement from her:
              <br/>
              **
"Human trafficking is fanned by the flames of "pornography".  The internet has made it easy for these perverted individuals to view [pornography] .... all types and soon that isn't enough to achieve their thrills, they must move on to something else which is often violating a child.   Addiction to [pornography] is the breeding ground for "human trafficking, murder and torture of young innocent victims."
             </p>
             <p>
              Noreen Gosch, 3-17-11 
**
              <a href="http://johnnygosch.com/">
               http://johnnygosch.com/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              Very much agree with that analysis of pornography.
For women, it is certainly pornography qualifying as propaganda against females - to demean and degrade them -- and to encourage violence against them.
We are also seeing the effect this violent and degrading porn has on the minds of men as they become addicted to it.
The result is a world changing loss of their family, friends, work.

              I think Gosch's Mom lives in W. Des Moines. I have an acquaintance in Des Moines who's a cop and he knows the Mom's version of the story pretty well. He said the kidnapping of her son drove her pretty crazy or hysterical. Small world.

              Wow unreal.  I'm familiar with that area from relatives.  This saddens me to hear.  I'm sorry for your pain, and all I would say is that you can beat this by turning to the one who has loved you from before you were born.

            My story is similar to yours. I started remembering at about 34 years of age. The memories started coming to me as if they were a dream, or quick flashbacks that made me shake my head and wonder what the hell was that all about. Then they started coming faster and I basically had a major meltdown. I believe I was programmed to act in a very self destructive manner if I started remembering, because I put myself in many very dangerous situations. Ugh.. can't get too deep into it, but yes, I understand what you are describing.

             I forgot that I had posted this here. Just decided to check it today. I was sexually traumatized at a very young age, or possibly from birth, but I don't have memories earlier than about 4 years of age. My first memories started flooding in when I stepped into a bath tub of nice hot water, intending to relax. I ignored it, thinking I was just really tired from work. But when I sat down into the tub, the memories hit me like a tidal wave and I felt the most horrible despair and anguish wash over me. I wanted to die. I had no clue what was going on, there wasn't anyone to talk to. Suddenly, I was that terrified child again, I struggled to function at my job, I struggled to function in friendships and I failed miserably. I went to lunch one day from work, and couldn't go back. My supervisor called me to ask what the hell happened, since I had been a model employee for 5 years. I went on in some kind of gibberish that made no sense and said I was just burned out. He told me to get off of whatever drugs I was doing and get myself straightened up. I wasn't on drugs. The next few years were a nightmare. I lost many friends. They all said I was having a midlife crisis and abandoned me. I was very attractive, and extremely cunning, I knew how to make men fall all over themselves doing what I wanted, which made me think I was the one in control. I wasn't. I realized later that I had been programmed to please men. My biological father was the programmer. He and my mother divorced when I was about 6 years old, and then my mother brought in a man that continued the programming. I have many blank years, that I don't remember at all. I don't know why, but if anyone asks me now (at 58 years old) anything about my childhood, I seem to think everything happened when I was 12 or 13. Apparently, there's some kind of programming associated with that, because everything couldn't have happened at 12 or 13? Either way, it's horrible, what they do to people. I got married at the age of 18 to a very cruel man that I realize now had somehow obtained me via my family. I didn't even realize what was going on, or why I was marrying him, I just did it because I was told to. I didn't realize until after we divorced, that it was weird right from the start. I was married to him for 13 years. I gained my independence, thought I had the world by the ass, I had a job I loved, and for the next 3 years, I was so happy. Then I stuck my foot into a bathtub of hot water and it was all over, that damn fast. My thoughts, my life, my memories are fragmented, and I prefer to be alone, with just my dogs. My dogs are the only thing that makes me feel safe. I pray daily that someone will make this abuse of children stop. I voted for Trump because I felt he would start moving things in the right direction. Every day, I cry, knowing that even as I type this, at any given moment throughout the day and night, children are suffering, and living in a hell on earth. My heart goes out to them. I wish I could help them. I will add, I do not doubt the validity of the Hampstead Children's stories at all. I see the defeat on their faces in the final interviews, where they are saying they made it up. I know that numbness that takes over when you thought there was hope, and now it's gone.

             Interestingly, that's the same age my mother remembered her abuse, however I don't think hers had anything to do with pizzagate but more to do with having a psychopath as a father.

              I remember in a senior level psychology class I had, a fellow student wrote about her childhood with a schizophrenic mother.  Quite horrifying in the insanity of physical and emotional abuse and neglect (no SRA).  I think it was her, or perhaps some related info, that mentioned how some memories start coming back later, (after 30?)...the accounts here support that.

              The father could have been involved.  If often happens, such as in the David Shurter case.

             I've had flashbacks for as long as I can remember.  Lately though, my memories seem to be in high definition and full living color. I won't even mean to but sometimes just the smell of something can put me back to being that scared kid again. I had tried for so long to forget and push it all out of my mind, at least until I was ready. And you are never really ready are you? Its not like I haven't told my story time after time. I've had a plethora of therapy. But its a lot different when experiencing it again in your mind. I have to remind myself it wasn't my fault and there is nothing I could have done other than tell. Just can't get past the thought maybe I could have done more, remembered names. I barely remember faces sometimes but then it will just hit me like a ton of bricks during a triggering episode.

              I want to say, your column was very meaningful to me.  So sorry it was removed.  Was it the comments about the George kid or something else?  I didn't understand. You have a voice, keep writing, I want to hear you again.
It got me worked up enough to begin writing myself, for the first time on this crap we have lived with.  I'm so relieved that RSA is a known and almost accepted reality.  When I first began to see my own abuse in that light, I could find no online support.  One website was focused that way but inactive.  Now we are being heard.  That's a big big change in about five years.

            How could you have been born out of incest during a ritual, but your mother not know your father was involving you in the occult?  And why wouldn't she believe you if similar things happened to her?

             My mom was 17 and a partier. Our family was always partying together. My father, her 1st cousin got some acid. I guess it doesn't matter who you are screwing if the walls are bleeding. Lots of drugs.. Lots..

             It took me a long time. I fasted and didn't sleep for 3 days straight. When my body became exhausted my mind had this clarity. I can't explain it. I barely slept for an entire week because everytime I closed my eyes the images would come back. Now I just make sure in completely exhausted before bed and wake up super early to disrupt any dreams that might come..

              I know a trick that
              <em>
               might
              </em>
              help with your trauma. Now, I didn't deal with anything even remotely close to what you dealt with, so no guarantees. I just had a simple motorbike accident, no long term trauma like you.
             </p>
             <p>
              Well, one night, I decided to let the images do what they do, didn't try stopping them. What happens is, after a short while, everything starts playing really fast and extremely loud until it sounds like a death metal drummer is playing his bass drum next to your head. That part is what I assume scares most people, I don't know, but try letting it wash over you however scary and loud it gets. At the end, it just pops like a balloon and you're back in the real world, relieved and crying a little. Also, focusing hard on the images might help getting your mind off the fear.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, I've never had long term trauma, so not sure if it'll work but it's worth a try. Unless you get super freaked out and start doing drugs or something. Then, sorry.

            Very sorry you had to go through this, and so many others. Hope you find  a good therapist. People are awake to these motherfuckers, and they are pissed off, and we are growing by the day. It's only been 4-5 months since pizzagate broke open, in a year I can only imagine the outrage. Hopefully this can bring down the entire 3000 year old Satanic Illuminati quest for a New World Order, hopefully Jesus will help us out.

            Thank you for telling your story

            Since you lived in iowa... not sure if you have heard of   With One Accord Ministries?  Bill Schoebelen?  He does ministry with  people who have been involved in satanic ritual abuse.  Said in one video that he gets about 50 calls a week.
           </p>
           <p>
            His books are amazing.
           </p>
           <p>
            To find him on youtube, search  prophecy club  - bill schoebelen (if I am spelling his name right).
           </p>
           <p>
            His lectures are a time commitment but he outlines his experience in satanist, explains the hierarchy and his website has specific prayers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Healing can happen - sometimes in fits and starts and sometimes all at once.  Just depends.

             I left Iowa at 18, didn't go back for 15 years. When I did, I got trapped for a few more but there is no way I would step foot back in that state if you paid me to.
