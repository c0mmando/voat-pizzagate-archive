<p><strong>Anthony Mangione</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mangione ran ICE\'s South Florida office from 2007 to 2011, a job that included numerous child porn investigations and oversaw 450 federal employees. Anthony Mangione, the local chief of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, had become what he was sworn to hunt down.</p>
<p>Using two screen names, BookStoreMomNC would e-mail child pornography emails of children between the ages of 3 and 15 and describe how she would spank her daughters, Hannah and Rachel. Oldrmom111 graphically detailed in an online chat how she forced her daughters, Melissa and Marissa, to engage in increasingly vile sex acts.</p>
<p>While the married father of three helped lead the local fight against child pornography, he was sending illicit images to a former school bus driver in Delaware who would be busted with a vast collection of child pornography, court records show. Federal authorities in Delaware said they not only found more than 700 pieces of child pornography on the computers of David Osborn, but also 500 Internet chat logs he had with &quot;others regarding child sexual exploitation.&quot;</p>
<p>He cut a deal with federal prosecutors in July that will require him to spend at least five years in prison. U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra could sentence him to up to 20 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>America Online, detected child pornography was being sent from one of his accounts and sent a cybertip to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children. With his plea he admitted using two different e-mail handles, BookStoreMomNC and MntnMama34, to send 16 emails containing child pornography to a single e-mail address — Rampantlion1314.</p>
<p>Rampantlion1314 was Osborn, 40, who not only had worked as a school bus driver, but as a substitute teacher and had been involved with a youth organization for girls, according to federal authorities in Delaware. Osborn, of New Castle, Del., told federal agents that he left the youth group after he was accused of being &quot;a pervert,&quot; according to court records.</p>
<p>Police reports indicate Osborn also had been investigating for sexually harassing a 14-year-old girl on Facebook.</p>
