<p>Yes, some of what they do and create is controversial and it\'s likely meant to get that response. I assume a lot of it is venting from frustrations at being discriminated against for being gay or tranny or trans or what have you, but I think a lot of it is also from being pigeonholed as &quot;evil&quot; by Christian zealots for much of their life, and lashing out at that by trying hard to come across as anti-christian as possible.</p>
<p>I can relate to some of that, not from being gay but from being harangued and proselytized to by Christians. I can relate simply through being raised as a humanist freethinker and a fairly leftist-liberal, tolerant one at that. Many of my views now are embarrassingly far right and I won\'t espouse them here, but I will relate (and have, vehemently, in several comments) that for PG to become dominated by a solely, staunchly Christian rhetoric will serve it more harm than good.</p>
<p>That being said as background to my thoughts, I can relate that the last thing I want to do is squash or incriminate some (probably poverse) DC acolyte of modern art-pop frenzy just for flying with the crowd.</p>
<p>And as concerns DC-area art-pop, I think it\'s sort of a new Enlightenment, more like a kind of hillbilly stab at one. You have these open-minded people who move to DC and they\'re surrounded with the architecture and the symbolism of the founding fathers and the maintainers of the FF\'s legacies, and much of it is Masonic which has been attacked for decades as &quot;Satanist&quot;, even though it is not.</p>
<p>In that environment, and given the right chemistry of harmful upbringing and wrongful treatment at the hands of overzealous Christians, I can see how a lot of this symbolism and reactionary &quot;okay yeah I\'m Satanist, here you go!&quot; makes its way into their artworks and therefore why this is so prevalent in the DC art-pop scene.</p>
<p>None of which is incriminatory in and of itself.</p>
<p>However, I do realize that if we follow these artists one to the next and pay attention to what they\'re doing in their life BESIDES making creepy reactionary art, then we CAN find some more evidence. I just don\'t want to burn the bridges along the way.</p>
<p>I\'m sorry that I haven\'t provided a link to &quot;cite&quot; as per the rules, which I don\'t 100% perfectly agree with, but if I provided a link to an innocent DC-area person\'s facebook or whatever, then I\'m drawing attention to somebody I <em>don\'t</em> want to draw attention to because thorough searching of their social media has revealed no signs of child abuse or interests in children.</p>
<p>I can say this, you can check out the facebook of the &quot;Black Cat&quot; bar in DC and find plenty of strange artists who hold similar to such as Sasha Lord\'s sense of aesthetic. </p>

            Ultimately this is a spiritual battle. Those artists who are atheist and rebel against God and religion in their work by using satanism or other morally reprehensible imagery are doing nothing to further humanity. They should be called out in the very least as bad artists. Satanism is anti-human. Art in its best forms uplift the human spirit and shows the strengths of humankind. It transcends the mundane and the perverse and seperates us from the animals. Humans are not animals. The artists that we have seen through pizzagate like abramovic, Djurdjevic, majestic ape, arrington de dionyso and others always de-humanize and often use animal imagery combined with human to try and strip away the unique and beautiful human spirit. They see us as nothing more than another species of animal which sets forth the moral argument that it's ok to abort a 36 week old baby, to kill grandma, and in the case of these sickos rape and kill children.
