            oh my God, Scalia was NOT a pedophile. you guys need to quit with the stupidity. This IS a serious investigation, Scalia was a good man and that pedo story from long ago was NOT true. Stick with the real research and Pizzagate is REAL but lets keep it real and stop with conspiracy.  The conspiracy with Scalia's death is that he was the ONE judge that kept the left from getting the last part of the NWO agenda from being implemented. in the Wiki Docs, the "wetworks" email was DAYS before he died. they had planned to kill him and most likely had to do with his decision on one of the many cases coming down the pike for Obama. Probably Immigration, Abortion or the TPP. so good grief. you cannot go around accusing the whole world of pedophilia, you have to be carful with that. otherwise you compromise the investigation. These people need to be brought to justice and this bullshit is exactly why no-one is going to take this seriously.

             Hey I was a big fan of Scalia too but you really can't trust anyone these days. The same argument you posit is the same argument people posited in the Franklin Scandal that got one victim jail time even longer than the man committing the atrocities on the children, Larry King. They all seemed like saints and such great people. So did the countless priests in the Catholic church that have been found to commit Satanic Ritual Abuse against countless children. Every one of them gained the trust of the community b/c they seemed like such good men.
            </p>
            <p>
             So yea, you've got a lot to catch up on. IF Scalia was murdered, WHY in the world would his family not want an autopsy? This goes against all protocol for such an extremely high positioned person. How did they arrive at the decision of death by natural causes? They didn't even attempt an autopsy and there has to be a reason why the family was COMPLICIT with not wanting one.
            </p>
            <p>
             So you have to ask yourself, IF he was murdered why would the family be complicit with not wanting an autopsy on one of them most powerful people in the US when he died in some mysterious circumstances in some far off remote place without his security detail team while Freemasons just so happened to be occupying the lodge with him. A very strange set of circumstances that no LOGICAL or REASONABLE family member would agree to unless THEY know something so damaging, so embarrassing about their beloved relative, that if they were to do an autopsy and it came up that he was likely suffocated by a pillow (asphyxiation) or had trace elements of chemicals in his bloodstream, then the whole world would investigate and possibly uncover that he was connected to this Sterling Allan guy where the blackmail originated in the first place, which allowed the other people who were connected to this 70,000 person Europol Pedophilia investigation to get rid of him b/c he was a danger to them as well.

             I didn't accuse him of pedophilia. Whoever made this in february, well before even a whiff of pizzagate, did. Being a pedo wasn't the accusation du jour yet so... what's the motivation here?

            We have eye-witness testimony from people he abused and reports dating from the time of Scalia's death, so long before people were talking about fake news or pizzagate. That's a pretty good case.

             Good question.  This article doesn't seem to provide credible sources to back its claims.  Need our sources to be as solid as possible.

            Being familiar with west Texas, I can't imagine why anyone would be paying $500 for a room in a place out there, 100mi from the Mexican border. Strange unless you are paying for privacy.

Edit: perhaps a boy strong enough to smother a large drugged man with a pillow at someone's suggestion.

            The really sad part about me researching this topic is that it led me to an online "Live chatroom" of other pedophiles and sexually abused hodge-podge of people.... they have been posting pictures of underage girls in sexually suggestive positions.... I really don't know what to do... another guy posted a video of ISIS burning alive 2 Turkish soldiers... is there a way to report this link?

               If you just linked to cp, you're breaking the law, you're breaking rule number one of this sub, and you're going to get this sub banned. Delete the fucking link if that's what it is.

                 Here's the really sad part...none of us knows where to actually report CP.  There isn't a known hotline you call to report seeing it. You'd think that may be kinda important if anyone in positions of power actually cared. I'd go to your local PD (if you feel they are trustworthy) and ask if you need to file a report. I seriously doubt anyone ever does that so it'd be interesting the steps they take or if they even have procedures in place.

                  I honestly don't know who to trust anymore... I've done so much research the last 168 hours and I've found 1 over-riding quality about Pedos and their handlers/bundlers that are often times women who pretend to be the "good person" but really it's a deceitful trick like Epstein's girlfriend.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also the people who are often the most culpable are priests or someone in good standing in the community that no one would ever believe b/c they are literally "the nicest" fucking person... If you watch Sterling Allan, the guy connected to Scalia's death, he was on Georg Noory's Coast to Coast like a million fucking times and EVERYONE thought this guy was legit and he even sounds reassuring in his youtube videos but he turns out to be a satanist fucking piece of shit.

                      You imbecile, since your reading comprehension is that of a 3rd grader you'd see that I wasn't sure if it was CP b/c I stated that it was Jimmy Comet style posts.... what I was sure of is that these people might be connected in some way b/c of their live conversations where they spoke about sadistic fantasies and were using code words similar to pizzagate.

                      Another VOAT article
                      <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1515874">
                       here
                      </a>
                      linked to an article in Tampa Times that caught a Pedophile ring and it described that the ring used "Live Chat Relay" systems such as Yahoo to communicate and I stumbled across something that might have fit the description and I wanted others to investigate and see b/c there could be a chance we catch them planning or plotting as well as reveal something about their network or identities but you are so mentally slow you can't see this or my explanations in other replies where I clearly state I don't know if it's CP b/c they are Comet Ping Pong instagram style posts.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      So since you clearly have no self-control of your emotion and can barely comprehend anything, try to read this post carefully b/c you need to be banned for screaming for me to banned based off false premonitions.

                   Well, from what you described, you may have broken rule number one of this sub. Which means you don't get to complain about someone being an asshole about it.

                   Don't be a fucking idiot, and make sure to use common sense. That is another way to describe rule number one.

                  Yes I already deleted it. But I don't know if it's actually CP material, the people are chatting about it (in a Jimmy Comet kind of way where they use jokes instead of explicitly talking about it) all the time though and the only photo I saw could potentially be (I don't know for 100% as it doesn't show faces).... what the fuck else am I supposed to do with the link? Email my local police office?

                   This is what you do: stop trying to find CP. that is not how you're going to take down the elites. If you're capable of finding it, so are the authorities - you've got no business looking for it. That's not what this sub is about.

                    For fuck's sake... I wasn't searching for CP. I was actually searching for "Scalia satanic ritual deaths" and how he was linked to Sterling Allan and that website came up b/c it had something linked to those two in their forums.

                      Look, you accused me for searching it... I stated several times that's not how I found that website and I don't know if they're actually promoting it, but it appears it could have ties.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And I wasn't posting anything directly with CP as there are no photos on the website but they post some Jimmy Comet type of photos all the time which isn't CP... So again don't accuse me of searching for CP you asshole.

                        I don't know if I actually broke #1 and I don't think I did, but I deleted it just in case it did b/c you went nuclear (there were no naked photos, but again it was Comet Ping Pong type where the children are in suggestive positions and what not).... so again, you're being an asshole by "accusing me of searching for CP"... think about what you actually say before you make a false accusation b/c your accusation is way worse than what I'm trying to expose.

                          I'm not going to argue about this; you specifically said "stop searching for CP".... my point is that I didn't find that link by GOOGLING CP... I found it by googling for Scalia and satanic ritual abuse... that's not victimizing myself, it's correctly pointing out that you're making a pretty damning accusation which could paint me in a very dark light if read incorrectly.

            I've read this same exact article already before you posted it (and many more). According to the claim, Scalia was involved with the Pedophilia ring and the Obama admin had blackmail on him for it, so they murdered him by smothering him with a pillow.
           </p>
           <p>
            It all relates to the bust of the 70,000 worldwide pedophile ring and how Scalia's is linked with compromising photos on the computer of the computer wiz guy (Sterling Allan, who thought he was God in the flesh and admits to committing pedophilia) that allowed the global users to remain anonymous:

             Interesting that you post that article from "Veterans Today". The OP's article involved a "Veterans Day online magazine", which I couldn't find a website for. That article you posted also didn't provide any evidence for any of the claims it made.

              Actually he does cite a source - FBI Special Agent Ross. The veracity of this rests on the author's integrity... you can follow up with Gordon:

              And the now jailed Allan is a well known case... you can watch his youtube video that I provided in the link above where he admits to committing pedophilia and claims to be god I think around the 20 min mark.

               If you want to fully understand the satanic depravity associated with this including Huberatis research the 9th circle satanic elite. Research Dr. Anthony Kidman yes that is right Nicole Kidmans father a high society secret club member physician in Australia. Was facing horrendous charges involving satanic child rape murder and the hunting of children for sport. He fled the country and just happened to die suddenly in a Singapore hotel room. Who knows if Scalia was blackmailed except he was called to whitehouse prior to trip to Texas. Unheard of... left with files allegedly. Goes to secret meeting found dead. No autopsy investigation, where is security detail? Who was with him? President refuses to attend funeral...unheard of? Podestas mention coded words prior to death and around same time also mention the new recommendation for Hilary Supreme Court. Not a democrat even...alleged Republican from whereelse Texas? Why his background of being lawyer for leader of Scientology Church leader against heinous crimes? Scientology hollywoods religion holds their secrets "open secrets" movie about satanic pedophiles controlling Hollywood. Think they are not related? Why would Podesta want former judge who helped Scientology leader Miscavige get off of heinous crimes. Do you research. It is all connected. Democrats, whitehouse occupants past and present, rebulicans, CIA, judges, clergy(Vatican), Contries=Saudi etc.

                I've read the personal accounts of the child that Anthony Kidman abused and sexually assaulted in front of Nicole Kidman as she watched and smirked as if the child deserved it... And I've looked into the 9th Circle already... The Royal Family, the Vatican, the Belgian Royals, US elites.... everyone's in on it except for Putin maybe.... which explains the antagony the Western corrupt MSM has for him - b/c he's obviously not a globalist scumbag.... the pedohpilia ring is all related to Globalism and creating a 1 world government.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is WAY worse than we will ever admit - they've corrupted the 3 pillars/institutions of society and claim authority over us: lawyers, priests, and bankers
               </p>
               <p>
                The problem with exposing this entire elite circle of Satanists that practice Satanic Ritual Abuse is that it will mean the end of "this world order".... which brings George H.W. Bush's comment of "New World Order" into focus. And yes of course it's all connected my friend -  that's the glue that holds these people together.

                Asking for sources when people make claims that you have never heard of before is a very old timey tradition. Probably almost as old as the concept of making statements. Since you are apparently going to vaguely accuse me of being a shill (?), I'm going to just assume you can't point to anything other than this singular woman's claims.

                  I'm too busy laughing at the sources that you have refused to provide to back up your apparently well-known claim to be joking with you. How hard is it to post a single link in almost a week to something that is so supposedly well-known?

                      Yes, yes, asking for you to back up your statements with corroboration is TOTALLY baiting you into...backing up your statements. You're absolutely correct.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      People like you are the reason that no one in the general public takes subjects like this seriously and dismisses them out of hand. When asked for proof of your statements you act like an asshole and start engaging in strawman tactics, accusing me of trying to bait you into something when all I am asking you to do is provide corroboration of your claim. You're obviously too immature to be looking into this type of matter. Either quit making statements that you can't back up, back your statements up, or shut the fuck up.

                        I'll make it easy for you: How about a claim from someone that DOESN'T have a mental disorder, like Kim Noble? Or maybe someone that hasn't accused nearly every person in Hollywood or politics in the world of being a pedophile.

                         well that took an odd turn... I'll look into that also. Thanks for the tip! Also, Kim Noble is only one of the names she paints under. Not... not that I expected you to know that.

                          I have been asking you for a link to any source about Billy Graham being a "confirmed pervo" or whatever the fuck you said he was. Your only half assed attempt at a legitimate response included:
                         </p>
                         <blockquote>
                          <p>
                           Do I need a FOX "news" report on the life and times of Kim Noble or something?
                          </p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p>
                          So when you say this, the obvious thought process, when all I have been asking for is a link involving Billy Graham, is that there is a link to Kim Noble and Billy Graham. So linking them was your gimmick, not mine.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          At this point, you can GFY. Your trolling tactics are tired.

              I'm inclined to believe the Scalia thing, because I remember a story where he made some hyper sexualized remarks in some sort of setting where it was extremely inappropriate.

               He was a judge, he can keep things squeaky clean. A judge is a dangerous person to go after. He may have just played his cards right until suddenly his hand was beat and he got knocked out of the game.
