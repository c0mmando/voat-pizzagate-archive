            Canada is a protector of pedophiles. Those in high positions in government in England for example, are often given posts in Canada, while waiting for the heat to die down. Very very seldom is a politician ever accused or arrested in Canada. The RCMP are not only complaisant but often involved. The Pickton farm is a prime example of collusion between the RCMP, government and sex offenders. Giustra is a King in Canada for a reason

            I have seen exactly the same thing happen. Someone, or some organization (three letter?) has the power to keep this stuff even from the internet, although I'm sure there's nothing they can do if people archive the information and post its content to Voat.

            You can make non relevant posts about politics with ease pretty much. But if you desire to stay on the topic of child abuse you will be rigorously judged and subject to deletion. Simply making reference to this fact will also get your post deleted so don't be surprised if Falcon deletes this one.

              Can I post the documentary now with the witnesses telling about how they were tortured and murdered by the Catholics in Canada without you deleting it? So far you have deleted it when it gets posted. According to you its not "relevant."

             Thanks. I didn't learn how to archive.
            </p>

             The   elementary school teacher has locals talking.  I wish I could archive this too.

             The sick part is that the school teacher new where to target -- Brocket is a native Indian Aboriginal school on a local Indian Reserve called  Piikani Nation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Did the perp think that he'd get away with it  in a location that already has a high sexual abuse crime rate?
            </p>
            <p>
             Did he think that befriending the parents of that Indian Reserve would make it easier if he were caught?
            </p>
            <p>
             Many people on Indian Reserves might turn the other way when children are molested by their own community, but this white dude is lucky his balls are still left on.
