Somehow he linked that with the cannibalism of children. Not sure how that fits together, but this is his astonishing statement:

            The organ trafficking over there is rampant.  Horrid.  I would not be surprised what they would make the people in their country live with.  It's not the people  that would demand it, it's the Bleeping Govt. elites.  Just like over here.  We have it going on here in Pedowood.   Pretty soon they will legalize it like prostitution.   They will say they have a right to sex with whoever they want too.  These perverted immoral bottom scum of the barrel will stoop as low as possible.  They probably already have the babies.
