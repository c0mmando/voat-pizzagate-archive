<p>One point catched my eyes - there is a great number of missing children in Sweden (1000). I do not want to draw undue conclusions, which might be wrong at all, but I searched for &quot;Clinton foundation Sweden&quot; and found an article which includes a wikileaks eMail regarding the Sweden-connection. One of the main donors to Clinton is the swedish lottery. Article about Clinton Foundation and Sweden. (<a href="http://theindicter.com/swedens-business-with-clinton-foundation-in-a-geopolitical-context/">http://theindicter.com/swedens-business-with-clinton-foundation-in-a-geopolitical-context/)</a>)</p>
<p>This lottery is a major donor for many children-aid-projects worldwide. <a href="http://www.postkodstiftelsen.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Annual-report-2015.pdf">Annual report of donations to organisations from swedish lottery</a> E.g. they support &quot;Insamlingsstiftelsen 100%
Give orphaned children affected by war a safe upbringing&quot;. Maybe, and I hope dearly that is all good and well. In that case: great, swedish lottery! </p>
<p>I am not a native speaker in english and do not speak a single word swedish. I am not very well informed about US-political institutions and here I am more or less just a lurker, but wanted to share this, because it came to my mind and that I have not heard anything else from these missing children in Europe from last year. Nothing. Nada. Niente. This makes me sad. As you can read in the reports I linked, UK is as well mentioned, and Italy. But I think it happened in most of the target-countries of those poor children. Awful. </p>
<p>If that has been discussed already - sorry and please delete my post.</p>',
