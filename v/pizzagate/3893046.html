<p>EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J. — The Monday deaths of three members of the same family have been ruled accidental drownings, New Jersey’s Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office confirmed late Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The victims have been identified as Bharat Patel, 62, his 33-year old daughter-in-law Nisha Patel and her 8-year-old daughter, who was unnamed, NJ.com reported.</p>
<p>UPDATE: We‘re back in East Brunswick where a 32 yo mother, her 8 yo daughter, and another relative (a 62 yo man), died in the backyard pool Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>According to neighbors, the family had just moved in and gotten the pool serviced. They were excited to use it </p>
<p>According to neighbors, all three family members moved into the Clearview Road home recently, and a pool company had been on site in recent weeks to prepare the property’s above-ground pool for use, the media company reported.</p>
<p>A neighbor who heard screaming from the residence just after 4 p.m. Monday called police.</p>
<p>Although the prosecutor’s office ruled the deaths accidental drownings, WPVI reported authorities have contacted an electrical contractor to investigate the scene because they believe an electrical issue in or near the pool could have contributed to the deaths.</p>
<p>East Brunswick Police Lt. Frank Sutter said at a Monday afternoon press conference that all three victims died at the scene.</p>
<p>“We believe the mother was calling for help from inside the pool,” Sutter said.</p>
<p>East Brunswick Mayor Brad Cohen said in a statement provided to NJ.com: “The entire East Brunswick community is shocked and saddened to learn of the three deaths yesterday in Frost section of the township. Our condolences go out to the family and may they find strength from the community that shares in their grief.”</p>

            I've looked over this and so far, due to a lack of details about the occupation(s) of the deceased and the commonality of the Patel surname and Nisha/Bharat given names, I can't verify that the Bharat Patel in question is the Bharat Patel who died.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly enough, there
            <em>
             is
            </em>
            a
            <a href="https://archive.is/bGJaz">
             Nisha Patel who work(s/ed) at Amneal Pharmaceuticals from 2009 - present
            </a>
            and a
            <a href="https://archive.is/jHwIF">
             Bharat Patel who work(s/ed) at Amneal Pharmaceuticals from 2012 - present
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            However, given the aformentioned commonality of names and despite that both attended Gujarat University and that the years of graduation/employment are reasonably consistent with Nisha's age of 32/33, there is no guarantee that these are the deceased persons.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>

            appear to be the
            <a href="https://archive.is/HVw5h">
             Bharat Patel who once worked for Teva Pharma from 1988 - 1990 and has been engaged in volunteer work for the Clinton Foundation-associated Ekal Vidyalaya from 2000 - present
            </a>
            , or the
            <a href="https://archive.is/X5DIV">
             Nisha Patel who
             <em>

             worked at Teva Pharma from 2000 - present and whose years of education/employment
             <em>
              do not match appropriately
             </em>
             with that of the deceased 32/33 year old Nisha Patel

             possible
            </em>
            matches for the deceased, with the latter being slightly more likely based on age and years of education/employment, but only the former Nisha Patel is a possible match in my opinion and
            <strong>

             Hundreds of plaintiffs had brought actions against Teva in various California state courts and had asked that the cases be coordinated before one state court judge “for all purposes.” The defendants sought to remove the cases to federal court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act (“CAFA”), on the ground that the plaintiffs had proposed a joint trial.  But the District Court and a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit held that the cases were not removable because the plaintiffs had not explicitly asked that the cases be tried together, which is essential to the definition of a removable “mass action” under CAFA. The Ninth Circuit granted en banc review and ruled in favor of Lefkowitz’s client, that the plaintiffs’ request for coordination “for all purposes” necessarily encompassed a request for a joint trial. Hence, the case was properly removed to federal court.[12]

            Well it's not a lot so far but Essel Group esselgroup (dot) com has their hands in a lot of business in India. Wouldn't be surprised if this goes all the way up. They're into Gold, Media (Hollywood/Bollyood), IT/data infrastructure, private banking and you guessed it Ekal Vidyalaya. Not necessarily the route of Clinton Foundation, but audit the hell out of their books and there has to be something there.  (who are we kidding though, they're all connected..) I'll keep digging.

             Some of us just expect you to maintain the quality of PG submissions, since you mods are ones who ran off so many of the good writers. All for a whore and a dragon. Hmmm, starting to see a common element here.

              And to maintain the integrity of the subverse [repository of evidence] as a whole entity. This is a part of why I was invited by the founder to be involved since the earliest part of the sub’s migration to Voat.

              Maybe that is the ‘new normal’ here. Regardless:

                Untrue, as you also well know. Once someone is removed from the mod team, that information disappears. And when I removed you, I didn't think to check who modded you, or screencap it, because I wasn't yet convinced you had ill intent toward this sub.

                 The other thread being the thread I deleted when I went back to start vetting each of the tweets and realized I'd misunderstood tweet #2. If I had "trouble admitting mistakes", why would I admit to fucking up the original submission and link to it in this thread? You're still pushing a ProtectVoat-style smear. And your logic fails.

                  You don’t have to attack me. You want to attack me. It’s disingenuous to pretend you never noticed, over years, how I was modded. Especially after we discussed it on more than one occasion.

                   You're really doubling down on wanting pizzagate researchers NOT to see this information. You do know that will have the opposite effect, right?

                   PGwhatever was a scheme dreamed up by Kev to hinder crowdsourced investigation of breaking leads, just like you are complaining about today.  The contributors of this board have never wanted breaking leads snuffed prematurely. We have a Debunked flair we will put on this if it is ever conclusively proven the Patel who drowned is not the same one linked to the CF.  If you actually contributed here, you'd know that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Poor Kev, had to give up that uber-powerful account and scrub its history. Now why DID he do that, I wonder?  I hope my pointing out his lies and manipulation and repeated sabotage of this board contributed to bringing his reign of terror to an end. Probably not, though. His own arrogance is what really did him in. LOL.  He did have to ditch R3BIRTH, though, after I caught him trying to fuck Voat with that sock.

                    Could I get a source for this, please? I liked PGWE, it was good to see the submissions that didn't quite fit still get posted. Lots of deleted posts were reposted there. But the best part was not having to deal with Mods possibly banning for rule violations. It was a nice place to learn how to submit. If it's such a bad place, then why are you still a mod there? Why haven't you dusted that cobweb off the sidebar?

                    Using a debunked flair doesn't stop a post from sliding legitimate posts, that don't need to be marked as lies. Don't you think that mods should follow the rules more strictly that the average PG poster?

                   <p>
                    Debunked flair means nothing. It is just

                        Your lack of self awareness is stunning. Since you and your crazy friends have been sharing my PMs, from the beginning. It will be interesting to see how far you all will go, collectively to attack me. But you're still a liar, who fell under the spell of an admitted sex majik freaker. Nothing you do or say to me is ever going to change that fact.

                          You're still a JV liar, who fell under the spell of an admitted sex majik freaker, without even putting up a fight, so did your friends. Nothing you do or say to me is ever going to change that fact. Have fun attacking me, my skills are inferior and you all, together, should have no trouble getting me to delete my account.

Lets go over this again. What I saw was actually through Google, not ever downloaded to my phone. I thought someone toyed with the algorithms on my phone by using my email. I am not tech savy although I told you I was before joking. My phone was taken to police nothing was ever found. But I will say what I think I saw was very simular to this sketch of Jon Benet Ramsey.

I am not tech savy although I told you I was before joking. My phone was taken to police nothing was ever found. But I will say what I think I saw was very simular to this sketch of Jon Benet Ramsey.

                                     So you're a liar, but you're tech savvy, but you're not, but people should believe you, but you showed pictures that would make men gag but you claim men hit on you, but somehow the child porn on your phone was on your phone, but it was google, but you blamed a PG researcher for it, but it was a joke, but you're tech savvy, but that was a joke...

                                          i dont need you to believe me, im just making conversation. and im definitely not jesus, he set the example. i regularly fall short.  i dont really believe these guys are pedos. i think they are doing some kind of psyop or social experiment.  i highly doubt someone would go on the internet and post about their evil, illegal proclivities.

                     Of course that’s not what I said. I just hate to see this place go from a repository of evidence to a bunch of off-the-cuff bull. And it’s particularly painful to see the mods doing it. Twice. Within a short period of time.

                   Wow, threatening to do to you whatever it is they did to kev. Well we know his friends are doxxers. It would kind of make sense that he would stoop to their level. Birds of a feather...

                   He was modded 1/3/2017, i know cuz i just got done archiving the 3rd of Jan. I prolly missed the reason for his selection on the main PG board. Maybe there's an explanation as to how he came to be modded in PGmods. i never checked.

                     slowly catching up. In the beginning, we got info overload, so the archiving is slow. As I get further along the archives should go much faster. Someones been going through and making a lot of new archives, that has helped a bit, their bot still doesn't get them all, though.
