   This is more important than Right vs Left, Republican vs Democrat. The elites rape children and also make snuff films using them. It goes beyond politics and that's what people don't seem to get.

            Yes, high level Democrats and Republicans are Insiders, but lower down, the general principles of Conserving the ideals of the Constitution on the Republican side which many on the Right seek to uphold (The US started as a Christian Constitutional Republic and we are trying to conserve that) vs.the Democrats who openly embrace of everything detestable, sickening and society-destroying. The Democrats are actively trying to destroy society and normalize pedophilia and all manner of sexual depravities as well as undermining the Constitution, and have largely succeeded.

            It aint no right vs left or Repuplicans vs Democrats it is all a social construct (democracy) for you to behave (beehive) in their built system of thought. When MAN get strong and united against the controllers of the hive a WAR is needed against other men from another hive. This is the core AGENDA of the world we live in, challenge that thought and you are an enemy to the state. That is why all religions are hammered down because it unites you the people in all colours under a FAITH. That is why when the music stops in one part of the world NEW slaves are needed. If the MUSIC stops THEY are all dead......oh well in reality this WILL never be a battle white always rule over darkness. As seen in magick or in genetics. Many powerful entities are in this realm watching over YOU just let them RIP.

            Yes!!
Every time I see a hit piece directed at one party, or candidate, or the other I speculate that the intention is to attack the other team and protect their own in relation to child crimes or other transgressions. I believe that this very dynamic is what this decrepit system alive. If all, or even the majority, of Americans were focused on the crimes there could be a shift. As long as both parties have the loyalty and support of a certain percentage of individuals in a we are good/they are bad game little will change.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever we each do around child crimes, the focus needs to be on protecting kids and seeking exposure and justice of perps. Anything else is participating in enabling these #$%^ers.

            This isnt even about sex... this is about a godlike power that comes with murder / pedophelia that the elite are addicted to.  Trauma of an innocent is a portal to deeper dimensions.  Those who use THE KEY are performing rituals.  The people involved do not get off to sex they get off to the spiritual POWER that comes with the traums of the youth..  SODOMY IS A SEGWAY TO THE GODS.

            The Left think it's woke by pushing queer theory. Queer theory supports transgression of any kind, and paedophilia is part of that transgression.  Anarchism and paedophilia go hand in hand. All leftists should watch Derrick Jensen talk about the history of Queer Theory:

            The paedophiles of the world know this, but don't talk about.

            The 'sex education' being introduced in all primary schools ALL AROUND THE WORLD groom children, teaching them about sexuality and how to have a good sex life.  Sex education should be age appropriate. Teach teenagers how to avoid pregnancy, how to say no, what consent is, how to avoid STIs, how to protect themselves.  The rest is up to the parents, not society at large.

            Exactly.  Well said.  Also — perpetuating that divide is just continually being a "victim" of the whole MSM agenda.  They want us divided so the elites can keep doing what they're doing while the stupid common folk fight against each other.  I wish more people could see through the smoke and mirrors.

            Beth Chapman. Dog the Bounty Hunter’s wife was probably another sacrifice. A nice woman, a young woman, a good woman, a Christian woman———who better to sacrifice, right???? So where would be Beth Chapman’s connection to some sort of demon possession that may have been involved with her being taken as a sacrifice??? You might ask! Well I’ll tell you exactly where!!!! Before Beth died she gave a talk at The Source Church. She revealed during that talk that she was raised in the Mennonite Church. Beth also told about an incident that happened to her in the Mennonite Church. You see I was a Mennonite once and I know all about what almost happened to Beth in the Mennonite Church. Beth was 17 years old and she found out she was pregnant. I happen to know what happens to you if you are unwed and pregnant in the Mennonite Church. The elders of the church will for e you to go up in front of the church, tell the entire congregation you are pregnant, confess to them you are a sinner, and apologize to the church that you got pregnant. Beth Chapman refuses to go up in front on the church congregation and ran off to Alaska instead. She left the Mennonite Church. The Mennonites also do this to the young man involved too, not just the young women, they make both go up in front of the entire church and tell everyone they are expecting out of wedlock. I know something about the Mennonite Church that almost no one knows. The Mennonite Church is a very bad church. It is a church so bad that it is actually not a church at all, it is really demon possessed. So now we have the connection to Beth Chapman and demon possession thru her ex church. Where demon possession exists there is going to be human sacrificing, that is just a fact. When Beth Chapman gave her talk at The Source Church and told us she was an ex Mennonite she didn’t even know at that time the church she was raised in from infancy to 17 years of age was possessed. Beth died without ever knowing that her ex Mennonite church was not a real church. She never knew that and we can tell that way the way she talked about her base. So anywhere that you have demon possessionin your past, you have a chance of being sacrificed to Satan and I believe Beth Chapman, Mrs. Dog the Bounty Hunter, may have been sacrificed. I’ve tried to start a discussion about this on Voat but for some reason it doesn’t show up. For those of you going down rabbit holes—here is one. Our churches in the USA are demon possessed and no one knows it.

            QRV can't argue with you because Q said "both sides" many times. Anyone who says dems only is an idiot or a shill. McCain was a republican. JFK and JFK Jr were democrats.

            Obama was actively working twords that.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, the fact Trump is using the courts instead of executive ordering everything from giving cash to iran, paying for news propaganda (removing truth in the news), on and on. Moblizing and weaponizing the IRS against people and groups he didnt agree with. He has a phone and a pen, and got. Really good at killing people. His words remember.
           </p>
           <p>
            So again, I could go on and on about the illegal activities your lord and saviour did, but you are the one making the allegation against Trump, yet I have to show you where Trump follows the law? No, prove your point and back it with facts.

            , technically this is an unsourced discussion post, which does not fall within our submission rules. You wanna take the next 24 Hours and add some links supporting what you're saying (maybe link to the Franklin Scandal, Hastert, and some of the Q stuff about the McCain Foundation for the Republican involvement to show it crosses party lines)? Otherwise I will have to remove it under Rule 4.

            More democrats or leftists than republicans, why?  More republicans believe in God and got to church and have a more moral lifestyles.  Democrats are always screaming separation of church and state, lgbtq, blah blah.

            Its mostly Jew vs Goy. Whites and Christianity are their first target because we stand for the exact opposite of what we do. Sure, there are plenty of brainwashed idiots, but if left to our own devices, we trend toward Good. I say Good rather than Right, because I agree that both sides are compromised, simply in different ways. 3rd position is the only way. If we are supressed, Asians/Buddhists will be the next target as they also believe in peace and cultural preservation.

            HAITI. Whatever happened in Haiti needs to be revealed now. They won't be walking away from the left, they will be running away. Complete with some riots and burning buildings. Maybe even a couple of executions. I didn't see anything. Did you?

SS Boomerwaufen.. very dedicated to neo-con republicants party lines they are. be careful when engaging with them, for arw they designed to befudle and demoralize, until prevailing in war of attrition.

            This evil has been on both sides. There were BOTH sides at the Bohemian Grove. The Bushes, Clinton's, etc. (And I'm sure they all continue this tradition, isnt July the month they have their "cremation of care" 
Rituals?) But yes, I believe these sick evil twisted sick scumbags are merely satans puppets placed on whichever side that goes along with their plans at the moment, to carry out this disgusting agenda. The Clinton's seem to have been leading satans army for quite some time now, most certainly,  but it has infested both sides at one point or another.

            Democrats are actively pushing normalization of "child sexuality", so yeah...no.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you're right wing and a pedo, you're just a pedo shitter who needs to die. Not "a champion of progressive sexual politics" or "a challenger of cis normative gender behavior spectrums". Conservatism does not have these rhetorical shields built into their ideology - though the clearly pedo-fueled "Go polygamous and breed 'em young" thing that pops up every so often in certain threads is an attempt to create a new form of ideological shielding now that they're losing their left-progressive pedo gravy train.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any form of Fundamentalism is a breeding ground for "Rules for thee, but not for me"  hierarchical structures where the further down the ladder you are, the less you're allowed to question and challenge your "betters" and their behavior.

            Gamergate was just the left's turn at demonizing games and gamers for in-group brownie points. The religious right were hitting us all the way through the 80s and 90s.

            I don't recall them championing child abuse at the same time. Only that the Catholic Church hid behind the "the flock does not question the Shepard" shielding that fundamentalist ideology gives it's institutionally-aligned wrongdoers.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's the same with Racial differences. Yes, whites have their criminal component. And yet we can't properly deal with them if every time we try to create laws to deal with emergent criminal trends/phenomena without tripping over "Muh oppreshun" or "muh antisemitism" narratives because certain crimes are statistically more prevalent in certain non-white communities.

            Any Dems among that number? I'd put Assange as some kind of lefty. But I bet he has some seriously borderline "permissive" views, whitsleblowing aside. And even he's a leftwing pariah now - because their corporate-marxist leaders told them so. Which to me speaks clearly that they have no real ideologies or moral values. At least there's some unassailable set of laws within Christianity that hold certain behaviors and morals to be actually and irrevocably wrong and evil. It just needs to lay off the "hate the sin, love the sinner" and be endlessly forgiving shit, which makes a fool of many Christians who turn their empathy and forgiveness credentials into an SJW-ish Virtue Signalling competition where their sense of moral superiority and self-serving piousness places them above the actual victims.

            I understand what you're trying to get at, but there are a few fundamental differences between conservatism and progressivism that destroy your argument. You're talking more about "Institutionalism", which I've trying to illustrate examples of here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole point of the Constitution and Bill of Rights was to fight this "I outrank you, ergo the same rules do not apply to me" bullshit that the (((modern political dichotomy))) embodies. "Playing both sides" is a tactic of a specific group of influencers, corruptors and power players. Basically, you're talking about Jews but you'rer attempti g to paint it as "Elites". These "Elites" you speak of are the product of jewish subversion of our institutions and mores. They are over-represented within their number too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whites trend towards stability. Yes we test social boundaries and yes we have a conservative streak, but we ultimately stabilise. We're the Goldilocks race. We test things, then rest at the "just right" level. We don't run things hot (like jews do), and we don't freeze them into complete stasis (like the chinks have done historically). A White Left/Right dichotomy is a balancing act. A jew-subverted Left/Right dichotomy is designed to control and pillage through aggressive boom/bust cycles. Constant ping-ponging between political and social extremes, while trading on inside information to drain all available wealth, power and resources.
           </p>
           <p>
            This system is not our system. These elites are not our elites. These are jewish creations. Social and political tools doing everything possible to stop us stabilizing and being able to deal with our problems. The pedogate "Elites" are just another kind of nigger or spic. Easily controllable, impulse-control adverse dirtbags . They are not "us". The good people don't make to into the "Elite" circles. The innovative people have their ideas stolen, or bought out after a long campaign of industrial or career sabotage.
           </p>
           <p>
            None of this is natural to White Civilization. This is Peak Jew. This is their system working as intended.
            <br/>
            Many Christians here are NOT zionists. They understand that the modern jew is not the Biblical Jew.
            <br/>
            Many of us are agnostics who feel the same way. We understand that many on the right are RINOs and liars.
            <br/>
            We reject this "Dem vs Republican" shit as you're framing it. But don't reject that the core values, unsullied by jew rats, are still valuable and shouldn't be thrown away because they've rubbed their dirty hands all over them. No. We take back what's ours. We rebuild it how it should be, and we stomp the rats and commies and pedos underfoot.

              For clarification. Please tell me if I’m wrong. Wasn’t it a person pulling a phishing scam that sucked dumbass Podesta the pedo into giving access to his perverted emails with his horde of fellow perverted elites. Seth Rich was the guy who downloaded DNC files to a thumb drive that were turned over to Wikileaks. I don’t think Rich and his brother were focused on exposing the elite perverts as much as exposing the corruption of the DNC in regards to what they were doing to their man Bernie.

            The idea that there are even two sides among the elite is a joke. Its one side. The baby raping western society hating kikes and their loyal goyim, and everyone else.

            It is left vs right. This is intentional by the left. The socialists wanted these people in power next to themselves. These criminals are easily controlled, and the socialists don't have to worry about getting usurped by the child murders since the socialists have so much blackmail material.

            It's the jews  stupid. Reminder slavery is legal in Israel and they still deal in the White slave trade of young Eastern European women and girls, and no country is willing to speak out against it.

              There are plenty of articles out there, if you google Israel slave trade. Weeding through what's antisemitic, politically driven, etc is up to you. But from the first two links I posted, that's peer proof of the issue.

            It has never been a democrat vs republican issue.  But the problem with that is that democrats essentially agree that monstrous behavior is OK as long as it is a democrat doing it.  The best example of that is Bill Clinton.  It was common knowledge that he was a violent serial rapist.  The response of the democrat senators and representatives was to assemble and march to the white house in support of clinton.  Now violent attacks on women and elderly by ANTIFA are supported by democrats.  None of those things are a right/left issue,  but politicians and the media support them as long as the perpetrators are democrats.  That is the only issue.

             The Globalists absolutely have used both parties. Currently though, their minions, the Clintons, financially gained control of the Dems, and they are the Globalist party du jour. Their hatred of Trump is real. Still, I go by "trust, but verify."

             Let's not forget, according to Epstein's lawyers, Alan Dershowitz and Gerald Lefcourt,

             "Mr. Epstein was part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative, which is described as a project 'bringing together a community of global leaders to devise and implement innovative solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges,” read the July 2007 letter to the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida. “Focuses of this initiative include poverty, climate change, global health, and religious and ethnic conflicts.”

              It would be of more help to the fight if you were to research it a little bit more and understand that the truth is not as you present it. You may be well intentioned but for the people who have already done their homework, you sound ill informed and divisive.

               The truth is not left vs right. I'm sorry but it's not. That does not make me sound ill infomred and divisive since I refuse to play the Republicans are the good guys Democrats are the bad guys game when both sides are corrupted.

                What you seem to think is that in the end, you are right, despite the fact you are ill informed and divisive. In the end, this is BY DESIGN left versus right. Not to say all left are wrong and all right are right. But there is no way around the fact this is designed much differently than you seem able to comprehend.

              Not my point. Why not just discuss pizzagate then and ignore other's desire to insert politics. You are literally playing the same game. If you bring it up, what do you think people will do?

                You can't just turn it off with a switch.  It's like closing the sluices on Hoover Dam after spring flooding.  The main shipping routes have been heavily disrupted.  Pedo rings are being busted pretty much on a daily basis now.
               </p>
               <p>
                Remember when the bust of a 3 or 5 pedos would warrant a post and many responses?

                 They have infiltrated both parties. They have created a fake system, literally a matrix, of lies while raping children for centuries. Watch the Conspiracy of Silence what Senator John Decamp said. He said both sides were doing it, both were involved. People who smile on camera and rape and murder children in private. It is so sick. Moloch has esisted since Babylonian times, all of the worlds governments have these sick fucks who infiltrated them. People think  the right is clean and the left are the bad guys despite people like Dennis Hastert and Craig.J. Spence.

            Ill copy my post from there too here because you stupid kikes dont seem to get it...
           </p>
           <p>
            "You entirely failed to address his point that the entire left spectrum explicitly works towards the destruction of all that is good and free, while there are SOME on the right spectrum that stand up to it. No one is saying the right is made up of completely innocent people.
           </p>
           <p>
            It looks like YOU are attempting to create division and shield the left by tossing both left and right into the same category because SOME people on the right are also satanic dick sucks, while ignoring that ALL of the left are.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we instantly cleaned up all political parties, the left would cease to exist entirely, while there would still be a right.
           </p>
           <p>
            So yes there are bad people on all sides of the political spectrum, but the good guys that do exist, are all on one side and not the other"
           </p>
           <p>
            I corrected a apelling error. Thats in reply to this dumbass notion that there is just no difference between the parties and they are both equal.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are bad guys on all sides yes. But the left is entirely bad, and the right has SOME decency.

             Fuck the Middle East and fuck you. I support Trump and despite being on the fence with Q with the arrests lately am getting faith again. I am simply sick of Pizzagate being made into a political issue when it's much more. You don't care about Humanity and supported the rapes of children multiple times. Burn in hell Donkey.

            Extrajudicial killings are the only way to fight this scourge. There is no Justice in a system controlled at all levels by the perpetrators. The systems of our governments are no longer functioning or legitimate and are controlled by people that are trying to genocide us.

                     Obama was actively working twords that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     However, the fact Trump is using the courts instead of executive ordering everything from giving cash to iran, paying for news propaganda (removing truth in the news), on and on. Moblizing and weaponizing the IRS against people and groups he didnt agree with. He has a phone and a pen, and got really good at killing people. His words remember.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     So again, I could go on and on about the illegal activities your lord and saviour did, but you are the one making the allegation against Trump, yet I have to show you where Trump follows the law? No, prove your point and back it with facts. I do not see trump doing any of that.

                      "obama was actively working towards that", fuck you thats bullshit and you know it. the obama admin was just a 8 year long sharkweek for old people. and no liberals don't worship obama the same way you clowns do he was pretty disappointing president tbh. but actingly like he was some walking constitutional crisis and trump isn't is laughable.

                       I'm not gonna argue with some propagandist like you who can't see the facts in front of your eyes. You have a narrative to push, either through ignorance or soros pay money, and I am not gonna waste my time on you. The goats on this board have posted fact after fact, we lived through it. To say Obama wasnt trying to take away the 2nd is laughable.
