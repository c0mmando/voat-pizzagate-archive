            I knew it wouldn't be long before this charity came into the pizzagate headlights.

            Baroness Buller was taken off the committee that was investigating the UK's establishment peadophiles as her brother was a shady character and said racist things. She is known as a very vigorous and intelligent lawyer and gets to the truth very quickly, but as her brother said hurtful things
            <em>
             she
            </em>
            was sacked.
           </p>
           <p>
            It must have been a coincidence.
           </p>

            They are the charity that saved humanity from being a commodity. They were the first to sequence the human genome beating a commercial company who were going to patent our genome and own us all.  The Trust put the results online for all to use.

            I think this charity is just guilty by association, as will be a few more high profile people and companies, but everyone just bays for blood. They are the second biggest charity there is, of course they will have connections to all sorts of shady characters.

             Think if it this way if this thread concerns you:
            </p>
            <p>
             Is it possible that Wellcome Trust STARTED out good and "on the up and up", then either went rogue or got subverted later? After all, that IS the MO of these "sick sacks of shit".
            </p>
            <p>
             As it is now, there's too many "red flags" out there not to look into this.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you're concerned, think on the lines of "save the tree by purging the tumor infesting it".

            This is incorrect.
The Sanger Institute is named for a British biochemist, Frederick Sanger, not the American Margaret Sanger.

              I mentioned the fact that one is British and one is American and I posted a link this his wikipedia page.  Searching for "Margaret Sanger" on that page brought up zero results.  You do find out about his wife if you search for "Margaret" only.  The activist lived and died in America, didn't she?  According to wikipedia, Sanger was her first husband's name and both her parents were born in Ireland, so I don't even think she is related to the British guy.   Also according to Wikipedia, she did spend some time in Britain in 1914, but the biochemist wasn't born yet. I see no connection between the British Nobel Prize Winner and the American birth control activist.  You have the wrong Margaret Sanger.

               That's because the Margaret mentioned on the chemist's page is refered to by her maiden name.

              <p>
               Either way, the Margaret mentioned in the original link was a nasty piece of work (as anyone who is a eugenicist typically is), thus her activities are worth looking at.

                Yes, I see that now.  But obviously, they are two different Margaret Sangers.  Do you now concede the British chemist's wife was not the American activist?

                You may want to look into the activist, but will you admit she has nothing to do with the Sanger Institute like you claimed?

              The Margaret Sanger you are talking about was born in 1879 and died in 1966.
September 14, 1879 – September 6, 1966

             Something with that high a mortality rate is a major red flag.
            </p>
            <p>
             Evolution favors that which is an optimal survival strategy. For parasites, having a very high mortality rate, especially with such a fast progression from infection to death is a very poor survival strategy given the context of a parasite.
            </p>

             Indicative of something that was made in a lab....purely to kill. HIV is suspected to be a bioweapon too, for slightly different reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
             Note that outbreaks of ebola tend to happen near known bio weapon labs.

            What is a crossbench life peer you non-Europeans may ask?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A crossbencher is an independent or minor party member of some legislatures, such as the British House of Lords and in the Parliament of Australia. They take their name from the crossbenches, between and perpendicular to the government and opposition benches, where crossbenchers sit in the chamber.

            So, after officially leaving England's premiere spy agency, this major player from the Wellcome Trust enters politics to shape the country's future. We did that in America, too. The guy's name was Bush.
