            The pedophile kidnapper in the OP is from Hoffman Estates, Illinois.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is one of the towns John Wayne Gacy lived in back in the 1970's when he was my babysitter (I'm not joking.)
           </p>
           <p>
            He had a construction trailer and a condo at Barrington Lakes townhouses in Hoffman Estates.  He was making child pornography.  He was definitely MK ULTRA'd, by the way.  He was involved with other IC black ops that my parents were involved with.  So TPTB not only knew what he was doing in Hoffman Estates, they directed it.  It was a long time ago, to be sure, but still.
           </p>
           <p>
            Florida connection:  The little girl who thank God was rescued lives in Orlando, Florida.  Coincidentally, JWG and another man brought me and my two older sisters to Florida at least once, possibly my parents were there too.  If memory serves the place they took us to was an annex of St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa.  According to Carolyn Hamlett, gifted children were given MK torture there.  I can't find that quote but here is
            <a href="http://archive.is/O2XUV#selection-1117.4-1117.78">
             another.
            </a>
            All I remember is the pale green and yellow checkerboard linoleum floor of an MK ULTRA laboratory, my hospital room, the other man preparing my food because he didn't trust what others might put in it, and seeing one of my sisters in the stairwell by a door to the outside.   I noticed online Gacy owned property in Brooksville,
            <a href="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4157/34028818770_6cb8dfbd60_o.jpg">
             Florida,
            </a>
            50 minutes from Tampa and an hour and twenty minutes from Orlando.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the MSM story about Byrns is true.  Or maybe it's completely false, like I assume 90% of the Gacy narrative is.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            Confirmation from someone who worked at Barrington Lakes that Gacy lived and worked there:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://archive.is/90VWU#selection-111.0-115.631">
             http://archive.is/90VWU#selection-111.0-115.631
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            He also probably worked there in the late 1960's, as BL opened in 1970, and my clearest memory of that trailer was when the car dropping me off there approached it, and the huge artificial lake to the right of, and slightly beyond it, did not have water in it yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone else was babysat by John Wayne Gacy:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             He [John Wayne Gacy] babysat my youngest aunt in his house every day when my mother's family lived in Lombard IL.
             <a href="http://archive.is/9yhF6">
              http://archive.is/9yhF6
             </a>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Funny how the police did not include John Wayne Gacy's extensive "babysitting" career, nor his long-term job in Hoffman Estates, in the official police story.  And, nope, my family won't talk about this, I think they are all involved, in one way or another.

             Wow.  What a horrible time of it you had during your childhood.  I know from reading about abused and MK Ultra, that some memories never come forward or take years to be realized.  That is amazing.  How traumatizing to even hear on the news that your Baby Sitter turns out to be a Serial Killer.  You helped me with my post for

             and little did I know that you have somewhat of the same past and I wan to thank you for that.  Thank you for sharing this with me and others.  I am so sorry for what you endured, you and your sister.  And your Aunt too.  I am going to finish reading your links.  I am still amazed.

              Thank you for your kindness.  Actually it wasn't my aunt who was babysat by him, so I just fixed the wording in my comment above to clarify that --
             </p>
             <p>
              I remembered this babysitter's face and the trailer, and that "it was dangerous there," and an apartment (possibly the BL one, but he seemed to be at or own many properties,) and I remembered him at my house, I remember going to the hardware store with him --, and I later remembered his name was John -- but I knew nothing about John Wayne Gacy (oddly enough) -- so I never made the connection until a couple years ago.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is all I knew about John Wayne Gacy until a couple years ago,
              <a href="http://archive.is/V0KUt">
               this mugshot,
              </a>
              and that he lived in Chicago, etc.  I did not recognize him from that mugshot.
             </p>
             <p>
              I recognized him from this picture I came across online --
              <a href="http://www.worldlycrimes.com/lib/029/308-crime2-the-killer-clown-found-his-killings-a-joke-but-the-lethal-injection-he-got-was-not-funny.jpg">
               this is what he looked like when I was young -- he was only 20 years older than me
              </a>
              Once I came across that picture of him young, I knew he was my babysitter.  (Not that I didn't have other babysitters too.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Other memories about John emerged later, about other IC black ops, including Tampa, etc.

               I am going to have to delete my post.  I can't seem to connect it to what is required at this point.  Things could pop up afterward, but as of now there is not enough out there on him.  Then you know what will happen.  It will be forgotten.  I understand the problem, but it is frustrating.

               Wow you just found out 2 yrs. ago. So very shocking for someone I am sure.  I remember the news stories about him and the day they announced it.  The start of months of digging, etc.  His incarceration was a Freak Show as well with women wanting to marry him. My mother in law always said, There's more nuts out than in.  I read this years after the trial.

            OK.  I found this in another article.  I can't believe this. Johnson’s parents said they were aware their daughter was talking to an individual from Illinois, but did not know she was in danger at the time. Byrns and the 11-year-old then began talking through the phone. It’s unclear how long they were talking before Sunday’s incident.  THE Parents Knew!  Shocking.  Will people never wake up.

            Now I also found out that in the Bibb County Sheriffs office, the deputy was arrested for Sexual Abuse.  It just beats all.

            Hey carmencita! Sorry to be a stickler, but is there any evidence this guy is more than just a lone ranger pedo? That is, does he have rich friends or business connections? I'm giving this the 24 hour Reprieve flair so you can add that material if there is any. Otherwise we'll have to remove it per Rule 1. Reply to this comment to have me remove the flair once you've edited. Thanks!

             I hate to have to delete my post, I have tried to connect it so it follows the rules.  There is a Gacy connection but not to the elites, even though it is believed that Gacy was part of a ring.  It is a shame to have the information of

             to get lost in the deletion halls.  My whole point of posting it was in hopes that parents would wake up and check on their children.  And also to make people realize what hoops these guys will jump through to get to their victims.  Driving all the way from Ill. down to Florida and then to Georgia.  I believe he was up to something.  Why not stay in Fla.  why take her to Ga.  I guess I'll never know.  Maybe I can keep checking.

              Since you want to send a message to parents to keep a closer watch on what their child is doing, maybe you could start a file of these cases, with links, that seem to show how parents may have overlooked danger signs before their child was taken.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then once one case is demonstrated to be tied to the "elites," you can post that to follow this forum's rules, but also have a second point to your submission about parental supervision in general -- where you list cases like Burns kidnapping that poor child.

              Don't worry about my info, it can't get lost.  A lot of people from my friends, to someone who appears on Alex Jones, to retired homicide detectives, to other prominent people in between, have my information, it's fine.  We just don't have any evidence.

               I am really shocked at all the things going on down there. More and more each day.  Now I just posted that the girl's parents knew she was talking to someone.  I am just flummoxed.

             Yes.  I think this would cut down on so many kidnappings and snatching of our kids.  They disappear right out of their houses.  They are on the game with the predator and are told to meet them at a mall or coffee shop or wherever and they are picked up and gone.  You won't even know where to begin to look.  This is easily nipped in the bud.  Their games and iphones can easily be programmed for safety.  Electronics are a pedo's best friend.

               Just as another thought, I am wondering if they may have had something to do with her disappearance.  I mean, Orlando is a very dicey area and the fact that they said they knew she was talking to someone and did nothing.  May just be a little lax, but we Have Heard of children's parents being involved.  Also was he taking her up to Bibb County to share?  Idk, want to explore all possibilities.

                I'd have to know more, but it sounds they were just lax. They did reach out to authorities, and they wouldn't have had to do so. They could have waited.

               <p>
                In terms of the sharing, now that's a real possibility. But their encounter may have been filmed. These guys don't like to waste molestation. Might already be disseminated on the dark web to thousands of buyers.

            This scared me because there are a lot of kids that play that game.  I heard that on the news.  He pretended he was another teen.  Can you imagine he drove all the way from Illinois to Florida to get her.  That's frightening to think about.  This is how driven they are by their sick desires to get to their victim.  We have read some pretty horrible things, but this kind of simple getting in contact, playing and then just jumping in your car is about as easy as it gets.  Driven to To Steal Our Kids.
