&quot;Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger did a really bad job as Governor of California and even worse on the Apprentice...but at least he tried hard!&quot;</p>

<p>Known by critics as the the &quot;Pedophile Protection Act&quot;. <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/september2004/030904pedophileprotection.htm">Title Here</a></p>
<p>World Net Daily | September 3 2004</p>
<p>A bill dubbed by critics as the &quot;Pedophile Protection Act&quot; is on the desk of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger after passing both chambers of the California Legislature.</p>
<p>Authored by lesbian state Sen. Sheila Kuehl, the bill drastically reduces requirements for mandatory reporting of the known or suspected sexual, physical and emotional abuse of children.</p>
<p>Richard D. Ackerman, vice-president of legal affairs for the Pro-Family Law Center, and a survivor of severe physical and sexual abuse, calls the bill a &quot;reprehensible act.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The one common denominator among civilized persons is the ability to rally around the protection of our children,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;Even one case of unreported abuse has the potential to begin a generational cycle of continuing abuse, and could even result in the death of a child.&quot;</p>
<p>Ackerman asserts the bill &quot;appears to be the work of abortionists and others who ply in the trade of promoting sex among children.&quot;</p>
<p>Under existing criminal law, anyone who regularly comes into contact with children is required to report an instance in which there is reason to believe a child has been molested or abused, Ackerman points out.</p>
<p>Typical mandatory reporters include pastors, priests, church volunteers, teachers, school volunteers, and medical personnel.</p>
<p>But the bill, SB1313, would eliminate mandatory reporting for anyone who can be characterized as a &quot;volunteer.&quot;</p>
<p>That means a Sunday school teacher, for example, would not be required to report her knowledge of a pastor\'s molestation of children.</p>
<p>Critics say the bill also eliminates mandatory reporting in cases where children are having sex with each other, and severe emotional abuse may no longer be a reportable event at all.</p>
<p>Ackerman, while working for the United States Justice Foundation, persuaded the California Attorney General\'s office to issue a written opinion to the California Medical Board that affirmed the requirement of reporting for anyone who comes into regular contact with children as part of professional duties.</p>
<p>The report, following a petition by more than 10,000 people, presented evidence that Planned Parenthood had seen over 30,000 children in California, but not one instance of reporting to law enforcement could be found.</p>
<p>State-required demographic data provided by Planned Parenthood to California demonstrated that the volunteers and paid staff of Planned Parenthood had seen children ages 6 and under for sexually transmitted disease treatment.</p>
<p>Ackerman says SB1313 seeks to make unavailable any reports of abuse, even if the reports are redacted.</p>
<p>Ackerman, urging &quot;all persons of good conscience&quot; to write to Gov. Schwarzennegger, said, &quot;If even one child is abused or dies because of the failure to report by a clinic, church or school, that child\'s blood is on the hands of Sheila Kuehl and the people who sneaked behind the media&quot;s back to get this sickly legislation passed.&quot;</p>',

            "The one common denominator among civilized persons is the ability to rally around the protection of our children,"
The problem with this statement is the protection of children is a blanket catch all excuse used to persecute pedophiles who are not a threat in any way to children.  Children and adults having loving sexual conduct is good and not dangerous.

             No. No. No. No. No. no. No. No. No. No. No. No.
It is dangerous - a child is not of sound mental maturity to handle the emotional responsibility that comes with a sexual relationship, no matter who it's with. The caveat here is that if it's with an adult, the adult KNOWS that they are taking advantage of the child who cannot reasonably make these emotionally complex decisions. HOW IS THIS NOT DOWNVOATED?

              No matter how many times you say "no" it will not make your opinion right. You must examine your opinion word by word and test it for fact and logic. No one needs to be of "sound mental maturity" to do something they like and that they are equipped for from birth or before. Ask yourself what is the emotional maturity that comes with a sexual relationship? Why must it be a "relationship" instead of a one time thing?  What is the danger?  If we like to do something pleasant, we can do it once or we can do it more than once. We can stop when it is not longer interesting to us. Since kids, like all people, want sexual relationships with each other and with adults, it is the duty of adults to set up safe ways for kids to do what they want.

            Trump has been beefing with Schwarzenegger for awhile, just in little snips here and there. Often when Trump does something that appears petty, it traces back to deep knowledge about something that most of us aren't aware of. Remember, he's known a lot of these rich, famous, and powerful people for many years. It might not even be this bill (which was disgusting) it might be some other reason.

            I would have thought he went after him for the comment about trading jobs, but Trump need not worry. After this week's Apprentice, Arnold has fallen on his own sword. His remarks about women, the aging process, and his misogynist views were on display. What a yutz! There were various reports of his mistreatment of his wife. Not sure why she stayed with him, the reports have been confirmed with what he spewed on film. No hidden cameras needed. The guy just doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut and seemed to insult everyone in the room.

             Arnold plays "mister nice guy" but is a total ego maniac douche. Trump plays the opposite. Brash and sometimes obnoxious publicly but heart of gold privately.

             You may be right.  I wonder if there could be more to it though, because that video all had to do with The Apprentice.   Trump went an extra step to criticize his job as governor.

              I hate to sound like a crazy Trump supporter following him blindly, BUT it does seem that every move he makes is calculated. I remember being infuriated at him for taking a jab at McCain, but McCain's dirty and it will come out.

               That's not crazy...it means you are paying attention.  Too many examples to list....2 things stick out in my mind:
1) FBI Anon said the Pres. Trump had very competent people feeding him info and advising.
2) The "Hillary took a whole village" quip at the roast.

               However; if you have a Trump Can Grab My Poonanny T-shirt made, I'll call you crazy.

            I reported someone in California and outcome "unfounded" .  In that event the entire file is deleted.  If more reports are made on this person, my prior report won't be available.  Plus they really didn't investigate my report.

            Not that I'm convinced Trump went after him because of this, but it certainly wouldn't have hurt.
