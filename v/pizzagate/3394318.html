<p>I am admittedly a somewhat to #pizzagate so please excuse me if this is an already well researched topic but recently with all the Epstein news, a normie friend of mine was open to doing some &quot;deep dives&quot; into information about the pedo rings and their influence on notorious celebrities and high ranking political officials. Since it took Epstein\'s suicide for him to become interested, I thought the best way to get him looking deeper would be to suggest simple key terms and people to search for so that he would start questioning things and coming to realizations on his own.</p>
<p>I started with the basics, explaining how the Podesta dumps told us a lot about some people who could be implicated in these crimes and what the code words in the Podesta e-mails meant and how you can find some pretty weird references to this right in the open and by well known figures. Since Instagram is one of the only social media applications he uses, I started by saying: &quot;Just go take a look at Tom Hanks Instagram and tell me if his photos seem &quot;normal&quot; to you.&quot;</p>
<p>He scrolled back to some of Tom\'s early posts and was visually disturbed by the &quot;left behind&quot; clothing items photos that covered his page.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tomhanks/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/tomhanks/?hl=en</a></p>
<p>I remember him asking: &quot;Why would he post so many of these if it was just something random?&quot; and asking if I knew what it meant. So I told him about some of the symbolism of these people and how they use rather innocuous signs which most people might glance over. I referenced how the &quot;red shoes&quot; was a symbol since he had seen the recen Bill Clinton painting that was in Epstein\'s house:</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/14/epstein-had-bizarre-painting-of-bill-clinton-in-dress-heels-in-townhouse/">https://nypost.com/2019/08/14/epstein-had-bizarre-painting-of-bill-clinton-in-dress-heels-in-townhouse/</a> </p>
<p>and told him to search the term &quot;handkerchief&quot; on Wikileaks:</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41831">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/41831</a></p>
<p>after he read this I told him to do a simple Google search of what handkerchiefs code for:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code</a></p>
<p>While we were on this subject, my friend started looking at accounts Tom Hanks had tagged in his posts and notable people he would take pictures with. He started looking at Tom\'s son, Colin\'s, account and immediately notices he has his own handkerchief company.</p>
<p>Now this is something I never noticed myself so I was intrigued since my friend who was only just learning all this stuff had just provided me with a new rabbit hole to explore. I figured anons have already found this on their own accord so I thought I send some links and ask what interesting digs anyone has found on this.</p>
<p>Here is Colin\'s Instagram:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/colinhanks/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/colinhanks/?hl=en</a></p>
<p>It links, right in the bio, to his handkerchief company:</p>
<p><a href="https://hankskerchiefs.com/">https://hankskerchiefs.com/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://hankskerchiefs.com/pages/about-us">https://hankskerchiefs.com/pages/about-us</a></p>
<p>The entire purpose of me posting this was to draw attention to the most jarring detail: he uses people\'s names, real human names, as the names of his handkerchief styles.</p>
<p><a href="https://hankskerchiefs.com/collections/hanks-kerchief/products/jacob">https://hankskerchiefs.com/collections/hanks-kerchief/products/jacob</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0rQMP3AjIB/">https://www.instagram.com/p/B0rQMP3AjIB/</a></p>
<p>Now I am beginning to believe there is no such thing as coincidences with these people so I feel as if this is a way of blatantly stating handkerchief code is part of their symbolism and they may even be using company\'s such as this as a front for child trafficking. To further substantiate that claim, try to find where this business is located. We could not find anything noteworthy when looking up the address which is also linked in Colin\'s bio.</p>
<p>The address (I think this has since been removed from his Instagram because I had to dig a bit deeper to find it when looking things up again for this post): </p>
<p>9100 WILSHIRE BLVD BEVERLY HILLS, CA 90212</p>
<p><a href="https://www.corporationwiki.com/p/330vud/hanks-kerchiefs-llc">https://www.corporationwiki.com/p/330vud/hanks-kerchiefs-llc</a></p>
<p>I also find it rather interesting he has 3 listed charities on his company website, 1 related to wildfires, 1 related to &quot;childhood&quot; cancer, and of course, one related to saving children from war torn areas... you just can\'t make this stuff up:</p>
<p><a href="https://hankskerchiefs.com/pages/charities-1">https://hankskerchiefs.com/pages/charities-1</a></p>
<p>This all was a bit much for me to process and I wasn\'t sure where to follow the rabbit hole so I wanted to turn to the anons for more information on this. Please help me in my quest to awaken my friends to this evil! Any leads would be much appreciated.</p>',

           Hello fellow pizzagate researchers,

          <p>

            In the 80s there was a code related to wearing bandanas in your pockets. It was mostly a code amongst gay men, and I have to admit that I dont know all the meanings but I am certain that blue meant something different from red and the pocket (left or right) also meant something.
