<p><strong>Excerpts from the article:</strong></p>
<p>The Boy Scouts of America, which acknowledged last year that it has taken a financial hit from settlements in child abuse cases, has <strong>lobbied against proposals in multiple states that would expose the organization to more lawsuits</strong>, according to victim advocates and proponents of the legislation.</p>
<p>The group retained lobbyists in Georgia and New York, where lawmakers say <strong>such action helped stall proposals that included “lookback” windows allowing adults to take legal action over decades-old claims</strong>. It has hired lobbyists in Michigan, where similar proposals are being debated. <strong>The bills would give adults who were abused as children a second chance to file suit if they missed their first opportunity under state law.</strong></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>In New York, a one-year “lookback” measure known as the Child Victims Act has been debated for years without reaching a vote in the state Senate</strong>, advocates said…The lower chamber of the state legislature overwhelmingly approved the measure in a separate vote last week, but Senate leaders gave no indication that they planned to bring the bill to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>The office of Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan, R, did not respond to an inquiry about the likelihood of a vote</strong>.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>In Michigan…the Boy Scouts has supported legislative efforts to narrowly tailor “lookback” periods so they do not have “such an open-ended approach</strong>...The state legislature is considering multiple bills related to child sex abuse after University of Michigan doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for molesting young gymnasts under the guise of medical treatment.</p>
<p>Victim advocates said open-ended “lookback” provisions are necessary because many people who were abused as children do not come forward until their 30s, which in some states comes after their opportunity to sue has expired.</p>
<p>Additionally, lawsuits alert today’s parents about alleged abusers and the institutions that shelter them, advocates say.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>In Georgia, the group has retained lobbyists</strong> from Dentons, a major firm, since last year. Its four current representatives include two former state lawmakers, <strong>one of whom is ex-House majority whip Edward Lindsey…state Rep. Jason Spencer, R, said BSA lobbyists created a legislative “trap” this spring to block his bill creating a one-year “lookback” window.</strong></p>
<p>Even after his measure unanimously passed the House of Representatives and the state Senate approved a weaker version supported by the BSA, Spencer said there was not enough time to reconcile the two proposals before the end of Georgia’s legislative session in March.</p>
<p>“By the end of the session, we were in the red zone,” he said in a phone interview. “The bill got tangled up in the back and forth.”</p>
<p><strong>Spencer said he confronted Lindsey in a meeting about delaying the process. Lindsey did not respond to an interview request.</strong></p>

             Stephenson and board members, yup, definitely the main problems here, no doubt.  I guess you know he was instrumental in the push to allow openly gay scouts and eventually got his way.  Now he's hiring lobbyists to work against the interests of abused kids.  Nice.
            </p>
            <p>
             He's also a member of the globalist Council on Foreign Relations.  Don't know if you've seen this:

             And yeah, most people don't want to think about pedophilia and resent us for even bringing up the subject.  I think we're all experiencing the social brick wall.

            I don’t know why BSA is making these bad decisions. I DO know, where I live the Boy Scouts are (were) excellent. My family was involved in boy scouting for two generations. They did exactly the activities, and learned the exactly the skills that Boy Scouts are noted for - leadership, survival, respect for God and country... I’m sorry to see this destruction of what once was such a great program, at least around here, where I’m seeing people losing enthusiasm and dropping out. I know my situation and experience isn’t like some others. I hope it’s more typical than not. But now that doesn’t matter, it’s all gone too far. Now I hope BSA dissolves completely, and quickly, before it ruins every good thing they’ve done. Thanks for listening, this isn’t much of a contribution, but I wanted to stick up for the good and REAL Boy Scouts and leaders I know.

             It's sad to watch the downfall.  Have you seen this about the new Boy Scout agenda?  It might explain a lot.

            I bet it went something like this: Boy Scouts: "We'd like statutes of limitations on child abuse please"... Filthy Democrat : "Well, we'd like you to accept girls and trans into the Boy Scouts".  Boy Scouts " .........................Ok."

            Hope you don't mind my posting this here.  I was looking for info of women abusing girls in the Girl Scouts since we know there are such.  Well, I saw this article and I was really elated that parents are standing up for Boys and Girls.  Parents are not in favor of Boy Scouts accepting Girls.  No Way.

            It's a great article so read it all.  But this really says it all.

            “Believe me when I tell you, it would be horrible,” Gremel said. “Men and women are equal, but not the same.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Gremel is something of a legendary figure in local scouting circles, having served more than 60 years as scoutmaster for Troop 979 , for which he still volunteers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gremel said it’s “hard enough” to plan events just for boys, and adding girls to activities and outings would complicate things for scoutmasters and other volunteers.
           </p>
           <p>
            “If they allow girls in this group, I will drop out of Scouts completely,” Gremel said.
           </p>
           <p>
            AND How About This
           </p>
           <p>
            “We have research that shows girls really do thrive in an all-girl environment,” said L’Oreal Payton, spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of Greater Chicago and Northwest Indiana. “It’s a safe space for a girl to be a girl.”

             In the South it is called a hayride. You put some hay in the trailer, tell the kids, "we are going somewhere for any given holiday," and pull it with a slow noisy tractor. That is how babies are made while the parents keep watch.

             Girls who have experienced incest and other forms of abuse thrive in an all girl program such as Girl Scouts. It would be wrong to take this option away from these children. Most would not consider joining boy scouts or a group that allows both sexes.

              I think so too and most Moms would not even entertain the thought.  I think the more this comes out, the more backlash we will hear.  Stupid Idea.

              Yes!  That's the first thing I thought when I heard the news!  Money.  Also, if they have men leaders, that will allow the leaders that prefer girls have their fun now.  If they have women leaders for the girls What An Orgy.  Boys Girls Women and Men.  This is a Fiasco waiting to happen.  Also what will they do for camping?  Ugh.  I am going to Vomit Again. All former Girl Scouts are upset.

            I remember that in New York, also an insurance company lobbied against extending the statute of limitations' period. They are afraid they'd have to pay out more money when more victims had the chance to sue their rapists, and would get a compensation.

             I thought the Mormons have issues with pulling out. I like smoking cigars but occasionally take them out of my mouth.

             I heard the same stat elsewhere, 20%. And, that additional financial support from the church exceeded 20%. That’s a big loss. Somehow, alienating this large source of funding must be worth it.

             In an official press release, the church announced its intent to focus its efforts on a “worldwide initiative for children and youth” that their leadership has been preparing “for years.” And so, “effective on December 31, 2019, the Church will conclude its relationship as a chartered organization with all Scouting programs around the world.”

              I was raised LDS/Mormon. Eternal identity is akin to teaching children that they are children of god and that our time on Earth is a short test to see what we do with our free agency. We were taught to have an eternal perspective on life, not a short sighted view of our time on Earth. There is an eternal perspective for families, as well. Families can be sealed for time and all eternity. Time is temporary. Time is the work of the devil (I don't know if Mormons believe that, but I do). Mormons are taught about an eternal outlook on things. That's the gist of it.

              I can see why it might sound strange to someone outside of the church.

               No, it does not sound strange.  You were taught the right way.  But remember that in all religions there are good and bad people that will twist the religion into bad.  There are people within your religion that are raping and murdering just like in the RCC with the Vatican's blessing.  There are evil people in this world that have hijacked the religions.  Keep doing what you are doing.  I trust that you have been taught to be a good person, but others have not.

               New Children and Youth Development Initiative Coming January 2020
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              New initiative to replace all existing activity programs for girls and boys, young women and young men in 2020.
             </p>
             <p>
              The needs of all children and youth of our faith worldwide are the primary consideration for our youth initiatives. For years, Church leaders have focused on creating ways to minister to the needs of young people around the world. A new initiative, coming January 2020, is designed to support families as they seek to develop faith in Jesus Christ and build character and capacity.
              <strong>
               Testing and refinement is in progress and more details will be shared as we near implementation.

             <hr/>
             <p>
              We need to keep eyes on the roll-out of this program.
