<p>The recent thread by another user was deleted and I want users to see and discuss this for themselves.</p>
<p>Worldcorpo was a site that was discovered here on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">/v/pizzagate</a> sometime last year that features videos of children being mentally and verbally abused in a shower (which some theorized to be a Comet Ping Pong shower). More importantly, the original fatherhood video had an uncanny resemblance to the voice of John Podesta who is one of the main figures of Pizzagate and allegedly linked to James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong.</p>
<p>My instinct has always been that Worldcorpo is a white hat (read: actual good guys in the FBI or other LE) that leaked the videos to us through a random website, in hopes that if enough citizens report the video to the FBI they will have the reasoning they need to move forward investigating it (because for whatever reason their superiors may not be taking it seriously). I have already done so with my real name and address last year, and have yet to have any visits or get my door kicked down, so if you\'re as disturbed by this as me, think about doing the same because at the very least this is real child abuse.</p>
<h1>The Videos</h1>
<p>Video transcripts will be provided by me below in the comments.</p>
<h2>Newer Video</h2>
<p>The newest video from Worldcorpo depicts a young child (I would guess like elementary age) in a shower similar to the one that we saw from the original fatherhood video but this time there\'s a flashlight shining on him and at least two guys standing there. Throughout the video there seems to be an electrical flashing and crackling noise coming from the floor of the shower. Also, it seems that there is some sort of bag over the child\'s head, and they are wearing pajama pants with no shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Link:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://flixtc.com/w/cGmASeb">https://flixtc.com/w/cGmASeb</a></p>
<h2>The Original Video</h2>
<p>Next is the original fatherhood video. The video depicts an enraged male yelling at a child through a shower door, with only the shadow of the child being visible. He hits the shower door with a broom repeatedly to scare the child. Again there appears to some sort of electrical flashing and crackling behind the door.</p>
<p>I won\'t link to previous posts on here about it as Worldcorpo links are not allowed anymore, but the theory beforehand was that the voice in this video is John Podesta. Some people disagreed because they say the accent is different, but I have always maintained that under stress, mental issues (multiple personalities or dissociation), or intoxication, people\'s voices can change. It\'s possible that the abuser himself has suffered abuse causing his mind to be fractured or unstable.</p>
<p>Secondly, some have said that the whole worldcorpo site is some kind of 4chan troll and something about &quot;hotlinking&quot; that must mean it\'s fake. Neither of those somehow make two videos of children being abused stop being real. As I\'ve seen pointed out before, both videos feature children legitimately terrorized, which would be hard for a child to act convincingly.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>The videos in theory could be a form of mind control conditioning or breaking in trafficking victims (researched here on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">/v/pizzagate</a> as well), because the intent of coercing somebody into a small confined space and then basically hazing them with water, electricity, screaming, making them shout your designated name to establish dominance, and banging on the shower door is designed to break down the subject mentally. This can create learned helplessness, almost completely tuning out mentally (dissociation), and a breaking of the psyche (possibly fracturing into multiple personalities, schizophrenia, or other mental issues).</p>
<p>Lastly, this is the voice analysis I created last year of the very first fatherhood video (in the hopes that somebody with the right capabilities will be able to analyze it further):</p>
<p><a href="https://clyp.it/q5eebpc1">https://clyp.it/q5eebpc1</a></p>
<p>Does it sound like John Podesta to you?</p>
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>So in conclusion I\'d like to ask the community:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What do you think about the video from Worldcorpo of a male child being yelled at in the shower? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you think of the original fatherhood video?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this real child abuse? An intricate disinformation campaign?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if it\'s not John Podesta or the shower at Comet Ping Pong, I still feel that this has to do with Pizzagate because it displays the techniques traffickers can use to break down children mentally in order to fuel the demand for victims by elites.</p>
<p>I\'m hoping that we can discuss this civilly with the blessings of the mods as this can be a sensitive and polarizing subject.</p>',

            100% that kid was not acting.  It sounds like John Podesta and whoever it is deserves to get their ass thoroughly kicked or even hanged if they took their criminal behavior to its implied conclusion.  That is about as civil as I can phrase my reaction to that video.  As for "disinformation"...to what end?  It was a free video online so it couldn't be for a commercial purpose unless it was some advertisement for a kiddie Hostel.  It could be white hats but that doesn't help because as evidence it sucks from a legal perspective.  If someone could definitively voice print Mr. "I am your father" as John Podesta then we would have a useful tool.  As it stands the video and the website act more as a tool for psychological warfare against "normalcy".

            I suggest you read the source code of the pages. You can google the phrases and will find the source of all the text bits, often they come from  Google Books. These sites also contain the exact contact list that is supposed to have come from the Anothiny Weiner laptop (a more recent allegation).

            I think this information is very important.
As I mentioned in another comment thread, people think pizzagate is about pedophilia but it's not. It's much more complicated than that.
Basically, you can distill all the information we have gathered to be about "Adults who control babies and children". They do not like children, "at all" as James Alefantis said to IsThisGameOfThrones last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why control children?
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             MONARCH/MKULTRA program
            </li>
            <li>
             Brownstone operations
            </li>
            <li>
             False flags
            </li>
            <li>
             Providing Elites with grown compatible organs
            </li>
            <li>
             Management of supply chain A to Z
            </li>
            <li>
             Pedophilia
            </li>
            <li>
             Cannibalism
            </li>
            <li>
             Creating watchtowers (staffing government, entertainment, media with offsprings, legitimate or not.)
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Within these activities, the control of children is paramount.
           </p>
           <p>
            Using the word pedophile is misdirection for two reasons:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              People think pedophiles are very rare loners (An impression created dutifully by the media via movies like "Do you know the muffin man" and via the State Department's efforts to suppress child trafficking arrests or news thereof. In reality, we are dealing with a sophisticated ecosystem of businesses who collaborate nationally to control babies and children (Think The Finders).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              These people are more complex than just pedophiles. I call them Krampus monsters because they are not what the average person tinks about when they read the word pedophiles. They are not pedophobes either. They are a different kind of slaver and the thing that seems to link them together seems to be Satanism and Luciferianism. But then again, we have freedom of religion... And we could be dealing with a form of hipster ironic Satanism (because I know a lot of people who are ironic statanists, and that's also the case of the Church of Satan which is atheistic.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            So to get back to this video, it is incredibly important because it demonstrates exactly the kind of reconditioning that is done to children to confuse their mind. This seems to be something the brothers tout, their control of children and of the people in Washington. I believe they are the world leaders of La Mana Nera a Chicago based extortion mafia group. They simply seek to control influential people and then sell this influence.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Sorry going from memory, you can use my words to "google" the sauce)
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             On the Podesta Group website, one of the hero images in the slideshow is a child with super powers. (See Archive.org for podesta.com)
            </li>
            <li>
             In the hallways of the Podesta Group office is a photo of a naked child looking at a butterfly in a fabric cage.
            </li>
            <li>
             In the very symbolistic picture of Bill Clinton and Kim Jong Ill, you can see John Podesta's black hand.
            </li>
            <li>
             Heather Podesta (Miss Uranium One facilitator) once invited SC Justices to dinner. She wrote on her invitation to others that she would be serving the Judiciary for dinner. Diane Feinstein bit her head off over how distasteful this invitation was. (Wikileaks)
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            I hope we can come up with a more descriptive way of calling these people other than "pedophile", because people have a built-in dismissal system for this word.

             I feel these videos were made as a clue to tip us off. Is this the way they attract a generation just a little older? How many more could there be? There is many, all different kinds, for all different ages, it's absurd. There is even channels out there teaching young children cyptonology.

            Here is my take on that Disney funded cartoon at its reasoning it is aimed at children with english cyphers and seasonal recaps of infowars.  So when those children are adults and if we fail now, they can just accuse those adults as conspiracy theorist and hold their YouTube history up high.  You follow the money and see it is not lizards that have infiltrated the US Government but communists

            Or, Worldcorpo was stood up by someone affiliated with the NYPD/Weiner laptop.  They put it out there to let the actors know they have the goods.  In which case, the "insurance files", could have easily been used for content like this.

            It sounds like JP.  No way of establishing probability of likelihood without some audio analysis by an expert, and even then, I don't think you could establish higher than 60-70% match based on the quality.

            a little OT, but there was another website that came up about a year ago here by a guy called Randy Prozac who clearly had experience with MK Ultra, and this website is chockers full of MK ultra triggers
           </p>
           <p>
            Can I tell you, after I watched a bunch of stuff from this website, I forgot many of the passwords to my online accounts, no shit. Fried my brains that much.  Took me between a week and 2 weeks for the lost ones to gradually come back to me

             I was gonna post on /pizzagatewhatever this weird YT channel, but got super denied cuz of lacking CCP. The YT channel is called GLOBAL WORLDWIDE, has anyone else seen it before? An endless supply of suuuuper weird 30 sec videos that give off a weird MK-Ultra brainwash-y vibe - something def off about the whole operation, curious what others might think... check it out:

            </p>
            <p>
             Even just the name Global Worldwide reminds me of other weird sites like WorldCorp, Sentimental Corp. - there is something odd about the way they use these generic/harmless sounding names, like they're almost meant to sound so bland that no one would unassumingly happen upon them

             The stuff on sentimentalcorp.org, specifically the rituals, seems to be 'weaponized media' - clearly made with an understanding of how the mind responds to sounds/images/epileptic-y light pulsing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Honestly, I only made it thru maybe 9 seconds of one of those videos. I haven't felt that specific brand of terror since I was like 6 or 7 haha, shit is whack. But still I feel my hunch is correct, this wasn't made by someone with clean hands. Can you imagine the damage these sorts of videos would do to a scared child locked in a room alone, strapped up w a VR headset??
            </p>
            <p>
             Given how many pizzagate-specific references are found just on this weird website (pizza parties, disassociative idenity disorder, pegasus museum), I would say shit like this is a big deal. Regular people weren't meant to just stumble upon this stuff... I think these are tools made by traffickers/psychopaths for traffickers/psychopaths to utilize

              read the 2nd link interview with Randy, too, it was quite a headfuck as well.  I think this guy was a supersoldier that didnt turn out all that super and somehow he evaded being snuffed out.

               yeah yo there is def something going on w this dude. he's outrageously clever, I actually respect his super morose humor/way he talks - but just SOO nihilistic, it must be terrible to go thru life with just NO hope in anything bigger than yourself ha

               the jokes these people make all seem to come from that same place of negativity - I know that doesn't "auto-align" all these people but Alefantis, Magestic Ape, and all those weirdo pizzagate-y bands seem like they are part of similar cliques. even the weird jokes people like Podesta make can actually be clever....albeit mortifying

            The similarity is high. The probabiloty is low to middlin’. Regardless of who it is or where it is, it is clearly depraved abuse. It’s existence, and the website it came with, plus the context of the dialogue of the two adult men, are features of culture that we rarely get to consider. This is typically fodder for law enforcement, rarely found in public, outside of the den of sickos that make it. This is a warning for us. If this culture is brazen enough to make this public, it means that they perceive that their culture has political staying power. We do not want this to become commonplace. My opinion: the videos are combo of “how to break a new one”, “how we do it in our stable” type selling points, and also perhaps trophy vids.

            I believe that is a white hat site, It was a puzzle that spanned multiple sites actually. I was able to enter discord on one of the sites. I was told the kid was put in acid. It was not at Comet.  It had something to do with agent orange and the high conscience network.

              Worldcorpo, Synt, LHOHQ was part of cicada3301 and it branched out into just about every social network, including here, but this is only my opinion based on things I was told, and I studied them for months. They were connected by mentions, links, and imagery. All taught me about mind control.

                See and those videos that are posted by the "trolls" that are cryptic in nature here, that don't make sense. They're from cicada3301 to. I believe those videos are just merely reminders of things we know and a glimpse of things we don't yet understand. Just a different style of Q, and it takes effort, time and patience,  to piece it together. To some long term truthers these are a waste of time, it's things they know verbatim but to some its a refresher of how we got here and things they've forgotten.  This was alot to grasp in a short time.

                Your welcome.
I am not saying my theories are correct, so if you notice something I haven't,  or I am wrong about please let me know. I am very interested in knowing the truth behind this story.

                    Here is another ARG from the same people. Sounds like a victim or redpill your choice.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I know who the tech savy pedos are, and I have their screen names.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I know they used Nigeria for a testing site for frequency weapons.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    They're  talking about xxxtencion way before his skit on stage where he supposedly hung a white kid? This was intentionally signed onto to stir up chaos and with him they use technology to make him look disgruntled, dark and fedup.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If you google every term written, in that post you can get the bigger picture.

                Let's not forget that Monsanto is the company that made agent orange. And now they basically control our food supply and have tampered with it. about 80% or more of what is bought in grocery stores has been genetically modified. Do we really trust them when they say GMOs are perfectly safe and healthy?

            When this video came out last year I reported it to RSPCC here in the UK.  They asked me to send the link to them via email which I did.  I got a call from the Police about a week later asking where I got the link from and did I know anything about it.  I explained it was going round the internet and I did not know anymore about it other than it could be pizzagate related.  They seemed satisfied with that, and despite my contacting them again a few times they did not say another word about it to me.  I think it is disgusting and I would never go on another link from WorldCorpo once was disturbing enough for a lifetime! -  Good post.  ps. btw just some advice from someone who has been down the road with Are_We_Sure. Please ignore him, he enjoys annoying real pizzagate researchers and stealing time from them with his pro-pizzagate comments and defence of JA,JP etc.  I am shocked he is still around.  (I have blocked him, best remedy)   :)

            Thank you for posting this.  The whole topic of worldcorpo is fascinating.  Here are some thoughts, for what they might be worth.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, just focusing on the videos featuring audio of children in apparent distress, I'm thoroughly convinced that somewhere, somehow, a child was genuinely in distress and recorded.  Naturally there are truly excellent child actors out there, and I could be fooled.  I'm just guessing that this is real distress.  Once I assume that the distress is real, it makes sense to me to think of these videos as depicting child abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to the question of whether one of the voices is John Podesta, that seems unlikely to me.  The voice just doesn't sound right.  Probably it would be a good idea to check in with someone with a good ear for the finer points of regional accents of the New York / New Jersey area.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something I haven't seen discussed much is the greater context of the worldcorpo site.  The child abuse videos make up only a small portion of the content, and the rest of the content has much more of an ARG (game) type of feel to it.  If you haven't checked out the songs, do yourself a favor and listen.  I think they're hilarious.  I picture a nerdy short fat white guy who thinks he's a big deal rapping into a five dollar microphone along with some canned music loops, but it's so bad it's good.  I'm not sure if the creator of these songs is a good comic or a shitty rapper, but either way, they're kind of fun.  The rapper's voice sounds to be about a 23 year old male and doesn't sound at all like the bad guys in the child abuse videos.  Also, just so you know, the lyrical content of the songs has no connection to child abuse or anything pizzagate that I can tell.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm a fan of the Some Ordinary Gamers YouTube channel, particularly the Deep Web Browsing series.  The host (Mutahar Anas) ends up reviewing quite a number of dark web sites with a feel similar to that of worldcorpo.  Actually it might not be a bad idea to ask him if he would be willing to analyze the worldcorpo site.  He looks at code, content, context, and a lot of other things to make reasonable guesses as to who created the site and with what likely intention.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, those are my thoughts, for what they're worth.

             (which some theorized to be a Comet Ping Pong shower).

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This was always an insane theory.....but I don't think they thought it was a shower, but the colored lights of the Comet Ping Pong stage.   Either way it's an insane bit of confirmation bias as this whole theory is.   That guy does not sound like Podesta.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             uncanny resemblance to the voice of John Podesta who is one of the main figures of Pizzagate and allegedly linked to James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It does not resemble John Podesta.   And there's no allegedly about it.   Alefantis is good friends with Tony Podesta and certainly is friendly, if not a full friend of John Podesta.  When Alefantis hosted a political fundraiser, he emailed John Podesta and asked if he could stop by.  He didnt.
           </p>

            You are basically writing a script here, not neutrally examining evidence.  The evidence doesn't fit your conclusion, so you are coming up with an explanation that jams the square peg of the evidence into the round hole of your conclusion.

           <p>
            You do that again here

            OH MY GOD THAT AUDIO.     WOW.  just wow.  Does it sound like Podesta to me?  No.  It sounds like swooshes and squawks of milliseconds of audio edited together.

            It's genuinely hard to listen to, let alone discern anything.

             While I agree it's probably not podesta, I have compared it to a clip I heard of podesta screaming and it did sound like him. I think maybe you're not hearing that comparison so you're not seeing the similarities in it. Still the likely hood of it being John is slim to none. I have always looked at it as the shock factor gets people interested in the pizzagate topic and if that's the case whether it is real or not, it's a good thing.

               Yes, I have very strong feelings about the pictures I have seen of Chester and JP side by side.  Spitting Image. That's how I will describe it.  We also know he had an affair with Chester's mother as well.  Just Sayin'
