            Your shear waste of time defending your bullshit opinion rather than working with those who revealed this decades ago that made you aware whether you think so or not. People like me who turned on my superiors and beyond who have to live in the shadows trying to make things as obvious as we can. We are well aware of psy-ops but if you you had to go was psy-ops, you wouldn't know the difference. Somebody had to give you reason to question because no matter how god like you are, you are still a basic input output device.
           </p>
           <p>
            And believe me, I question absolutely everything, I come up with more theories in 5 minutes than I could write down in a life time. My ability to calculate a thousand variables in a heart beat has saved my life and others on many occasions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Without enough data, you can ponder scenarios till you're blue in the face without coming up with a logical explanation. Sometimes that data can be the smallest item from the way the wind blew a certain day to a photograph of somebodies smile when it shouldn't be! Suddenly your entire world changes.

            Again, you are the idiot. People don't join knowing these things! The only way YOU get to know is because people like me opt to become part of what is supposed to be an honorable system designed to help and serve the betterment of others such as you!
           </p>
           <p>
            And its people like you who have willful ignorance that vote for obvious frauds that compromise the system!
President Kennedy warned voters that the system was infiltrated, and voters kept on voting for more disasters.
Good people still have to join, still have to fight and still have to take risks to protect ignorant morons like you. If we don't, more infiltrators get in and you end up in the gulags! Or dead!

            Your comment wreaks of ignorance! 
Former agents, current agents, in whatever branch or nation who has investigated these pedophile networks do know whats been going on for decades and our survival is the best we can do. Because in the end, we are humans just like you and we are just as vulnerable.
           </p>
           <p>
            We don't even know who each other is to be able to band together and we wouldn't trust each other anyway as we don't know if they are counter agents trying to find us to kill us for what we know. And those still in the system, whistle-blowers, find out the hard way what it means to go against these pedo rings that own our systems. They destroy lives, kill, kidnap, and often times go after the families of the agents who know the truths.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those I worked with and trusted 30 years ago vanished. I don't know if they went deep to protect themselves as I have or if they are dead. This has to become public and the world needs to know everything, but right now, these people have full control of all aspects of government and I guarantee all files are being search and destroyed. The records President Kennedy saw that revealed the truth to him, his personal exercise in investigating the situation, all those records will be destroyed. WW2 records will be destroyed, WW1, the Bolshevik revolution etc etc.. This shit goes back 100's of years and its all related. This is a cult and it is big and deadly.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can not band together, but we can tell whats going on and what has been going on to give the WORLD the clues to follow this through! WE need HERO's too! It is up to the general public to take the ball and run with it and when you get it to the goal post, we will be here as the witnesses to help you make the touch down!
