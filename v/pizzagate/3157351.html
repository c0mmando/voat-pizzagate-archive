<p>Some vaccines can cause encephalopathy (brain swelling) which can result in AUTISM LIKE BEHAVIORS, according Hannah Polling\'s vaccine court case.  The autism rate has increased almost exponentially since 1987 when the NEW INCREASED vaccine schedule was rolled out by Dr. Orenstein through the CDC, THE YEAR AFTER THE 1986 law was passed absolving vaccine manufacturers from legal LIABILITY.

<p>CURRENT AUTISM NUMBERS SHOW NEW JERSEY HAS THE HIGHEST RATE (or better reporting):</p>
<p>\'The Garden State Grows.... Autism&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which uses research by Rutgers University, shows a significant increase in the percentage of 4-year-old children with autism spectrum disorder in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The study found the rate increased 43 percent from 2010 to 2014 in the state.</p>
<p>The report, released April 11, found that about one in 59 children has autism. New Jersey\'s rate was the highest of the states studied: one in 35. That puts the national rate of autism at 1.7 percent of the childhood population and New Jersey\'s autism rate at 3 percent.</p>
<p>…The analysis of this young group of children shows U.S. autism rates are continuing to rise without plateauing.&quot;

            I think they are using vaccines for population control. Check this out:
           </p>

            </h1>
            <p>
             The Centers for Disease Control reports that more than 12 percent of American women—one in eight—have trouble conceiving and bearing a child. Male fertility is plunging, too, and the trend is global. Something—or things—are robbing young women and men of their capacity to procreate and public health admits it doesn’t have a clue where to start to fix the emerging priority.7 Besides bantering about expanding access to costly and risky artificial reproductive technologies, very little is being done to discern the cause of the rising infertility crisis.8
            </p>
            <p>
             So, earlier this month, when an unprecedented study was released that looked at a database of more than eight million American women and singled out a whopping  25 percent increase in childlessness associated with one ubiquitous drug that young women have been taking for only a decade—in tandem with a marked decline in fecundity—you would have thought there would be significant interest from public health, the medical profession and the media, wouldn’t you?9
A Common Denominator Behind Growing Infertility Rates
            </p>
            <p>
             Instead, all three of these behemoths remain stone silent. The reason? Because the study, published in the current Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, examines the childbearing capacity of women who received the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine—compared to those who didn’t—and the results are chilling. No one in public health, medicine or mainstream media, which are tangled up in the money-making machine of this vaccine, dare to publicly question the “safe and effective” mantra they’ve promulgated about Merck and GSK pharmaceuticals’ “blockbuster” commodity worth billions.
            </p>
            <p>
             The study is by Gayle DeLong, associate professor of economics and finance, at Baruch College at City University of New York. She observed that the declining birth rate had plunged in America in recent years—from 118 per 1,000 in 2007, to 105 in 2015 for the cohort aged 25 to 29.
            </p>
            <p>
             The HPV vaccine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the US in 2006 to prevent cervical cancer—an illness women face a 0.6 percent lifetime risk of being diagnosed with. Although it is diagnosed most frequently at age 47 in the United States, it was rolled out en masse, initially targeting girls aged 11 to 26 (and has since been marketed to boys as young as nine to prevent rare anal and penile cancers—a disease that afflicts 0.2 percent of men in their lifetime.).10 11
            </p>
            <p>
             DeLong had read a case study in the British Medical Journal by Australian physicians Deirdre Little and Harvey Ward, who described a 16-year-old girl whose regular menstruation ceased after receiving HPV vaccinations and she was diagnosed with premature ovarian failure.12
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2014, the doctors published a case series of more teens who had entered premature menopause—a phenomenon Little and Ward described as ordinarily “so rare as to be also unknown.” They raised troubling questions about some vaccine ingredients’ documented impact on reproduction, cited serious deficiencies (some would say criminal negligence) in preliminary vaccine trials and concluded that further research was “urgently required… for the purposes of population health and public vaccine confidence.”13
            </p>
            <p>
             As well, between 2006 and 2014, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) cited 48 cases of ovarian damage associated with autoimmune reactions in HPV vaccine recipients. Between 2006 and May, 2018, VAERS catalogued other reproductive issues: spontaneous abortion (256 cases), amenorrhea (172 cases), and irregular menstruation (172 cases), all of which are likely under-reported symptoms.14

             Creators: Bill Gates vaccine development interview, somehow population control gets mixed in. 
People tried to defend Gates’ weird comments by suggesting if more children survive in third world countries, then mommy dogs wouldn’t have so many litters that we have to kill at the shelters
(No, they didn’t say “litters” of children...but I find “helpful hero racism” most disgusting and disingenuous)
Anyway Gates’ interviews about vaccine development -Africa creepy.

             Yes. Vaccines are a deep rabbit hole. Autism rates are higher in males, especially in African American males. Most with autism won't marry or reproduce. Read ALL the heartbreaking comments. THIS IS BEING SWEPT UNDER THE RUG.

             If you want to know the true history of modern vaccines, watch the 9 videos of top vaccine expert and inventor Dr. Stanley Plotkin's SWORN testimony. He wasn't expecting a 9 hour "discovery" under oath. Watch his expression and hand gestures. If you watch beginning to end in order, it all falls into place. You will also get to see a HIGHLY SKILLED attorney in action. He is BRILLIANT:

              "Dr. Plotkin, who was an instrumental figure in the development of rubella, polio, rabies, varicella, rotavirus, anthrax, and other vaccines, traces the serendipitous beginnings of vaccinology in the 1700s to its flowering in the latter half of the 20th century. Additionally, he highlights the relationship of vaccinology to industrial and technological developments, as well as the special role of Philadelphia institutions and researchers in vaccine development. Especially interesting is a description of an exchange with Albert B. Sabin, MD, at a scientific meeting in the late 1960s, when Sabin objected to Plotkin's (and others') use of cell lines derived from human fetal tissue. Plotkin replied, "I must say that despite my great and sincere respect for Dr. Sabin, I think the statements he has made are strictly ex cathedra and without a factual basis. So my conclusion is that what we are dealing with here is theology, and you see, in theology it is very difficult to disprove the existence of ghosts. But this is not, to my mind, a basis for making intellectual decisions.""
