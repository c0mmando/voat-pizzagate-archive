<p>Just when Israel\'s Barak is under scrutiny for his relationship with Epstein, it\'s Captain Chris to the rescue with a feel good movie about Israeli agents rescuing their black Ethiopian brethren and bringing them to the safe haven of Israel. </p>
<p>&quot;In the film Evans stars as Mossad agent Ari Kidron who, along with other undercover agents set up shop in a deserted holiday retreat -- the Red Sea Diving Resort in Sudan -- and use it as a front from which to smuggle Ethiopian refugees out of the war-ravaged county to safety in Israel.&quot;
&quot;The film is based on real events that took place from around the end of the 1970s and went through the 1980s...&quot;

<p>Pizzagate researchers will find &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;smuggled refugees&quot; to be a familiar theme.</p>
<p>But did these Ethiopian refugees have a happy ending, years later?  Some would say, no:</p>
<p>OOPS!
&quot;Israel Forcibly Injected African Immigrants with Birth Control, Report Claims&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This weekend, a report revealing that African women immigrating to Israel were subjected to mandatory contraceptive injections, effectively amounting to forced (if temporary) sterilization made global headlines.
Some 130,000 Ethiopians, most of them Jewish, live in Israel. The community experiences higher poverty and unemployment rates than the rest of the  country\'s Jewish population.  In the past decade, the birth rate among Ethiopian-Israelis has declined by at least 20 percent.  Advocacy groups now claim this decline is the result of a birth control regimen forced upon Ethiopian immigrant women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That Israel should allegedly engage in this activity is particularly shocking, considering the practice was widely used by the Germans throughout the Shoah. While the scale and effects of these operations cannot be compared, Israel’s implicit intent to limit ‘burdensome’ (read: undesirable) portions of the population recalls the dark eugenics experiments of World War II.&quot;
OUCH!
And this was written in Forbes!  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliseknutsen/2013/01/28/israel-foribly-injected-african-immigrant-women-with-birth-control/#e85d96f67b88">https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliseknutsen/2013/01/28/israel-foribly-injected-african-immigrant-women-with-birth-control/#e85d96f67b88</a></p>
