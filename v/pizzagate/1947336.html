<p>I believe this video needs quite a bit more attention - the victim here states among other things that iT IS BECAUSE OF CORY FELDMAN speaking out and victims coming forward that she has decided to speak up.   This is important - any work at exposure does have meaning and impact.   It\'s only been 6 months really since the wikileaks exposure - we are just at the beginning people!</p>
<p>Here is somewhat of a summary to help you get to the important parts if you can\'t listen to the whole thing.  You can skip to about 9 to forgoe some background info at the beginning but the whole video is very good, very well produced.   I like this guy, never heard of him before but he seems like a good new person to take on the task of publicly speaking about Pizzagate, pedogate and the whole ugly mess.  
</p>
<p>This is quite a story, and a bit different. <strong>At about 9:00 the woman starts speaking about being taken from her foster parents on occasion by a female pedophile LA area newscaster to be peddled sexually to other newscasters under the guise of &quot;babysitting&quot;</strong>. She speaks of a &quot;main newscaster&quot; that had a boat that is still alive - she was treated like <strong>a &quot;human party favor&quot;</strong> on his boat.  As for pedphiles &quot;...They exist, and are quite active and not only do they molest but they make children available for others.&quot;</p>
<p>At about 19:57 talks about being <strong>encouraged to run away to be groomed for someone higher up the chain</strong>   She insists, what Cory Feldman and others say is right, Hollywood is a <strong>candy store for pedofiles</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>21:00 - starts talking about being groomed at 14 for &quot;Jethro&quot; of the Bevery Hillbillies - Max Baer.</strong>  Wow. Never heard this before. &quot;He would have sex with her, she would have sex with me, yeah, it was a twisted scene..<strong>He was about 40, I was 14.&quot; He closed his Facebook account when she messaged him a few years ago.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Back...on the boats there would be other girls from the foster care, young girls.....<strong>They have been operating freely and in plain site</strong>, for 42 years that I know of.&quot;</p>
<p>around 26:00 She hopes to help even one person to know they are not alone and they can get out of it like she did. <strong>She says &quot;God restored my innocence. There are those that say this is impossible but it\'s not. God can give anything back.&quot;</strong>  This is an important message of healing to survivors.   I think this lady should speak more.</p>
<p>29 - &quot;Evil likes to hide in plain site. These pedophile networks are well known people. there\'s going to be plenty more names come out.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh wow - she is such a survivor -<strong>she laughs and says obviously she doesn\'t trust mainstream news - paraphrase -&quot;these people would take her out and have sex with her and other kids all day then go and report the news!!&quot;</strong> She says with a little sleuthing the names would be obvious.- she is not sure legally that she can say who it is. Anybody got a moment to figure out who was an LA female news anchor in 1974? Who was a main male anchor who owned a boat at the same time?</p>
<p>I am also really happy to hear that because she heard of Cory Feldman\'s story and other survivor stories she decided to speak about her story - shining sunlight on the filth! This means our hopes and our work does have an impact and survivors are finding strength in it!</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>

            VieBleu, THANK YOU for your perfectly worded email to David at America Talks.  I hope Debra will feel empowered by your outreach and realize there are many, many people who care.  She has not fallen through the cracks.  I hope David asks her whether she keeps in touch with any of the other girls who went through what she did.  If so, that could help tremendously with encouraging the "Cosby effect."

             Hey, I just looked at the video again - it is now captioned, was it before? - and at 12:48  Debra describes the female in question as "a network broadcaster for the Deaf that was on KP-TV in the early seventies..."  (?!)  The deaf?
            </p>
            <p>
             Did we miss that before?
            </p>
            <p>
             EDIT:  OK I can calm down - as I watched, the captions are cleary not checked for accuracy.  At one point at 15:00 Debra says "MK mind control" but the caption says "empty mind control" so the caption is an auto.  I bet "deaf" was like you said, more like "desk".     Sorry about that.  However she does say her foster parents thought the woman they were dealing with was a "celebrity" so she definitley had to have screen time.

              Oh, it was deaf!  That's where I thought she was saying "des" or "desk," but I didn't hear the "k."  I also thought she was saying KGTV here, although it did sound a little off, like KTGB or something.  KPTV is in Oregon, and KGTB is in Texas.  Can't find any reference to broadcasting for the deaf in connection with Lange or Purcell or KGTV and don't know what that would entail other than adding captions unless she was actually using sign language or was broadcasting with a sign interpreter on hand.  Might have been a short-lived program.

               check out the rest of my comment - I updated/edited it and take it back.  The captions are not accurate, i think you were right after all.

               Debra said her foster parents were excited because this person was a "celebrity" so she had to have screen time. Listening again I heard "dow" which you mentioned - a financial desk anchor who gave the stock reports on the evening news?

            Statute of limitations is 3-30 years. It's a free country in the USA and you can say what you want without legal ramifications as they have to PROVE the statements were false. Thanks libel and slander laws. If you make the statement of a crime committed by a person, and they don't like it, they have to prove they didn't do it, so technically guilty until proven innocent. VS. England where if you talk shit they just sue you.

             it's sordid, but your comment "Jethro, say it ain't so!" managed to give me a chuckle.  thanks.

             I really hope that Gilligan's Island, and pretty please - Bullwinkle and Rocky! are left out of all this.

            "Debra" identifies the Los Angeles area TV station as KGTV (a San Diego station) twice, at 12:45 and at 23:58.  Here is a list of former personalities at KGTV:
            <a href="http://www.thefullwiki.org/KGTV#wikipedia_Former">

            She says the woman was a network broadcaster for what sounds like "the des."  Maybe she said "the desk," I don't know.  If so, that is broadcasting lingo, and she could have picked it up at the boat parties.  She also says at 17:35 that she was a broadcaster for what sounds like "the dow" (financial reporter?).  Also, she was "in movies."  A great clue.  How many newscasters are also in movies?  She never actually says that the woman is an anchor.  Debra gives the impression that the abuser with the boat who was the "main anchor" also works at that station.  Jack White and Harold Greene both fall into the timeframe we're looking at, but Jack White seems to have been the main anchor during most of that time and was a fixture at KGTV
            <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/lifestyle/people/sdut-jack-white-was-san-diegos-anchorman-2013dec05-story.html">

            </a>
            whereas Harold Greene seems to have been a bit of a station hopper and served as reporter and co-anchor when he was at KGTV
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Greene_(journalist)">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Greene_(journalist)
            </a>
            Both men are said to have served as consultants on the movie Anchorman starring Will Ferrell.  Here's Jack White being interviewed about that:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZAaJPt5oVY">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZAaJPt5oVY
            </a>
            Here he is in 1976:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/277OGhkpVEs?t=323">
             https://youtu.be/277OGhkpVEs?t=323
            </a>
            We need to know whether he owned a boat back then.  Jack White was a magician and was president of the International Brotherhood of Magicians:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8tIyAjUr3c">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8tIyAjUr3c
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, IF Jack White is the guy, this video could be very useful.  It's a series of still shots of the people he likes to party with, up close, possibly including the mystery woman newscaster:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy6lRlnyr5M">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy6lRlnyr5M
            </a>
            It starts with "Jack White, Thanks for the Memories," and I can't help but be reminded of Brice Taylor's horrific account of her trafficking and mind control at the hands of the elite:

             Thank you for your close listening - yes there are more clues to parse more carefully.  Bears another closer listen.

             Maybe there will be a "Pedo Outing" movement getting started with revelations like these.  Jethro has effectiely been outed I'd say.

             Like you said, how many news desk girls are also actresses - I'm thinking Kelly Lange again hits all the numbers -

              I see what you mean about Kelly Lange, but I'm thinking Sarah Purcell might be the one because she was at some point with KGTV and Lange was not:
              <a href="http://www.thefullwiki.org/KGTV#wikipedia_Former">
               http://www.thefullwiki.org/KGTV#wikipedia_Former
              </a>
              In the early 70's, she was a weatherperson for KFMB in San Diego.  See the third paragraph here:
              <a href="http://people.com/archive/when-she-gained-tvs-real-people-sarah-purcell-shed-her-man-vol-13-no-11/">
               http://people.com/archive/when-she-gained-tvs-real-people-sarah-purcell-shed-her-man-vol-13-no-11/
              </a>
              She called what she did newscasting.  It looks like she moved to KABC in Los Angeles to co-anchor the morning show with Regis Philbin, but they both have also worked at KGTV.  Sarah Purcell is also an actress and has been in movies.

             </p>
             <p>
              AND she appears to be quite involved with Big Brothers Big Sisters in LA (scroll down to Photo Albums):

               i'm with you on this one! Sarah Purcell looks like a good candidate! she also had a director hubby... as your article above shows... was an actress as well, and is still well known and involved (as the testimony stated).... except for cronkite and walters, i don't recognize any of the anochor names here EXCEPT sarah purcell! i remember her very well, and from her charity works she remained involved with celebrities. interesting info on her real name and affluent childhood in the article above....mama was a stockbroker and dad anesthesiologist, big power connections here!!! $$$ lots of possibilities, should look into her parents too...
            "Fittingly, the “Protestant work ethic” was stressed during her affluent San Diego childhood. She was born Sarah Pentecost in Richmond, Ind., the youngest of three children of an anesthesiologist father and stockbroker mother. She dropped out of L.A.’s Woodbury University for secretarial work and then toured through Europe. Her meeting in Spain with her future husband was Hemingwayesque. “We were in Pamplona for the running of the bulls, and he offered me a glass of champagne on a street corner.”

            This is very important for those who continue to claim that there are no victims coming forward.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with you, the longer this is kept in the public eye, and public are educated, the more people will come forward.

            , I pushed the button extra hard!  This is  excellent information and very well written!  It's fascinating and grotesque at the same time.  The crimes against children sicken me.  I want all of the bad guys exposed.  START NAMING NAMES, PEOPLE!   I say that to the victims with all due respect.  Please name names and let's get on with it!

             I so agree about the naming names.  I think this is part of the concept that the whole society is actually abused, in shock and is just coming to real awareness.  At first it is hard to get to the nitty gritty, even talk about details, but as time marches on, and oh it will abusers, I think it will be more commonplace to fill in details when appropriate and certainly to start naming names.
            </p>
            <p>
             it seems like there is still fear of legal repercussions, even when one knows what happened.  If you can't prove it, can't you lose everything you've worked so hard for?  We know most pedos will stop at nothing to preserve their lifestyle and name. I think that is what goes on in their minds.  Consulting with lawyers is expensive and time consuming.  I hope this area becomes more clear and gains pro bono legal aid for survivors that is easily available.    thanks for your comment.

              Yes, I agree.  Let them come forward for we shall stand behind them.  There is no shame for the victim.  It is all on the perpetrator. We need to make them feel we have their back.

                 no, not you,  there was a person awhile back who hammered  Feldman for not standing up. It was ugly.  I mentioned that in  agreement to the reference  that people need to be kind to victims.

               They need that definitely, and they need legal advice - very practical, professional legal advice.
              </p>
              <p>
               We need advocates in the legal community to offer individual advice, and also to write something to give general guidelines on legal liabilities for speaking out decades later, when the evidence is long gone.

                They need to pass a law that will get ride of the statute of limitations on child sexual abuse. It is long overdue.  Can Trump do something about this with his Executive Orders?  This I am not that familiar with.  Something needs to be done to help them, yes.

                 Very very good point - just get rid of SOL for the crime of pedophilia.  Politicians who would talk like this on the local, state and Congressional level would win landslide elections.  (Except for all the pedos that would vote against them - and we know there are a lot! damm)

                  Just think.  We would then know exactly who the bad guys are!  Hey you out there, if you want to run for office you would have it made, until you are shot at a morning baseball practice.  This must be done by the President, if at all possible. I cannot see it passing in the House or Senate.  Although, the Bill backed by Scalise on human trafficking passed in the House, it is coming up in the Senate.  They did not want him around to pressure his colleagues. There are others though that are backing it as well.  Let's hope it passes.

            Just curious if Jodie Foster was also a victim of pedophiles in Hollywood. Maybe that would explain why she became a lesbian.

             Huh?!?  Can you elaborate on this question? What does lesbianism have to do with pedophilia and furthermore, people do not "become" gay or heterosexual. One is born one way or the other. You may not like it, but get your facts straight.   One's sexual preference or orientation is an innate quality, as is  one's gender identity. Again, you may not like it or understand it, but those are the facts. Don't make this investigation look idiotic or it will lose credibility.  Because pedophilia is definitely not defensible, as young children do not have a say. Any effort to normalize it is obviously of great concern even though pedophiles have a sickness and need/deserve treatment, children are innocent, period and need to be protected until they are mature enough to know where they fall on the gender and sexuality spectrum.  So, do not say that I am normalizing pedophilia, just because I have a correct understanding of sexual orientation and sexual identity.

              !! i don't hear any 'assumptions' in your statement, unlike those of Sharipie which are chock full. The first of which was that someone's 'lesbianism' would need an explanation. we will never defeat the oppression of the elites, until we see the division they sow and reject it. we are one people. love is all that matters.

              No it is not.  Period.  Full Stop. Stop it, in fact.  Sharipie is not only correct in his observation your thought policing is antidemocratic and authoritarian.

              It wasn't a question. And since you and I are coming from places of totally different assumptions about sexuality and gender, I bid you adieu. Sorry. I just can't deal with your level of liberalism.

             good grief! really?? plenty of straight women molested and raped too!
 though i do think she had to have been through it, she was around from so young and then taxi driver! but could be why she is so shy and stays completely out of public eye....

              reread my post and you'll see that I wasn't implying all women who are molested become lesbians. Since you are confused I was talking about one particular lesbian who I speculated may have been a victim of pedos since she was in the pedos den from an early age as we all know. I will say that to a woman, every lesbian I know personally was molested. Which is different than saying anyone who is molested must become a lesbian. Sheesh.

                Wake up and realize that you've been indoctrinated to be offended by almost everything except what the Establishment tells you is ok at any given point in time. Once you become aware of it you will feel free (maybe for the first time in your life). Having your own thoughts is a liberating thing.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's not that I object to people having differing opinions. But I am personally upset when I see someone who is so deep in the indoctrination and just refuses to be open when we try to awaken them. I'm sure you are not that far gone.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's imperative that we wake people up right now, but the most resistant at this point have to be left by the wayside. I really don't mean to offend you.

                Hope you have a beautiful day/week/life.

                 ha. ha. ha. one of us is certainly indoctrinated, and it ain't me sweet cakes-
i find it amusing how easily you dispense opinions and 'knowledge' about things you obviously know nada about. 
i have been woke since childhood. i am well- taught and well-read, not to mention curious. consciousness is my vocabulary, conscientiousness my soul. indoctrinated is one thing i have never been- in as much as any american can avoid in this ethnocentric, consumerist culture that is...
(maybe don't try and tell an invisible stranger about themselves. stick to the facts, and always be ready to learn new ones from other amazing humans)

            <p>
             Now, think about Foster being tied to the Reagan assassination by Hinkley's supposed psychotic fantasies.  Hinkley Jr. was the son of one of VP HW Bush's closest friends and business associates, John Hinkley Sr.

              Hollywood connected to assassination of leaders - happens quite a bit from Griffin's tasteless comedy re: head of President Trump to the movie "The Interview", "Manchurian Candidate" and on and on.   It has been said the CIA has been embedded in Hollywood since at least WW2.

              Wow! They really thought they were being sly apparently. What are your thoughts on the Hinkley connection? the Jodie Foster infatuation story was pure BS, but why would they use her instead of any other actress?

               I don't have absolute proof, but I now believe Foster was used to brainwash Hinkley into shooting Reagan. I already know it was a designed hit, given Hinkley Jr's attachment to his fathers 'charity', World Vision ( Mark David Chapman, Lennon's assassin also spent time with WV ). Hinkley could have been obsessed with ANYONE, if he was really insane. But the plot needed the Foster element to shift the narrative away from the Bush/Hinkley connection.  And that is exactly what happened.

             You can be a lesbian without having been a victim of pedophilia - just to be clear.
            </p>
            <p>
             Foster was sexualized eary by men - "Pretty Baby" movie case in point and that's probably the tip of the iceberg.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit - yes sorry mixed up pretty baby with "Taxi Driver" - got my oversexualized 70s movies mixed up - ugh.  Poor Brooke Shields, maybe her mother protected her some, although she also put her right out there.  Another Hollywood story.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do believe being sexualized and used as a youngster by men CAN lead to females turning to other women as sexual objects of desire, in part because of a sense of safety.   Sexuality is complicated.

               I do not make comments to school you, but rather I view a board as something that will be up for all time with readers that will read through for who knows how many days, weeks or years.  It is a comment thrown into the discussion as crystal clear clarification, and not an assumption about your beliefs - sorry for that misunderstanding, but your comment implies direct causality.
              </p>
              <p>
               On your part, you assume and accuse arrogance, when just clarifying your comment would be more helpful.

             You are right, it is HMMMM - Sharon Tate?

            <p>
             Interesting line of inquiry - In this video, this survivor Debra does briefly speak about being around some of the Manson family when she was very young- points to a loosely organized (?) ring sharing children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mansons &gt; Foster parents &gt; Newscaster &gt; Max Baer
            </p>
            <p>
             One can speculate that perhaps the important female newscaster pedophile knew the Manson family or at least some of their associates?    The Manson family would have been in the business of providing drugs and children/young teens to important Hollywood pedophiles for $ and to get favors.  Charlie Manson considered himself an up and coming musician.

              She was apparently so dumb she didn't know when she was in line to get a job application.  She was apparently put in a silver lame tight suit and put in a helicopter to sell sex instead of news. Her husband directed "The Exorcist", "Sorcerer", "To Live and Die in LA" and "Cruisin'" among many other films.

              I'd say she has the kind of credentials to be a candidate for the person we are trying to identify.  "In Southern California, she served as co-anchor for nightly newscasts at KNBC-TV from 1971-1999."
