<p><strong>Who is Lord Justice Fulford?</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Fulford">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Fulford</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sir Adrian Bruce Fulford PC QC (born 8 January 1953), styled The Rt Hon. Lord Justice Fulford, is a Lord Justice of Appeal and as of 3 March 2017 holds the position of Investigatory Powers Commissioner. </p>
<p>In March 2014, an article in** the Mail on Sunday alleged that Fulford had been a supporter of the Paedophile Information Exchange in the 1970s**.[14]</p>
<p>After these allegations, he stepped down from judging criminal cases and an official investigation by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office took place. The investigation, by <strong>Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore</strong>, concluded on 18 June 2014 that the allegations against Fulford were &quot;without substance&quot; and he &quot;was not and had never been a supporter of PIE or its aims&quot;.[15] Following his exoneration, Fulford resumed sitting as a judge on the full range of appeals.</p>

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An investigation by the Mail on Sunday has discovered that Fulford was a founder member of a campaign to defend PIE while it was openly calling for the age of consent to be lowered to just four.</p>
<p><strong>Fulford was a founder member of an organisation called Conspiracy Against Public Morals set up to defend PIE leaders facing criminal charges.</strong> </p>
<p>It later published a sickening pamphlet claiming that children would be freed from the oppression of the state and their parents if they were allowed to have sex with adults. </p>
<p><strong>Last year he was nominated as an Appeal Court judge by David Cameron</strong> and appointed to the Privy Council, the elite group of senior politicians, judges and clergy who advise the Queen on constitutional matters.</p>

            Glad to see this is being documented in detail, but it was obvious the minute the Snowden revelations hit. The fact that they can see everything and everyone and what is on their phones and computers means they have the power to shut down pedophiles, yet it is happening to more and more kids every year. The only common sense conclusion is that Five Eyes is full of pedos. And really, if you get off on child rape, what better job would there be?

                This really scared me.  I had to stop when I read he was allowed in the hospitals, although I have read about his trips to the Children's Hosp.  Nauseating.  "The only surprising thing about his knighthood is how long it has taken him to get it. He has been raising money for charity for at least 20 years – more than £30m at last count – and Stoke Mandeville’s National Spinal Injuries Centre is almost entirely a result of his efforts. The day after I met him, he was going to open yet another £2m donation to the hospital – a new magnetic resonance imager which for the first time will enable surgeons to see the spinal cord as well as the spinal column, with no side effects to the patient."

            OP is a perfect example of why women are not meant for decision-making.
           </p>
           <p>
            she is a diligent and productive researcher yet always opts to ask questions rather than draw decisive conclusions.  or she secretly knows that what ties all her threads together and the people mentioned therein is JUDAISM but lacks the courage to say so, afraid of being labeled "shill".  but you cant break up a gang without identifying the basis on which they group together and labeling it, so 100% of her admirable work is utterly pointless.  kinda sad

             Once again, I know it has to be very damaging for a pudgy, awkward, kid to have a truck stop ho for a mom, especially when said mom would rather blow stinky ass truck drivers than hug her own son, but you really can't keep blaming all women for the shortcomings of that crack ho. You're an adult now donkey, it's time to man up and get some help processing your childhood. Stop blaming ho-mom, she did the best she could 😂😂😂.
