Last year, a post by entylawyer on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O\'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death. Warning, this is a very stomach churning lead!</p>

<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kZO1mewbM_g">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kZO1mewbM_g</a> A preview to an upcoming video about Heather O’Rourke. Got a tip about a possible sign of sexual abuse. Look at the 15 second mark. The red under her eyes, which still shows up despite the make up trying to cover it. I’ve been digging as to what could be the cause of that red. Right now I just have a guess. </p>
<p>🚨What is the time stamp of the photo in the 15 second mark? This is possible forensic evidence that can ID a culprit. 🚨</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24556565/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/24556565/</a> Phthiriasis palpebrarum infection in children is a red flag to sexual abuse. Caused by Phthiriasis pubis (the species name for pubic lice). Symptoms are swelling and redness around the eyes. Head lice do NOT colonize eyelashes and eyelids. Pubic lice do. Most likely route of transmission being oral rape.</p>

<p><a href="http://magaimg.net/img/7u72.jpg">http://magaimg.net/img/7u72.jpg</a> Of course the Pedostas know what happened to Heather O’Rourke.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-heather-orourke-poltergeist-iii-1988-39626336.html">https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-heather-orourke-poltergeist-iii-1988-39626336.html</a> Compare Heather O’Rourke’s garb in Poltergeist 3 to the child on the right. Not an exact match, but very similar.</p>
<p><a href="https://unit70.com/ecom/">https://unit70.com/ecom/</a> The source of that “prop” in the Pedosta’s collection. </p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T5PVBz1QvuI">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T5PVBz1QvuI</a> Those props are designed to be animated and scream. It would appear that customization options are availible in terms of the pjs the children wear. The company is upfront about doing custom work for customers afterall.</p>
<p>Commentary: I do not have reason to believe that Unit 70 is up to no good. Legitimate business regarding horror based attractions does exist (which is what they make their wares for). Context is everything. Compare the image above with the rest of the Podesta’s art collection. This gives me the conclusion that it was the Podestas that made the custom order for the Heather O’Rourke style pjs.</p>

Suspected victim of Steven Spielberg (was about 13 when she filmed Jurassic Park). Seems to suggest an MO to the kind of girls Spielberg targets. Looks a lot like an older Judith Barsi.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is something that has bugged me for a while.</p>
<p>If the Neon Nattle article about Heather being skinned is 100% fake, why did “they” go so apeshit scrubbing all traces of it? Why did MacCauley Culkin receive threats shortly afterwards (this is on a CDAN)? Why did Gabe Hoffman act up shortly after the 3rd culprit was ID’D? Why the attempted False Flag in August? I believe I may be able to reconcile these things.</p>
<p>Theory: The drunk (NN) accidentally hit real paydirt. There are legit kernals of truth in there that freaked “them” out.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>MacCauley Culkin knows who killed Heather. He follows this investigation (I have proof of this).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pedowood has a “red shoe club”. I indepently verified that the alleged skinning is physically possible (below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There were enough clues in there to ID one of the people who killed her.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic. </p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler. </p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           A preview to an upcoming video about Heather O’Rourke. Got a tip about a possible sign of sexual abuse. Look at the 15 second mark. The red under her eyes, which still shows up despite the make up trying to cover it. I’ve been digging as to what could be the cause of that red. Right now I just have a guess.
          </p>
          <p>
           🚨What is the time stamp of the photo in the 15 second mark? This is possible forensic evidence that can ID a culprit. 🚨

           Signs of sexual abuse can even occur around the eyes of children.

           Phthiriasis palpebrarum infection in children is a red flag to sexual abuse. Caused by Phthiriasis pubis (the species name for pubic lice). Symptoms are swelling and redness around the eyes. Head lice do NOT colonize eyelashes and eyelids. Pubic lice do. Most likely route of transmission being oral rape.

           Spielberg apparently raped his 13 year old cousin.

           Of course the Pedostas know what happened to Heather O’Rourke.

           Compare Heather O’Rourke’s garb in Poltergeist 3 to the child on the right. Not an exact match, but very similar.

           Those props are designed to be animated and scream. It would appear that customization options are availible in terms of the pjs the children wear. The company is upfront about doing custom work for customers afterall.
          </p>
          <p>
           Commentary: I do not have reason to believe that Unit 70 is up to no good. Legitimate business regarding horror based attractions does exist (which is what they make their wares for). Context is everything. Compare the image above with the rest of the Podesta’s art collection. This gives me the conclusion that it was the Podestas that made the custom order for the Heather O’Rourke style pjs.

           Ariana Richards. Suspected victim of Steven Spielberg (was about 13 when she filmed Jurassic Park). Seems to suggest an MO to the kind of girls Spielberg targets. Looks a lot like an older Judith Barsi.

           Lastly, there is something that has bugged me for a while.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the Neon Nattle article about Heather being skinned is 100% fake, why did “they” go so apeshit scrubbing all traces of it? Why did MacCauley Culkin receive threats shortly afterwards (this is on a CDAN)? Why did Gabe Hoffman act up shortly after the 3rd culprit was ID’D? Why the attempted False Flag in August? I believe I may be able to reconcile these things.
          </p>
          <p>
           Theory: The drunk (NN) accidentally hit real paydirt. There are legit kernals of truth in there that freaked “them” out.
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <p>
             MacCauley Culkin knows who killed Heather. He follows this investigation (I have proof of this).
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Pedowood has a “red shoe club”. I indepently verified that the alleged skinning is physically possible (below).
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             There were enough clues in there to ID one of the people who killed her.
            </p>
           </li>
          </ol>

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.

            DK, I read a blind a while back (can’t find it) that spoke to
            <strong>
             Macaulay
            </strong>
            still being prone to dark rages every once in a while where he lashes out at his girlfriend (actress
            <strong>
             Brenda Song
            </strong>
            , who used to be engaged to Miley Cyrus’ brother) and screams about being abused by Pedowood Elite, Heather, SS and so on.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brenda usually calms him down but then gets stressed out herself and tells her girlfriends (who tell other folk, hence story got leaked.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Wonder if Mac or Drew B will ever be “Kappy-ed” at some point.

              Yes, that is the answer.  Whether they are still useful to them.  Or they become a huge liability.  Then it's curtains.

            you’re going to have to do something about the Wisconsin troll. It’s putting a lot of folk off (including myself) and I’m really sick of having to scroll past this shit that takes up HALF A PAGE and buries other, more valuable commentary.

            Somehow you banned Jem777 but this fucker stays? Logic?

             TTT is too chickenshit to actually make any research submissions with their bot diarrhea (one way we know they are not legit contributors). Users have to downvote the shitposts. Four downvotes collapses their content.

             Have you tried blocking them so you can't see their content or get their replies in your inbox? You can do that on their profile page.

                 462, now. I save them, thinking I might need to come back to them. Every now and again, I'm glad I did (and others aren't!). :-) You should see my basement. If Voat allowed me to search my inbox, the shills would have a very bad time.

                  As soon as I wrap my head around actually connecting via the api, I'll get to work on searching one's inbox.

                   Everyone who uses your program would need to get their own api key and the api has the same limits on messages as the website does.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   As for templates, I doubt there is one. You can do a search for the programming language you plan on using + "search text" though.

             Jem777 was banned, because she frequently posted submissions that were against the rules.
            </p>
            <p>
             comments, on the other hand, are sacred on Voat, as long as they are not spam, cp, or are doxxing someone.
            </p>
            <p>
             In order to be banned for spam, he would need to spam the same comment over and over again, from what I understand.

             TL;DR he cannot be banned for his comments here.  My suggestion would be to downvoat comments that you don't like, and ignore them as far as possible.

                ​As sustainable development has evolved to the point where the teaching of Agenda 21 is called "Earth Sciences" in schools, universities, and colleges, our government has instituted Agenda 21 through the Presidents Commission on Sustainable Development. Throughout the U.S., there are cities that have adopted Agenda 21 and there are those that are now sustainable, such as "Sustainable Racine." We must remember Russia did not fall to the communists all at once-it was city by city.

                More spectacularly, the State Department established the Art in Embassies program in 1964 which sought to turn U.S. embassies into small art galleries. In 1962, Edward R. Murrow who was then director of the USIA proclaimed "a new and, I think, significant development" in terms of art patronage in the United States. He was particularly excited about the offer by S. C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. (the floor wax giant) to send its large collection of contemporary art around the world, sponsored by USIA.
