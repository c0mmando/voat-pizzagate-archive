<p>Trafficking Aborted Baby Body Parts May Be Raking in US Tax Dollars (Graphic Video)</p>
<p>An organization harvesting aborted baby organs for research has been charging more than what is reimbursable, a new report shows. </p>
<p>Warning - Graphic Content: As soon has you open the link you will see 2 tiny babies.  It\'s not just in the video.  
</p>
<p>The report details how Advanced Bioscience Resources, Inc. (ABR) charged universities a significant price for the organs it harvested from aborted babies.</p>
<p>ABR is currently under investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/08/justice-department-planned-parenthood-fetal-tissue-transfers-215999">https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/08/justice-department-planned-parenthood-fetal-tissue-transfers-215999</a></p>
<p>Federal law prohibits the sale or purchase of fetal tissue — human body parts harvested from pre-born or aborted babies — for “valuable consideration.” The law does allow reimbursing baby body part suppliers for costs “associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.”</p>
<p>This is what undercover videos showed Planned Parenthood using to make money from human remains.</p>
<p>ABR charged researchers hundreds of dollars per harvested human organ plus packing and shipping fees — prices that indicate the organization may have been marking up the cost of fetal tissue beyond what is legally reimbursable, per The Center for Medical Progress released report. </p>
<p>CMP obtained invoices that show ABR charged the University of Wisconsin-Madison $680 for two eyeballs from a second-trimester baby in 2015. </p>
<p>An invoice from the University of Colorado showed the rate for a single eyeball was $340. </p>
<p>“ABR’s customer invoices show ABR charging the customer double if two eyeballs were harvested from the same baby—even though the ABR technician would harvest both from the same skull at the same time, and the eyeballs would be packaged together as one shipment! The invoices show ABR routinely shipped multiple body parts together in one package, charging a single shipping reimbursement for the order, but multiple specimen charges for each body part.”</p>
<p>ABR billed a University of Utah customer $12,000 for two unsuccessful attempts to harvest organs from babies that were aborted in January 2015. When the researcher objected to these huge charges, ABR replied that they were only asking for reimbursement for their costs:</p>
<p>“The clinic charges us for the time, space and utilities for the two day minimum that we are in the clinic for the RTA, for Phases 1 &amp; 2, which on its own is a fee of $500…If there is no suitable tissue acquired, which is always an unfortunate possibility, the labor and time-intensive work on behalf of [Redacted] has still be done and performed in good faith that ABR would be reimbursed for the work.”</p>
<p>The researcher wrote back:</p>
<p>“I calculated the costs for travel, hotel, time, food, personnel time, clinic fees and some overhead in the scenario of a non-useable product and I figured your costs to be around $3,000. Therefore, instead of charging the full $6,000 or $7,000, I would recommend $3,000.”</p>
<p>ABR finally agreed, writing: </p>
<p>“We are willing to accept the decreased amount of $3500, to cover our costs.” Had the researcher not objected, it appears ABR would have pocketed an additional $8,500.</p>
<p>that on July 25, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration signed a contract with ABR to acquire “fresh” human fetal tissue to transplant into “humanized mice” so that these mice will have a functioning “human immune system,”</p>
<p>The taxpayer-funded project includes paying nearly $16,000 for ABR-harvested organs. Please keep in mind that the organization remains under investigation by the DOJ. </p>
<p>Contract details are available from the FDA and from the Congressional Research Service .</p>
<p>In a statement, the FDA said that ABR has ‘provided assurances with all applicable legal requirements relating to research involving human fetal tissue’ and that the FDA is not involved with how ABR sources the tissue. The FDA appears to be taking ABR at its word, despite the findings of congressional investigations.</p>
<p>While it isn’t clear if ABR is currently charging more than what is reimbursable, as it looks to have done in 2015, the FDA appears to be taking them at their word, even though the organization is under federal investigation.</p>
<p>Pizzagate related in that our govt. has been allowing this to happen.  The killing of babies.  Our Children.  The FDA is letting this slide even though ABR is under investigation by the DOJ.  It is against the law to sell Baby Body Parts.</p>',

             This world is made of some really sick morons that are so money hungry they have not any morals and it seems like nothing is sinful to them.  Soros is invested in the company that does 80% of the abortions in this country.  Imagine that kind of money.  Boggles the Mind.  It's all about the power.  I believe Bezos is the next Soros.  People don't realize when they buy from Amazon what they are building up.

                Yeah people sign up to be surveilled. Craziness. My husband's professor confirmed the whole smart TV camera thing and my family finally believes me about that. Before that they thought I was looney even though it's on Wikileaks, they don't care... LOL.

                  The surveillance cameras may not need the TV to be on for it to work. We had one but it broke. I heard it's Vizio and Samsung, but that's probably just the ones we know about. Prof says people in Asia actually sit there and watch others on the camera doing all kinds of unclothed activities like a bunch of pervs. I wouldn't want my butt on anyone's screen. Super pisses me off that they can get away with this. Have you ever watched "Snowden?" Watching him realize the CIA had access to spy on everyone all the time... kind of like imagining what it would be like to be one of my own family members who doesn't believe any of this and then one day finally has to.

                   I saw the movie, yes.  My jaw dropped open.  But they only let us see what they wanted us to see. There is so much more.  Some in my family think I am nuts.  They think they are so smart because they are younger and went to college.  They look at me like, Oh yeah, uh huh, Really?  Humoring me.  I want to Smack them.

             Yeah, we had a post on here about a movie with real actors, not a cartoon from 1914 and they threw a real baby into the fire as a sacrifice to the god.  Someone said it was Canaanite as well.  It is their way of keeping up their old sick satanic traditions.

            Something I didn't know: "Aborted" babies are not always dead babies when it comes to harvesting their cells for vaccines:'
           </p>
           <p>
            The tissues were obtained from a live aborted fetus! “They further noted how they induced labor using a “water bag” abortion to shorten the delivery time and prevent the death of the fetus to ensure live intact organs which were immediately sent to the labs for cell preparation.”

             Yes.  I have read this before.  Imagine what they are doing to those babies while they are alive.  Heartbreaking and Stomach Turning.  These people are committing torture and SRA and murder, imo.  If that seems harsh, I am sorry.  They have lied to the American people about how they are not babies just like a little dot.  BS.

            Don't know how the people involved in the chain of custody of baby body parts from abortion to delivery at research centers can sleep at night. I couldn't stand looking at the formaldehyde embalmed baby specimens in the college anatomy lab.

            What goes round, comes round: there are studies apparently now saying that fetal cells in vaccines are causing autism.

             That would make sense because in many trials taking fetal cells and transplanting them into damaged organs (hoping that the stem cells would regenerate the organ) the cells created cancer masses because they regenerated haphazardly. Why are they putting fetal cells into vaccines when they know that fetal cells can cause cancer?

              "They" think fetal DNA has less chance of introducing cancer causing viruses than animal cells. Polio vaccines were grown on monkey kidney broth leading to Simian viruses implanted in many of us.

             Not surprised at any of the autism connection to vaccines.  As far as sleeping, these people make so much money from this disgusting biz and come use to their lifestyle.  You and I surely are already disgusted and laying my head on a pillow at night, I can't even.  Scares me that there are these kind of people walking this earth.

            Wow, what an eye-opener.  I bet 99% of women undergoing an abortion are unaware of this travesty. I would like to see anti-abortion advocates focus on educating women about this, if they are not already doing so.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could envision some legislation that requires disclosure  on a consent form and permitting a woman.to allow recovering of only the umbilical cord while  mandating some kind of dignified disposal of the remains of the fetus.  I remain an adocate of abortion but I am in favor of  lots of restrictions.  If such restrictions cannot be achieved by an individual (ie, 1st trimester only) , then the woman needs to "man up"  and face  the consequences by completing the pregnancy and  arranging for adoption.

             hi, just wanted to respond to this, for what it's worth . i am a former planned parenthood clinic employee (emphasis on 'former') and from what i gathered (along with what i was officially told), the cash-for-baby-parts agreements are the exception rather than the rule; i personally witnessed all kinds of parts (euphemistically referred to as 'product of conception' or 'POC') that was packaged up and stored in a freezer for pickup by stericycle, who were then responsible for incinerating it.
            </p>
            <p>
             i always did wonder a bit about stericycle.... they are responsible for processing god knows how much of the medical 'waste' in this country. i wonder if anything ever 'fell off the truck' on the way to the incinerator ? ... total speculation on my part. but, let's say that if there were some sort of a demand for a nondescript sort of 'tissue slurry' ... not sure what the effect of deep freeze would have ... but i did always think, rather morbidly (well.  it's a gallon of dead babies, after all), as i was putting the day's container in the freezer that surely , somebody somewhere would pay good money for this.....

            Human fetal tissue has stem cells that can turn into ANYTHING.  That is why they are so valuable.  The stem cells can be obtained from a grown human, but they are never as powerful as embryonic stem cells.  In most of the studies using stem cells both adult and embryonic stem cells are tested to see how they perform. As embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated, they can be put anywhere in the body.  But a fetus has to be aborted for these to be acquired. Not good.

             I thought they could also get the same stem cells from cord blood? That's why parents bank their baby's cord blood shortly after birth because it can be used later in life should the baby suffer any health concerns? A baby doesn't need to be killed to her the cord blood, but we know killing a baby is an added bonus for these sickos.

              Cord stem cells are multipotent but fetal stem cells are pluripotent. Aborted baby cells are much more powerful because they can turn into anything (except a baby). Here's the difference:

                 I think that they have been able to replicate cells using stem cells from teeth. That may be the dental chair / pulling teeth connection to some of the abusive imagery we've seen in Elsagate videos and Jeffrey Epstein's home.

             This is beyond disgusting.  I can't even think about all the money they are making from this. Stomach churning.  No wonder they want to keep people as poor as they can.  Knowledge and Education is power.  Who are the women that are providing these these poor little babies?  Just typing these words makes me sick and cry.  These people are monsters, imo.

              I absolutely agree: education is power. That's why the US has a poor education system. I think it wants to keep its masses disempowered and unable to think critically.

               They have been working at wrecking our education for about 30 years now I believe. Slowly at first.  This is how they do things.  Incrementally. So we don't notice.  Then BOOM here we are.  I think they are not done with us yet.  It's really disgusting.  When people realize what has happened, it will be too hard to turn around.  It will take at least 100 yrs to undo what they did in 30.

             I did include the relevance to pizzagate near the end of the post.  I am not good at fixing links but I will try.  Hopefully someone could lend a hand.

              Sorry, my apologies if I missed that inclusion at the end, I didn't read carefully enough and initially thought the whole post was a copy/paste from that link.
             </p>
             <p>
              Try removing the "(com)" and replacing it with a single period "."
