<p>-One child\'s bleeding from the colon (before accusations) while no doctor could identify the cause, which was claimed to be caused by sodomy by one doctor after all prior did not (this would make sense as many doctors would not be looking for it)</p>

<p>&quot;AND THE CHILDREN SHALL LEAD THEM</p>
<p>At least one child had a voice in the archaeological project. Time was running out before the bulldozers would obliterate the site and there seemed to be no trace of the children’s secret room. Joanie (11) 12 years old, was visiting her old preschool with her mother. Dr. Stickel asked her,”Can you tell us where it was that you entered the tunnels and which way you turned?” Joanie gave a meticulous description of every step along the way. Starting from the parents’ dig in the northeast corner of classroom #3, she described being lifted down a hole, turning right, going straight past the roots that brushed your face, turning right again where you were hurried through the long tunnel. “I liked to stop where the pipe was and swing on it. There was a little boy who couldn’t reach the pipe, and sometimes I’d lift him up so he could touch it. But right after that you had to duck down so you wouldn’t hit your head on the cement, then you had to run again to get to the secret room.”&quot;</p>

             This is the one I watched. It was made by a sympathizer of the Buckeys. It is so absurdly dramatized and over the top in favor of them being the victim. That's the one that actually got me onto looking into the matter more and create the above post.
