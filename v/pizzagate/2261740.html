             Here are some ideas on how ICMEC might be capitalizing on its unique position:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              People are advised to send pornography to them so that they can route it to the appropriate authorities.  They have been given special software to detect faces and to build a giant database containing porn libraries.  Seems to me this puts them on the receiving end of porn, the ability to identify adults, and then blackmail them.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Project VIC has built a library of over 5 million unique images of child pornography, including stills and video. Through processing and categorization of the images, there now are more than 2 million quality-controlled hash values available to law enforcement.
              <a href="http://archive.is/2EOx4">
               source:
              </a>

             <li>
              <p>
               They are under no oversight.  If they receive a report, they can choose to pass it on or not.
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               They work closely with individual law enforcement units, and they know who is compromised and who isn't.  They also get them software which I am guessing could give them the opportunity to install software that allows them to download from the LE computers.
              </p>
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             I know there is more, but what?  Are they coordinating shipments of children through various countries?

I'm trying to red pill people with videos and my mom, dad, and stepmother think they can somehow jail me or institutionalize me. The world is backwards right now its just so destructive on my brain, I cannot believe how entrenched people have become in the reality fed to them by hollywood, the MSM news, and the government, its just absolutely insane....

            <p>
             <strong>
              Project VIC is a collaborative effort between ICMEC, law enforcement and industry.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             “Project VIC is allowing us to save time on our workflow, dramatically allowing us to focus on uncategorized images and limiting the amount of trauma we suffer from seeing images already identified.”
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The goal is to increase information sharing among law enforcement worldwide,
             </strong>
             while identifying more victims, more rapidly. Project VIC does this by improving – and standardizing – the technology resources available to law enforcement who review images of child sexual exploitation.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Why is Project VIC important?
             </strong>
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The proliferation of child pornography on the Internet has created an enormous challenge for law enforcement personnel who seek to identify and rescue victims, and to investigate and prosecute offenders. The number of images seized by law enforcement around the world, both still and video, is staggering. Individual offenders possess massive collections of up to terabytes or even petabytes of data. When tens of thousands of images of child abuse material are seized by law enforcement, many of the photos or videos are destined to be left on hard drives and in police station evidence lockers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Traditional forensic workflows combined with sentencing guidelines and the sheer volume of offenders has created an epidemic and an environment where child victims are undetected and undiscovered, and the crimes committed against them are never investigated. The failure of this detection enables the continued access to and abuse of these children.
In the vast amount of material that is not reviewed, there are victims of abuse who are not identified, rescued and supported. Out of that dilemma comes Project VIC’s philosophy: Victims First –
             <strong>
              No Child Left Behind
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             <strong>
              What exactly does Project VIC do?
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              First, Project VIC compiled all existing online child abuse images into a single repository. Each image, whether still or video, has a unique identifier known as a “hash value.
             </strong>
             ” Using the hash value allows investigators to quickly rule images in or out of their searches. Project VIC participants have organized and compiled detailed lists of their own image collections using these hash values.
            </p>
            <p>
             Project VIC also commissioned the creation of an “image hash cloud,” which is available to investigators around the world. They download the “master image hash lists,” which contain the identifiers of highly vetted, known images of child sexual exploitation. Law enforcement personnel also are able to expand the database by uploading new hashes they have seized.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             To make the image hash cloud effective, all involved need to have the ability to contribute back. Project VIC protocols allow for this because the technology is governed by OASIS, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards. This ensures that technology tool providers can adopt – and their data will be compatible with – the Project VIC ecosystem of technology tools.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              What has Project VIC accomplished to date?
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              There are thousands of Project VIC users in the United States and 25 companion countries.
             </strong>
             Recent survey results from a sample of users reported over
             <strong>
              250 victims have been identified
             </strong>
             and over 125 offenders identified as a direct result of Project VIC participation.
            </p>
            <p>
             (
             <strong>
              ONLY 250? WUT?
             </strong>
             )
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Project VIC has built a library of over 5 million unique images of child pornography, including stills and video
             </strong>
             . Through processing and categorization of the images, there now are more than 2 million quality-controlled hash values available to law enforcement.

              What is in store for Project VIC?
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In the fall of 2015 Project VIC launched a new initiative, Project VIC-International, to promote and grow the information sharing of Project VIC data and innovations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Project VIC has already started work on a bridge to major data sources at INTERPOL and Europol.  Other countries have adopted the Project VIC model of information sharing, and victim centric approach to investigations including the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

             It is basically a collection of all the child sexual exploitation videos and photos ever found.  In the hands of an agency that is not even government based.  Their propaganda states that "Project VIC is a collaborative effort between ICMEC, law enforcement and industry". There is an elaborate system of identifying each of these photographs on hashtags and other complicated numerical IDs. **You will love their philosophy: Victims First – No Child Left Behind. ** (Another thought:  Where is all this data housed physically?)
            </p>
            <p>
             From their website:

Each image, whether still or video, has a unique identifier known as a “hash value.” Using the hash value allows investigators to quickly rule images in or out of their searches. {My Interpretation:   All items are individually marked so that copies of items will be flagged. No passing off someone else’s work as your own.}
Project VIC participants have organized and compiled detailed lists of their own image collections using these hash values. {Their OWN IMAGE Collections???}
Project VIC also commissioned the creation of an “image hash cloud,” which is available to investigators around the world. They download the “master image hash lists,” which contain the identifiers of highly vetted, known images of child sexual exploitation. Law enforcement personnel also are able to expand the database by uploading new hashes they have seized. {So this database access is cloud-based, where you can get the master list of the content.

Project VIC protocols allow for this because the technology is governed by OASIS, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards. This ensures that technology tool providers can adopt – and their data will be compatible with – the Project VIC ecosystem of technology tools. {With privately developed technology, everyone will need to get the tech tools needed to work in the system.}

             This certainly seems like a massively expensive system to develop and maintain.  I cannot even guess the amount of funds that went into this.  They must have a lot of success identifying victims and perpetrators, right?  According to their website:  250+victims identified, 125+perpetrators identified.  {Really, that’s all?? Even Ashton Kutcher claims more than that!}

             This info is from a different site-stating how many images VIC has handled: Image Submissions and Analysis: 
--Have categorized and quality controlled 1.5million into three categories. 
--An additional 2.5 Million files have been collected of which 2 Million are unique. 
--Additional images are being worked on so the set can be increased. (pdf source below)

            <p>
             In 1996, Belgium was shaken by tragedy. A man named Marc Dutroux, an unemployed electrician and father of three, had over the course of many years committed a series of kidnappings, rapes, and killings of a still-unknown number of teenage girls. Called the “Dutroux Affair,” the episode galvanized Belgium, and more than 300,000 Belgian citizens came together to express their anger and frustration in the handling of the case in the now-famous “White March.”
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Belgian Prime Minster Dehaene turned to the U.S. National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) for help.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the late 1990s,
             <strong>
              NCMEC had found itself responding to numerous requests for assistance from individuals and organizations around the world. The “Dutroux Affair” was the latest.
             </strong>
             So when Prime Minister Dehaene asked NCMEC to help establish a center in Brussels, NCMEC’s President replied, “You do not need an American solution to this problem — you need a Belgian solution.”
            </p>
            <p>
             With the volume of requests for assistance from abroad exceeding NCMEC’s capacity to respond, the Board of Directors authorized the creation of a new organization that would devote itself to doing globally what NCMEC was committed to doing in the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
             A year later, members of the Board of Directors for the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC) held their first meeting in 1998, and ICMEC was launched in April 1999.
            </p>
            <p>
             ICMEC was born out of tragedy, created as a reaction to heinous crimes committed against children. Since our inception, we have worked to safeguard children from abduction, sexual abuse and exploitation, partnering with governments, academia, law enforcement, and the NGO community, to offer a range of practical measures that protect children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since we opened our doors to the world we have trained over 10,500 law enforcement officers. We have contributed substantially to both new and refined laws against child pornography in 127 countries. We have expanded the Global Missing Children’s Network; 25 countries are now members. We have advocated for the commemoration of International Missing Children’s Day, which is presently recognized on May 25th in 17 countries across four continents. And we have expanded our global partnerships.
            </p>
            <p>
             With each new partnership, each new initiative, we take another step toward our goal of making the world safer for children.

              If you thought you knew everything about Pizzagate, just meet American "sculptor" and pedophile Jeff Koons. Koons is a strange breed of character who has a plethora of shady interests and connections to go along with his dubious behavior:

             If that wasn't enough to get your heebies jeebied, here's truly horrific testimony by Koons' first wife, Ilona Staller (aka Cicciolina).
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             But I told the psychologist in New York that I suspected my husband was a psychopath. I walked in on him nude on the bed while our child was playing with his genitals, and I told him, “It’s not nice to do that with a child.” I certainly saw other horrible things, but I can’t tell you about them.

Conclusion
            </p>
            <p>
             As much as this answers, there's unfortunately way too many questions opened up by these findings.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              How could such a man ever be awarded ICMEC's "Champion for Children" Award?
             </strong>
             Why is nobody offended that all these politically-connected artists also support criminal regimes like their patrons?
             <strong>
              Why does every weirdo in the art and political world hang out with the deranged Marina Abramovic?
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Most importantly, what is wrong with the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children?!
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              SERIOUSLY, WHAT THE FUCK SOCIETY?!

            The Belgian Kids’ Fund
           </h2>
           <p>
            Now that we’ve met the cast of (cowardly) characters, we can turn our attention to the
            <strong>
             Belgian Kids’ Fund (BKF)
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             Kids’ Care (KC)
            </strong>
            . There are several reasons why these children’s organizations are unsettling.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/QeawCNH.png">
             https://i.imgtc.com/QeawCNH.png
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            1)	The Support Committee
2)	Children’s Events
3)	Promotions for the Organizations
           </p>
           <p>
            First, the support committee for the BKF includes
            <strong>
             Maurice Lippens
            </strong>
            the alleged child abuser, rapist and participant in ‘hunts for children’. In addition, philanthropist extraordinaire
            <strong>
             Baron Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer
            </strong>
            is also part of the support committee. Cardon seems to be involved with every major international children’s organization as well as key Belgian organizations. Is he involved because he's such a tireless children’s advocate or is he there for some other reason entirely?
           </p>
           <p>
            Second, from the event page of the BKF there was a description of a massive children’s party and social gathering of 3,500 kids hosted by members of the upper class that has since been scrubbed from the website.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             By the way, just for interest’s sake, the Countess Maurice Lippens and Jean-Pierre de Launoit (chairman) are members of the support committee (Steuncomite) of the Belgian Kids Fund. Also, Barbara de Selliers de Moranville co-organized a huge party for 3500 children in the garden of Countess François d’Ansembourg’s property, as part of the Belgian Kids Foundation for Pediatric Research.
            </p>
           </blockquote>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, the promotions for both the BKF and the KC have suggestive imagery throughout their website and brochures.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are some samples, see if you agree.

            <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/HpEwctq.png">
             https://i.imgtc.com/HpEwctq.png

            KC
           </p>
           <p>
            On their own, these images are innocent enough but taken as a whole these suggestive and repeating images appearing throughout the webpages of these organizations are disconcerting. It would seem they are a subtle signal to a certain target audience within their ‘supporters’ and ‘volunteers’.
           </p>
           <p>
            The idea that any parent would allow their child to participate in social events, or be involved in any way with an organization supported by an alleged child rapist, is beyond me.
           </p>
           <p>
            A final note about BKF is that they’re involved in pediatric care and have a special focus on vaccinations. (See part 2 at top of page).

           <h3>
            Parallels to Pizzagate
           </h3>
           <p>
            Like the
            <strong>
             Franklin Scandal
            </strong>
            in the US, if one follows the chain of evidence surrounding the
            <strong>
             Dutroux Scandal
            </strong>
            it leads to the upper echelons of the power elite. In both cases, the investigations were doomed to fail as the rich and powerful rallied together to suppress evidence and to silence those that spoke out.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are striking similarities that exist between the
            <strong>
             Dutroux Scandal
            </strong>
            and Pizzagate. Dutroux, who was ultimately found to be ‘acting alone’, took the fall in the end and was sentence to life. In some ways, his circumstance mirrors that of Comet Pizza (CP) owner James Alefantis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dutroux has been described as a low-level procurer of children who supplied the elite with kidnapped children through and intermediary. Could this description also be applied to Mr. Alefantis? I think it could very well be the case or, more likely, Alefantis being an intermediary similar to Nihoul (middle man in Dutroux Scandal).
           </p>
           <p>
            Dutroux kidnapped children and kept them in the basement of his home. Two girls even died of starvation in his basement while he was serving a short prison sentence of of four months. Dutroux claimed that the children locked in his basement were still alive when he was released after four months, but died in his arms when he returned.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another detail in the Dutroux Scandal that could be applied to Pizzagate is that the purpose of supplying young children to the political elite is for the purpose of blackmail.

            Comparatively, a question pursued by many online Pizzagate investigators has to do with whether or not CP has a basement. There are also intense discussions about the possible existence of a tunnel system below CP. Though Alefantis owns a pizza parlor (also Buck’s Camping and Fishing), he has been listed as #49 on the list of most powerful individuals in Washington DC. The only explanation for this is his connections to other political power players such as the Podesta Brothers and his former lover David Brock. These are influential people in DC, and perhaps Alefantis is the middle/intermediate who is in good standing with the rich and powerful. In this way, his (for a lack of a better word) customers do not have to deal directly with the low-level procurers, thus shielding them and providing plausible deniability.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite good standing with his upper-class patrons, Alefantis is expendable. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Alefantis take the fall for higher level elites if the investigation gets too close to the circles of power in DC and beyond.

            Conclusion
           </h3>
           <p>
            This article describes how the Dutroux Scandal is linked to the ICMEC and its sister organizations in Europe. The involvement of individuals such as
            <strong>
             Baron Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer
            </strong>
            in 5 major children’s organizations around the world and his close relations to alleged child abusers (
            <strong>
             Lippens, Davignon, Paul Van den Boeynants and King Albert II
            </strong>
            ) is extremely unsettling.
           </p>
           <h3>
            Why did the Baron Cardon, a wealthy banker, suddenly become a crusader for children in 1998, founding Le Cercle de Lorraine as well as multiple child advocacy groups?
           </h3>
           <h3>
            Why not before this time?
           </h3>
           <h3>
            Why all at the SAME time?
           </h3>
           <h3>
            Why was Cardon ennobled in 1998?
           </h3>
           <p>
            It would appear that the Baron’s true role at the ICMEC is to make sure allegations of child abduction, sexual exploitation, abuse, rape and even murder involving the upper echelons of society are never reported or discussed in the public domain.

             ‘hunts of children’
            </strong>
            that took place in heavily wooded areas close to Chimay castle in Belgium.
           </p>
           <p>
            This disgusting practice involved children running into the woods, being captured again, stripped of clothing, set free once more, recaptured, raped and in some instances murdered.

            It’s hard to imagine a child being subjected to this level of extreme terror, torture and unspeakable abuse. These are members of the Belgian hierarchy who are alleged to have committed these heinous acts against young children. This is possibly the most depraved and monstrous account of child abuse that one is likely to encounter. Unfortunately, these individuals have not been brought to account for these accusations as the investigation was thwarted on multiple levels and interfered with by many powerful individuals, including King Albert II and the psychotic Black Baron, no less.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a sick and dark irony here in that the name “Bonvoisin” literally means “good neighbor” when translated from French into English. It would be a gross understatement to say that justice did not visit the victims/witnesses of these crimes. Instead, the perpetrators still galavant around in high society and continue to conduct themselves with complete impunity.

             Wikileaks released the Dutroux Dossier
            </a>
            (Dutroux Files). These files contained the witness statements and allegations made against high-ranking Belgian political figures and businessmen. 
Predictably, these allegations were covered-up and the blame was placed almost exclusively on Marc Dutroux a convicted child rapist and ex-convict. Nevertheless, the witnesses described the horrific details involving the Belgian elite in their statements and numerous individuals are identified.

            Previously, we have seen the deep ties between the ICMEC/NCMEC and the IT industry as well as the pharmaceutical industry. In part 3, we will explore the political connections of the power elite who are on the board of directors at the ICMEC. In particular, we’ll investigate the connections between the Dutroux Case and the ICMEC.

            History of the ICMEC

           <p>
            According to their webpage, the ICMEC was created in response to the public outcry surrounding the Dutroux Scandal. An estimated 300,000 Belgian citizens took to the streets to protest the crimes and the handling of the investigation.

           </p>
           <p>
            Rewarding top-tier bundlers with ambassadorships is a common practice in politics. As a successful fundraiser for the Obama campaign, Howard Gutman was appointed US ambassador to Belgium in 2009.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gutman was a popular ambassador among those he came in to contact with during his tenure in Brussels from 2009-2013. 
Gutman’s honeymoon with the Belgian public abruptly ended when it was revealed that he had attempted to solicit sex from a minor in a public park. Despite the accusations, Gutman unequivocally denied the claims and stayed on as Ambassador completing his term.

            Missing Children Europe is an umbrella organization that incorporates dozens of child advocacy groups spanning across Europe.

           <h2>
            Belgian Ties
           </h2>
           <p>
            One of the central personalities at the ICMEC is the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cardon_de_Lichtbuer">
             Baron Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer
            </a>
            (Cardon). Cardon was the first president of the organization. Mr. Cardon is deeply involved in a plethora of organizations dealing with missing, abused and exploited children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cardon spent his entire career in the Belgian banking world and has been a long-time member of the business community. His banking career started at Bank Brussels Lambert (BBL), where he eventually became CEO. He belongs to the Brussels business association known as:
            <strong>
             Le Circle de Lorrain
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/3TcAOHk.jpg">
             https://i.imgtc.com/3TcAOHk.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Cardon was selected as the ICMEC’s first president (1998) and has served on the board of directors since its inception. 
To receive the title of ‘Baron’ in Belgium is akin to being ‘lorded’ / ‘sired’ in the UK. It is an honor bestowed by the monarch for service and achievement. King Albert II awarded the title of “Baron” to Daniel Cardon in 1998.
           </p>
           <p>
            As we will see, both King Albert II and Baron Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer are named in the
            <strong>
             Dutroux Scandal
            </strong>
            and cover-up.
King Albert is identified by a witness as being present at a gathering described as a ‘hunt of children”. It's unclear if the witness was referring to King Albert I or King Albert II. The Baron however, is not named as being involved in the sexual abuse of children but he was involved in the cover-up.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Source: To be added shortly)
           </p>
           <p>
            This is intriguing, the wife of the King, Queen Poala, and a wealthy banker baron both emerging as champions of abused children, acquiring lead roles in the new international organization while at the same time being intimately linked to an accused in the
            <strong>
             Dutroux Scandal
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only that, but the Baron suddenly takes on a leading role in Belgium’s own child advocacy organization
            <strong>
             Child Focus
            </strong>
            (1998) and later with greater Europe’s equivalent; Missing Children Europe (2001). But that’s not all, he's also a board member at Italy’s children's foundation
            <strong>
             Foundazione Child
            </strong>
            who’s president and founder, Ernesto Caffo, also happens to be a member of the ICMEC board of directors. Furthermore, Cardon is also identified as being part of the support committee of several other children’s organizations:
            <a href="http://www.ami-huderf.be/accueil_fr.html">
             Kids’ Care
            </a>
            and the
            <a href="http://www.belgiankidsfund.be/">
             Belgian Kid’s Fund
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, perhaps it’s unfair to cast the Baron Cardon in such poor light, as his involvement with these organizations may truly be altruistic. Besides, he's a Baron. A man ‘lorded’ by the highest order of the country and a respected pillar of the Brussels business community. A reputable organization such as
            <strong>
             Le Cercle de Lorrain
            </strong>
            surely would never allow their ranks to be filled by scoundrels and degenerates, would they?

            Was looking into ICMEC/NCMEC yesterday and found excellent research that doesn't seem to have gotten a lot of attention.

            did a LOT of excellent deeper-pass dot connection 9 months ago:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1658938">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1658938
            </a>
            Many leads here.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those wondering the Clintons' connection, here's a photo &amp; history from ICMEC launch in 1999:
            <a href="https://www.icmec.org/history/">
             https://www.icmec.org/history/
            </a>
            I agree with other researchers who suggest that the ICMEC was indeed formed in response to the Dutroux Horror -- the elite nearly lost control of that one, with 300,000 people protesting for justice for the children.

            looked into ICMEC's VIC program -- ICMEC became the clearinghouse of all CP worldwide, and developed an elaborate tracking system:

           <p>
            My own poking around about ICMEC board members turned up these tidbits:
           </p>
           <p>
            Maura Harty, President and CEO of ICMEC, worked in the State Department in the early 90s, where she co-founded the Office of Children's Issues. The wiki on the OCI mentions these "controversies"
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 2002 parents of internationally abducted children characterized the Office of Children's of allowing deference to foreign leaders and laws to trump OCI’s vigilant pursuit of the interests of U.S. citizens. Patricia Roush,
             <strong>
              the mother of daughters abducted to Saudi Arabia, characterized her interactions with the State Department and Office of Children's Issues as demonstrating “indifference bordering on hostility,”
             </strong>
             Dismissing the Office as “merely another data collecting, do-nothing, play-dead-at-the-wheel section of the federal government."
             <strong>
              Maureen Dabbagh, mother of a daughter abducted to Syria, used the Freedom of Information Act to acquire her OCI files and was shocked by “page after page of slanderous, insulting comments made about me and comments trivializing my case.”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2003, Joel Mowbray, the journalist credited with exposing the still running "Visa Express" program of the U.S. State Department long after it allowed the entry of at least 15 of the 18 hijackers of 9/11 wrote the book "Dangerous Diplomacy" on the role and culture of the U.S. State Department. Mowbray's second chapter in "Dangerous Diplomacy", titled "Cold Shoulder: State's Smallest Victim's", is dedicated to an analysis of the assistance provided to American parents left in the wake of an international child abduction. It describes
             <strong>
              State's overriding desire to appease foreign governments and maintain "good relations" as having a conflict of interest between their responsibility to internationally abducted children as the designated United States Central Authority under the Hague Convention.
             </strong>
             This inherent conflict of interest between the two roles is magnified by what the book defines as the "culture of state", a culture characterized by extreme moral relativism, valuing process over substance and misplaced priorities that reward failures by promotions or high paying jobs "consulting" for the foreign government of the country that they'd previously been paid to advocate America's interests in.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Board member Anne-Marie Lizin (now deceased) was caught in the 1980s trying to “get three children back to Belgium” who had “been abducted by their father” — she was using false passports.

           </p>
           <p>
            And board member Patty Wetterling, who started the Jacob Wetterling Resource Foundation
            <em>
             four months
            </em>
            after the disappearance of her son, recently wrote in opposition to sex-offender registries. Perhaps the registries were working for them in the beginning -- helping them to locate likeminded people -- but they've since become a nuisance?

            I've seen some crazy in-depth charts about ICMEC &amp; NCMEC's board of directors but not a lot of in-depth research past it. There are all sorts of things to discover. I'm not sure I have the heart to dig deeper again, it gets so fucking dark. After finding a video selling handicapped children, I think my heart broke for good.

              Good job. These organizations need to be razed to the ground and all involved to the gallows. Ignorance is not excuse for what these people have, they are complicit and at the heart of this evil. They operate with no oversight too. How convenient is that? We should lean on these people until they crack.
