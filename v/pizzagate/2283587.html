<p>Here is the transcript of one of the scenes with Jeff\'s Character:
 Do you have any kids?
- Me? Hell, yeah. Three. I love kids.
Anything at all can and does happen.
Same with wives, for that matter.
- You\'re married?
- Occasionally.
I\'m always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.</p>
<p>At 1:19 there is a &quot;sneezing&quot; dinosaur, which happens to sneeze on the little girl in typical cumshot fashion <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=8LIjT2iKAUY">https://hooktube.com/watch?v=8LIjT2iKAUY</a></p>
<p>In this clip, Jeff walks up to a huge pile of dinosaur shit.  That\'s not what he is talking about though.  They are openly saying that he is a piece of shit and he knows it also.  Look how he owns the pile with his acting.  This was obviously made to be a 2 way joke, not one many people would get unless they watched the movie in context of him sexually abusing Ariana Richards.</p>
<p>As I was creating this post, I decided to check her Ethnicity.  <a href="http://ethnicelebs.com/ariana-richards">http://ethnicelebs.com/ariana-richards</a> . She if one of the only non jewish actors in the movie and her birthday is Sept 11.  This would not of been such a shock to me, but I\'ve been watching a lot of videos of how they openly mocked 9/11 in hundreds of mediums and now I think that this is just another one to add.  We just don\'t fully understand why she was picked to be one of the openly abused children.</p>
<p>We must look for subtle context in the movies, as they are there for us to see, we just have to have the eyes to see it.  If a movie has a small non jewish child in it, chances are they abused her and then shoved it right into our faces because we had no context.  Now that we have context, it\'s time to start compiling a list of movies that mock child sex.  If we do this, then we can actually predict and very well who was and was not abused AND look at the crew of the film.  I am fucking horrified to go back and watch the movies I loved as a kid just to go back and watch them and see they were about sexual abuse the whole time.  It\'s part of how they control the population with popular culture.</p>',

            Watch both of these clips... How many more movies are there?  Can you honestly say they don't openly mock us?  They don't just openly mock us...  They milk our money and get rich from us all while telling us stories about how they rape and drink the blood of children.  This is the most diabolical industry ever created and it's roots with all of the other popular culture mind control mediums are no less guilty.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the Nobel Prize to Hollywood, they are no different.  They are subversion tools that they put exuberant amounts of time and effort into, that are filled with satanic symbolism and again openly mocking the public.  It's all a fucking illusion and it's amazing how much time and effort goes into keeping this machine alive.

            Not to mention that both of these scenes are in the

I mentioned 9/11 because it's synchronicity to my timeline after watching hours of them openly mocking 9/11 in all forms of popular culture, it would be funny that I watch the movie and search it only to find the same date staring me in the face.
            </p>
            <p>
             Watch this, and yes I will support this guy on youtube :
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQhfGdfdU00&amp;ytbChannel=Mark%20Devlin">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQhfGdfdU00&amp;ytbChannel=Mark%20Devlin
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             By putting future programming into our movies, they help usher their plan into existence.  Subverting the population with coded messages  in our popular culture.  They openly mock and tell us what is going to happen because they NEED TO influence as many minds as possible to call fourth the time line they need.   It's not crazy, you just need a bit more information to be able to see it happening before your eyes.

              Again ignoring the fact that all of the scenes you mentioned were written in the book many years before they could be applied to any actors.

              You also didn't post a link to the clip about the pile of shit, but  there are several people in the scene. Perhaps he might be the only person on camera during that one line, but there are thousands of lines like that in every movie.

               The scene stops and cuts to a different shot after with the animated dinosaur.  That scene was for just Jeff. They are two way jokes, much like what  a show like Animaniacs does.  They say a joke a child will take literal and a parent will get.  Well, in this case, they are telling a joke that an adult takes literal and the "Hollywood cult" gets.

                 They don't "know", its just how they practice occult activities.  They always openly mock real world events that take place.  They make it happen, it does not work unless they have it in the eyes for all too see.   It's kinda funny how they have "occult" and  "A cult classic", I am sure that's just nothing also.

                    Lol so Steven Spielberg contacted Michael Crichton and told him that he wanted to make a mundane 2-way joke about child molestor Jeff Goldblum, so he should write a book about dinosaurs and include the line "that's one big pile of shit" somewhere in the book so that Goldblum could molest the young female actress, who would

                      There have been references to thousands of things that didn't happen, too. If you combine millions of pieces of literature, it's inevitable that you're going to be able to find something that vaguely resembles something that happened in real life.

            Great Work.  I applaud you for spending the time to do this.  There are many movies that have been created with the intentions of putting in their little jokes.  It is disgusting.

             Rosemary's Baby is so sick and twisted, also space Odyssey 2001.  Both also have references to 9/11 in them as well as simpsons and HUNDREDS of other mediums, Music included.

              Kind of like Eyes Wide Shut in a way.  Jurassic Park was full of subliminal messages put in to hypnotize the masses, including the others you mentioned.  There is a conversation that is on the internet between Spielberg and Lucas. It really spells it right out that they are both Pedos.  They talk about a 12 yr. old girl.  Totally Incriminating.

               Yeah Indiana Jones was supposed to have had sex with the main girl at age 12.  The actress was meant to be in her early 20's.  I heard the conversation between Spielberg and Lucas...Lucas really wanted to make her young and make Indiana a pedophile.  But they thought better of it at the time...it was the early 80's.  Now they probably go ahead and do it.

                 It is pattern recongnition....they should of never gave us the internet...because we can get together and talk about what we think is odd about different things.  And taken together in a mass......the truth is shocking.  Pizzagate turned me from a teaparty normie and in two weeks I had gone down the rabbit hole all the way to Jews/masons luciferian nihlistic pedophilic cult from hell really did run the world.  Then to go back and reevaluate all the bands and music you loved growing up.  Put the words Freddie Mercury and Illuminati together and watch the videos.  You could just blow all of the weirdness as a coincidence...but when you put a year study into the Satanic NWO and you understand they really have been controlling the movies and bands for at least 50 years.  To KNOW Freddie Mercury probably was a Luciferian Pedophile and you would believe Freddie being at sacrifices and drinking the blood of humans.......fucking weird.  To watch the movie HELLO DOLLY and know that the man who played Barnaby in the 1969 movie was killed in a very occulty way.  That his killer had filmed himself murdering Danny Lockin.  Cops wanted death penalty but they took it all the way to the supreme court and refused to let the Prosecution use the actual film of the murder....the fucker only got time served and got out after like 18months.....you realize it is all related.  That the fucking "elite" among us kill us in almost plain sight and they got away with it for decade after decade.....till it seems they got sloppy and got jumped by Trump and his COUP boys....taking it to them now......

                  Wow.  I pray it all comes out too.  I hope they all hang (which is asking a lot) but they sure deserve it.  If I was dying I would never take a drop of their blood.

             I'm with you, it's a reach. Suggesting someone was chosen for the role because their birthday is September 11th, a date that had zero significance at the time, makes it even more of a reach. Evidence is what we need.

              I feel it's a bit stretchy myself, but, just gotta point something out:

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               September 11th, a date that had zero significance at the time

             </blockquote>
             <p>
              To the general public, sure, it had no significance... that doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't significant in the minds of others who may have been planning something.
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, all things aside, Spielberg's name does keep popping up constantly, I can't remember who the producers/distributors were, etc, for Jurassic Park... might be worth looking at though.
             </p>
             <p>
              With regards to Jeff Goldblum: Needs more evidence/corroboration, has he even been accused of assaulting anyone let alone Ariana Richards?

             No, I am not reading too deep.  They have to put their doing's out in the open in order for the "magic" to work.  They really are a bunch of blood suckers.  Why do you think vampire movies are so popular?

               Vampire mythology was weaponized long before hollywood existed

              <li>
               The reason why vampire mythology has been weaponized past and present, is to keep folks' heads filled with lies and superstition, so that they don't ever figure out who the enemy is

              Do a bit of reading about Vlad III Dracula, there's a lot more to the story than what most believe or are even willing to read. (not trying to be a jerk, I've done the reading myself; it's quite interesting, even just as a history lesson)

               Or it's an attempt to normalize vampirc activity.  Once you make believe, it's hard to ever take something seriously you have seen in a movie.  Which is exactly why they do it, so they can just call us crazy later.

                Definitely a valid thought, indeed, that's part of the point of weaponizing it in the first place. Normalize it and/or fuck people up and call them crazy later, not just vampire/dinosaur movies either, of course... They didn't expect so many people to start seeing it for what it is, though.

                Cheers for taking a look at Jurassic Park, on that note. I'm sure others have brought it up before, but, another look, a different angle or another set of eyes, can do wonders.
