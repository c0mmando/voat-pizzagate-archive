  'formattedContent' => '<p>So far I have no concrete evidence in this direction but I like to look back at the big picture strictly in terms of what is possible and what is not possible. This is possible, even if not likely:</p>
<p>We know Hillary Clinton lied about landing in Bosnia &quot;under sniper fire&quot; and we know the Balkan region, as a consequence of the war, was a hotspot for human trafficking, prostitution of minors, etc. Look it up, it\'s bone-chilling.</p>
<p>The same thing tends to happen during natural disasters and in that line we also find the 1999 Turkish earthquake, where many children vanished in the chaos that ensued, who are still missing to this day. There are also records of Bill Clinton visiting those refugee camps. Which could have been advertising.</p>
<p>Now let\'s consider the war in Syria from the perspective of a human trafficker, a slaver essentially, specializing in children.
You have two big opportunities in that business:</p>
<p>1, Take them to Europe to be sold off to a high-value customer or prostituted.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the large amount of orphans in disaster areas, your greatest challenge would be to take children from their parents. This can be accomplished if their parents fear for the lives of their children enough to hand them off to a stranger (or especially someone they trust), to be transported to Europe, if you maintain the illusion that they are welcome.</p>
<p>Or, more easily, you can lure entire families onto boats, kill off their parents at sea, easily dispose of the bodies without leaving witnesses by just throwing them off the boat, and take their children to be sold off. You pocket both what the parents paid you for the crossing and the value of the children to the next level of the supply chain.</p>
<p>Mind you that statistics exist placing the average life expectancy of children in these situations under 5-10 years. They will never become adults, hence they will never be a problem unless you\'re caught, and no records will exist of your activities. Neither will they know who you are, and as they\'re cut off from communication with their family and neighbors, you can repeat this stunt indefinitely.</p>
<p>It would help to have allies in geographically close countries, and the Clintons have substantial connections to post-Yugoslavian states, which are next-door to Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean, some of those high-level politicians in those countries have been connected to them on this forum before, through the Podesta emails. Landing a ship there should not be complicated.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, we\'ve learned of the Clinton Foundation\'s connections to shipping companies. And even Julian Assange hints towards boats as we\'ve seen in my other submission, where he pointed to a passage from Nineteen Eighty-four that mentions a poem by Rudyard Kipling about a steamer\'s captain, &quot;M\'Andrew\'s Hymn&quot; (it also mentions children being on board).</p>
<p><a href="http://server2.docfoc.com/uploads/Z2016/02/11/XQCSxUlbcU/92b186b33206690ac39a7e380c0e4aff.doc">http://server2.docfoc.com/uploads/Z2016/02/11/XQCSxUlbcU/92b186b33206690ac39a7e380c0e4aff.doc</a></p>
<p>Now let\'s look to the other possibility, the one that involves the Russian air force and might explain why the Russian government seems to be the main focus of the mainstream media, which John Podesta is cozy with, as evidenced in his emails.</p>
<p>2, Provide a closed-off, safe environment for visitors to come and abuse children. Make Syria a pedo brothel (again?).</p>
<p>No rule of law in a war zone means there is no risk whatsoever of being caught, if you decentralize the locations and provide security all around.</p>
<p>ISIS is not a serious threat to this plan because ISIS does not have an air force. Neither would be the &quot;moderate&quot; rebels, unless they are themselves involved. Culturally, they would not be alien to the concept of fucking little kids, as Bacha Bazi in Afghanistan and child brides in Saudi Arabia demonstrate, so they might cooperate if promised arms and supplies to overthrow the Syrian government.</p>
<p>The threat to this plan is the Syrian air force, and their buddies the Russian air force, who can sweep in and drop a bomb on the VIPs while they\'ve got their pants down.</p>
<p>That would be terrible for business, especially if you\'ve got a myriad of wealthy customers sitting next-door in the gulf states, mistakes and accidents cannot be hidden.</p>
<p>Perhaps for that purpose, we now saw Congress voting in on a resolution to provide MANPADs (anti-aircraft missiles) to the Syrian opposition forces, potentially as a dissuasion to Russian air incursions.</p>
<p>And maybe also for the same reason, we saw Hillary Clinton\'s notorious effort to push for a no-fly zone in Syria, over the last few years, although her motivations never seemed very clear.</p>
<p>These people are smart, albeit fallible as a result of their arrogance, and there\'s no reason to think they\'re new to this business. Question every single one of the claims and goals they\'ve stated over the years, everything that is unexplainable is suspect, we\'ll catch them around the corner when they\'re not watching.</p>
<p>They will inevitably fail, for all I care they have already failed the moment they started trying to silence us. They may have years of experience but they seem to have no understanding of the Barbra Streisand effect.</p>',

            I think the most obvious reason for a no fly zone is to prevent the bombing of oil fields. Their profit will literally go up in flames.
