<blockquote>
<p>Government school officials in California think it is “really important” to teach children about pedophilia and pederasty in the classroom because it is a “sexual orientation.” That is according to a top official for California\'s Brea Olinda School District, who admitted to parents that it was being done — and that it would continue, despite the outrage. The implications are mind-blowing. </p>
<p>The stunning admission came after a parent-information meeting last month for the Brea Olinda Unified School District (BOUSD). Stephanie Yates, founder of Informed Parents of California, asked school officials why they were “teaching pedophilia in school to 9th graders.” But instead of a denial that such an atrocity was taking place, a top school official confirmed it was happening and acted like there was nothing wrong with it. </p>
<p>“This is done because we are talking about historical perspectives of how gender relations and different types of sexual orientations have existed in history,” said BOUSD Assistant Superintendent of Curricula Kerrie Torres in a matter-of-fact way, sounding almost oblivious to how the bombshell might sound to normal people. </p>
<p>Horrified, the mother turned activist expressed shock at Torres\' admission. “So sex between a man and a boy is a sexual orientation?” she asked. Torres did not deny it. “It\'s something that occurred in history, and so this is really important for us to include,” the assistant superintendent said, implying that yes, sexual relations between a man and a boy — properly considered rape under the laws of every state — is a “sexual orientation.” </p>
<p>Of course, if simply having “occurred in history” means something merits inclusion in school curricula, then one might ask why the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ or the full text of the Mayflower Compact are never mentioned in government schools. Obviously, there is more to the story than simply having to teach children about such perversions merely because they “occurred.” </p>

            Here's a useful comment from the mumsnet thread on this topic:
           </p>

            The original point of this thread was noting how US high schoolers are to be taught (or have been taught) how paedophilia is a sexual orientation as part of historical teaching of 'gender relations'. I haven't seen the lesson plan, I don't think I need to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Exactly. Whilst we don't know that this is the case for sure, people are twitchy about this for good reasons.
           </p>
           <p>
            The battle over language is the battle for popular consciousness and you would have to be a particular kind of blind not to realise that "orientation" has come to mean a "gentle" natural inclination towards - there is no violence or coercion implied in the word. That this is a normalising word is shown most clearly by the fact that the people who most want their desires classified as an "orientation" are paedophiles themselves. They try to draw a distinction between paedophilia and child molestation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The following clip contains the infamous interview with members of PIE carried out in the 1970s. I couldn't find the clip by itself and I don't know who the gentleman is who is commenting on the clip, neither have I had time to watch the whole thing - but the snippet of the interview speaks for itself. I am sure many people have already seen it. The interview starts around 1:36
           </p>

           <p>
            I am not unsympathetic to people who suffer from aberrant desires but we must be very wary of the paedophile's tendency to portray themselves as the victim - this is very much part of their "condition". They also like to enter into pseudo-intellectual rationalisations of their desires and theories of childhood sexuality. This is presumably what Harriet Harman and the NCCL brought into in the late 70s and early 80s. here is an article on the academics who are attempting or who have attempted to justify paedophilia.

           </p>
           <p>
            Another thing that we need to pit against their claim to victimhood is the actual tenacity of the war of attrition that they have fought for decades to have their rights take precedence over those of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is plenty of information here just covering the period 1976-1980

            In addition, we must be aware that this is a strand of thought that runs through the whole of the British state apparatus. PIE's offices were in the Home Office, some of their senior members were civil servants and they seem to have been the recipient of government grants. This is not a left/right issue - this is a part of the dominant liberal ideology that has very little to do with party politics.Is it any wonder that we have civil servants posting on these boards that they are being forced to accept an erosion of their boundaries and to say that men are women when they clearly are not.

            The main point that I am making is that these people will not stop and will use any tactic to gain a foothold in popular consciousness and, increasingly, to force their appetites on a largely ignorant general public. I also think that women and female consciousness are being particularly targetted as we are seen as the major barrier to these people achieving their aims.

            It's redundant to say something you posted is a mere repost from 8chin.  So eager to shit up our sub you didnt see it was already posted on the front page.

             The point is having this spread around Donkey. What’s the point of anons researching if the info is not spread? I do my own research too. Go back to pizzagate now faggot.

            This is NAMBLA... not to mention, Ginsburg &amp; the rest of these demented ass wipes.  How many kids have discussions on those topics with parents? None if any ...so they want to get to that young brain first before you do. This is history that most find out, if ever maybe a Human Psychic class in College. It's to NORMALIZE an stir up CURIOSITY. Thank you AMA &amp; Psychologists!

            According to the son of a friend who was in high school a couple years ago he was telling me they were teaching proper condom use and sexual matters including fisting and other stuff. These people are sick.

              I remember in sex ed in high school one of my school mates asked if a person could break his boner some how. He was trying to be the class clown again. Surprised the heck out of us when the science teacher took him up on it and explained how penile ruptures do happen. We were very quiet and at least half the class were silently making vows to never let this happen to us. Now adays they get training on how to stick a hand completely up a vagina or anus. WTF????

               That's a funny story, see that's stuff that's normal &amp; even important to learn, class clown question or not. but the fisting, I'm sorry but even if a kid asked, that's unnecessary &amp; disgusting &amp; not freaking cool. Uh this just upsets me so much. I have nieces &amp; nephews in jr high &amp; HS. Uhh.. sometimes I seriously want off this planet.

                Right. They are pushing perversions in class and trying to make it seem normal. It's one thing if adults do crazy stuff later on in life but it's quite another matter to push this stuff on kids. We don't need to be sexualizing our children. I'm ok with basic anatomy in high school but this pushing of sexuality that's perverted is just off the carts insane.

                 It's absolutely off the charts. I cant even imagine, for instance, a19yo &amp; making out w their BF &amp; them trying one of these horrid things they learned in sex ed? I'd have knocked the mofo out, &amp; then some. It's just total insanity. Kids need to learn basic anatomy due to puberty, raging hormones, menstruation, but come on!!! Absolutely shameful.

                  All these things can be taught in a tasteful and reasonable way.  With sincere advice, etc. it can be beneficial.  But why in the world are parents not teaching this to their Children?  I know I would be embarrassed if I had Children but I also know that I am a pretty responsible person and somehow I would load up on books and educate my Children.  There is no use to go into horrid details with Kids, just give them the facts.  Uh, no.  I never participated in any of this sick stuff but now a days as sick as society is, we need to buck up and let tell them the truth and what they are up against.  Uh, yeah, and also see that they learn to knock out one of those perverts too.  Defense class in order.

                   Totally agree. I dont have children either, and funny you mentioned if u had kids that youd read up on how to teach these things to them, I'm exactly the same. I have 5 nieces and nephews and I cringe when I think of them being subjected to these things. But you're right, the way this world is nowadays, it's better to arm them with knowledge. But uhhh.. it's just so sad. But yes there is a tasteful and responsible way to do it. Idk how I would coped if some guy tried what he learned in class on me, I'd have seriously lost my ish on him. I think I'm going to buy my nieces self defense classes, great idea. &amp; luckily my brother with all the sons is an amazing, loving, but strict and very involved father and teaches them to be gentlemen and his wife is such a blessing and is the same. Lawdy, what a world. 🙏🏼

                    You are lucky they have good parents.  They are they boss though and you can only do so much.  But yes, I don't think they would object to defense classes.  I have seen on the news where there was a girl that threw an adult over her head!  And have you also heard reports of people trying to take Children and the Children are kicking and biting and getting away sometimes.  I think their parents are arming them with valuable info.  Even better if they can afford it they should get them classes.  Better yet, they should be taught in school.  Is this why Gym classes have been cancelled in many schools?  The elites are trying to weaken Our Children.  We must push for School Defense Classes. They can't start too early imo.

                     Yea they can afford it, I'll talk to them about it. My brother was in the army &amp; is/was a personal trainer, now an RN. I'm sure he can teach them at least the basics. They're stunning girls &amp; I worry about them constantly. I'm not sure if I've mentioned it here before but my eldest nieces high school took out a full 2 pages in their yearbook dedicated to Islam :/ &amp; it's a very wealthy neighborhood with (supposedly) one of the best school districts. We went there as kids also, but things have changed so much I dont think there are any good school districts anymore + this is California. You're right about them only being able to do so much. But they are very blessed with such good parents, sadly that's not always the case, especially these days.

                      Be careful about the info you just wrote.  Someone could use it.  Takeout the HS Islam Yearbook info.  That's not too hard to find.
