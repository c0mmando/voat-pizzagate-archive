<h1>Rozzi was raped in the shower more than 30 years ago by the late Father Edward Graff, among the 301 predator priests identified by the recently published grand jury on sexual abuse in Pennsylvania dioceses.</h1>
<h1>On Monday, Bill Wachob, a Democrat who between 1978 and 1984 served in the House, made public his own abuse.</h1>
<p><strong>Wachob, who now lives in La Jolla, Calif., calls himself &quot;collateral damage&quot; to the clergy sex abuse crisis. He said his abuser - an older and bigger neighbor - was himself being abused by a priest.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Even though I  was not directly abused by the priest, the actions of the priest had a ripple effect and I  became collateral damage as a result of the priests\' behavior. At such a young age, I was filled with fear knowing that the priest himself was ultimately responsible for the abuse I endured.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With two exceptions, none of the cases detailed in the grand jury report can be prosecuted as the statute of limitations have expired.</p>
<p><strong>Wachob broke his silence before a Capitol Rotunda packed with lawmakers and victims ahead of Monday\'s House vote on reform amendments to a statute of limitations reform bill.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is widely known that many abusers were abused themselves,&quot; he said. &quot;This was the case with the person who abused me. In fact, <strong>he would justify his abusive behavior toward me by continually assuring me that he wasn\'t doing anything wrong because the priest was doing the same thing to him.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Wachob said his abuse went on for years</strong>, and at times in the disguise of strip poker or some other ruse.</p>
<p>Wachob has kept his silence about his abuse up until now and has only recently realized the destructive and lasting effects that come with child sexual abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Wachob</strong>, who now is in campaign advertising production, <strong>urged the Legislature to pass a retroactive window that would allow time-barred victims to file civil suits in court.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I  am convinced that if no action is taken now and we just move forward with business as usual, there will be more victims, more broken families and more deaths,&quot; he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Monday afternoon [09/24], the House by an overwhelming vote passed several amendments to SB261, including Rozzi\'s retroactive measures.</p>
<p>Once the bill clears a final vote in the House, it will return to the Senate for concurrence.</p>

             I'm sure that the guilt  Bill Donohue feels with his sociology degree about not stepping forward on McCarrick when he had prior knowledge is being projected on to a child abuse victim, Rozzi.
            </p>
            <p>
             Donohue makes half a million dollars in salary and benefits as head of his non-profit, which sits on $35 million in assets. Describing itself as "the nation's largest Catholic civil rights organization," Catholic League is registered as a 501c charity"
            </p>
            <p>
             Rozzi has more grace than Donohue will ever hope to have .

              At the very beginning of the Grand Jury I asked my friend Survivor if she had faith in him.  I am always questioning the sincerity since we have been burned by so many.  She said he is to be trusted and very sincere.  He has shown us what he is made of and I know that he is not done helping these Victims.   They have a lot of courage filing the lawsuit after what they have been through.  How much more do they have to endure.  I think that they have given even a new pump of vitality after the Report.

               Did you catch the Church militant article on the Buffalo NY seminary rector stepping down? He has in the past been accused of bringing in Columbian gay seminarians and parceling them out to gay pastors! Those two Colombian gay priests caught in Florida were not an anomaly but the norm. How any Catholic could be sending money to Opus Bono or Catholic League is beyond me. Even Legatus now seems shady since listening to Rose Maher's podcast.

                OK here is more.  I found the nbc reports and here is a doozy.  Very short but Cupich steps his foot right into a pile of it.  He also plays the Race Card about the pope being Latino!

                My friend called me and said I would have to go on the internet.  Well here it is CUPICH APOLOGIZES and they discuss it on here it is amazing.  Also they discuss Father Kalchick  and they mention that he is afraid he will be tared and feathered!   Then some guy pipes in that the Flag was bad because it also had the cross on it, I am so over the moon I can't stand it!  Oh my God. The woman on there really had a lot to say and it was not good.  She said there is nothing bigger than the sexual abuse cases.  Also they said he made priests read a letter at all the Churches.  He is on Hot Water.   Step up everyone on the Petition and Prayers!!!

                Yes!  I saw that.  Everything is Blowing Up and all of their Dirty Linen is getting aired out.  I have to say that although none of this is funny,  I have to have a laugh about that.  Someone said to me in a comment that he things Jesus Christ is blowing everything wide open and that this is only the beginning.  Keep saying that Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel.  I think it is working.  Many people have read it in that letter I saw, I am sure.  The more that comes out, the more people will hang on to their hard earned money.  Those that continue to give are their supporters in crime and those Holy Rollers that are Forever Sheep.

            thank Bill Wachob for speaking out.  It takes immense courage to do so. Something that, Thank God, most of us will never have to do.

           <pre><code>"Even though I was not directly abused by the priest, the actions of the priest had a ripple effect and I became collateral damage as a result of the priests' behavior. At such a young age, I was filled with fear knowing that the priest himself was ultimately responsible for the abuse I endured."
</code></pre>
           <p>
            It is widely know that many abusers were abused themselves. YES and the priest himself was ultimately responsible.  YES!  Well, they are trying to make us  believe that they are Born That Way. NO!!!  They are not.  It is passed down from one abuser to create another abuser and to reap the horrible benefits of their perverted sick crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            I commend those in the House for their overwhelming votes.  If the Senate does not find it in their hearts to do the same they will be forever held responsible  for emboldening those that will commit further crimes against Our  Children.  I can't even imagine what former Victims are going through right now.  Sitting on Pins and Needles.  Everyone please pray harder than ever before.  +
