            I want this abuse of children to stop and I don't care that much about revenge.  But I would like these conditions:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              That they be known, and they admit publicly the crimes they committed
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              That they make financial restitution to the victims as well as they can (they will not want to part with ill-gotten gains but we have to remove their power)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              That they are unable to hold any position of authority: they must resign if they are politicians, judges, police officers, or work with children
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              That they receive mandated therapy and report to a parole officer or similar regularly
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              That they not fraternize with any other pedophiles, traffickers, etc
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              That they must stay away from children under the age of 18, including their own children and grandchildren
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Violation of these rules means they go to jail for a minimum of 20 years
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This is a one-time immunity.  Anyone who does not come forward will be prosecuted fully.
Also I want an audit of all child-related facilities, services and charities.  I would like people working directly with children to get some kind of screening, maybe lifestyle/polygraph clearance, psych evaluation.  This goes for cops, too.

             There are too many people involved and I'd say about 80% were blackmailed into it. Think Senator Geary from The Godfather 2:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSxXiHRZTOY">

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Geary didn't kill the prostitute, He was drugged who knows how it happened. The end result is the same. There have been "Senator Geary's" since the dawn of civilization.

            I hadn't thought of that. I like it. The only problem is people would have an incentive to find someone who black-mailed them. That's getting a little Salem Witch Hunty.

             "don't listen to this shill".........I see your point. I'd agree if it were anything but gang raping the entire population of Haiti. Those facts will come out eventually, there is no question. A human being of sound mind can't be told what happened there and not think "All Hands On Deck", "Katie bar the door." etc etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the most sordid and disgusting shit I've ever heard in my life. I think Donald Trump is a complete and utter idiot. His malfeasance is a tea spoon compared to the Pacific Ocean of evil that was done to the Haitian people. You can't put a lid on this thing. It's like trying to put the toothpaste back in the tube. It's not going to happen. People can't forget what they've seen.

            If Pedophile/sadist murders are not eliminated this will continue.  We must cleanse this country, or we will lose it.  Blanket immunity is but a Plan C for all the perps.

             Well, if we want to stop it, really stop it, we will have to do the same things after arrests and we would do after amnesty.  Monitor the guilty and support the victims.  It is going to be a monumental undertaking.

             The risk with an all or nothing solution is nothing gets done about it. Trust me I want whoever did this to fry but there is no one person who started it. People got sucked into it almost like a Ponzi Scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
             It very much looks like it started with George H.W. Bush in the 1960s if you can believe it. See Oliver Stone's movie JFK. It will blow your mind.
            </p>
            <p>
             It started then and just kept snow balling of its own momentum. This is highly charged shit.

             "murdered and abused children"........I know. I don't know what's right. I have a strong suspicion this thing is so big though that unless it's brought down gracefully we could see a lot more kids die if you know what I mean.

               "the stages"........Holy fuck I've been a fucking basket case over this. All I can think about is those poor Haitian kids who Laura Silsby tried to take to the Dominican Republic. When the kids came back from the border a reporter interviewed one of the older kids. The reporter said the kid didn't know his parents had abandoned him. After he learned what happened the kid said he never wanted to see his parents again. Who would?

                I have heard so many recently say that they are having a hard time dealing with all of this sick Evil. 
I look at everyone now and wonder do they have kids locked in their basements? are they Satanists? I see a drainage ditch and wonder if it was used to move trafficked kids. I see a moving  truck and I want to pull it over and check in the back.  Life will never be the same I'm afraid.

            Wow, how much did Soros buy Webb for!
Yeah, explain that to victim! Hey, I am sorry there is way to many of these sick fucks. So we are just going to tell them all that hey we know you did bad things and ruined lives. However, we as a nation need to feel better so we will let all this evil shit go. We will no longer seek justice, and you are free to continue.

             He's just voicing a common tactic that is often used in sticky situations like this. Relax with your Soros allegations. I can see the benefit and why blanket immunity is one way to resolve this. However I agree with

              /u/Millenial_Falcon
             </a>
             , plea bargaining is a better solution. Either way, success on any level dealing with something this big and tenuous is asking a lot tbh.

              I guess, but whomever gets the immunity or plea, will be free to continue the Evil. Even the little guy who just drives the van full of kids to the border, he knows he can be right back doing it again. Then with the bigger guys put away, the van driver moves up.

               It is really up to us as a nation to figure out how it got this way.  We are learning a lot about it now.  Starting with secret societies, mutual blackmail, and childhood abuse.  We have to bring everything to bear to heal the children and the abusers.  We have to make sure the children are safe and this will take a lot of monitoring and a lot of care.  But the cycle has to be broken and I cannot think of a better way to do it.

               If we wait for a compromised Law Enforcement and Justice system to do it, it will never happen.  We are asking them to investigate and arrest themselves and their bosses.  So knowing that will never happen, the alternative is for individuals to take law into their own hands.   That is a lose for everyone

            Something similar was done with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa.  Personally, though, I don't like the idea of blanket immunity.  The lack of accountability would encourage future elite crimes.  I'm more a fan of plea bargains, especially for small fish, in exchange for evidence and testimony against the big fish.  Then again, if non-prosecution agreements can get the big fish to admit their crimes and resign from office, I might be in support of that.
