            I think there are other auctions on the deep dark web where buyers get to see video of the kids all on a very secure encrypted network site. This would be the best way for them to buy and sell kids and it would include buyers from around the world. Delivery of the kids would take place a few days or weeks later they have to transport the kids by ship or by plane. Payment is most likely half up front by electronic bank transfer and the other half upon delivery of the child you purchased on the secure site.

            Doesn't add up. Children are always in the equation. And we already know popular art is a scam in that way. You did not respond to any of the dots connected here, and instead gave alternat theories. That is a known shill tactic, so if you are not one, best in the future to respond to what has been presented.

            Have you tried at all to find anything to support your assertions?

            I went to Sotheby's and found this under Buy and Sell &gt; How to Buy and Sell &gt; View Glossary of Terms &gt; Lot Symbols &gt; symbol:
            <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/key-to-lots-symbols.html">
             http://www.sothebys.com/en/key-to-lots-symbols.html
            </a>
            Maybe there is an alternate symbol decoder list available at the Preferred Access link at top of page.  Interesting choice of art for the sign-in page:

            An example for the code in the pamphlet that bidders get when they enter they all get these booklets so they can see and study what artworks are up for sale during the auction. So it could be a painting listed as:
           </p>
           <p>
            Modernistic Interior by John Smith
           </p>
           <h1>
            B12-5J-RV starting bid: $5,000
           </h1>
           <p>
            And the pedo-bidders would know this gets you a Boy age 12 for 5 hours.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they were doing it this way (the code would be more complex than my example) then it would have worked perfectly for them for a very long time. No one would have ever suspected it. The money changes hands in a public setting for a valuable painting and nobody outside the inner circle knows what the bonus gift will be the buyer gets the painting then a boy or girl is delivered to them later that night or a few nights later and they get the kid for five hours not a minute more unless they want to pay extra for more time with him or her.

              You seem awfully sure that there's nothing going on at Pegasus. Just admit you work for JA already.

                How else do you find out if something nefarious is going on somewhere? You watch them. Eventually they will slip up. The fact that you constantly type in all caps shows that you're unhinged.

                  What sucks is that the few people that have gotten to talk to Alefantis (like the two shitheads on YouTube) clearly didn't take time to think out what they were going to ask him. I would have been grabbing passers-by and showing them the pictures and then pointing at James and saying "This is the guy who posted these." Making everyone aware of the things he was posting online should have been a key element of PG but it fizzled out.

                  I'm not saying that the methods aren't somewhat ham-fisted, but at least people are trying to expose these sickos. This whole "hurry up and wait, don't do anything, just watch from afar" thing doesn't always work. More people need to go to CPP with hidden cameras, Pegasus too. Start going in groups to these places; they can't catch us all.

            It makes sense that satanic jewish pedophiles would use shitty art as a money laundering operation for their crimes against children. It's the same way they used fake "israeli art students" as spies during the lead-up to the Mossad attack on the World Trade Center on 9-11, and the same as the jewish homosexual art group "gelitin b" who lived on the exact floors where the World Trade Center explosions occurred just prior to 9-11. Inbred, satanic jewish homosexual pedophiles have a long history of using art as a cover for their Talmudic crimes against humanity.

            "GEMARA. … Rab said: Pederasty with a child below nine years of age is not deemed as pederasty with a child above that. Samuel said: Pederasty with a child below three years is not treated as with a child above that. (2) What is the basis of their dispute? Rab makes nine years the minimum; but if one committed sodomy with a child of lesser age, no guilt is incurred. Samuel makes three the minimum."

            I keep thinking it would be awesome if somehow some sleuthing could be done by attending one of these "auctions".   I wonder if they are invitation-only?    Also, if a site/business is called a "museum," I would think there would need to be at least some hours where the exhibits were open for public viewing. I don't know of any museum that doesn't have hours for public visitation.

             You as an unknown outsider attending for the first time would not see or hear anything unusual just an ordinary art auction. You could even bid if you establish credit so they know you have money to pay if your bid is the highest bid and you'd go home with an expensive painting but nothing else. Only those who are insiders who are known to those running the auction would be told how to bid for a boy or girl to have sex with and that only happens if you are rich and powerful.

            That would explain why the art produced today is such junk and overpriced.  The only thing I find wrong with your post is the description of this stuff the produce as "legitimate work of art".  Much of it looks like it was produced in a kindergarten.
            <br/>
            This is a theory worth looking at and testing.  What more can we find to confirm or disconfirm this?

             I think I know why the 'Art' is so crappy!  It guarantees that only their 'Art collectors' come to the 'Sales' as no genuine artists would be interested.  Makes you think that is the only reason for any of this abhorrent, so called art, being produced.

              That was the ONLY thing Alefantis cared about in their text convo. He honed in on Pegasus. That's what he wanted deleted. And he (JA) never thought that convo would become public.

               True. Imagine how they had this perfect place set up with a park and all. They did all kinds of renevations on the building. But by Pegasus being revealed, it would have royally screwed their world up. What an inconvenience to the sick freaks.

                I created the thread, I got hacked via the original chans that were at the start of the pizza stuff.
               </p>
               <p>
                I was a bit of a pest, taunting  alefantis and supporting trump (won big on trump getting presidency) I had everyone on my back at the time. CTR (correct the record) and others where out to get me. I'm not sure if you no of CTR, but they had the tools supplied by the NSA - the ones which are now in the public domain. No: this isn't paranoia I've  been looking into pizza and associated stuff since Nov 2016.

             The scary thing is that this is what the 1% do to procure their playthings.  What do the other 99% of pedos do to acquire playthings?  Dungeons, dog crates, storerooms, etc.  The poorer pedos don't get to shop at "Whole Foods for Children".

            You're allowed to have a theory, but what is it based on?  This is pure conjecture.  If you were to make deductions based on circumstantial evidence, you'd have a case.  But you've pulled your theory out of thin air.
