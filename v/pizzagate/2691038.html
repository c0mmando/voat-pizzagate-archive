See the very end of page 2 of this post for the &quot;intimidating&quot; Logan photo. <a href="https://whyweprotest.net/threads/doyle-mills-osabot.78333/">https://whyweprotest.net/threads/doyle-mills-osabot.78333/</a></p>

<p>Here Logan Mills calls himself &quot;OSA\'s Ghost&quot; funny since his dad used to put on his FB that he works for &quot;KP Ghost Productions&quot; (see other threads on &quot;Doyle Mills&quot;) KP = Kiddie Porn</p>
<p>Funny because Logan Mills says people got a lot of stuff wrong on the thread there, but there\'s just a bunch of photos of Doyle, and people making fun of him, so not much to get wrong. He also says &quot;OSA is watching&quot;</p>
<p>I previously posted on here about this person, Doyle Mills, whose Instagram had a naked child (not his, but the son of a woman he befriended and got her to let him babysit on multiple occasions) sitting on his lap and how he was connected to two obvious child trafficking accounts (one seemed to be a young prostitute or slave and the other was selling satanic pizza gear) and how he always mentions people calling him daddy who are not his kids. </p>

<p>This Why We Protest (Anonymous) thread is the same thread where I was given threats in May 2017 that I should lose my children to CPS and die in a fire. Those threats were later scrubbed but I have screenshots, which are on this really old post from last year. I still don\'t know who made the threats, they could have been from Doyle, or perhaps Logan, or maybe even my ex husband:

<p>My question - is the high level OSA at Scientology going to allow Logan into their office to start intimidating people with his scary violin and nose ring? Or are they going to just keep doing remote stalking of their victims? Also, what does OSA do for the US Govt besides look like idiots?</p>

             Yes, I remember him too. Check out his IG doylemillsusa he’s got kids all over tons of pics. For Christmas he put a decorated tree upside down from the ceiling and the occult star clearly visible. Pic of an animal tail hanging from his bed, furries. He claims to be a volunteer minister. The other men he is with on his page look like total creeps too.

              Well they always say that we should look at someone's friends and that will tell us who they are.  He seems to attract creeps.  Birds of a Feather.

             Yes, this is much, much better. I will remove the flair.

             One thing that would make all of your posts easier to follow is if you could embed the supporting links right in the text they support. You can do this using the third formatting button (view desktop site if on mobile to see the buttons), or if that is too hard when you're posting from a phone, just enclose the text you want to turn into a link in square brackets, folled by the url for the hyperlink right after it (no spaces) in parentheses. This makes it much, much easier for mods to verify which links support which claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, it's good procedure to always assume your reader has no clue about what an acronym means, who someone is, and that kind of thing. Your edits explaining thee in this post were excellent.

                Interestingly, I was looking back through the comments on some of Jem's posts and he shows up there doing the same thing 8 months ago. This is probably part of the same set of Jem-related alts.

            EYJP, this is a very difficult thread to follow. Please edit to clearly explain who this Doyle character is, why there is a board devoted to ridiculing him, what OSA is, and how this is relevant to investigating elite child abuse. Instead of only linking to your past equally complicated threads, please pull the relevant supporting links from them and include them in this post so people do not have to go through a labyrinth of threads to see the support for your claims. Crosslinking to your old posts is great, but making us dig three or four layers deep for supporting links like the naked instagram pic or the pope pics really doesn't meet our Rule 2 requirement for linked support. It's probably not your intent, but it also looks like an effort to drive traffic to your blog and steemit channel instead of making a straightforward post containing all relevant links inside it, which weakens your argument. Giving this the 24 Hour Grace flair.
