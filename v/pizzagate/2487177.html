              Well, this post needs to clearly state how Slim's tunnel relates to elite child sex abuse. Are you saying he used the project to launder money from human trafficking? Or is the premise here just "something fucky is going on" because he is a big CF contributor and Mexico is the epicenter of human trafficking? It's really not clear in either this thread or the one you linked to in pgwhatever.

               Really just something fucky is going on and I'm trying to get C. Slim on people's radar. I can't be the only one trying to keep tabs on this power player and hoping more goats find him as significant as I do and research who IDEAL is and who belongs to this organization because I can find nothing. Why did it take 13 years to construct this tunnel? Were they using it for trafficking during construction? Slim is one bad dude and for people to automatically see this tunnel as a link to corrupt activities cannot be simply brushed away as nothing.

            What is connected by the tunnels? Carlos Slim spent a year or two unofficially rated as “the world’s richest man”. He is never spoken of in Mexico. It’s rumored that he owns all of the cel phone services, newspapers and tv stations.

             You're absolutely on par with all of that, and it would be interesting to find out more about his past, but I've checked and can't find anything that explains how he got to where he is now or who he's related to.

            Underwater tunnels?  You mean like the one drive to work in every other day?
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you serious?  You've never heard of a tunnel under a river?   NYC has three of them for cars and several others for subways.  This has been going on for over a 100 years in America.  In London the tunnel under the Thames is 175 years old.

            You haven't heard of the Big Dig in Boston?  The Holland Tunnel, the Midtown Tunnel?  The Chunnel? Aka the tunnel under the British Channel? Oakland and San Francisco have train tunnels under the Bay.

             in the telesurtv article:  A few months after his term ended, in December 1994, Salinas fled the country, leaving it in economic shambles. The situation was so grave that then U.S. President Bill Clinton felt forced to step in and order his Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin to transfer US$20 billion in emergency funds to then Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, who took the opportunity to buy himself a mansion worth close to US$1 million.

             I can't believe Osorno is still alive.  Anyway, Salinas, the former El Presidente, I believe his son is also involved in the Sex Cult Ring being run by Raniere.  These guys, just like in the US all hang together.  They stay in a circle because they are the only ones they can trust.  Slim, like "El Chapo" Guzman donated to Clinton.  I remember when I was still with reddit there was a news item that Guzman hand donated 1M to HRC.  Well before you knew it, it was already being debunked by Snopes.  WHISK, it was gone.  Just like that.  The money BC sent to Mexico was probably laundered, after Zedillo pealed off his 1M.

              Yes, indeed! Follow the money donated by disgusting creatures and it usually leads back to the Clintons. I can't believe people still believe Snopes about anything. In fact, it seems we have our own version of Snopes here who call themself Are_we_sure. LOL!

               I think I checked out Snopes a few years ago and started noticing that all of their answers ended up in favor of democrats.  Even though I was a Dem. I started doubting them and lo and behold we found out they were a Bogus and Disinfo.   Yeah, I think it's pretty sad people still believe.  How Dense.
