<p>Former Youth Group Leader Sentenced To 5 Years In Prison For Transportation Of Child Pornography</p>
<p>David Osborn, age 41, of New Castle, Delaware, was sentenced today to 5 years in prison for transportation of child pornography via AOL chat rooms and email.  Osborn also was sentenced to 5 years of supervised release following his prison sentence.  He also will be required to register as a sex offender in any jurisdiction in which he lives, works, or attends school. </p>
<p>at the hearing and documents filed in court, Osborn was identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation through reports of child pornography trafficking that had been provided by AOL LLC to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (“NCMEC”).  Under federal law, internet service providers, such as AOL, are required to report suspected child pornography being transmitted over their servers to NCMEC, which then directs these “cybertips” to the appropriate law enforcement agency.  AOL  identified Osborn, used AOL email to trade images of child pornography with another AOL customer in South Florida. </p>
<p>In May 2011, federal agents executed a search warrant at Osborn’s New Castle residence and arrested Osborn after finding over 700 images of child pornography on his computer equipment.  Law enforcement agents also searched Osborn’s email account, which was found to contain additional images of child pornography.  Osborn’s child pornography collection focused mainly on girls between the ages of four and sixteen.  Forensic data found on the equipment indicated that Osborn had been receiving and distributing images of child pornography for over eight years.  Also found were over 500 internet chat logs between Osborn and others regarding child sexual exploitation.  Investigators also learned that Osborn was the moderator of an online chat room devoted to discussions of physical abuse to coerce them into engaging in sexual acts. </p>
<p>Over the 13 years prior to his arrest, Osborn worked as a substitute teacher in the Appoquinimink School District and as a school bus driver for elementary and high school students at various New Castle County Schools.  Osborn also was a member of Masons Lodge Number 26, in Newport, Delaware, where he held various positions supervising youth groups for pre-teen and teenage boys and girls.<br />
the main way that high level initiates of Freemasonry can have a long running supply of children for sexual abuse is by infiltrating Child Care Centres, Government-run Children’s Homes and Boys Clubs.</p>

<p>Lodge History
    Armstrong Lodge No. 26 A.F. &amp; A.M. was chartered on June, 1870 and could rightly be called the “mother Lodge” of Newport, because of the rapid rise in membership during the 1940’s and 50’s. It would help four Lodges get their start in the Newport area. Included would be Ionic Lodge No. 31 in 1950, Unity Lodge No. 32 in 1955, Christiana Lodge No. 35 in 1963 and High Noon Lodge No. 38 in 1978.
     The events of the last fifty years have shone brightly from the labors of the quarries of Armstrong Lodge No. 26. In addition to the formation of new Lodges they have also had the honor of four of them members being elected Grand Master of Masons in Delaware; Joseph W. H. Watson, served two terms, in 1880 and 1881, Paul Yearsley in 1947, Arthur G. Craig in 1965 and David J. Marianelli in 1989.</p>
<pre><code> In 1964, PGM Paul Yearsley retired as Treasurer of the Lodge after twenty-two years of service. He was the first DeMolay to occupy the office of Grand Master in 1947. In 1971, PGM Arthur G. Craig retired as Secretary of the Lodge after twenty-three years of service in that office.
 After serving as Senior Grand Warden and Deputy Grand Master, Grand Master-elect Edward P. Sturgis was called from labor on September 15, 1974 about two weeks prior to his scheduled installation as a very young Grand Master at the age of 40. Brother “Ed” was a hard working Master Mason who had been awarded nearly every honor possible as a DeMolay, including the DeMolay Cross of Honor. Bill Clinton was a DeMolay. Although not a &quot;Masonic organization&quot; as such, DeMolay is considered to be part of the general &quot;family&quot; of Masonic and associated organizations, along with other youth groups

 While many brethren have been involved in the in the maintenance of the Newport Masonic Temple over the years. Though they have been called from labor, their devotion to serving the membership in providing a well-maintained facility will long be remembered and appreciated by the various bodies that use the facility.

 Through the influence of PGM Craig, the early English Table Lodge was reconstituted at Armstrong Lodge. It proved to be a very popular event and it was not unusual to have 250 to 300 brethren in attendance. 
 As part of the 100th Anniversary Celebration of Armstrong Lodge, a public installation of officers was held at the H.C. Conrad High School Athletic Field on June 27, 1970. Much hard work had to be done to make this event a success, as the field had not been in use for some time. In addition, the Lodge furniture had to be moved to the field as well. There were over 200 family members and friends who watched from the bleachers.

            So he was sentenced in 2012. Meaning he's already served 5 years (as of 2017) and now he is out on "supervised release"

            Seems like we ought to track this Pedophile down. I'll bet that supervision is pretty lax.

              Rampantlion1314 was Osborn, 40, who not only had worked as a school bus driver, but as a substitute teacher and had been involved with a youth organization for girls, according to federal authorities in Delaware. Osborn, of New Castle, Del., told federal agents that he left the youth group after he was accused of being "a pervert," according to court records.
             </p>
             <p>
              Police reports indicate he also had been investigating for sexually harassing a 14-year-old girl on Facebook.

              The cybertip that alerted authorities to Mangione eventually led them to Osborn, court records show.

               I guess he did click on some CP videos...and it just so happens he himself "was sexually abused when he was young."  Hm.  You have to wonder who did the abusing.

            Yes, DeMolay is a Higher Order of the Masonic Order and Bill Clinton is definitely a member.  As would be expected.  And I am sure this pervert was on his way to becoming a High Level Member as well.  Mostly all of his jobs have dealt with Children.

             , I thought DeMolay was a youth order of FreeMasonry (kinda like the nazi youth) is it also for adults/ an adult title?

              Yes. Bill Clinton is a member. It’s on the internet. It lists him and others. There are even Higher ones. I forget which is the Highest one. There is one that is highest in world. We can guess who the members are. Paul Ryan Priebus and Walker were all Boy Scouts. There is an Order that came ftom the BSA.

            Over the 13 years prior to his arrest, Osborn worked as a substitute teacher in the Appoquinimink School District and as a school bus driver for elementary and high school students at various New Castle County Schools. Osborn also was a member of Masons Lodge Number 26, in Newport, Delaware, where he held various positions supervising youth groups for pre-teen and teenage boys and girls.

            We would think that strict background checks would get around this but they can also put in place people that will ignore the rules and look the other way to put these sickos in place.  What to do about these innovative perverts.   This is how we have been getting so many teachers and school bus drivers that sexually abuse Our Children.  Possibly our School Boards and Higher Ups have also been infiltrated.

             If I remember I will include the info I found about Unions being started by Masons and some of their Meeting Places being Masonic Lodges.  Shocking.  Just found by accident trying to help someone with their research.  Not all unions just some. But by now who knows.  They have had the time to do their infiltrating.

               I believe some are probably clueless. The ones that are doing evil things are good at hiding. But I also think there are Lodges that are set up for Pure Evil.
