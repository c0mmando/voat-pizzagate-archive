<blockquote>
<p>....There is another odd connection of Imran Awan that goes back to the circle around prominent neoconservative Paul Wolfowitz during the Iraq War. In late 2002 and early 2003, Wolfowitz regularly met secretly with a group of Iraqi expatriates who resided in the Washington area and were opponents of the Saddam Hussein regime. The Iraqis had not been in their country of birth for many years but they claimed to have regular contact with well-informed family members and political allies. The Iraqi advisers provided Wolfowitz with a now-familiar refrain, i.e. that the Iraqi people would rise up to support invading Americans and overthrow the hated Saddam. They would greet their liberators with bouquets of flowers and shouts of joy.</p>
<p>The Iraqis were headed by one Dr. Ali A. al-Attar, born in Baghdad to Iranian parents in 1963, a 1989 graduate of the American University of Beirut Faculty of Medicine. He subsequently emigrated to the United States and set up a practice in internal medicine in Greenbelt, Md., a suburb of Washington D.C. Al-Attar eventually expanded his business to include nine practices that he wholly or partly owned in Virginia and Maryland but he eventually lost his license due to “questionable billing practices” as well as “unprofessional conduct” due to having sex with patients.</p>
<p>Al-Attar was investigated by the FBI and eventually indicted for large scale health care fraud in 2008-09. This included charging insurance companies more than $2.3 million for services their patients did not actually receive, with many of the false claims using names of diplomats and employees enrolled in a group plan at the Egyptian Embassy in Washington. In one case, the doctors claimed an embassy employee visited three of their clinics every 26 days between May 2007 and August 2008 to have the same testing done each time. The insurance company paid the doctors $55,000 for more than 400 nonexistent procedures for the one patient alone.</p>
<p>Al-Attar fled the United States after the indictment to avoid arrest and imprisonment and is now considered a fugitive from justice. Late in 2012 he was observed in Beirut, Lebanon, conversing with a Hezbollah official. Al-Attar is of interest in this case because he appears to have been a friend of Imran Awan and also loaned him $100,000, which was never repaid. The FBI is currently looking into any possible espionage involving the two men as Awan and his associates clearly had access to classified information while working in the House of Representatives

<p>This Wolfowitz connection was new to me and might have some more significance as to who and what the Awans really are. I wonder if the fugitive doctor also gave Imran blackmail material over some of his patients and who those patients were...</p>

            Where does Imran Awan, an  IT employee  and non-citizen working in America,
get  the chutzpah to engage 
such a high powered lawyer?(if what is being
reported is true).
           </p>
           <p>
            Who is paying for that?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or is the Imran and brothers thing some kind
of psychological operation, (all the  reporting on  it is so outlandish).

                This NK nuke rattling has taken an upward soar of late.  Strikes me that this coincides with the upward interest in the Awans and DWS saga and I've wondered whether it's a deliberate distraction.

            I found these Doctors in Ny and a connection with the Awans like 5-6 months ago, thanks to SYNT.US and George Webb.

              Thanks. I think this Ed Buck thing is promising. Lots of leads.
