<p><em>&quot;I began by becoming a volunteer youth worker, which is how I met my first inspiring role model, Kath, who taught me what being a great youth worker is and mentored me through my youth work training.

One of the reasons I was attracted to Girlguiding was that volunteering was a cornerstone of my own career development.</em></p>
<p><em>When I was 23, I met my second role model, Beth, a female chief executive. She told me that she thought I had the potential to be at the top of an important charity one day.&quot;</em></p>

<p>The Girl Guides story began in 1908, when army general <strong>Lord Baden-Powell</strong> founded the Boy Scouts. In 1910, Powell decided that girls should have an organisation of their own, and asked his sister, Agnes Baden-Powell, to head the movement. </p>
<p><strong>Robert Baden-Powell</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell,_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baden-Powell,_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell</a></p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>...notice the double entendre</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Baden-Powell was the son of The Reverend Baden Powell, a <strong>Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford University</strong> and Church of England priest and his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth (3 September 1824 – 13 October 1914) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lewis Carroll attended the lectures on pure geometry by Rev. Baden Powell. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>[The significance of this Lewis Carroll information will be explained in another post]</p>
<p>So let\'s get back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savilian_Professor_of_Geometry">Savilian Professor of Geometry</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The position of Savilian Professor of Geometry was established at the University of Oxford in 1619. It was founded (at the same time as the Savilian Professorship of Astronomy) by <strong>Sir Henry Savile</strong>, </p>
<p>He wanted students to be educated in the works of the leading scientists of the ancient world, saying that the professor of geometry should teach Euclid\'s Elements, Apollonius\'s Conics, and <strong>the works of Archimedes</strong>; tuition in trigonometry was to be shared by the two professors. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>[The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral">Archimedian spiral</a> and its relation to pedophilia symbology will be examined in another post.]</p>
<p>Sir Henry Savile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Savile_(Bible_translator)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Savile_(Bible_translator)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 30 September 1604 <strong>Savile</strong> was knighted, and in that year he was named one of the body of scholars appointed to prepare the authorised versionof the Bible. He was entrusted with parts of the gospels, the Acts of the Apostles and the Book of Revelation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Savile family were heavily involved with the Royal family as well as esoteric knowledge  
</p>
<p>I am willing to bet that Jimmy Savile is a descendent of this family.  I tried to trace his family roots but there are missing links in the chain (maybe deliberately so).</p>
<p>Back to information on Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout Movement:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Reviews/Miscellaneous/scoutingforboys.html">http://www.johnderbyshire.com/Reviews/Miscellaneous/scoutingforboys.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The personality of the author is all over this book. The title of Jeal\'s biography is The Boy-Man, and it is from this aspect of Baden-Powell\'s character that the Scouting ethos arose. Just three years before the publication of Scouting for Boys Baden-Powell had attended his first performance of J.M. Barrie\'s play Peter Pan. He went back the next day to see it again, and returned to it many times thereafter. To say that Baden-Powell never quite grew up does not quite capture the man\'s full depth, though. He functioned capably in the adult world; his marriage, though very late, seems to have been happy (it produced three children); and he was nobody\'s fool.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And tellingly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is easy to smile now at the book\'s author, at his enthusiasm for pastimes like pig-sticking and skirt-dancing, his snobbery and imperialism, his determined repression of his own sexuality, whatever it was. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recent cases of pedophilia within the scout movement (and there are many)..</p>
<p>From 1998, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/paedophile-rings-30-years-of-abuse-1198569.html">Paedophile ring\'s 30 years of abuse</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>SCOTLAND YARD revealed last night that paedophiles who infiltrated a breakaway scout association have sexually assaulted up to 300 children over the past 30 years in one of the worst cases of abuse uncovered in Britain. </p>
<p>The men belonged to the <strong>UK Baden-Powell Scout Association</strong>, which broke away from the main scouting movement in the late Sixties. The group has 100 lodges and 2,000 boys. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And another case from earlier this year 2017,  in a long line of similar cases involving scout masters <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3292576/scout-association-accused-of-letting-paedo-leader-abuse-boys-for-30-years-after-failing-to-report-him-to-police/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3292576/scout-association-accused-of-letting-paedo-leader-abuse-boys-for-30-years-after-failing-to-report-him-to-police/</a></p>

            Fuck the scouts! Seriously I hated Boy Scout camp, got butt raped though it took me years to realize what it was. Woke up thought I pissed myself, but I was dragged out of my bunk used by a group and left outside. Bass terds. Used to cry to mom and dad take me home. Sucks I realize now there is a ton of it going on. Scouting for boys, no shit never knew that

            Bingo! Scouting for Boys.  I caught that too in your beginning of your post.  I am still in Mortal Shock over the transgender decision within the Girl Scouts.  They are putting these girls in Danger.  More ways to have access to them and to be Grooming them.  Warning Pamphlets and Sheets must be handed to parents outside of schools in parks where they bring their children.  Sick Sick Sick Sick Sick!!!!!

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The position of Savilian Professor of Astronomy was established at the University of Oxford in 1619. It was founded (at the same time as the Savilian Professorship of Geometry) by Sir Henry Savile, a mathematician and classical scholar who was Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Provost of Eton College. He appointed John Bainbridge as the first professor, who took up his duties in 1620 or 1621.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bainbridge practised as a physician in Leicestershire and London after leaving Cambridge. His first book, An Astronomicall Description of the Late Comet, was published in 1619 and described the comet of the previous year. He was already known by this time to Sir Henry Savile and
             <strong>
              Henry Briggs
             </strong>
             (who Savile appointed as his first geometry professor).
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1618, he became a member of the puritan group of scholars known as the
             <strong>
              Gresham Circle
             </strong>
             .

             In 1596, he became first professor of Geometry in the recently founded Gresham College, London; where he taught geometry, astronomy and navigation. He would lecture there for nearly 23 years, and would make Gresham college a center of English mathematics, from which he would notably support the new ideas of Johannes Kepler.

            <p>
             Gresham was founded in 1597, the brainchild of Thomas Gresham,
             <strong>
              king of what’s now called the Square Mile
             </strong>
             . He had also established the Royal Exchange, and decreed that rents paid by merchants there should fund free lectures open to anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gresham also led its more famous cousins in having professors of geometry and astronomy; an early occupant of the second post was Christopher Wren. In 1660 the college gave birth to the Royal Society, which meant that, for a while, the Society’s members were known as ‘Greshamites’. Samuel Pepys attended a 1666 lecture at which one of the first-ever blood transfusions occurred. ‘There was a pretty experiment of the blood of one dog let out, till he died, into the body of another on one side, while all his own run out on the other side,’ he wrote. ‘The first died upon the place, and the other very well, and likely to do well.’

             God I wish I had more time for this.  There is so much chicanery going on here.  Sir Henry Savile for sure must be related to Jimmy Savile and Provost of Eton.  ETON?  There have been so many that went to Eton and have been convicted of pedophelia.  Lord Mountbatten for one and many others.  It is a breeding ground for grooming and abuse.  It literally, in my opinion, has created pedophiles or continued abuse that was already begun before the boys even attended.  This is my opinion and my opinion only, but Eton Should Be Shut Down.  It is a Breeding Ground For Pedophilia.  There is no way if I had a child I would ever send him there, no matter how rich I was or who paid for it.  If you do, you either want your child dickered with or you already are.  Shameful Place and Should Be Shut Down.

             A "pretty experiment"?  What does that mean!  What kind of lectures where they giving for anyone to see?  All this stuff is highly suspicious and the Rothschilds taking over that place is Evil Indeed.
