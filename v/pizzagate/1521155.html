            I'm stuck on the word "seems" in Susan Sandler's email to Podesta.  "a map that seems pizza-related".  Why not "a map that's pizza related" or "a pizza related map"?  "Seems" implies to me examination of the object, peering at it, maybe looking at it closely in a good light.  Is she referring to a small stain that the realtor didn't mention out of delicacy or possibly didn't even notice?  Is Susan saying "hey did you cum on this hanky or wipe with it --I spy something there"? Or "hey the kid may have left a blood spot on this hanky" ...?

             From the context it is very unlikely that she saw it.  I think that she is just inferring from what she knows  and what she has just been told by email.  Suppose she know what Podesta used handkerchiefs for and just was concerned that he'd left one behind.  He response could have several means as others have discussed.  One could be no it is just a "clean" handkerchief no worries.  Or, it could I'm not going to express concern in an email but he took measures otherwise to retrieve it.  Or, it could be that he just isn't worried regardless.

            I kept coming back to this email too.  If it is innocent then it should be easily explained.  However, as we know, the content of the leaks has never been fully addressed by those involved.  Not even an investigation to clear up any misunderstandings.  They all know something...they have too.  I'm kind of insulted at the diversion and cover-ups attempting to make us all look stupid.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has anyone looked at the properties that the realtor showed them?  I was trying to figure out what the Field house is.  Is is a last name or a nickname for a building on a property?  I looked at the listings and noted the ones with kitchen islands.  These are my half-assed notes that I have not gotten back to.  There's is no clear indication that any of the listed houses are the actual house, but I'm suspicious enough to think one of them is being used for extra-curricular activities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, these are notes I dumped in notepad to one day research.  I noted the mismatch in property ID's just out of curiosity but it could be an honest mistake.  Something stinks about it all though.

            I think that the realtor must know, too. After all, would you trust any realtor to just wander into your home and see all of your hidden rooms?

            Oh, BTW: I called this out weeks ago, in my NYT Pizzagate article breakdown (a post which got almost no response).  Here is what I said:
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             This handkerchief exchange needs more consideration than it's gotten yet; allow me to provide it here:
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             The NYT authors don't include the realtor's email to Susan Sandler, which describes the handkerchief as black and white but does not mention a map. This raises a major question: why does Susan Sandler "think" it "has a map" when the realtor didn't mention one? The realtor didn't mention any writing on it, which would have been an intuitive thing to mention had the realtor been trying to give a helpful description, as it appears they were. So what sort of "map" could this be, given that (a) the realtor apparently didn't recognize it as a map, (b) the realtor didn't mention any writing at all, and (c) Sandler wasn't even sure it was a map -- but (d) Sandler said that whatever it was which she "[thought]" was a map "seem[ed] pizza-related"? Now add in Podesta's unqualified reply: "It's mine." Wait... how does he know it's his, from that fucked-up description?
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             LOGICAL QUESTIONS FOR JOHN PODESTA OR SUSAN SANDLER: What the fuck was this handkerchief? What did it actually look like? What was this "map"? In what way was this "map" "pizza-related"? FOR SANDLER: Why were you unsure that this was a map, and why were you unsure whether or not it was "pizza-related"?

            This has been a very informative thread, especially with its discussion on how the information was passed along from the realtor to John Podesta, and also with a lot of other material covered in the comments.

            You don't describe a piece of fabric as pizza related unless it has pizza on it because what the heck is considered pizza related cuz I have no clue. If I describe something I don't say what it is related to unless I am purposefully being vague.

            Given the known handkerchief code and MAP is a commonly used term for minor attracted person. This reads to me as she's encountered a minor attracted person into s&amp;m (black) and masterbation  (white) possibly looking for something perhaps porn ( pizza ) related as opposed to live action. Perhaps there was a gathering of potentially like minded people at this 'viewing'.

            Survivors of satanic ritual abuse and MK Ultra often include the 'handkerchief' or towel in their art to highlight their importance. Are the victims telling us that handkerchiefs are used to collect bodily fluids (semen, blood, DNA) and kept as 'souvenirs' of the ritual abuse by their abusers? If so, than this would prove that map is the right code word for semen.

            Good one, and in light of this, I think that the usual interpretation of
            <em>
             map
            </em>
            as
            <em>
             semen
            </em>
            is not correct. It seems to me that Susan tries to interpret
            <em>
             white w/ black
            </em>
            , the colors which
            <em>
             map
            </em>
            to a certain fetish combo as per the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief_code">
             handkerchief code
            </a>
            . In this sense, a handkerchief that
            <em>
             has a map that seems pizza-related
            </em>
            would mean a handkerchief that is color-coded in a sexual (
            <em>
             pizza-related
            </em>
            ) way.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Podesta's reply ("
            <em>
             It's mine, but not worth worrying about.
            </em>
            ") seems to confirm that it's not meant to mean
            <em>
             semen
            </em>
            , since if it was indeed semen, and Susan tells him in a code language that there's a handkerchief with semen on it that might be his, he probably wouldn't say it's not worth worrying about. It might be an "unused" (unstained) handkerchief, otherwise the clueless realtor would probably not even contact them offering to send it over in mail. Think about it, isn't it mightily awkward to find a handkerchief that is stained with apparent bodily fluids, and write a delighted email about the possibility of mailing it over? I'd probably not go out of my way to say anything about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, this is just speculation on my part, but it makes more sense in the context than
            <em>
             semen
            </em>
            .

             Do you realise that you're talking about a handkerchief? How would it be related to pizza in any way if there was no semen or blood on it. How would a handkerchief be related to black and white at all if there was nothing on it to suggest it was BDSM?! Do you get what i'm saying?
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's say there was nothing on it, no blood or semen. Just a handkerchief. Now, why would they bring up the black and white (BDSM) or sadism on a virgin theory if it was clean? How would they make this connection? The only explanation is that map means semen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Something else this proves that the handkerchief IS a 'souvenir' that is usually kept by the abuser. That's why she asks if it's his. His response means, it's mine but you can trash it.

              You're entirely misunderstanding my comment.
             </p>
             <p>
              I didn't say nor imply whatosever that the handkerchief wasn't one of the color-coded sexual fetish handkerchiefs, or that it wasn't intended to be used as a souvenir with semen/blood on it at one point. In fact, I've alluded to the opposite.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I'm saying is that the context – the importance of which OP rightly emphasizes – suggests that regardless of the handkerchief being intended to be used as a sexual souvenir at some point or not,
              <em>
               map
              </em>

             <p>

               wasn't

              going to be used as a souvenir collecting semen, it only means that the codeword

               map
              </em>
              doesn't refer to that habit.

               I have to disagree. Map = semen makes much more sense.
              </p>
              <p>
               "The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related)."
              </p>
              <p>
               Now replace the code words with these correct words: "The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has semen that seems child sex-related)." Makes sense.
              </p>
              <p>
               One can only imagine what semen, mixed with a child's hymen blood (since it's Black and White, meaning Sadism on virgin child) collected from sexual abuse and having dried-up would look like. Exactly, a map. 
Did you ever cut your finger and wiped it with a cloth or ever let a bloody nose drop on a towel? Check it after its all dried out. It looks like a map.
              </p>
              <p>
               If, on the other hand, we should put map as in a mapping context, what would they have to map in that email? The details are all included. Handkerchief, Black and white, pizza-related. What could possibly be misinterpreted in that message that would require the word map to indicate that she's using code words, when she IS using code words already? It would be useless. Even if there wasn't any semen or blood on it, the code words B&amp;W and pizza-related are already there and obviously out of place. She wouldn't have to specify that it's a mapping. Anyway, I don't know how to be clearer than I am in my logic. Common sense is what is telling me that map = semen. You can disagree, no problem LOL.

            Yeah, this one and the dominos on cheese one are pretty much undeniably code for something.  Also I have wondered about the pillows referenced in the pizza map email.  Were they also code words or actually pillows?

            If you look at the dates of the emails they are only days apart, so this is not after a weekend away but after having been shown houses for future use. There is no way however that they wouldn't have a scrap of paper for the 'map' if it were an actual map. Nor could it be 'pizza related' if it were a literal map to a pizza place. Definitely code

            the other part of that email that is somewhat less interesting but still so is:
           </p>
           <p>
            "I also meant to inquire yesterday about the pillows you purchased. I can send them as well, if you let me know where they are in the house."
           </p>
           <p>
            It sounds like Sandler bought some pillows and put them in the rental house for this event, and now Tate is going to pick them up for her. Probably nothing, just putting it out there as things tend to get lost in this email given the big handkerchief part of it. Maybe Sandler was the event coordinator...maybe pillow is a code word....also if there's a "realtor" involved does this mean they have been renting out homes that are for sale? And who is the realtor in question? Whoever it is, Podesta doesn't seem to worried about him/her. This email tells a bigger story...

            </p>
            <p>
             Here's the thing: if the first part about the hanky is as nefarious as theorized, the next part about pillows purchased isn't referring to some fluffy pillows for Podesta to rest his head on. It would be referring to more trafficking related paraphernalia. If part b is innocent, then part a is innocent.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is no reason that anyone should understand everything in an email describing events they weren't part of and it's confirmation bias fallacy to define words as code to make what is being described understandable to them. Not saying it's not possible, just saying.

              I brought the pillow sentence up because maybe it is code for drugs or a trafficking term as you say. I don't doubt. If it was referring simply to actual pillows to be used at an orgy with adults and children, I would be surpised. Thought I'd learned recently that "pillow" was a term for a large bag of cocaine...anyway putting this topic out there for ideas...(going now to see what the post before mine was..)

            If I was to buy the code theory about the pizza related map, the I would suspect that the "pillows" he purchased that the person was gonna mail to Podesta along with the hanky is code for knock-out pills.

            I never really thought about this, but why no one even should worry about a handkerchief? I think nobody would really answer like that if it was just a handkerchief?

              agreed. I also noticed that the day JP left the vineyard he sent a strange message to Herb saying he left a pair of his glasses behind. maybe to provide cover for a return visit?

              Here's the thing. JP left the house the Friday before Labor Day and this email from the realtor Tate happens on Tuesday! How is his handkerchief still there on the kitchen counter not found by the hosts, the Sandlers, but found by the realtor, Tate, instead?

             Yes, and the Luzzatto pool party invitation and responses can also be read to confirm mutual understanding of coded references not otherwise explained in the writings themselves.  In the Luzzatto case, I refer to the response that says the respondent has not had an affair.

              Urban dictionary also defines "pillows" as marijuana - i'm assuming a decent amount. Crossed my mind that she was looking for her weed? Too much of a stretch?

               You could be right, but I would caution that these type of people aren't necessarily going by the urban dictionary book for their code words. Maybe codewords coming out of military intelligence and intel agencies may be also more likely used? I don't know about this area, but that is my thought.

               i'm inclined to believe that the pillows are just pillows.  in my experience, everything in a rental house is for sale - and the realtor is an interior decorator.  if someone just liked the throw-pillows, and had to have them, they could have bought an identical set.
              </p>
              <p>
               maybe it's more, but i don't think the realtor was in-the-know.  just imo, though.

            map=semen doesn't make sense to me, because the realtor described it as simply a black/white handerkerchief. The realtor didn't say it had stains on it, so how would Sandler know? I do think the word map is code, though.

              Good question. Depends on whether the Realtor is involved or innocent. If she is innocent then handkerchief just means handkerchief. I think on eof the things we really need to do is work out how much the realtor is involved.

              I took a minimalistic approach to this to show how to argue this to "unbelievers", so I take the handkerchief literally.  If you do then it shows that Susan Sandler must know something because she says that she "thinks it has a map that is pizza related" so she doesn't know and hasn't had a conversation with Tate to get a detailed description.  Otherwise she would be more emphatic or wouldn't have forwarded the email.  Sandler is just afraid that might be the case and wants to warn Podesta of this possibility.  This to me exclude the idea of a literal map.  She is using some kind of code.  The only credible objection is that it might be a code for something else that pedophilia.  But, if so what would that be?  It is clued by a cloth handkerchief.  When we have the Podesta's involvement with Thelema

              this seem more likely.  We see the cloth in the art work under the victim.  So this is only explanation that make sense given what I know. I would be interested in hearing their alternative explanation.

             I agree. The "map" refers to how the black and white is like a guide to your fetish. People use handkerchief code to navigate these get-togethers and to find others that are into the same thing.

            There's a video on youtube that feebly tries to debunk the "pizza-map handkerchief" by Suggesting that there are handkerchiefs with maps
on them. Well the author suggests google image search "handkerchief map" - which granted there are tons, they are all STATE based maps
  Very souvenir-shop / state line gas station type of item. Fantastic Lots of maps... you know what i didn't find ? a " pizza related one"  AFTER
20 minutes of searching re-phrasing the search, could not find a SINGLE example...
           </p>
           <p>
            Guys be on the look out for things that are posted AFTER 11/6/2016 i believe this was about the time the fake news narrative started
and the dissuasion campaign started.  They have even been caught creating fake profiles, etc... so any evidence presented AFTER
 that date is EXTREMELY suspicious and likely manufactured.
           </p>
           <p>
            but yeah Hunt1954, VERY sound logic and good catch, she describes the handkerchief as just being black and white, which would
leave someone to assume its plain, and void of any specific pattern, logo or design... how it transforms to " pizza related map" is just
WILD.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             ONE other IMPORTANT NOTE:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone interested in Katy Perry - she Said in the tour music videos (from 2013) when she was describing the pizza in new zealand:
 " the kind so greasy you have to PLACE A NAPKIN UNDERNEATH IT... "
           </p>
           <p>
            also there is the " Playing Ping-Pong All night Long "   "its no big deal "  song, where within the video there is tons of pizza images,
not to mention the " WEDO " on the car's tag which was run together, switch one letter and it becomes " PEDO "
           </p>
           <p>
            so there was another Katy Perry song that had the lyrics " its no big deal "   care to guess which one ??
" i kissed a girl and i liked it "
           </p>
           <p>
            going back to " Ping Pong " has anyone discovered the REAL meaning behind that code word ?? Even Greg Gutfield and Brietbart
use the code word when talking about "Wiener-gate" - Breitbart even suggested " i wonder if any of them [prostitutes] were under age ? "
 then go on to say Anthony Weiner Brags about having sex with a pop star ( P!NK )...
           </p>
           <p>
            i am telling you if you search lyrics these code words and concepts may be sprinkled through-out even less obvious stars that 
may be " under the radar " (sorry for rambling)

           <p>
            From that article -- 
"A few years later, in early 2012, while the British police were starting to trace the Maddie McCann kidnapping to America,
            <strong>
             David Brock paid an out-of-court settlement of $850,000 to an ex-lover named William Grey,
            </strong>
            who threatened to tell all to law enforcement authorities. To raise the money to silence what he called “blackmail”, Brock sold his house in
            <strong>
             Rehoboth Beach, Del
            </strong>
            aware, at huge profit for more than $1 million to a realtor in McLean, Virginia, where coincidentally the CIA Langley headquarters is located. Oddly, the new owner tore down the valuable house but did not erect another structure, leaving the expensive lot empty. So that raises the obvious question: Were their little bodies buried below the basement?"  Unquote

             Depending on how close to the ocean the house was, there's a good chance it didn't have a basement.

             The testimonies provided by the children in the Hampstead case, and so many other cases the world over, detail stories of babies been trafficked for the purposes of Satanic ritual. To summarize this portion of the children’s accounts:
Babies are supplied to the UK from all over the world, including the United States, South Africa, Portugal, Spain, Gayana, China, India and Hawaii. Babies are either purchased, drugged and transported by international courier service, or the parents (cult members) bring them from other parts of the world. A high-level member of the network – a real estate agent – provides empty properties for ritual and sexual abuse of children to take place. The rituals they described involve child rape, sodomy, orgies, torture, cannibalism and human sacrifices. These activities were also filmed and sold.&gt;

             Wonder how they dispose of the babies and children they use up and then don't completely consume. Maybe take them over to Planned Parenthood to be sold for parts or disposed of alongside the aborted babies?

             Look at Saville real estate for Jersey island. (Pedo lands and no pedo laws- queen eliz).
            </p>
            <p>
             Saville and Sotheby..top rich. Have a rich Jew gal from childhood, works at it. She's changed. Top politicians, celebs she has coke partied with, got way weird.
For Saville Jersey Island:
Same female realtor for every very old estate that you can only get the price by doing an "application." Rest homes even if millions are price listed. Big discrepancy. Can't even just list price?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, the podesta email of who will being the meat grinder. Can anyone pull that up here?
            </p>
            <p>
             Also whole set of emails on Clinton, Chelsea, Cheryl mills talk about bringing two sick Haitian kids in.
            </p>
            <p>
             Quite a industry in bone grinding, I've found.
Meat-machinery.com
Look at the bone grinder/ bone paste machines.
Retsch German corp website even mention mills for human bones.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bio diesal: (obama-podesta climate energy change has already been torn apart in an investigation and book by a top attorney. There is even a email sending the 67 page attachment investigation to podesta. Bones is a huge bio diesal profit!
So is blood harvesting. (Peter Thiel tapping in since all this came out but w live donors).
Remember: all think money, biz niche, lead industries. Why isn't Karp, Their using Palantir to help break this or CIA who funds them??
            </p>
            <p>
             And, bio fuel corps have been debating Obama and spa of his false promises. Their sun, wind, gas ones, etc having issues w Obama.
As bone- dispel biofuel research is huge and rapidly escalating.
            </p>
            <p>
             1980s bone research for research and multi industries, skyrocketed; but Retsch is from old German past.
            </p>

             But, the series events on email of this subverse, shows Missy sanders is in the "know of Podesta's very private activities" She exposes herself.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pillows.
Pills..or condoms.."where u leave them?. Now you know their sex events are INSANE CREEPY OUT control. Maybe even chase, hide seek victims, like that ranch in Texas ( Scalia). Look at the pics in Texas society mag of the 53 royal creepy visitors.
(Put self in shoes of both victims and bold repeat rapist, serial murderers).
            </p>
            <p>
             Scalia at ranchnin Texas.
 All the male and females  holding, standing by dead birds they shot, no gloves as Mass bird viruses? They look so comfortable with dead stuff. Hunting does not equate to have no respect for what killed.
            </p>
            <p>
             No one finds itbodd that mass hunt events is called tradition with all these old rich and new rich?? If you look at all tradition events of rich, politics, other parry events, its pretty impossible to work. Its a constant jet set party.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, no one stays at house or being pillows as just looking at places. But, with rich, showing for temp rentals is a biz niche. Yet, there are discrepancies in the series of events of it, and ones usually book ahead, by photos, not drive around w their pillow cases!!!!

             If they are using "map" the paedo code for semen, in that context, then JP's semen - read DNA - is at that location. Probably something he would not want connected to any location which may be "outed" in the future.

            It's incredibly concise. If you have post history of you saying it so eloquently, please link me to it and I'll give you kudos, but we can't all see everything on this. It's a nuance I personally hadn't read yet, and I've been on Pizzagate since maybe the 2nd week. Goes to show you the massive circumstantial evidence here.

            Is it possible they have secret maps to pedo gatherings hidden on a handkerchief? If it was in code, most people would assume it was just a really odd handkerchief.... it would be an easy thing to dead drop because if it was found, it would be unlikely the finder would know what they had.

            These people are weird, but how could they forget a girl?  Seems unlikely.  Also the realtor's email sounds like it is talking about an actual handkerchief, IMO.  I guess I missed the Shimatsu commentary you reference, though; I read an article by him on Rense about PG but don't recall anything about that in particular.

            Who are the Sandlers? Is anyone investigating them?

           <p>
            But I would also suggest that "realtor Kathryn Tate" may also be of interest.
            <br/>
            Where is the place she is referring to and what is meant by a "Field House"? 
SHE does identify the handkerchief as "white/black" which is symbolic and which may be the reason she is reporting it?
This may also be a friendly and aware realtor?

             I don't see any clear reason that Tate is "in the know" about Podesa and friends activities beyond real estate.  She is just describing a handkerchief she found.  It is likely that all she is doing is keeping communications open for future real estate deals and show that she pays close attention to all details.  I doubt Tate even knew the handkerchief code.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is Sandler's reaction without any more information that brings in the code words.  She does know about these things and is concerned.  As to Podesta's reaction, it could be that he knew that it was an unused handkerchief and so nothing to worry about or it could be he (as some have suggested0 he did not want to express real concern in an email.

              Sorry, but his guy is a biased, antisemitic writer who's out to get the Sandlers and the filthy rich at all costs... I don't believe it's a reliable source of information. Entertaining at best.

            I've brought the handkerchief email up in this post here, you might want to take a look. Also there was another sub that was linked and mentioned in it. It would be helpful to collect info from both of them.

             Thank you -- how did you determine where the house was and that it is that particular one?
But, obviously, given the size of it, there may have been others besides JPodesta staying there?

             <p>
              i've done days of research on the property, and found a few interesting items.  most of it is summed up here:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1510472">

             </p>
             <p>
              quick synopsis -
             </p>
             <p>
              when this email was written, the house was owned by someone named "Michael Field", hence "the field house" (
              <a href="http://archive.is/9vtOG">
               http://archive.is/9vtOG)
              </a>
              )
             </p>
             <p>
              the house is currently owned by one "Linda Comstock" (
              <a href="http://archive.is/T5i7n">
               http://archive.is/T5i7n)
              </a>
              ) and as you found, rent-managed by Sotheby's
             </p>
             <p>
              betwen those two owners, it was owned (or occupied) by power couple Melissa Moss and Jonathan Silver.  (
              <a href="http://archive.is/T5i7n">
               http://archive.is/T5i7n)
              </a>
              )  these two have come up multiple times in my research between alefantis and podesta...keep them on your short list of important players.
             </p>
             <p>
              I completely agree that the strongest line of questioning/investigation should be directed at Sandler.  I suspect that as soon as she heard that the realtor had left the handkerchief on the kitchen island, she bee-lined straight for it.  I don't think the realtor knew what was what...if she did, she wouldn't have broken the chain of ownership.  Sandler took possession of it, i'm sure.
             </p>
             <p>
              writing on a napkin?  yes, that makes sense.  writing on a cloth hankerchief?  ha ha, no.
             </p>
             <p>
              in regards to the sotheby's connection:
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1502076">
               https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1502076
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              i think the sotheby's preferred card is what fbianon meant by follow the cards.  the program is for the hyper-elite, invite only.

                i was just a reader too, for a while, and i noticed that the same bits of information would be revealed and then dropped over and over again.
               </p>
               <p>
                it's important that we A) duplicate research for verification but B) don't forget what we've already established, so i want people who make the same connections I've made to remember and reinforce them.

              Good question. I did ask the same question and this is the answer I got.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The address is found in this email from Herb Sandler to John Podesta:

               The house is discussed in this thread :

             <p>
              I still didn't get the other post's link. I'm not an investigator, just lurking and trying to get you guys the links so you can connect the dots on your own. Also there is the 'Sotheby card' connection that should be looked into in the same thread.
             </p>
             <p>
              P.S. The key points of the 1501728 thread:
             </p>
             <p>
              1-There was indeed a party held by the Podestas at that house on Aug 23, where they played "dominos."
             </p>
             <p>
              2-The realtor that lists that house is part of Sotheby's. Sotheby's isn't just an art museum Podesta likes, it's also the realty of the house the party was in. Sotheby's also holds auctions and trades diamonds. Sotheby's may be a one-stop-shop for these people and the cards may be some kind of secret pass.

               Ying -- Thank you for acknowledging me -- but I'm also just a reader here watching the amazing research being done -- and like you wishing I could help.
               <br/>
               Concerned I caused you work -- "WikiLeaks email" would have been sufficient reply.
I'm wondering if "Card" like other words has a dual meaning.  Obviously, it is a key to extra privileges via Soetheby's.
              </p>
              <p>
               True -- Sotheby's remains very interesting, for many reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
               I can very much see the need for investigators to concentrate specifically on what directly connects to pizzagate - 
Clinton Foundation/Hillary/Podestas/Alefantis -- but as we can see without even trying there are realtors and agencies involved.
One of the posts offered suggested that the realtor "Kate" was either pre-involved or later involved via the B/W handkerchief and 
it was suggested may have also assisted with the girl left behind, who it is also suggested came from DC/Comet Pizza and "homeless."
Someone to take her to the airport?
               <br/>
               We also very much see this is generational historically, father to child.  We also know that survivors have discussed this -- i.e., being 
abused by father who then somehow comes to attention of CIA/MKULTRA and father hands child off to them and is financially rewarded.
It seems clear that any kind of abuse of a child results in "scarring of the brain" as I've seen it described.
               <br/>
               Certainly, CIA/MKULTRA in its simplest mind control program is advocating torture and sexual abuse to create new personalities which
can then also be programmed.  All while the subject goes on about life without being aware of what other lives he/she is living.
Perhaps there are explanations we need to understand.  Could anyone doing the things these people are doing actually go on with their
lives in public without reflecting the things they are doing secretly without breaking down?  I continue to doubt that.
In the Podesta's, we have two brothers involved which leads me to think it was a generational arrangement -- perhaps via the Mother?
In Hillary and Bill Clinton's cases, we certainly know there is CIA involvement by the time of Mena, Ark when they he (as Governor) is 
helping cover up CIA/drug-gun running.  But they may have also become involved with CIA/MKULTRA at Yale?  Or even earlier in 
their childhoods as both of their families seems to have connections to organized crime.  (Many people get upset when I suggest these 
possibilities as they see it as sympathetic to these people while I'm just trying to figure out what's really going on.)
Somehow it also seems that the number of pedophiles we are seeing internationally suggests that this abuse is creating new pedophiles.
We have to keep in mind that when a child is abused they do not necessarily go on to abuse others -- but a certain number of them do so.
The more children who are tortured and abused, the greater the chance of creating new pedophiles.

               What might be the limits of involvement if we also add in the military?  See Kate Griggs/YouTube.

She speaks for a few minutes about what she has covered in earlier videos -- but very quickly conducts a tour
of the underground tunnels she is aware of.  And very close to the Pentagon.

               I'm sure we all want to know how and where these children are being held.  How children from other countries
are being brought into the US as far as passports, unaccompanied by a parent.  Intelligence connections?
The trafficking locations seem to be clear -- East Coast/West Coast close enough to DC and Hollywood and 
Florida, I believe has been mentioned.
               <br/>
               And wonder if with the investigations of pizzagate going on if they are feeling an increased need to move children around?
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, the numbers of children being kidnapped in US every year ranging now from 500,000 to 800,000 suggests that the FBI
is doing nothing to recover them.  They can only hold onto these children for so long before there is a need to dispose of them?
The new question then becomes how many ways they might have of disposing of the bodies?

               A report by a man named Tory Smith follows her comments before the tour of the tunnels.
He is reporting on military abductions referenced as Mi-labs or My-labs?
You need to listen to this yourself, but a general outline . . .
              </p>
              <p>
               What he is saying is that 127 children from Child Protective Services in Canada were taken in January 2016
to Detroit via My-labs which is a US Child trafficking operation.
               <br/>
               They were taken to DC via Indianapolis on HIGH SPEED RAIL trains built between
1995 and 2007 which connect all the My-labs and several other places like White House.
They take elevator down to train station.  Jump on train and go across the country.
               <br/>

                Washington to LA in under 30 minutes means traveling 6000 MPH.  That's many times the speed of sound.  And Indianapolis is about 750 miles from Texas at a straight shot, so that would be over 20,000 MPH.

                 From what I recall of the highest speeds we've been told about UFO's sightings has been around 1400 mph.
But other reports suggest that sightings right after WWII say the speeds were 3000 to 4000 mph.
Imagine what they can do now.

                <p>
                 I think the first question is .... who is involved in this child and human trafficking --
Is our CIA involved?
                </p>
                <p>
                 What of the tunnels under DC -- do they exist and are there secret tunnels?
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is the video I was referencing --

                <p>
                 It's a very brief video -- go to about 6 minutes to see Tory Smith's report on the trafficking of children -- 
and at about 9 on the video, the tour of the tunnels begins.

                I appreciate the long report and the effort you've put in. Everything is a possibility, but there is just too much unreliable sourcing going on for it to be evidence in any way. Mrs. Marlowe is, I'm sure, a very well-intentioned person with connections to international organisations. However, credibility and man power are lacking. Also, this Tory Smith is a psychic, which doesn't help our case. It's all conspiracy theory as far as we know. Nothing concrete coming out of this. As much as I would love to see concrete evidence presented here to pin point the perpetrators and their satanic evil plans and acts, it remains a 'theory' or a 'vision' until concrete evidence can be presented. Still very interesting though.

           <p>
            "It's mine, but not worth worrying about."
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm putting myself in that situation and thinking if I left a pair of socks at a friend's house.. they call and say "hey you left your socks here." My response would be something like "haha just toss em," or "ok I'll get em next time I see you." Socks/handkerchiefs are hardly expensive things, most people have tons. If someone bothers to let you know that they have something that belongs to you, no matter how trivial, you give them direction on what to do with it. You don't just say "it's mine."
           </p>
           <p>
            Add to the fact he says "not worth worrying about".. uhh who worries about things like a lost sock or handkerchief? Only a person who realizes the significance of what they found and its definitely not just a plain old handkerchief.

            The handkerchief refers to the Handkerchief Code.
           </p>
           <p>
            The color reference (black/white) confirms that. Although Wikipedia only has one of those colors listed (it's a color code), the other code must be an innovation for the pedophile cult. Everyone in the email chain knew what it meant - probably something like "I have a child available for domination, and the child is young/virgin." Of course, we do not know for sure, but that is the most likely outcome.
           </p>
           <p>
            The more difficult code email to parse is the one about opening a box of cheeses/pastas and playing dominos on them. It's likely code of some kind, but what the hell does it mean? Are they delivering infants by Fed. Ex?

             Delivering babies by Fed-Ex sounded crazy to me until I read about it in relation to the Hampstead case:

              The part that I really really have trouble believing is George Webb's theory that they caused the Haiti earthquake, perhaps with a peaceful nuclear explosion underground.
             </p>
             <p>
              And yet... Bill and Hillary Clinton were making moves on Haiti in the month/weeks before the earthquake.

            Another thing that is interesting is that most of the apparently coded emails are sent to Podesta by others rather than having been written by Podesta himself.

             What's really interesting is whoever hacked his emails only distributed his inbox and not his sent items. We only see emails sent to podesta not what he sent, unless someone actually replies back to him you see it in the chain. I would put money there's another cache of these emails.

            This is the one indisputable email in the leaks, in my opinion, for the reasons stated above and also because not a single journalist has asked John Podesta, Susan Sandler, or Kathryn Tate, what this meant. Also, Eryn Sepp was CCd on this email chain as well, giving investigators four opportunities to corroborate stories.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been brutal and precise about this one point on twitter lately. Want to shut people up who call you crazy for believing that there is something here? Ask them to explain what a 'pizza related handkerchief map' is, ask why John Podesta or Susan Sandler won't explain, and ask why not a single fucking "journalist" has asked any of these people that simple question. There are NO good answers.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the tertiary evidence is circumstantial without LEO investigation and evidence chains of custody. Plus, this has been morphed into a partisan issue so people have gotten tribal about it so even less objectivity.
           </p>
           <p>
            By my assessment, this email thread is the only objective piece of evidence us 'mere mortals' can pursue and more than half of the people who ACTUALLY read the damn thing will say "what the fuck does this mean?" and begin to walk down the rabbit hole.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is how you get fools in checkmate on the public channels. You're not convincing the jackasses battling your logic, you're convincing anyone reading the conversation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beat this drum until John Podesta and Susan Sandlers ears bleed. Fuck both of them.

             Another question these pseudo-skeptical lalala libfags fail to answer is why was there a random email with a picture of 2 little kids that was named "pizza.jpg" with a caption saying 'Like John said, it doesn't get any better than this"

              Wasn't a random email.  Picture was not of two little kids.
The picture was two adult women and one child. The women are reporters who were working on a story of North Korean defectors and were imprisoned in North Korea. The child is the daughter of the reporters.  Why doesn't it get any better.  They were back home, free on American soil, with their family and eating comfort food.   What could be better?

                Yes.  Absolutely.  It was covered extensively at the time.  We absolutely know the identity of the two women and the child.
               </p>
               <p>
                They are two reporters.  They were covering a story about North Koreans who escape into China.  Since the women defectors are so vulnerable, they are often wind up in the hands of traffickers, so this was a big part of their story.  They were reporting from China near the border.  They met a source who said he had information, but most likely was actually working for North Korea.  He got them to cross the border illegally entering North Korea.   Once there they were arrested by North Korea.    When discussion of their release came up, North Korea asked for Bill Clinton as a faciliator.  He went over there and was able to get them out and they came home.
               </p>
               <p>
                And THEY ATE PIZZA.
                <a href="http://www.today.com/id/32328010/ns/today-today_news/t/freed-journalist-told-sister-it-had-be-clinton/#.WGSB9vkrK5g">
                 From a 2009 article on their release.
                </a>
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 **The pleasure of pizza **
Ling and Lee are weak and exhausted, but are slowly recovering from their ordeal. Ling suffers from ulcers, and Lee lost 15 pounds while in captivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The women have said very little so far about their time in captivity, but they rarely saw each other. Lisa Ling told CNN Laura read a lot of books and walked around her room for exercise for hours a day. Bathing was difficult because there was no hot water, and she was monitored 24 hours a day by North Korean guards who did not speak English.
Now that Euna Lee is home, her 4-year-old daughter, Hana, won’t let her mother out of her sight. 
Ling said that the two families got together Thursday night for dinner, where the women ate pizza for the first time since returning to America.
“They really just delighted in it,” Lisa told the TODAY show. “And Hana, I have never seen her so happy … It was remarkable to see.”

                 OK, but how do you know that was the real story? How do you know for certain they weren't finding kiddies and the cover is a story about defectors? We've seen so many "cover" stories that it would be incredible to just "buy" this story.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If it was after the Haiti debacle where they made so many mistakes that that simply cannot be anything other than Sislby caught stealing 33 kids. Maybe they had a better story for this one.

                   I'm claiming that there's zero real evidence of any of it. Just what we're told. We have Clinton's with a history of child trafficking and getting caught with no "story"..we have another incident which may or may not be similar. No way to tell.

              why? likely because those 2 "reporters" were trafficking kids, got busted trafficking kids, and Bill flew over with bags of money and drugs and "made it all go away" - OH, the irony. How the sick and depraved LOVE IT when they get away with sick shit in public.

               They were not trafficking kids.  That is a complete lie.  They got "busted" for wandering into North Korea.  NK charged them with espionage.

PizzaGate Is A Giant Step

             Which I checked tonight because of comments below about "Shimatusu" and Arron Schwartz (who founded Riddet).
            </p>
            <p>
             Notice that Susan Sandler is now connected to "Sandler Foundation" as daughter of Herb and Marion.
Quote -- 
For parting shot about “fake news”, here's an email from a staffer at the **Sandler Foundation **to John Podesta, who dropped something from his back pocket:
 "Hi, John. The realtor found a handkerchief. I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours? They can send it if you want. I know you’re busy so feel free not to respond if it's not yours or you don't want it.”
Podesta replied: “It's mine.”  Unquote
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              The quest for leverage also led the Sandlers to lay out big money to start the
              <strong>
               Center for American Progress (CAP),
              </strong>
              which is now the top progressive think tank in Washington, DC. The Sandlers had long been donors to liberal groups like the ACLU before they sold their business. But when they turned to philanthropy on a larger scale, they became preoccupied with the question of how conservative ideas had become so influential starting in the 1980s.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             And then Herb goes on to "find" Podesta.

            <p>
             Also note that the Rense article contains other info -- Matthew Freud is grandson of Clement Freud.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Matthew Freud
             </strong>
             , until a recent divorce, was married to** Elizabeth Murdoch, the daughter of Rupert**. Her grandmother was Jewish, and the publishing empire News Corp. and The Australian are financed by the NM Rothschild Bank. Freud is a  confidant of Lord Jacob Rothschild, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson. In a step toward truthfulness in advertising, Freud should rename his PR firm as “Frauds”.
            </p>
            <p>
             **Podesta’s Girl Friday is a Rothschild watchdog
**
             <br/>
             Now get this:
             <strong>
              Matthew’s former ace at Freud Communications, Sara Latham
             </strong>
             was on the White House staff of Bill Clinton, a consultant to the Clinton Foundation and Microsoft, and she is the Chief of Staff for Podesta Associates and his liaison staffer to the Hillary for America campaign. Latham is the Rothschild watchdog over Podesta, the Clintons and the Democratic Party leadership. She is also a mentor to Chelsea Clinton.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why then should anyone be surprised that Rothschild Bank has just set up its new U.S. headquarters in Chicago, the Podestas’ hometown now run by Mayor Rahm Emanuel? The Rothschilds are managing Bayer’s takeover of Monsanto and selling off the Green Giant division of General Mills.

               It would make sense as an offer for some kind of sex trafficking service, indicating what is available (white/black), and asking whether Podesta is interested. At least, that interpretation makes about 90% sense, and the literal explanation (actual handkerhief) makes virtually no sense.

                You really think that makes 90% sense?    Why is a "sex trafficking service" using handkerchiefs?  That is not what the handkerchief code is about.
               </p>
               <p>
                Myself, I'm kind of partial to literal explanation.................one of the pizza places near that house uses a map in its marketing.  Also, pizza maps is not an unfamiliar concept to me.  You can buy a NY pizza map for $10.

                 They place handkerchiefs under the victims that they are abusing and they catch all of the boood and semen upon them, they then keep the handkerchief as a keepsake, if they want. Sure they also use codes with handkerchiefs, but that doesn't appear to be the only significance of them.

                   Well possibly, it's a theory, but I have seen this depected in their art. There is a painting of what appears to be a child being abused with what even looks to be some sort of handkerchief under the child. The picture on the right is the one I speak of.

                    Yes, I have seen that image.  You may know this but the image you linked are two separate images posted as one.   The image on the right was never used to promote shows at Comet Ping Pong.
Here's the original poster.

                    I still have not seen anyone mentioned this pedophiles use handkerchiefs to save fluids theory before the Podesta emails were released.  It seems like it was yoked on to pizzagate like those two separate images were combined.

                     Well, certainly the deal is that the lady who does the art, noble is her name. She is claimed to have been a victim of mind control and it is said that she has multiple personalities, some of which are young children and in multiple of her art it shows this same concept. For instance here is another of her arts with it.

                 I mean this 100% sincerely: the literal explanation makes 1% sense, and the sex explanation makes 90% sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                 First, everyone - not just me - thinks that this email is weird and involves code language.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Step 2: there is literally a document on Wikipedia called "The Handkerchief Code" and it has been published there for almost a decade.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That should be enough, on the surface, to discount the innocent/literal interpretation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But then, the discussion of the handkerchief references colors - black and white. And the Handkerchief is a COLOR code.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And then, add in every other piece of data from Comet Ping Pong and pizzagate, and ask yourself whether this email was really innocent.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In my view, with about 80% odds, the email means something like "hey, I have a child available for you, it is a virgin [white] and available for domination [black]. Are you interested?"
                </p>
                <p>
                 I could be wrong about that. But I am highly confident that the email refers to sex trafficking code, and not a literal pizza-related map, whatever the fuck that would mean.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Honestly, people wake up from your just world delusions where the world is fair and evil doesn't exist. This code talk is real, and it indicates a level of evil that is difficult to comprehend.

                  Yes.  they think it's code language, because they already think of Podesta as some devil-worshipping monster and were already pouring over his emails with the intent of finding something damaging they could use against a hated political opponent.  When they couldn't find that, they kept digging..  It's called motivated reasoning and not giving someone the benefit of the doubt.  You can't paint someone as a nasty SOB if you violate
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity">
                   the rational Principle of Charity
                  </a>
                  and decide that ordinary words they used have sinister meanings.  The starting point of this investigation was not rational, hey this must be code.  The starting point was PODESTA IS A MONSTER.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  See the Spirit Cooking nonsense which preceeded pizzagate.
                  <em>
                   The guy WORSHIPS SATAN! Surely, he doesn't simply make pizza and pasta and play dominoes, does he?
                  </em>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  They thought it odd, he talks about food all the time. They ignored the fact the guy is gourmet cook.   They don't know that Salsi di Noci is a tradition pasta topping from the region of Italy where the Podestas come from.  So therefore this monster must be speaking about something else when he talks about Pasta with Walnut Sauce.   A code so absolutely top secret that John Podesta's recipe is on the web.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Yes, I know there's a Handkerchief code.   It's basically for when you are among strangers like if you were trying to pick someone up in a gay bar, It's not used with people you know because there is no need for it.  And there is no handkerchief code for I like children. NONE OF THE COLORS apply to that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You don't understand what a literal pizza map would mean?  The NYC Pizza map is available for $10.

                     You say zero cognitive dissonance, and yet you are willfully distorting the evidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You say "pizza map" then you say "handkerchief' then you say "pizza handkerchief." But the Podesta doesn't say "pizza map" or "pizza handerchief." In every case, you're intentionally dropping off one of the modifiers, even though every modifier makes the statement more absurd and unlikely, when taken literally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Podesta emails say a (1) handkerchief, (2) black/white, that has a (3) map that seems (4) pizza-related. The fact that generic handkerchiefs can have generic maps on them is irrelevant, if you're just going to ignore the preexisting Wikipedia sex code, the colors black/white, and the term pizza.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If you're going to consider the email honestly and fairly, you have to consider all of the words that don't make sense together. All four of them. Not just two. Finding a hanky with a map of Berlin doesn't cut it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Then you have to factor in the AVALANCHE of other evidence we have, including all of the Instagram pictures of people sexualizing pizza, giving pizza blow jobs, etc. Then you have to factor in that (A) the handkerchief code is a preexisting sex code and (B) pizza is also a preexising sex code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I know you think that I'm guilty of the fallacy of argument from incredulity. But - that goes both ways. I could say the same thing about your credulity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Honestly, I think you're suffering from the just world fallacy.

                     Child trafficking isn't hard to believe. It happens everywhere, all the time. The hard part to believe is that the Clinton Foundation private army somehow triggered the earthquake in Haiti. That's the level of belief/disbelief we are at on pizzagate. We got over the hanky sex code a long time ago. Catch up.

                       The peaceful nuclear explosion theory is George Webb's - a very highly respected researcher around here. I don't necessarily agree with it or disagree with it. The problem with the theory is that it's ridiculous on its face. The nice thing about the theory is that it explains why Bill and Hillary made documented, substantial moves toward Haiti in the weeks before the earthquake.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       To even entertain the nuclear theory, you would have to think that the Clinton Foundation, and associated government entities, are essentially filled with psychopaths. They call it the pathocracy. I'm getting the sense that you're not there yet, and that's ok.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Notice, however, that you have not explains what a black and white pizza-related handkerchief is. Nor have you shown me an example of one.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Do you feel the gears turning in your brain, trying to explain what the phrase actually means? That's cognitive dissonance.

                       It will get worse before it gets better. Most/all of the emails will probably come out in 2017, one way or another.

              There's even more to Sarah Latham and has some unusual linkages to the madeline McCann story but il save that for another posts.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sarah Latham was actually director of public affairs for Freud communications.

             agree totes. This and the $65 000 'pizza' for Obama's party email. Clearly code for something illicit. You can weigh up drugs, adult prostitutes etc, but why does their code coincide with paedolingo ? Why would you refer to an adult prostitute as pizza? why would a hanky involved in some drug use cause enough concern to warrant an email asking if it should be returned?

              This is as strong as the one I cited.  I think this one was generally interpreted properly. Key here is that it involves President Obama which means this will not be investigated during his administration.

               I did put up another thread, though, speculating whether this $65k email was an entrapment message. Obama doesnt seem very strongly connected to the child trafficking evidence aside from this - I'm absolutely certain he knows and is implicated by his knowledge and his failure to take any action against it - but I havent seen a smoking gun as to Obama's direct participation in the satanic abuse

               i think its like a nostalgic keepsake, but perhaps they call them 'maps' as they contain DNA samples that can help law enforcement identify/locate victims. That's my best guess

              I think even more than the $65K hotdog email is the email that refers to "waitresses," and "I assume we are using the same channels," although that could merely be referring to prostitution.

Why are people referred to as "hot dogs"?
Why is "waitresses" quoted?

               the cute thing about the obama one though is its a sneaky red pill. You can say to a disbeliever 'ok, benefit of the doubt, lets say its $65 000 of cocaine or something, not underage sex slaves. It still means obama spent $65k of your taxpayers money on a recreational drug millions of people have to go to jail for - it still screams we need the FBI to arrest him'

                 well, then you've got the deal where no food gets into the WH that isnt made in the WH kitchen. Like they'd risk a headline 'POTUS poisoned, ordered out from Putin's Pizza Parlour' ?

                  Also consider the economics of it...even at 10$ a dog (which would be an OUTRAGEOUS price especially at that bulk of a buy)  you'd still have 6,500 hotdogs!
                 </p>
                 <p>

                   http://mobile.nytimes.com/2001/10/07/nyregion/6000-hot-dogs-a-week.html
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Heres an article about a restaurant in NY that sells 6,000 hotdogs in a WEEK at like 2$ a pop....
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Even if you say "well he got expensive 10$ hotdogs!" Then you'd have 6,500 hotdogs for ONE event!  That is RIDICULOUS.  The best possible outcome is that Obama wasted taxpayer money on comically overpriced hotdogs but that is so unlikely to be the case (as a 10$ hotdog is absurd and at 2$ a dog, Obama would be buying an ABSURD number of hotdogs for $65,000!)
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And the email mentions pizza too, 65,000 would buy an ABSURD amount of pizza and they'd have to be FROZEN....why would they do that when the white house could MUCH more cheaply prepare BETTER fresher pizzas on site??

            What about the addresses for the houses? I mean, could those be of interest? Maybe they were used for their "pizza parties" because it's a place you can just leave.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not sure if that makes sense, but could the addresses in the Podesta emails be of any relevance?

            This is a really good catch.
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone had explained it to me that it was OBVIOUSLY a map of the pizza places around the area because Podesta was   a big fan of pizza and he's an older guy who isn't tech savvy so he would draw a map instead of looking it up on his smart phone.  I was skeptical of that, but it wasn't outside the realm of possibility.  However, now that you've pointed this out, there's no way they could have been referring to actual pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, great catch.

              Yup.  And one of them uses a map of Martha's Vineyard as their logo.

             I hate using the word smoking gun, but this 100% confirms it's a code. Even the stupidest person in the world has to be out of touch with reality to deny it.

              I wouldn't go as far as to say smoking gun, but definitely highly suspect.  I try to remain as objective as possible, and there is always the chance there was a telephone conversation involved at some point, but it certainly does not read that way
