<p>In January Catholics asked Trump to probe Soros-Obama-Clinton Conspiracy at Vatican.</p>
<p>&quot;Did billionaire speculator George Soros, President Barack Obama, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden, and Obama/Clinton adviser John Podesta conspire to overthrow the conservative Pope Benedict XVI and replace him with a radical, Pope Francis? Did they use America’s intelligence agencies, and our nation’s diplomatic machinery, political muscle, and financial power to coerce and blackmail “regime change” in the Roman Catholic Church?&quot;</p>
<p>“We were alarmed to discover,” their letter notes, “that, during the third year of the first term of the Obama administration your previous opponent, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and other government officials with whom she associated proposed a Catholic ‘revolution’ in which the final demise of what was left of the Catholic Church in America would be realized.” The letter includes footnote links that take the reader to documents and news stories underscoring their charges and pointed questions. It first directs attention to the Soros-Clinton-Podesta e-mails disclosed last year by WikiLeaks, in which Podesta and other “progressives” discussed ending the “middle ages dictatorship” in the Catholic Church.</p>
<p>In their letter to President Trump, the concerned Catholics write: “Approximately a year after this e-mail discussion, which was never intended to be made public, we find that Pope Benedict XVI abdicated under highly unusual circumstances and was replaced by a pope whose apparent mission is to provide a spiritual component to the radical ideological agenda of the international left.  The Pontificate of Pope Francis has subsequently called into question its own legitimacy on a multitude of occasions.”</p>
<p>“We remain puzzled by the behavior of this ideologically charged Pope, whose mission seems to be one of advancing secular agendas of the left rather than guiding the Catholic Church in Her sacred mission,” they say, expressing the thoughts, undoubtedly, of innumerable Catholics worldwide. “It is simply not the proper role of a Pope to be involved in politics to the point that he is considered to be the leader of the international left.”</p>
<p>(Their questions):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To what end was the National Security Agency monitoring the conclave that elected Pope Francis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What other covert operations were carried out by US government operatives concerning the resignation of Pope Benedict or the conclave that elected Pope Francis?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did US government operatives have contact with the “Cardinal Danneels Mafia”?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>International monetary transactions with the Vatican were suspended during the last few days prior to the resignation of Pope Benedict. Were any U.S. Government agencies involved in this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why were international monetary transactions resumed on February 12, 2013, the day after Benedict XVI announced his resignation? Was this pure coincidence?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What actions, if any, were actually taken by John Podesta, Hillary Clinton, and others tied to the Obama administration who were involved in the discussion proposing the fomenting of a “Catholic Spring”?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was the purpose and nature of the secret meeting between Vice President Joseph Biden and Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican on or about June 3, 2011?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What roles were played by George Soros and other international financiers who may be currently residing in United States territory?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What about the secret “Cardinal Danneels Mafia” referred to above? According to the Catholic blogspot Rorate Caeli, “The election of Jorge Bergoglio was the fruit of secret meetings that cardinals and bishops, organized by Carlo Maria Martini, held for years at St. Gall in Switzerland.&quot; That is the claim of Jürgen Mettepenningen and Karim Schelkens, the authors of a recently published authorized biography of the Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels, who refer to the group of cardinals and bishops as the &quot;Mafia-club.&quot;</p>
<p>Cardinal Danneels himself, in a video recorded for the book, admits to taking part in the secret club of cardinals that were in opposition to Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict). He refers to it as “a Mafia club whose name was St. Gall.” ... Cardinal Danneels, a Belgian, has long been viewed as a key subversive in the Church prelature for undermining traditional Catholic teaching ... as well as for his efforts to protect pedophiles in the clergy.  
</p>
<p>One name not mentioned in the recent letter of concerned Catholics to President Trump, but certain to surface as a key culprit in any substantive investigation, is former chairman of Goldman Sachs International Peter Sutherland. Mr. Sutherland, an Insider’s Insider among the globalist banking establishment, was brought in to help “reform” the Vatican Bank, which was akin to putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank.</p>
<p>For the past decade, as the United Nations special representative for International Migration, Sutherland has been a key architect, along with George Soros, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and other globalists of the global scheme that has flooded Europe with the disastrous tsunami of Muslim migrants. (Their plans, which called for a similar migration deluge for the United States, got started under President Obama, but have been scuttled by the election of President Trump.)</p>

            There is definitely an agenda he is pushing.  Look at all his books, and all the books recently published by his acolytes.  And, you have to understand, that for Catholics, he still is the ultimate authority.  From a perspective of believing in the "priesthood of the believer" it is perplexing and disturbing.  The cabal knows the money centers, and they are in the Catholic Church and the Vatican.  I had hopes that this Pope would be good for the world.  But, if he turns his back on Israel, to promote another religion, then, he is for Soros/Clinton/Obama/Biden.  You are known by the company you keep.

            The entire Catholic church is bathed in innocent blood.

           <p>
            And the current pope has stated that he will kiss the feet of every Muslim to make up for Trump moving the US embassy to Jerusalem.

            Pray for the Catholic followers, that they might see and hear. Then pray that the echelons of the church fall on their knees and repent.

            So Trump has been known to be mobbed up for a long time. This connects him to the Vatican. He has stated publicly that hillary clinton did not like Catholics.If there are factions of fascism, this puts Trump and Pope on the same side. The other factions are US, Rockefella/bush, clinton/ .....EU is queen ellizabeth  / rothschildren and vatican. Rockefella is in charge of killing people through  AMA/Big Pharma gates  and vaccines. Have read that the Houston hurricane was pay back for Katrina...would guess Vatican against bush/clinton...since katrina happened on Bush's watch.And Houston is the bush senior home in the winter....Now , the fires in California, esp. Bel Air could very well be a hit for all the pedophelia and rape in hollywood. There is plenty of evidence that these California fires are man made.They are starting in odd ways and burning in odd ways.Would guess hollywood is Jewish  so vatican.They seem to be connected..... Perhaps also pay back for the Jerusalem announcement Trump just made?

             Unless the Catholics Hillary does not like are the same Catholics Pope Francis does not like. In that case, Trump is on one side and Hillary/Obama/Podesta/Francis are on the other.

            I will always remember, how pope Francis compared "fake news"  to "coprophagy". 
Well,  ... I  did not know what that word means and had to look it up in the dictionary....    ...
            <em>
             yuck!
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            But seems that term was so common for the pope, that he had not even to think about.

No coincidence he got along great with Obama, they are both involved in the same circles. The Bible talks about this in detail...

              My pastor is very vocal about Pope Francis being a wolf in sheeps clothing.

             A moment will come when I will take my beloved son, the Pope. I will walk with him to Jerusalem. For the second time I will go to Jerusalem to witness the death of a son.

               Pope Pius XII catapulted Hitler to power ....
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course, American Elites/wealthy and internationally recruited Hitler and 
funded Hitler and Nazis through front companies.  Prescott Bush and Allan 
Dulles were caught at it -- see USHR hearings.
They were doing it through front companies ....
              </p>
              <p>
               Arrangements were then made to bring out the gold and the ex-Nazis
(See:  Operation Paperclip) ... done through Vatican ratlines.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the 1960's there was a brief time when efforts to turn the Church from
dictatorship to democracy rose in the church -- via beloved Pope John XXIII.
That Pope gave members Vatican II which sought to make the church a democracy...
also to verify for members that they were to use their own free thought and intelligence
and free will to decide for themselves whether or not to use contraceptives.
              </p>
              <p>
               Not only does it seem that Pope John was murdered ... but at least two ... if not more
Popes after him.  They were also intending to confirm the right to birth control for members.

                   American and international Elites recruited Hitler -- evidently working as a homosexual prostitute
at the time. They funded him through front companies.  Read something of the history.
Finally, Dulles and Prescott Bush were investigated by US government and shut down - 
Bush's funds were confiscated.
Dulles and Bush went on to continue their work, they wrapped themselves in the American flag ...
went into "intelligence" ... and Congress ... 
and were active in bringing the whole operation out again as the war was being lost.
TWO years before the end of the war, they were organizing Mockingbird, Paperclip, Gladio.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Vatican, of course, was involved in moving Nazis to US and around the world ... and the Gold
back to the US.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Hitler had a natural talent for speaking.  He was also a Catholic who understand the
effect of theater used by the church to entrance the members.
No accident that Hitler also demanded total loyalty, obedience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   NONE of the leadership of the Nazis' fit the Aryan model.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Whatever Hitler's father was, he was very brutally abusive to Hitler in beatings, whatever.
Same with Stalin - same history.  Same with Giancana/Mafia. 
Violence creates violence.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Btw, Hitler also makes clear that he was only doing to the Jews what the RCC had already
been doing for 1,500 years.

                    You're getting there. That was better. But you have to be more accurate because you slander the wrong groups of people with your delivery. The Zionist war on germany was done by Jewish Zionists. You know that but you make try to make it sound like all white heterosexual men are the earth's problem and I think its on purpose. You are transferring one group's problems onto another group. Stop that and I will stop filling in the gaps in your footsteps.

                     Jew-hating Elites here in the US recruited Hitler and funded him ... and raised money to fund Hitler/Nazis
also from international Elites - some Royals, actually.

                    <p>
                     Hitler's goal was to remove all JEWS from every society.  That is not the goal of Zionists.
It's the goal of Elite fascists.

                     <pre><code>        Instead of evidence finding Nazism in conflict with homosexuality, Lively and Abrams report the strategies of the German homosexual movement to ensconce National Socialism (the Nazi party) and Adolf Hitler, triggering a holocaust which engulfed all of Europe.  Writing of those days in The Mass Psychology of Fascism, radical German sexologist and Hitler contemporary, Wilhelm Reich, warned that Nazi leadership was both ideologically and actually homosexual.  Almost as an aside, Reich noted Nazi leaders such as “Bluher, Roehm.... Rosenberg” represented Hitler’s fascism, which was, Reich said, “a male state organized on a homosexual basis.”[1]

                       The perversions of the Nazis can't be denied ...
In same way, Jim Jones in Jonestown was forcing members to homosexuality.
So did MKULTRA.
The basis is fascism, perversion, torture.
The troops were also generally high on drugs and alcohol much of the time.

             In al seriousness, there was an email chain in the Podesta wikileaks that addressed something like this.  It stated in clear terms that the Democrats and Leftists had founded a number of supposedly Catholic-affiliated organizations with the specific intention to destroy the Church.
            </p>
            <p>
             It got almost no attention, but it was actually one of the more blatantly alarming things in that dump.

              In all seriousness either she is really possessed by demons, thinks she is, or has Kuru. Could be a multiple, and I am certainly not the superstitious type. No. Now that I think about it probably all three. The power of Christ compels you! Has anyone tried to splash(mist) some holy water on her, or maybe just a hidden religious relic moved secretly in her direction at a speaking event? I would be wearing some garlic and certain native herbs. Oh heck no! I would not go around her without some kind of extra protection.

            Catholic Church has been corrupt for a while. Not surprising to hear about a coup taking place.

            Wow.  This all sounds Pretty Incriminating.  Hold on tight.  But really Ratzinger is no candidate for Sainthood.  We have talked many times of his Red Shoes.  Although I am sure that the Cabal is aware of many differences, thus opting for a much more evil choice than they already had.  Could be that Ratzinger was just your ordinary pedophile and would not bend to certain requests.  Bergoglio may be just the right replacement for what they had in mind.  The complete take over of the Vatican.  Thank You this poses a very interesting situation.

             Don't disagree about Ratzinger, but it seems like Francis is NWO's puppet even more so

              Maybe I did not explain it right.  What I meant to say is that they wanted Ratzinger because Bergoglio was much more crafty and evil.  He would be much more receptive to their evil ways than Ratzinger.  Also Francis was younger and the plans that would have to be carried out, may be interrupted by Ratzinger's death or illness.

               I understand -- I think we both agree, neither R nor F are "good" Popes. F may be a touch worse and will likely live longer.
