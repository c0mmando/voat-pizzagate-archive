            Seriously? Are parent so stupid in their eyes that we need to be told how to "teach" our children about pizza portions? And the implications of what this said on a darker level are just gross. "Kids will be offered pizza in settings where you may not be present"? WTF is that actually referring to? Is this just programming to prepare the parents for kids abuse?

            I was looking into Justin Trudeau making pizza at a place called Stoney's

            </a>
            .  It feels like a name that could be a reference to stone masonry or freemasonry.  Although I found nothing related to Trudeau, and nothing that follows is either,

             this place

            popped up in my search.  Stay with me, because I think I found a connection to pizza shops and tombstone shops.  I know...  Hear me out.

           <p>
            Stoney's itself I personally find creepy, being a house with a side door, plus it's physical location and surrounding businesses being a tombstone shop and a Burger King feels low-end.  The reviews are interesting to read and not positive.  It looks like there's an eye and writing I can't make out on the sign by the side door

            It has physical rides (not shown) like a helicopter and horse, arcade, and I remember the back room being for adults only.  Seems like they're branding themselves more a Chuck E. Cheese vibe nowadays (although I'm not sure that's better)

            The only lead I had to connect the monument/tombstone places to freemasonry was this Frederick Barnicoat person.  Turns out, he was a very successful businessman, contributing to openly masonic ceremonies, and running quarries containing the only source of a particular type of granite,

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             FREDERICK BARNICOAT, a skillful 
granite sculptor of Quincy, was born 
in Penryn, Cornwall, England, April 
7, 1857, son of Thomas P. and Emma (Cur- 
dew) Barnicoat. The father, also a native of 
Penryn, was there for many years a contracting 
mason, having a large business and employ- 
ing man)' men. His wife, Emma, likewise a 
native of Penryn, bore him nine children. 
These are: Elizabeth, the wife of James 
Coles, of Leeds, Yorkshire, England; Emma, 
the wife of James Hogg, also of Leeds; Mary 
Hannah, the wife of Henry VVorsdell, of 
Quincy, Mass. ; Charlotte, a school teacher in 
Birmingham, England; John, of Providence, 
R. I.; Edwin, of Mylor r Cornwall, England; 
Frederick, the subject of this sketch; S. 
Henry, of Quincy, Mass. ; and Charles, of 
Providence, R.I. 
Frederick Barnicoat was educated, and 
learned the trade of a granite cutter in 
Penryn, England, living there until twenty- 
four years old. Emigrating then to America, 
he settled in Westerly, R.I. Here he fol- 
lowed his trade for five years, and subse- 
quently in Boston for six months. After com- 
ing to Quincy in 1886, he had been employed 
as a carver and statue cutter for two years, 
when he started in business for himself, 
being the only person in the city making a 
specialty of statue cutting. Since then, by re- 
markably artistic work, he has achieved a 
wide reputation, and now receives orders from 
all parts of the Union. He has done much 
work for soldiers' monuments. In the last 
year he cut and shipped thirty-three figures, 
employing as assistants about twenty-two men. 
He takes great interest in anything connected 
with the development of the granite industry, 
and is one of the directors of the T. W. 
Smith &amp; Co. Granite Turning Company. 
Mr. Barnicoat is a member of the Sons of 
St. George. He married Mary M. I. awry, 
who was born in l'enryn, England, daughter of 
Alexander Lawry. They have seven children 
living; namely, Charles, Gertrude, Stanley, 
Nelson, Minnie, Emma, and Frederick, Jr

            There has been controversy over whether a memorial statue he created was memorializing Union or Confederate soldiers

             completed the Alabama Confederate Monument
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Due to pressing post-war needs for proper burial of many Confederate bodies lying in shallow battle eld graves, and the needs of widows, orphans, and Confederate veterans during Reconstruction, plus an economy slow to recover from the war, the cornerstone was not laid until 1886. More than 5,000 people witnessed Jefferson Davis perform that ceremony with full Masonic rites near the spot where he had taken the oath of of ce as the only President of the Confederacy. Another twelve years passed before the monument designed by New York sculptor Alexander Doyle (1857-1922) was completed with his handsome bronze  nial  gure of Patriotism and bronze relief sculpture of a generic battle scene en- circling the column. Granite statuary by Frederick Barnicoat (1857- 1942) of Quincy, Massachusetts, representing the Infantry, Artillery, Cavalry, and Navy was added by the patrons to complete Doyle’s design.
            </p>
            <p>
             The granite  figures representing the infantry, artillery, cavalry, and navy were made by Frederick H. Barnicoat, who operated the larg- est granite sculpture carving company in the country. He employed thirty men in Quincy, Massachusetts and produced as many as  fty statues annually using the latest pneumatic tools and other technical advances. Barnicoat also innovated the production of portrait busts in granite and may have been the only American nineteenth-centu- ry artist and entrepreneur to create them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Alas, if only the whole monument were granite, the most durable of stones. If it had been built from the ground up in the 1890s, when technology had evolved to harvest, handle, shape, and ship granite cheaply, and when pneumatic tools existed to create granite statuary economically in the production centers of Quincy, Massachusetts and Westerly, Rhode Island (the only two places in the U.S. quarrying  ne-grained grey granite suitable for  gurative statuary), the monument might have been built entirely of granite like many that still stand in pristine condition in towns and cities North and South.
