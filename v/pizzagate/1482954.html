<p>A Saudi Arabian diplomatic compound in Virginia is under investigation after law enforcement officials came into contact with possible “victims of human trafficking” there, the Department of Homeland Security has confirmed to NBC Washington and BuzzFeed.</p>
<p>According to NBC Washington’s Jackie Bensen, who broke the story on Wednesday, DHS officials and local police were called to the McLean, Va., compound early Wednesday morning and “in the words of a source familiar with the investigation, ‘rescued’ two women.” The report also says that “one woman reportedly tried to flee by squeezing through a gap in the front gate as it was closing.” Real estate records obtained by NBC show that the residence belongs to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has been the subject of intense scrutiny from the human rights community over the years. The country “is a destination country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of involuntary servitude and, to a lesser extent, commercial sexual exploitation,” </p>
<hr />
<p>Real Andrew Kline is deep down the DOJ Rabbit Hole, theory is that Kline run\'s the entire pedophile network linking saudi &amp; wc</p>
<p>UAE</p>
<p>It is a common practice for foreign-owned properties to be administered by a proxy registered “owner”, like Kline, on behalf of a foreign company like Dhs.CON.N.E.B. Let’s examine this curious company name, with a little help from my past experience in the Gulf States. First, Dhs in this case does not refer to Department of Homeland Security. It stands for Dirhams, the currency of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). CON is short for Construction and N.E.B. stands for National Engineering Bureau LLC (limited liability company).</p>
<p>This Dubai-owned property group, likely to be financed by the Saudis, has owned the lot for longer than a decade. The primary motive for the property does not appear to be rental income but instead is a vehicle to provide funds to the Clintons. The blog Lux E Tenebris has been so kind as to provide a map of the Dubai-owned lot on either side of Connecticut Avenue.</p>
<p>The storefronts are occupied by Comet Pizza; Bucks Fishing and Camping restaurant (also owned by Alefantes); Besta Pizza run by Arabs; Politics and Prose bookstore owned by Lissa Muscatine, a senior speechwriter for then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and her husband Bradley Graham with The Washington Post. Across the street is Beyond Borders, a Clinton Foundation-funded NGO involved with promoting the European refugee crisis; and Terasol Bistro, whose website is decorated with the pedophile trapped heart symbol.</p>
<p>That\'s where all the kids who are reported missing go. On a diplomatic Jet, for a holiday in the sun. The cops get paid off to look the other way. The rational is that these kids would only end up as wards of the state and cost the tax payer , no one will miss them anyway so why not make a few bucks.</p>',

            Also, where is the EVIDENCE for the Saudi connection to Besta?  This stuff gets upvoted like mad, but I never see any actual EVIDENCE.  Given the association with the Kline disinfo (and LegionWill), I strongly suspect this is disinformation.

             U R a known CTR MF, U have NOT debunked this story and the world knows there is only one "Andrew Kline", and that he is using many aliases to cover his tracks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Andrew Kline is the brains of the entire DOJ-SAUDI scandal, if you wish to call this  assertion debunked, then let the record stand that once the entire world knows the TRUTH that U used
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             to hide the truth from the people.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's Your sub MF==KingKong, you do as you wish, but this is Voat, and we keep telling the truth on voat.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Bot's and mod's on this sub don't read, but I will post proof just for the record so other investigators know that

             has been long compromised by CTR ( Protectors of KLINE ) - The following links all prove that Andrew Kline is Besta-Pizza is DOJ.
            </p>
            <p>
             That DOJ is sending children to Saudi to be fucked to death.

            You know fuck all ya fucking moron. Another Throwaway, I see? Surely you must get sick of being told to fuck off with your misleading "Kline DOJ is the owner" shit. You have yet to give any evidence to prove DOJ Kline owns the businesses. You're a fucking shill.

            If the real teachings of the koran are looked at. You find that sodomy is considered a sin...unless??? its with a slave. The whole region has get out of jail free clauses for Pedophilia...its common for them to sell their daughters early, rather than wait for problems.
