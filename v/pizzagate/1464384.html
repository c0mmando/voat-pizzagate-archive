           Milo was saying on facebook and twitter that he would talk about pizzagate tonight. People watching the stream, however, noticed that the timer had been pushed back 30 minutes and the title was changed to "MILO at Miami University: On Stabby Muslims, Campus Censors, And Daddy's Transistion," totally removing pizzagate mentions! After the second 30 minute timer, it said it would start "soon".  It has now been almost 10 minutes. Did they get to him?
