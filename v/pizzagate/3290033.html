Last year, a post by entylawyer on Crazy Days and Nights explained that Heather O\'Rourke was basically raped after filming Rocky Road (which was cancelled after 6 episodes were quickly filmed in order to cover this incident up). This incident was the root cause of her death. Warning, this is a very stomach churning lead!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia">https://en.m.wikipedia</a>(dot)org/wiki/Poltergeist_(1982_film) To get ahead of the “contract conflict” argument of shills, found some eye witness accounts saying Spielberg was on site during filming, meaning he had ample opprotunity to commit the crime. Filming of the first movie finished on the first week of August 1981. </p>

<p>Given the above, we can deduce the most likely dates of the incident to 4-7 days before the air dates of the respective episodes.</p>

<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic. </p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks. </p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           (dot)org/wiki/Poltergeist_(1982_film) To get ahead of the “contract conflict” argument of shills, found some eye witness accounts saying Spielberg was on site during filming, meaning he had ample opprotunity to commit the crime. Filming of the first movie finished on the first week of August 1981.

           Found the filming locations for Happy Days. I’d say the most likely site of the crime is Paramount Studios. Paramount Studios - 5555 Melrose Avenue, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, USA.

          <p>
           Given the above, we can deduce the most likely dates of the incident to 4-7 days before the air dates of the respective episodes.

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.
