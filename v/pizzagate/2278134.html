<p>Today\'s Blind Items - The Web
Ever wonder why one widow looks like she is grieving every day, all day, and the other looks like she is getting ready to party all the time? Well, lets go back in time a bit to the first widow. We all know she is a black widow who only cares about herself and her survival. Right up there with that is how much she loves money and fame. So, when a couple of people came to her and offered her a great deal of money to make some of her past crimes and foibles go away, she was all ears. When they offered her a chance at her own reality show down the road, she really listened. When they told her that her A- list (PJ) celebrity husband was going to divorce her and enforce that prenup, she was 100% on board.</p>
<p>They provided her with drugs that were much stronger versions of the ones her husband used to take. Her job was to get him hooked again. They told her exactly what to do, and how to do it every step of the way. When that first wire transfer hit a relative’s bank, she was the most enthusiastic helper ever. She might not have been there to commit the actual crime, but she was part of the conspiracy to kill him and she has had no problems with the money and fame she has received after his death. She is so greedy and so concerned with herself that she never even asked more than a few questions about why anyone would want her husband dead.</p>
<p>Contrast her situation with another widow. A widow who became one not that long after the first. She was married to an A- lister (RJ) herself. She would never have done anything to harm her husband. Nothing. Someone could have offered her millions of dollars and she would say no. Every day she grieves for her dead husband. She grieves for her family. She also grieves for the people that her husband and the other A- lister were trying to help.</p>
<p>Her husband was an inspiration to so many troubled youth and teens. Naturally those people reached out to the A- lister when they struggled. About a year or so before his death he was told by one of the teens that he had been sexually abused. The teen talked about others who had all been abused at the hands of the same group of people. The teen named some names and our A- lister knew who some of the people were. In fact, he knew one of them really well. That one is a permanent A+ lister who has been known in the past to make his problems go away permanently. When our A- lister approached him, the A+ lister advised him to not pursue things any further and to let the matter drop. It was shortly after that conversation that our A- lister talked to his friend PJ and told him what the teens had said and his conversation with the A+ lister. At that point, PJ and RJ went and spoke to the A+ lister. This time, they were warned more strongly and threats were made about their careers which the A+ lister could destroy.</p>
<p>PJ and RJ started interviewing the teens and recording the interviews. No one knows how that information got back to the A+ lister. Did PJ or RJ or both send him a video? Howv [sic]</p>

           <p>
            I'm honestly not sure. I, personally, do not visit that site at all. For some reason, I don't trust to name of the site and thus don't click any links here to CDAN, instead, I wait for someone to post the relevant info. This is a personal hangup of my own, I mean no malice nor implications towards CDAN.

           </p>
           <p>
            There's an interesting story there, that's for sure... I'll set aside some time to look further into the names/events mentioned, my gut tells me there's something very juicy here - I have to split my attention between a few threads at the moment, though.

            wow, this needs some looking into. From what I have heard over the years, Geffen is dangerous and has had people silenced, even eliminated. He would have the means and the motive to have them eliminated. The only thing is I don't understood why Cornell and Bennington would bargain, threaten or whatever with the devil? They must have heard stories and known of his reputation. Anyway, Geffen is a lot more powerful and ruthless then Weinstein could ever dream of being, and it will take a lot to bring him down.

             Geffen is the monster he is made out to be.
            </p>
            <p>
             Geffen is in the music industry (big player), and Cornell and Bennington were his puppets.
Bennington isn't as innocent as he appears. The music industry is very slimey and everyone seems to know everybody else.
            </p>
            <p>
             My guess is Bennington and Cornell: 
A. Woudln't do what was asked of them
B. We're too much of a liability alive, knew too much.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's all in the music.

              Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington were murdered.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding Chester.  May I state something that is an opinion of mine?
             </p>
             <p>
              Band mate Mike Shinoda was complicit in Chester's murder.

               I would not be surprised. They are very good at dividing bands like that, offering sweet deals for partners to be in on things like that, or to keep things quiet.
              </p>
              <p>
               The way that Chester died was a drug overdose from what I've read, and he also had a history of trying to commit suicide (which interestingly they tried to exclude in his autopsy report).
              </p>
              <p>
               I do know, for one reason or another, that Linkin Park was an important band for 'the cult.' I've heard they did private gigs at parties where torture / sacrifice was involved.

              It is:David Geffen School of Medicine.  The school was renamed in 2001 supposedly

             <p>
              to honor David Geffen who gave them $200 million.   Am thinking UCLA will take a PR hit soon.  Or at

               UCLA Medical center seems to be where a lot of people in Hollywood end up going when they 'step out of line.' Wonder how many medical records disappear or get altered at his behest.
              </p>
              <p>
               David Geffen seems to have his hand in every corner in Hollywood. UCLA has been an embarrassment forever now. I wonder what collusion there is between UCLA and the Medical Center / School. Last time I went to look around there, it was more than 80% foreigners.

               Please read my post on MOCA Geffen, it ties Geffen to the Podestas and Soros and the gallery has an extensive history of performing Satanic rituals. My original post about Hollywood musicians was missing this important piece and is admittedly flawed, and I had to condense the story to fit. What I was trying to argue was that the same musicians from Comet were showing up on the West Coast doing shows with 'Satanic Pizza' imagery.

               And I'm not a source, I'm a researcher.

Sorry but this is the only way I can communicate to you now:
ENTY: If you get this, I'm on a plane getting the FUCK outta Hell-A. Too much smoke for me. FYI: I have some guys working for me who also work at Blogger. They're on it. They're into the backbone of the site, and going around your top-tier credentialing to override and switch the flow of those DDOS attacks to a mirror. No damn clue what that means. I'm no expert, just repeating what they told me. I paid them out of pocket for it so they said it should be back running clean again soon. Within the hour at least. Figured you wanted this solved asap. Sorry to do it without asking. And yes, just so everyone knows - the attacks were trackbacked to the same root. Wanna guess where it points back to? Don't need a blind item to solve that one buddy. Be well and stay firepoof. Literally!
In the Air -

            Annnnnyway, very interesting read here in particular the portion discussing Darlene and what turned into a book she wrote about the experience, and in particular mention of a Hollywood music company where the long running rumor was that MJ had been molested for a long period of time by an executive there. Note the incident Darlene writes about with pizza and a young boy occurred well before the MJ accusations began. Who was the Hollywood music company exec though? Tommy Mottola? Jose Menendez? Geffen?

            There was also the post pointing fingers at Frank Guistra. I think that would invoke more terror to those who want things kept quiet. With Guistra, we have the Clinton Foundation, Uranium One, and the pedo-symbol emblazoned "boys club." Guistra is a can of worms I think they really really don't want opened because it'd help pave the way for a waterfall of other shit to hit the fan.
