&quot;ALEFANTIS: Well, we make everything from scratch. Other restaurants, even good restaurants, will, like, not roast their own peppers. You can just buy the roasted peppers in a can. Or you can buy garlic oil. Some products you can get, and they’re consistent and they’re easy. But I didn’t even know that existed actually until they said that. I was like, “What do you mean? There’s another way? You can just buy these things?” Because a lot of restaurants will open a can and put it on. Like our sauce — we harvest a whole crop of organic tomatoes — 10 tons of tomatoes every year.

<p>I believe this article is a reliable statement by James, because earlier in the article, he confesses intimate details about his life and about how he came out to his parents as a homosexual.  The statement was made at the same time and in the same article/interview as a statement of personal or family history.</p>',
