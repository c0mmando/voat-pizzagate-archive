<p>My friend was working on the set for the first 12 weeks but didn\'t go back for the reshoots.

<p>This doesn\'t match up to what the Gold Coast Bulletin reported about the reason Micke left, which is some kind of spin doctor story about an on set romance and some kind of incident.</p>
<p>It begs a lot of questions and it seems that no one is asking: What incident? Why did he quit? What happened between him and the lead actress?

<p>I just don\'t think Micke Moreno would have had a contract that could allow him to quit overnight. </p>
<p>It makes sense if the studio is trying to hide some kind of abuse though ... but whose abuse? Was Micke the abuser or did Micke get abused? Or did Micke witness abuse?! </p>

           <p>
            My first thought when reading about the crux of these events being massive loss of production costs is insurance fraud. Hollywood is already famous for their kinky accounting practices and wonky insurance schemes. It's possible this was all a deliberate scheme to rake in cash from insurance payouts set up to cover loss from just this type of scenario.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I think it's worth noting that an even more bizarre reality exists involving similar Hollywood accounting practices. I've read some unsubstantiated accounts of what they call "Limited Investment Opportunities" whereby banks allow basically anonymous accounts to be used for theft and money laundering. It all happens through what is called "Black Screen Banking." "Green Screen Banking" involves all the transactions that take place between bank customers during normal banking hours of operation. "Grey Screen Banking" involves the intra-bank transactions between banks after normal hours of operation. "Black Screen Banking" involves only transactions on a banks second set of books. In other words, these transactions record the illegal activity for the accounting purposes of corrupt bankers and the networks of organized financial crime set up at the end of WWII.
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently, Hollywood funds some of their largest productions through the proceeds of these "Limited Investment Opportunities." The way it works is a few accounts at a bank are chosen as repositories for stolen money. They are always anonymous in that they bear the names of depositors like, "The Black Bear" or "Children's Dream Group." Certain Hollywood studios and other insiders are given the option to make a deposit of $15 million or more to one of these accounts. The caveat is that, they will sign contracts agreeing to forfeit said money and promising to NEVER attempt a withdrawal. The punishment for withdrawal attempt is death.
           </p>
           <p>
            After a period as short as between 3 weeks and 6 months, they receive a cash return of between 10x and 30x their deposit. This accounts for a huge percentage of US inflation, as these profits are created from thin air. I can't recall the process that takes place by the banks to produce the profits. I just remember that it all sounded feasible when learning about it 5 or 6 years ago. I do remember that it was somehow connected to phony bonds produced by the Federal Reserve Bank way back in the post WWII years. That involved gold reserves deposited with the fed by nations in exchange for bonds worth astronomical sums.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not dismissing that there may have been some child abuse element behind this story. I'm just suggesting it was probably some other form of crime. We'll all be surprised just how much less child abuse there will be once we FIX THE MEDIA.

              We used to call this school of hard knocks. As in old school wisdom.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now wisdom is pre-packaged from Marxist indoctrination centers called Public Sector School funding.

             Very good information. Wish someone would dig down on Lionsgate. Giustra must have been doing something along these lines.' Black Screen Banking'...interesting. Personally I believe all major studios are washing money and in all likelihood from nefarious dealings such as child trafficking, organ harvesting etc

                ;I have posted that picture many times here.  It still gets to me.  Someday I am dreaming of them getting their just desserts.  You know they are trying to pass a bill saying it's a crime to lynch someone.  After all these years they pass it now.  I don't think they care at all about whether any Black people are lynched.  It's their own necks they worry about.

                 It's an evil so awful that my brain can't fully think about it. I notice that sometimes my brain just stops at a certain point when looking at a picture like that, it just won't let me think process further. When the masses feel the way I do right now then the good people of many nations will take to the streets to hunt these monsters down. Really, there will come a day when they can't walk down the street.

                  That's my dream.  I don't like really frightening movies, but one time my husband and I happened to turn on Night of the Living Dead and we really didn't know what we were watching when all of a sudden we saw the dead, a whole bunch of them getting out of graves and walking in a group.  A group of them all dead, that is how I picture them walking down the streets after we have our way with them.  Begging for Our Mercy.  Which we will not allow.  I know how you feel, believe me.
