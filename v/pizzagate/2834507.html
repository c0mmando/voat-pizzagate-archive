            This post has been flagged as not following rule 1.  The preposterous notion that only well known public figures or
            <strong>
             "elites"
            </strong>
            are involved in large scale organized human trafficking or what has come to know as pizzagate. i.e. James Alefantis.  James Alefantis was relatively unknown before the Podesta email leaks.

            If in-fact that this person actually had 200,000 cash to spend on purchasing a child, he should be investigated.  If we are not able to communicate freely and share links through is site, you have done a great disservice to real researchers.

             This argument should have been made as part of the submission, or added after you received the flair.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you click the link in Rule 1 that goes to the definition of pizzagate, you'll see that Rule 1 includes anyone who is helping promote or cover up child abuse by the rich and powerful and members of rich and powerful organizations. It is very broad. BUT you have to make the case for why whatever news item you post is relevant to what we are investigating: the global cabal that uses sexual abuse of kids to keep themselves in power. You can't just dump links with no explanation on the board, and make multiple posts that ignore the submission rules and not expect it to be taken as a forum sliding operation.

            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/Ateam">
             @Ateam
            </a>
            , thanks for posting. Have you seen our rules in the sidebar? When on mobile, please switch to desktop view.
           </p>
           <p>
            I need to flair your post per Rules 1 and 2.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            is a research sub about elite pedophilia, so we would need to know whether this man belongs to the elite. Unfortunately, the article you linked doesn't mention that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second, we require a short description for each link that is posted (always
            <em>
             in addition
            </em>
            to info given in the headline). So I would ask you to please add one or two sentences to your OP:
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will flair the post '24 hours Grace', so that you'll have some time to edit.

            rules:
           </p>
           <p>
            1: Relevance: Posts must be directly relevant to investigation of Pizzagate: the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of children by elites, child trafficking organized by elites, and/or cover-up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities. See definition of Pizzagate and examples of relevant posts.
           </p>
           <p>
            2: Empiricism: EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link. If you ask a question: Explain what led to your question and provide sources. If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them. Avoid baseless speculation. ALL posts must include at least one link.
           </p>
           <p>
            3: Clarity: All titles must adequately describe post content and must establish direct relevance to pizzagate. EACH link in your post must include a description of content and how the link relates to the post (except when markup is used to embed links in the specific text they support).
