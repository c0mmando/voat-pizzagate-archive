            First, I'd like to say I am an independent who voted Trump.  That being said...
           </p>
           <p>
            The only thing about the list of mta6's that I would disagree with is adding the people not in office or not held an office, like he had Timothy McVeigh on there along with Ted Bundy, several other people who were "activists", a preacher, and even a son of a republican, etc.... if we were to make a list of people just who associated themselves with a party, we could go on forever with lists for both parties.
           </p>
           <p>
            Original poster of that thread was exposing people still in office (at that time). So just bc mta6 had a lot of Repubs on his list, I dont think any were still in office at that time, some never were in office, and some werent even politicians or ever held or ran for office. The poster's list would be longer if she would have included people who were no longer in office or who just associated as being dems.
           </p>
           <p>
            BUT...that's just me analyzing a list of apples &amp; oranges and how it would have evened out if they all listed just politicians or former politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            BUT...all that being said, I welcome any list of any party or anyone who harms children, so that we can be reminded or made aware of the mutherfuckering pedophiles. This only helps us with pizzagate and proves there is a pedo problem in the gov.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a lot of OTHER corruption in gov, many on that list were arrested for things HRC &amp; Barry have done, so why didnt HRC or BHO, hell, even WJC get arrested for those things too? Bc they are/were higher up the politician chain, even untouchable?
           </p>
           <p>
            What caught my eye &amp; interest on that list was the guy  Craig J Spence who arranged child sex parties in WH in 80's. I did not know they actually arrested or charged someone for that, I thought there wasn't solid proof. But I will be looking him up later to see what happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            Side note: the kids who were forced to play with the dead baby by their parents...WOW. I can only assume the parents were mentally messed up after losing the child &amp; had a mental break of some kind.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the guy who admitted to fucking a mule....would be perfectly acceptable as long as he was a muslim.

            Holy shit... this is absolutely insane... these lists are absolutely frightening.
           </p>
           <p>
            Honestly, the links/data/history should be made into a "locked" or "sticky" post along with the compilation of evidence/introduction post for Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is truly disturbing.

            That Craig thing was a false set-up operation. I actually walked into a men's room at that airport in Bloomington Mn a couple years after the Craig bust and when the urinals are all taken the people go piss in one of the open toilets and there is a puddle of piss there in front of all those toilets, like what is obvious to any male that has to use a busy mens room like that. If you have to sit down in one of those stalls, you're gonna have a wide stance or you're gonna be putting your expensive senator shoes in a puddle of piss. Don't know if it was the exact men's room that Craig got fake-busted that I used at the Minneapolis airport, but it's worth the effort to find the identity of the arresting officer and trace him to a scheme from 'rat headquarters. They occupy ever stall when they see Craig coming that way and give him the open stall that they know is all pissed-out and then they try to click his shoe. .

            In case you guys didn't see it, mta6 made two posts on the thread, both are long lists . Definitely seems to be a network of politicians with a common interest.. sadly.
