           <p>
            Anything else resembling legit intelligence info in what this clown passes as his "research" has been taken from FBIAnon posts.. and other places.. and that "research" has been twisted to exclude any links to AIPAC, Mossad or the Apartheid state of Israel.
           </p>
           <p>
            He even admits so himself..

             Israel supports the ISIS ratline (75% of Israeli line is from the ratline i believe) But i don't believe they are involved, etc. My big focus is to get all the emails, not to shame Israel. The emails are the key to the investigation IMO.

            why would you want to listen to lies and misinformation?

            If so, mind as well tune into CNN, NBC, ABC,,, because George "AIPAC" Webb Sweigert is not really any better than fake news, since he is never going to name the real culprits behind the crimes.

            His agenda is the same as the MSM:

            We did make up our own minds, his "research" is complete garbage disinfo taken from a bunch of silly websites, research without any evidence whatsoever, always pointing to people like the Awan Bros, that are long gone and far out of reach of US authorities.

            He is just like Alex Jones, pure noise and entertainment, which is why brain dead fools still follow him.. just like Alex Jones who still is followed by millions of sheep.

            I'm still confused why people listen to Webb. He has said 3 times in his vids he's Mossad (once sayin Old Guard as if that's any better) and twice I've seen it written out. Once via text and this one where he says he's a Zionist. Zionist and/or Mossad, old or new, doesn't matter. ALL BAD NEWS

              I went a little way down this rabbit hole. I concluded that there is NO WAY that the spooks in the DNC have allowed Pakistani intelligence direct access to federal infrastructure. Not without help from Israel. It's too risky otherwise.

                Perfectly possible. Here's a similar theory of mine filed in my notes under the 'somewhat outlandish but possible' category:
               </p>
               <p>
                The Awan brothers are and always have been Mossad agents working for the old guard. Webb's mission, and he chose to accept it, was to divert all attention away from the role of Israel in the massive espionage operation that they just perpetrated. I have a feeling that the old guard Mossad don't like Hillary for the same reasons Obama doesn't: she's too reckless. This even makes some of Webb's more repulsive statements make sense: Hillary is being far too reckless, we all need to dial it back, and so on.
               </p>
               <p>
                With this in mind, it's quite likely we can take most of the information Webb gives on Hillary as correct or certainly pointing in the right direction. However, I don't trust anything he says about the Awans. It makes far more sense that Israel was behind the Awan hacks with cooperation from people like DWS and others who don't mind H being thrown under a bus.

                   Pure nonsense, generational splits happen when companies have a huge age difference between those who administer and those who do the work.
Mossad  have never stopped hiring IDF crew, In Mossad the old work along with the young, and i know this because i have met Mossad ops working undercover as IT workers for an Israeli IT startup. There is no old and new Mossad, that is complete garbage made up by wanna-be hasbara op, who has no f'ing clue.

                   There were a lot more than two Mossad groups working before and during 911, including the dancing idiots, the art-selling "students", the art group that worked inside the WTC and a lot of other ops we don't even know about..

              And for those that still "protect" Israel and don't believe what Israel/Mossad/Zionists are doing, really need to do their own research. Search Hungary Zionists (like Soros) and know that those "Jews" in Israel are not real Jews. The Zionists are protecting their true agenda under anti-semtisim. This video is from 1990's re: ISIS

              ETA- still don't believe? Here's a protest MSM did NOT cover after Trump got into office. This was when Bibi visited Trump earlier this year. Except this protest wasn't against Trump, it was against Bibi and US backing of Israel.  Calling Israel/Zionist out for what they do is NOT anti-semantic. We've been endoctrinated to that belief and it needs to end.

            Only thing I know for sure: NYT is written by monkeys. Right off the bat they call George Webb a "far right conspiracy theorist." Webb, who says over and over and over again that he is a Bernie guy. I am so fucking sick of that publication.

             And on YouTube. But if this operation is so large even RD Steele is supporting them, don't you think they could afford to buy an online presence? Look what these clowns have done to our community! David Brock would probably DONATE his services (he runs an online bully team, they attacked Bernie supporters for money, and
             <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-clinton-digital-trolling-20160506-snap-htmlstory.html">
              even admitted it
             </a>
             ) to disrupt this community the way they have.
            </p>
            <p>
             But what they also did was a false flag on OUR community - now, (akin to the Comet "shooter"), if we ever ask authorities to look into evidence we've discovered, they can dismiss us with "The Ohio Hoax cost taxpayers 3.4 million dollars!", and perhaps even new restrictions on speech will be put into place, using this as an excuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             People have been warning everyone that this was in store, based on Webb's actions. It looks like the deep state will get him to safety though, after pulling the false flag, and he won't get in trouble. RD Steele hinted (when he called in to Jason's show today) that he was going to contact the police and defend Webb, but he won't defend Jason. That's what I mean by "clean up operation", Jason is being made the fall guy, (even by Dave Acton, George's brother), and people are defending George using pity, and the fact that he's a nice
             <s>
              salesman
             </s>
             guy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Steele seems to be part of the clean up operation after the truthers, or in other words, anyone asking reasonable questions using YouTube, have just been dealt a deadly blow.

              The logical response is to start heeding those who were never fooled for even ONE DAY. The guy whose leads get most deleted and who doesnt know or care who Trish is but can locate new pedo restaurants in any major city AT WILL. Dont forget the entire Seth Rich MSM pile-on as we are now obligated to prove an UNNECESSARY SECOND CONSPIRACY, meanwhile his boys here attempt to discredit me using SJW tactics.
             </p>
             <p>
              By heeding i mean that IN RESPONSE TO THE JEWISH ESCALATION THE PG RESEARCHERS  STIPULATE THAT PIZZAGATE IS MERELY THE "HOW" OF THE J.Q. AND ITS SOLUTION WILL NECESSARILY INVOLVE REMOVING A GREAT NUMBER OF JEWS FROM POWER STARTING WITH THE FED

              Robert David Steele is a shyster, IMO.  He saw the opportunity to make money off Webb's youtube watchers. Trying to sell certificates of ownership of the country after "the revolution" if one funds his organization.  He looked like a high pressure used car salesman.
