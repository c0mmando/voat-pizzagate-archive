<p>Shana Aaronson, director of the Jewish Community Watch (JCW) office in Israel has told The Jerusalem Post that the group found there are 42 suspected or convicted child sex offenders who moved to Israel from the Diaspora.</p>
<p>“Because Israel has the concept of the Law of Return, and Israel being a national homeland for the Jewish people, and the numerous legal rights that Jews have: to be here, to come here, to seek safe haven here, this is a particular issue with Israel, where you are going to come here and by and large you’re going to be granted automatic citizenship, and as the case may be, safe haven,” Aaronson said.</p>

<p>NGO report paints grim picture of state of children in Israel
14-year-old boy found in severe neglect, allegedly caged since birth
The Jewish Agency denied the allegations and said any candidates for aliya with either the Agency or the Nefesh B’Nefesh organization had to face extensive background checks before they could immigrate.</p>
<p>The JCW is a global group that seeks to expose offenders and warn communities about potentially dangerous people in their neighborhoods. In addition to 42 child sex offenders it says who have taken residence in Israel, the group has also identified several offenders who regularly travel in and out of Israel with ease.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006 by a child sex abuse survivor, the JCW is active in the US, Canada and Israel, and is dedicated to the prevention of child sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Aaronson and other activists say the aliya process allows sex offenders to provide inaccurate information about their criminal backgrounds so that they may obtain Israeli citizenship.</p>
<p>Avi Mayer, a spokesman for the Jewish Agency responded in an email: “We have no information to suggest that many people are able to enter Israel fraudulently and are confident in our multi-pronged vetting process.”</p>
<p>Sabine Hadad, a spokeswoman at the Interior Ministry, which ultimately decides matters of citizenship, said: “The procedures of the Population and Immigration Authority require an immigrant applicant to present a certificate of integrity in his name from his country of origin. If necessary, a federal certificate of integrity or a certificate will be required from the district to which the applicant belongs.”</p>
<p>Aaronson said, however, that it’s possible for a tourist to change their status and become an immigrant once they are already in Israel. Many are able to obtain a notarized letter instead of this certificate of integrity from local lawyers stating they do not have criminal backgrounds. These lawyers do not always investigate their client’s backgrounds.</p>
<p>“While the State of Israel in theory does have the right to restrict somebody from coming here if they think they will be dangerous to the citizens, they don’t necessarily know about it,” Aaronson said.</p>
<p>Nefesh B’Nefesh spokesman Tani Kramer said Israel is currently reevaluating its policy regarding certificates of integrity.</p>
<p>“In the past, federal background checks alone were not sufficient in order to make aliya, and therefore the Ministry of Interior imposed the responsibility on the oleh to declare his lack of a criminal background. This is currently being reevaluated by the Ministry of Interior. We are awaiting new instructions on this matter,” Kramer said.</p>
<p>The country has prevented some potential immigrants with criminal records from immigrating. A 1954 amendment to the Law of Return excludes Jews “with a criminal past, likely to endanger public welfare” from obtaining citizenship.</p>
<p>“Each year, Jewish Agency staff uncover a number of cases in which applicants are found to have lied on their aliya applications and those cases are handled accordingly,” Mayer said.</p>
<p>But according to Aaronson, many pedophiles still manage to enter the country undetected. “One can only uncover and reject what one knows about. It is those that they don’t uncover and reject, and therefore are by definition not aware of, that we are concerned about,” said Aaronson. “It is not what I would call an extensive background check by any stretch.”</p>
<p>Once in Israel, Jewish sex offenders can change their names and start new lives. Alarmingly, they are often free to insert themselves back into positions that will bring them into close contact with children.</p>
<p>Israeli authorities have a mandate to extradite suspected criminals to their countries of origin. But Aaronson alleges that because of its historic role as a protector of Jews, Israel is often reluctant to do so.</p>
<p>“Israel is always hesitant to extradite people,” said Aaronson. “It is just part of the system.”</p>
<p>Justice Ministry spokesman Noam Sharvit said there are many conditions which have to be met in order for an extradition request to be accepted, making the process complicated and time consuming. Some extradition requests are rejected.</p>
<p>“If a country wants us to extradite, it’s not automatic,” Sharvit said.</p>
<p>American prosecutors wishing to extradite a suspect from Israel face a six-step process. First police must compile the case and hand it to the prosecutor’s office where it is sent on to the governor for approval, then back to the prosecutor’s office. If it passes through these steps, the request goes on to the State Department, which may decide to send it on to Interpol for verification. Once verified by Interpol, the request heads back to the State Department which can submit an extradition request to Israel.</p>
<p>“When information is received from overseas government organizations such as Interpol, joint investigations are opened and continue until the suspect is found and brought to justice,” Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.</p>
<p>The process is long and daunting, and many US prosecutors are hesitant to engage. If there is no request for extradition, Israel is unlikely to seek out a charged felon, Aaronson said. She said the state tends to reject those requests that don’t list a proper address for the suspect.</p>
<p>However, the Justice Ministry denied that accusation. “Of course if you give an address... it helps. But this is not a condition. If there is no address, we tell the police to locate it,” Sharvit said.</p>
<p>Not all alleged sex offenders are extraditable. According to the Justice Ministry, Israel only entertains extradition requests for suspects for whom authorities have enough evidence to put on trial. If they are only wanted for questioning, the ministry will not accept the request, Sharvit said.</p>
<p>According to the JCW, pedophiles who immigrate can live in communities with children nearby and even get jobs at schools.</p>
<p>Manny Waks, founder and CEO of Kol V’Oz – an organization that also addresses issues of child sexual abuse in Jewish communities around the world – hopes for change through two avenues: advocacy in the Knesset and raising public awareness of the issue.</p>
<p>He is working with the Knesset Special Committee for the Rights of the Child and its chairwoman, MK Yifat Shasha-Biton (Kulanu), to make it more difficult for sex offenders to make aliya.</p>
<p>Waks believes the government should set up a commission that addresses the issue of child sex abuse both locally and in the Diaspora. </p>
<p>“There is certainly that strong connection between Israel and the Diaspora Jewish community, and therefore there is an opportunity to approach this issue on a global scale,” he said.</p>
<p>Raising public awareness and changing the culture around child sex abuse within the Jewish community is also paramount, Waks says. He encourages parents to talk to their children about it in a sensitive, open way.</p>
<p>“There are various age-sensitive resources available in various languages. In this day and age, it’s very easy to obtain the appropriate, culturally sensitive, age-relevant resources,” he said.</p>
<p>Aaronson and JCW seek to make it more difficult for sex offenders to make aliya by working with the Jewish Agency, the Association for Americans and Canadians in Israel, and Nefesh B’Nefesh.</p>
<p>“Those non government offices should do their part to check, why is this person suddenly making aliya? Is it because they found out their victims just went to the police?” Aaronson said.</p>
<p>Kramer also said: “We have strategic partnerships with the JCW and other similar organizations in order to proactively identify these individuals, and give a heads up to the appropriate authorities in order to prevent their immigration.”</p>
<p>Aaronson said she believes the Jewish Agency is also “making serious efforts to address this to the degree they can on their level. Ultimately the laws need to change, and for now they have really impressed upon me that they are working hard on this.”</p>

           <p>
            So,
           </p>
           <p>
            if ones knew of a rape victim of Zionist jews in the USA, being shut down and threatened; would ones help? What if goyim were joining the Zionists in raping? Ever suspect why most missing children, missing women, and serial rape/murdered victims are NOT Jewish or rich? Ever do the historical infrastructure of most cities and larger towns in the USA; to see who owns/runs/contracts/lawyers/hospital-medical the counties?
           </p>
           <p>
            Ever call the attorneys for victims of Epstein and Weinstein, to see they retrauma victims, dominate, refuse help to escape, say will not represent, will demand victim sends in financials of rapists as its all about money, and demand victims name and address/location? Doing calls, that front can be exposed. Ever suspect thats a Hollywood front to track down any surviving victims?
           </p>
           <p>
            Ever call the rape and human trafficking hotlines, and the traumatize victim, demand mental label and routing to their shelter prisons, demand victim name and location, violate victims SAFETY plan to escape county first, then report. (Restrain orders, bail bonds, delayed investigations and arrests, many child victim survivors are disabled, cannot drive, poor, isolated/outcasted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok, so when is helping a victim; mental route and label as that destroys a lawsuit against rapists, not mental label the sadistic/psychotic rapists, shelter prison in the county is a prison not freedom or safety, blocks access to work, keeps victim on foot in the county. Now, would not legitimate escape for victim survivors [VS) be uhaul them to WHERE/LOCATION they want to live and feel safer, adhere to standard crime victims RIGHTS to a SAFETY PLAN (report with a support team AFTER leave the county, buy or lease to own cheap agricultural/commercial land for VS to be able to grow food and live as a accessory dwelling/trailer to run a self propietorship/work as able as recover, build dignity, non co dependance, privacy, boundaries, and rebuild confidence OR also on a cheap, liveable used boat; able to move location if stalked and go to intercoastal waters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where are the civil and human rights attorneys for these VS persons? Where are the fundraisers done in a safe way to protect the victim and their child crime rights of anonymous, especially until feel safe?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are APA, AMA, ACA Codes of Conducts and Ethics being violated at every junction above, including psychological assessing crime trauma victims is unethucal; as fear and distress are normal responses, and many VS persons can rapidly go back to who they are in a safe environmemt that is not abusive, scary, and isolating.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look up the board of directors of these various non profits. Look up the Jewish crime hotlines. Call them on behalf of a VS person, see what happens and how they raise their tone. Ask them for an Escape Plan assist. Ask them for a Rabbinical Rabbi to mediate between victims and Jewish parents that perpetuate, as in light of "adopted children," by rich Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a case going on for years, that judges will not give the adopt papers to hundreds taken from poor, non jew moms. New York, Miami, Miami Medical alumni, Orlando and other states are the locations of a Jewish doctors and attorneys, that illegally with aggressive tactics took infants from poor females, most are non jewish females.
           </p>
           <p>
            There of course, can be good jews that are not of satanic with jew as the public image. The Satanic Manual orders that no members are not to be kept secret. Satanic is now allowed in public schools, includi ng elementary. The Masonic and Satanic manuals, meeting notes and rituals are very parrallel. They both are secrets, rituals, altars with orgois, based on irrational logic to harness energy to destroy life, and both use their own conning linguistic in all their communications. Without question, members must do what is ordered to do. That is entire huge units of members that can easily gangstalk and harrass versus person, block medical and lawyer assistance, and rights to get/keep jobs, false arrest and false mental route victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have never been able to find a way to "escape plan," just standard domestic violent victims, that are controlled by income and unable to drive. Crime stats of disabled of all ages and genders are of highest abuse crime cases and group bullying.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have found numerous cases of rich jews that have manslaughtered in drunk driving cases, and never are in media, never go to jail, and are overentitled, lawyered up; if are DISABLED by their choice to drive drunk, STILL get their ADA Disability Rights to work, and it is always jobs CRAFTED around their disability that they can personally do, flexible hours to their health condition, provided private transport versus having to take public health care transit, are on expensive hmos provided by family and private Jewish donations with temples/JCC, and other jewish organizations and groups.
           </p>
           <p>
            BUT, what I have found with low income crime victims not of human trafficking topic and with child/human trafficking is that their ADA Disability Right and United Nations Disability Rights are extremely violated with no equal rights access and rights to accomodations; including in rights to works. I have seen the types of jobs that the rich Jewish drunk drivers are supported to do, as shop owners, attorneys, corporate and store/office locations are bought conveniently near their homes or they live on the same property of their store/office.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is a long history of human trafficking and all the range of crimes and constructs of that are direct related to the infrastructures of counties. I saw the infrastructures of DC to be accessed some in early Voat. I read on here in periods. I never see strategies for victims to escape or any accessed way for attorneys for low income victim in private or group victim cases. I have sat and called and emailed any lead to assist in victims; including ACLU, attorneys, bar associations, all types of victim crime hotlines, counselors, medical individuals and groups, Southern Poverty Law Center, mental rights groups, medical advocacy groups, disabled rights groups, child rights groups,legal aid, numerous Jewish help organizations and temples, poverty groupsmedia, and so much more. So much donations and so many fake assholes.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is never pleasant, and there is never any help, just high disrespect and intimidation. Makes me wonder how many VS persoblns are routed mental, sheltered to homeless, mortality as non treated medical is excaberrated, and SUICIDED.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the utter habits of violating a victims CRIME SAFETY PLAN, triggering trauma, invading healthy boundaries the victim tries to exercise, controlling the victims choices to only mental route and sheltee, demanding without earned trust or signed consent the victim say all endured and given medical advice illegally to be psych routed, called liars, name and location demanded is disturbing. I noted that call staff is not licensed nor degrees in any crime rights field.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, screamed at to call the cops. I note that victims of simpler domestic violence to survivors of this Voat topic are often intimidated, mental routed by cops, threatened and hostile cops, refuse to give names, refuse to take reports. I note that more cops were just arrested in NY and CA for raping rape victims in dire, and the RAPIST SERIAL KILLER in California, married to a ATTORNEY.
           </p>
           <p>
            I noted that the national and county Human Trafficking hotline is ran and donated by many attorneys, doctors and other rich in the counties. I noted and spoke out that none of these rape, crime and human trafficking non profits ARE addressing the rich people of high power status over the poor in their community. I noted that mafia networks and other ones are highly researched for the same way all crime networks are; and up to the child sex offenders that group together online, especially on illegal sites and the dark web. I noted that many convicted rapists serial killers, often state they are in networks, and that they are at the POOR income bottom of the networks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would not the rich networks, full of attorneys and government positions not hire and use the repeat low income  felony criminals, and provide them lawyers and judges to get away with crimes and not be arrested as often?
           </p>
           <p>
            I note that in low income areas are the rich sex clubs, poor sex clubs, and the bars that cops frequent. I noted that a number of early voat researchers are missing under duress. I truly wonder how much ones want to take down the Z, for VS persons that know who their county networks are and need to finally escape. RATS RATTED are what these chronic crime victims are called.

            <p>
             I noted that the Jewish Meyro services for the poor is a food pantry, false,advertised transport, and requires a client to pay $80 and up and be with a mental health counselor. The board and donations are revealing. Many decent counselors refuse insurance, for that requires any that talk ro a counselor to be given a mental label! Telling ones to go to a counselor is saying, go get a label, pay for it, be punished for seeking guidance ablnd have your diary of life, nosily invaded. How many issues in life do ones need someone to talk to, trust, not be judged, help seek guidance and steps, and after issue resolved; snap back to their normal self versus stressed, scared, mourning, abused, controlled, or terrified? Will every abused animal be mental routed now? What is the forcing of a non proven field of labels and chemicals that also discriminate many medical rights, religious rights, indigenous and spiritual rights?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is every issue in life, now to be mental labelled? How does over mental labelling the non violent nation help in discerning the most dangerous mentals that are sadists and psychopaths, and narcissistics?
            </p>
            <p>
             I also noted the Bully Hotlines. OK, so always victims to be mental labelled, forced ro talk and be truggered and not gave their own peivacy boundaries or OWN thoughts, as their endurings ARE NOT their thoughts, ONLY saying the SERIES OF EVENTS they endured. They are the thoughts of the felony crim8nals of mental dis-orders that focus by their CHOICES to harm, destroy, stalk, slander, distriss, RATT, bl9ck equal rights Citizens and Disability Access! The more money and power is the more control and networks. Why is the logical common sense of rich, pathol9gical criminal networks COMPLETELY UGNORED AND ENABLED, as any victims are dead blocked and demeaned inhumanely?
            </p>
            <p>
             Question to compare contrast: How many Holocaust victims did the jews MENTAL ROUTE AND LABEL, force to spend their years finally be free, with psychs, in shelters and institution prisons versus freedom to live and work and have their own.pleasant daily thoughts and actions by choice.
            </p>
            <p>
             I say it is time to take down the county networks, then state, to national, to worldwide like acupuncture meridians! I say any jew not a satanist rapist, to assist or you are of evil or enabler. Every group has criminals, so enabling is no excuse for abuses and cover up. Who is charming and helpful to others in theur ingroup, does not mean jack crap of what victims endure or endured if not alive. Too many damn cold cases in each county is getting damn wierd, just like all the missing children, and children taken from poor homes. Never are the 99.9 percent victims JEWS OR RICH!
            </p>
            <p>
             ALWAYS the rich jews are lawyered up and all their crimes, of every type are covered up. I note the amount of parties they have, the coke addicts and orgies are habit. I note that married, but gay and swingers is frequent, as is married and fancy bar hoppers, of habitual drunks! I note victims to ppor are discriminated, slandered with vicious gossip, deficiencies and blame; as the rich Jews enable, cover up each of the overentitled bad choices and harmful mustakes IN HABIT.V
            </p>
            <p>
             As the Jews say, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. Double standards are hyocrites. Any good jew WOULD want assist to stop criminals in their group and assist victims to safety, dignity, justice to thrive. What is your song? 
" We are one, we are, one, branches of a tree, as one together we will rise."
            </p>
            <p>
             I say GAME ON.

             Jews who expose jews get a pass. Like Br. Nathaniel. It is a VERY tiny minority of jews who will do this. The majority of jews call them "self hating jews" and treat them like "Nazis". Jews are guilty until proven innocent. There is a reason they were kicked out of 109 countries and it wasnt "jealousy".

              81% of jews in USA support the Russia investigation hoax. That tells you all you need to know about jews and how they think and what they are up to. "Fake news" and the "Russian bot collusion" terms were shot into the (((media))) narrative right as the pizzagate story was breaking. (((Cohencidence)))?
