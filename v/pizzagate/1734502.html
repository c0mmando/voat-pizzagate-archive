            Question: If the term PEDOGATE had gotten enough attention, why did it not gain the following PIZZAGATE has? And for that matter, why did the new term even need to be created? Perhaps because we already test drove pedogate and it did NOT work.

            Having watched this for many years, there is no way around it. The ONE word that brought most of us here is PIZZAGATE. It is the word ears perk up to. It is the word that defines there is a new war on pedophilia AND MORE.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we abandon the term pizzagate we are 'starting over' in many ways. From a marketing standpoint, if we abandon the word pizzagate, we need to put a LOT of effort into whatever other word we use. As pizzagate covers a lot more than pedo, ask yourself, 'why does pedogate fit and how do we get people to understand it is more'?

             Pizzagate brought us in, and it brought the trolls in too. If I stick to it, it'll just make it harder to make a case (demand an investigation) as the term has been pissed on too much. If I were a prosecutor, I probably wouldn't listen to people claiming investigation with that term on top.
            </p>
            <p>
             If I choose pedogate, I will face the same problem. So there will be trolls and there will be painting. But that term is much more difficult to paint over, as it's a globally known fact that
             <strong>
              children are victims of human trafficking including pedophilia
             </strong>
             . Pizzerias used in the network are not outside that term either.
            </p>
            <p>
             From a community/marketing point of view, moving from one term to another is a simple step if it's widely known. With our experience from studying trolling, politics, disinfo, falseflagging, taking it too far etc... around pizzagate, we are also wiser to recognize such behaviour from the beginning in the pedogate forums. Of course, our enemy have prepared for that too, and they are not stupid. Never to be underestimated.

              Although you have fully explained your opinion, it has done nothing to support changing from pizzagate to pedogate. If we can start over and promote something different for the trolls to attack, we can put the same effort into building on pizzagate, which is already well publicized.

            I agree. Pizzagate is toast. All is not lost though. Pizzagate will forever live on as a sacrificial anode collecting all the negative disinformation put out on a daily basis by what looks more and more like the 10 headed beast of the Book of Revelation.

            As in every community, there are people with personal views included. Personally I haven't taken any other side but the side of the children, and the truth is there's a lot to do for them, no matter under which term. However, in the modern network and global communication, a common term is useful to gather the helpers together.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please note that a big part of the nicks in this community are trolls with intention to mix this soup however to make the -gate unbeliavable, including using a political view. Let's just save those children, and value HIGH all those freewilling investigators doing that here.

            Agreed. It's an easy transition and if enough people start using the term, it will certainly have people doing a double take. Curiosity will take over, the term is researchable online without it heading into the Clinton running a child trafficking ring out off a DC pizzeria basement. It also helps that the term has widely been used by political circles for a while.

            There will be some that will desperately ask us to cling to the term pizzagate, They can use both terms if they wish, this way a bridge is easily created if they're afraid of losing the narrative they wish folks to follow.
