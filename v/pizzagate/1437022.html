<p>Here is a Reddit AMA with someone who &quot;modeled&quot; for Terry Richardson. She was 19 and wanted to speak out: <a href="http://archive.is/Dbykq">http://archive.is/Dbykq</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a Saturday early evening, I went to his studio in Soho. When I got there his assistant let me in and I met him and he was very smiley and his studio was just a big studio apartment type set up. We sat at his kitchen table, me, him, and his assistant. His assistant was probably like 40-45, dark hair, some work done on her face. We sat at the table and they were super casual, she was ordering food and asked if I wanted any I declined (I legitimately had a stomach infection building and went to the hospital that night but that\'s another story). I remember he got this like lemon garlic pasta and thinking that sounded really good. So he ate, she ate I drank tea and he was doing something on his computer and she had me sign the model release forms. I dont remember what they said, definitely not anything specific about what he would want to do though, I had signed several of these before and it looked the same. Eventually we got up to take pictures and he had me stand against the blank white wall in the middle of the apartment.</p>
<p>I stood there and he started taking pics, assistant off to the side. Then he came up and took pics pov style with his hand on my face. Then he put his thumb in my mouth, I actually thought this was funny in the moment and he and his assistant were very upbeat and just light heartedly directing me. Then he stepped back at some point and had me start removing my clothes (I knew I would be getting nude, so this was not weird to me). I remember he had me take stuff off in stages, he complimented a lot, his assistant too. Definitely the usual trying to make the barely legal model feel special kind of thing looking back. I honestly do not remember if the sexual stuff started by the wall or when he moved me to the couch area but at some point I was being directed to do things like hold the top of his pants while he took more pov style pics, then eventually unbutton his pants and then his penis was out l. Meanwhile it felt like it was all just happening and there was no time to step back and be like woah this is out of hand, I was nervous and paralyzed is the only way I can describe it. At some point the assistant started taking pics too with a point and shoot little camera and when I went to the couch things became extremely sexual and out of hand I would say. He had me posing on the couch and then I had my back to him and just literally felt him start licking my ass, like every part of it, and the assistant was taking pictures the whole time. After that point it was completely pornographic, he was on the couch with me and it was just varying sexual acts, him having me squeeze his balls, aggressive kissing, him doing random sexual acts to me, everything slow so his assistant could photograph. I never once initiated anything I was completely a sex puppet at this point. It ended with him jacking off on to my face and he told me to keep my eyes open really wide and his assistant stood over me and it got in my eye and they both began taking pics of it for a what felt like 10 minutes but was probably only 30 seconds... At this point they backed off and were still acting totally normal happy whatever and I think I was visibly in shock, I am quiet by nature and I was definitely quiet in that moment and that\'s when he asked if I had a boyfriend. I said yes and he started overly sweetly apologizing and so did his assistant. And he said oh I always mean to ask that first I\'m so sorry. I said it was fine that it didn\'t matter and he wouldnt care its ok (I dont know why, obviously he would care. He knew I was nude modeling but nothing like this). Then I guess I cleaned up and got dressed and I don\'t even remember saying bye or what happened as far as leaving the studio/apartment but his assistant wanted to come with me and paid for a cab and rode halfway with me and sort of comforted me I guess? She was giving me weird advice on how everything we did was ok and how I am clearly a strong girl but i wasn\'t even asking for advice. Then she left at her destination and I went home. I told my roommate that night about it in kind of disbelief. I still had that stomach infection going on and it got extremely bad that night and I ended up being taken to the hospital in an ambulance, looking back I am almost 100% sure this was more panic attack induced than the stomach infection alone.
edit: and no I did not get paid.</p>
