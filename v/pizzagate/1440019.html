             Thanks to being put on to hotels via linkage to this thread, I've put together a few more bits and pieces that conspire to tell a more compelling tale than that told in my submission initially. The comment thread is quite difficult to follow so I may compile these in to a more comprehensive post outlining the relationships between Haiti and Laura Silsby with her New Life Child's Refuge trafficking case substantiated with further evidence regarding the child labour trafficking of young boys out of Central American countries such as El Salvador and Honduras, Hillary Clinton's email updates on her situation during the time of her incarceration as well as her funding of high end Marriott hotels in Haiti, a possible explanation for why so many hotels are fundng the ECPAT (including Marriott who are in turn funded by the Clintons, creating a complete loop) and how Haiti obsessed Beyond Borders [dot] net being so close in proximity to Comet pizza may not be simple coincidence. Cheers for the heads up.
