<p><em>from <a href="http://archive.is/VcMgw">today\'s</a> The Independent:</em></p>
<p>\'Earlier this month, a Reddit post detailed a lengthy series of accusations against lead singer Mario Cuomo, drummer Henry Brinner, and bassist Grant Brinner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Among the allegations are that Cuomo sent unsolicited nude photos and videos to underage girls, had sex with underage girls - some of whom claim it was consensual but later regretted it, and others who allege that he raped them</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Twin brothers Henry and Grant Brinner are also accused of sexually abusing and raping young or underage fans</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>In a statement released on 28 August the band denied the sexual assault claims, writing: &quot;We emphatically deny these baseless allegations brought as a personal attack against us.</p>
<p>&quot;While callow altercations and vulgar language we\'ve used in the past must be recognised and owned up to, the allegations of sexual assault are completely unfounded.&quot;</p>
<p>They added: &quot;No member of this band has ever acted without consent or maliciously taken advantage of anyone. We encourage anyone who\'s been affected by sexual abuse to speak up and make their abusers known, however we also encourage everyone to be cautious of the things they read and say on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>However, shortly after the statement denying the allegations, the band issued a tweet on 29 August which simply read: &quot;The Orwells have disbanded.&quot;</strong> The same message was posted on their Facebook page. </p>

            Was watching this band very closely.
            <strong>
             They are involved in the Comet Ping Pong ring with the bands that pass through.
            </strong>
            Their lyrics telegraph that they're working on behalf of a larger organization.
