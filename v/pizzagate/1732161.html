            The Israelis would sacrifice their children to Molech and come into the temple on the same day. This really angered God. Kind of sounds like our days!!! The nation of Israel went into 70 years of captivity to Babylon for King Manasseh's sins. King Manassesh allowed child sacrifice to Molech. King Manasseh did worse than the heathen nations around him. God took him to Babylon and he was humbled then allowed him to come back to Israel. God said the people of Jerusalem would eat their own children in the seize of Jerusalem during Jeremiah's days and they did.

            Whos father? Also Im still not read up on the Epstein stuff. Sometimes I assume something might be disinfo if I didnt hear from a credible source. Im not claiming it is disinfo I just tend not to read up on things I cant verify.

            One thing ive always wondered about guys like Bill Clinton and Trudea is that if they would actually be pedos. I thought the pedos were usually the weirder guys. I thought maybe since BIll and Trudea are attractive they just bang hot ladies or something. I could be wrong though.

            I was just thinking about something like this recently but I wasn't sure where it'd fit if I tried to create a new post.

            Was Jesus ever molested by all the rabbis he was hanging out with as a kid? He generally called out sinners, obviously had a message of forgiveness, etc but when it came to kids, he said you should basically commit suicide if you cause one of them to stumble (which could include pedophilic acts).

            I find it funny that any normal person thinks they know what elite are like, when none of us have even had a conversation with any of them or even know who most of them are. That's the fallacy of money equaling someone's value. Riches are a cover

             I would say the Jews were created by the Pharaohs as a hybrid race bio-weapon to enslave humanity.  They have an appetite for human blood and the need to control everything in the lives of humans.  Lets say for example some new movement or religion or even website was started...it wouldnt take long before it would be infiltrated by a Jew and completely taken over by them...so one Jew would have to split off from his Tribe and live his life controlling this new movement for the rest of his life.  Like a virus spreading and replicating its host and imitating it but still part of the hive mind.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are also reasons why they control nearly 100% of the media so as to hide their crimes of "blood libel".  And there is a reason why the ALL have gotten kicked out of more than 100 countries over the centuries and its because those countries suspected ALL the Jews were doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Jews control everything above ground while the Pharaohs lineage continues to live safely underground or in Switzerland.

            Well they've certainly kept it quite hidden from view. they must know it's wrong on all accounts despite what they're perverted belief system tells them. The words of jesus Christ regarding the little children have much more meaning to them now for me and I understand why he said it. Also, in more modern times the sentiment "Bless the beasts and the children" This world is a fucking cesspool to me now. And it will be forevermore til this horror is no longer practiced.
