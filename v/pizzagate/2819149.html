<h2>13 US states are now investigating whether [sexual] abuse was concealed by church leaders, including bishops who head each diocese.</h2>
<h2>[O]ne place under scrutiny by federal investigators is Buffalo, New York. In August, information about dozens of accused priests was leaked from the diocesan secret archive. What it revealed, infuriated many of Buffalo\'s 600,000 Catholics.</h2>
<p>The hundreds of pages Siobhan O\'Connor uncovered included personnel files and memos. <strong>They revealed that for years Bishop Malone allowed priests accused of sexual assault such as statutory rape and groping to stay on the job.</strong></p>
<p>At first, she took pictures with her phone. Then she used the copy machine at the bishop\'s offices. The documents provided an extraordinary window into how the diocese handled abuse.</p>
<h1>Her decision to act was influenced by the phone calls she fielded from dozens of people who said they had been abused. O\'Connor says she tried to get the bishop to be more responsive to them. He would tell her it\'s not her concern.</h1>
<p>She said by last summer she was, in her words,  &quot;morally allergic&quot; to what she witnessed. Just before O\'Connor quit her job in August, she anonymously leaked the church documents to a reporter at Buffalo television station WKBW.</p>
<p>Until now, Siobhan O\'Connor had carefully kept her identity secret.</p>
<p><em>Bill Whitaker conducted an interview with her.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> Some people would say that you betrayed Bishop Malone.</p>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> I did betray him, and yet I can\'t apologize for that, because there was a greater good to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> I love my church, I love our diocese, and I-- I loved him. I-- I genuinely did as my bishop and as my boss.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> So why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> The reality of what I saw really left me with no other option. Because at the end of my life, I\'m not going to answer to Bishop Malone. I\'m going to answer to God.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> And nobody caught on to what you were doing?</p>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> No, they didn\'t. I was always working with paper, and I was always there, so it wasn\'t as though I had to ask for keys or take them from someone\'s desk.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> There was no other way you saw to handle this?</p>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> Not with any expediency, no. I mean, I-- I did hope and pray that a grand jury would eventually be convened and that there would be hopefully an independent investigation, but <strong>I felt that there could be other victims between now and then, and I-- I couldn\'t have that on my conscience if there was a way to prevent that.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Her doubts began in March. Bishop Malone had agreed to release a list of 42 priests accused of sexually abusing minors. But O\'Connor knew there should be more names because she had seen the draft list that circulated between the bishop and diocesan lawyers. There was also something else, a dossier about priests she discovered in a supply closet.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> There was one particular binder, which was of pending litigation that had been presented to Bishop Malone when he first was installed as our bishop. And this was from the lawyers. </p>
<p>And this was a large, over 300-page binder, and I found it when I was cleaning the closet where they kept the bishop\'s vacuum. And I remember finding this obviously very important and sensitive information and thinking, &quot;How did it ever end up here, first of all?&quot; And-- and then I was shocked at the volume of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>The cases in the dossier Bishop Malone inherited when he arrived in 2012 stretched back decades. As they worked on the list, the bishop and his lawyers decided they would not reveal the names of accused priests still in ministry.</h1>
<p><em>Assholes.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> It was a very carefully curated list. And I-- I saw all the-- the lawyers coming in and out, and I was aware of the-- the various strategies that were in place.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> <strong>What were they trying to do if not help the victims?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> <strong>Well, to my mind the overarching attitude seemed to be to protect the church\'s reputation and her assets.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> And the assets?</p>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> Uh-huh. Very much so.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Siobhan O\'Connor was most alarmed to see that Father Arthur Smith was missing from the list. Church records showed two young men in Buffalo had complained in 2013 that Smith had inappropriately touched them.</h1>
<p><em>Two years before that, Smith was sent to counseling after repeated contact with an eighth-grade boy that included unwanted attention and facebook messages. Despite what Bishop Malone knew, he endorsed Smith for a job as a cruise ship chaplain.</em> <strong>The bishop wrote, &quot;I am unaware of anything in his background which would render him unsuitable to work with minor children&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><em>bangs head on table</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> <strong>Our previous bishop had removed him from ministry, so I always thought it was odd that Bishop Malone had reinstated him.</strong> When I explored his file more in-depth, that might have really been the moment when I knew that I had to do something with this information.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Remember, the diocese list had 42 names. The documents O\'Connor revealed put the number of Buffalo priests facing claims of all types of abuse at 118.</h1>
<p><em>shakes her head in disbelief</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> They had accusations against them, credible accusations.</p>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> Yes, that\'s right.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> What\'d you think of that?</p>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> <strong>I felt that instead of being transparent, we were almost being the opposite or-- or half transparent. Here are the names that we would like you to know about, but please don\'t ask us about the rest.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>One of them was Father Fabian Maryanski. His file included an accusation that during the 1980\'s he had sexual relations with a girl that began when she was just 15. The diocese knew about it but a note in the file argued Maryanski should be excluded from the list of problem priests.</h1>
<h1>It said, &quot;We did not remove him from ministry despite full knowledge of the case, and so including him on list might require explanation.&quot;</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Siobhan O\'Connor:</strong> And I remember thinking, if that\'s their rationale for leaving a priest off, then how can I abide by this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>She was not alone. Father Bob Zilliox advised the bishop on church law, including abuse cases. He told us he was disgusted by how the cases he saw were handled.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Father Bob Zilliox:</strong> I think the hypocrisy, the lip service, you know, the, &quot;Yes, Bob, I agree with you,&quot; and then I would walk out of an office and nothing would happen.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of cases should have been handled differently. They were not. A lot of cases probably should have gone to Rome at the time. They did not.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> How many of those priests should have been taken out of priesthood?</p>
<p><strong>Father Bob Zilliox:</strong> I would argue at least eight or nine.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> How many of them still are in the priesthood here in Buffalo?</p>
<p><strong>Father Bob Zilliox:</strong> All of them.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> All of them?</p>
<p><strong>Father Bob Zilliox:</strong> All the guys that should have been removed from the priesthood are still priests.</p>
<p>I think one of the factors that goes into decision making in terms of administration or leadership within diocese or in parishes is that there\'s a certain brotherhood. There\'s a certain mindset that we watch each other\'s backs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Bishop Malone has the authority to strip Father Zilliox of his duties for going public. But the priest told us he is motivated to speak out by more than the truth.</em> <strong>He also is a victim of sexual abuse by a Buffalo priest.</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Father Bob Zilliox:</strong> And so all of this has been very painful for me to see how our diocese, how other dioceses have handled this.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> How old were you when you were abused?</p>
<p><strong>Father Bob Zilliox:</strong> I was a 13-year-old boy.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> By a priest?</p>
<p><strong>Father Bob Zilliox:</strong> By a priest.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Whitaker:</strong> How did that experience affect you while you were watching how Bishop Malone was handling these cases?</p>
<p><strong>Father Bob Zilliox:</strong> It was very difficult in a lot of different ways. There\'s a certain respect that is owed to a bishop. But when I saw things take place the way they did, I sort of was conflicted within. I think as a victim, I have a bias, which is maybe not a healthy thing, but objectively I can-- I have no tolerance for any abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Every bishop chooses a motto. Bishop Malone\'s is \'live the truth in love.\' Bishop Malone declined our requests for an interview.</h1>
<h1>Bishope Malone said at a press conference: \'The shepherd does not desert the flock at a difficult time\'.</h1>
<p><em>The bishop has made three public apologies and offered to sell his 11,000 square foot official residence to help compensate victims.  &quot;We continue to reach out to victims, remove clergy with substantiated allegations from ministry and cooperate with federal and state investigations.&quot;</em> </p>
<p><em>But in Bishop Malone\'s first six years in Buffalo just one priest was put on leave. It was only after this scandal broke in March, that he suspended 16 more for abuse. None have been kicked out of the priesthood.</em></p>

           One of them was Father Fabian Maryanski. His file included an accusation that during the 1980's he had sexual relations with a girl that began when she was just 15. The diocese knew about it but a note in the file argued Maryanski should be excluded from the list of problem priests.

            I think one of the factors that goes into decision making in terms of administration or leadership within diocese or in parishes is that there's a certain brotherhood. There's a certain mindset that we watch each other's backs.

            It was very difficult in a lot of different ways. There's a certain respect that is owed to a bishop. But when I saw things take place the way they did, I sort of was conflicted within. I think as a victim, I have a bias, which is maybe not a healthy thing, but objectively I can-- I have no tolerance for any abuse.

            Covering for and relocating lawbreakers to protect income flow and assets smells a lot like racketeering.  And that's besides the egregious offense of creating a new safe place for perpetrators to continue committing their crimes.

            I hope the Feds put everything they've got into this.  They need to think outside the box and pursue every possibility for conviction this time--precedence to the contrary be damned.  The courts need to take a fresh whack at this problem.

             . Let's never forget that the Catholic Church has spent
             <em>
              millions
             </em>
             in the last couple years for paying lobbying firms to push
             <em>
              against
             </em>
             laws that would abolish the statute of limiations in cases of sexual abuse (in New York f.i.).
            </p>
            <p>
             So, besides protecting perps, it's greed that motivates Bishops and Cardinals to cover up for child abuse.

             I'm sure he meant 'reconcile with the perps'. Or why would he keep perps that are still serving as priests as of today from the list he sent to authorities? /s

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             We have instituted an Independent Reconciliation and Compensation Program to bring some measure of justice to those who have been abused. We have hired a former Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to monitor our professional responsibilities and obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
             We continue to reach out to victims, remove clergy with substantiated allegations from ministry and cooperate with Federal and State investigations.
            </p>
            <p>
             These activities occupy most of my days, but as St. Francis of Assisi instructed us:  start by doing what is necessary; then do what is possible; and suddenly you're doing the impossible.
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, while "60 Minutes" is free to interview whomever they wish for this story, it is clear to me and my staff that your roster of interviews did not include those who are aware of the full extent of the efforts of our Diocese to combat child abuse.  Nor does it include those who urge me every day to stay the course and restore the confidence of our faithful.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sometimes, it feels like the weight of this scandal will never pass, but by doing what is necessary and what is possible, one day we will restore confidence and earn the support of the faithful of our diocese.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, although I have respectfully declined your invitation, I have sat for hours of interviews with highly regarded local journalists -- a newscaster and a reporter for our daily paper -- so that our message can be distributed locally.'

You also know how the fire was caused, but you don't tell me. So you pretend to grieve with me about the fire, but the problem is you caused it.

             <strong>
              On January 27, 2000, Malone was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Boston and Titular Bishop of Aptuca by Pope John Paul II

             He received his episcopal consecration on March 1, 2001, from Bernard Cardinal Law, with Bishops William Francis Murphy and John Boles serving as co-consecrators. Malone was later named the eleventh Bishop of Portland in Maine on February 10, 2004, and was formally installed on March 31.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The Bishop is also a Fourth Degree member of the Knights of Columbus.

            <p>
             On May 29, 2012, Malone was appointed ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo. He was later appointed apostolic administrator of Portland in Maine until such time as a permanent replacement was installed.[1] He was installed in Buffalo in a ceremony at St. Joseph Cathedral on Friday, August 10, 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
             On September 28, Malone named
