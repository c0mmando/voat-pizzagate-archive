Here\'s one source that describes the type of conduct this \'agency\' was involved in ( it\'s in polish ): <a href="http://www.msn.com/pl-pl/wiadomosci/polska/dramatyczna-historia-si%C3%B3str-adoptowanych-przez-par%C4%99-z-usa-dgp-pozna%C5%82-kulisy-sprawy/ar-AAmdbEx?li=AAaGjkQ&amp;ocid=spartanntp">http://www.msn.com/pl-pl/wiadomosci/polska/dramatyczna-historia-si%C3%B3str-adoptowanych-przez-par%C4%99-z-usa-dgp-pozna%C5%82-kulisy-sprawy/ar-AAmdbEx?li=AAaGjkQ&amp;ocid=spartanntp</a></p>
<p>Here\'s a summary - 2 polish girls (age 3 and 5) were given in adoption to an american family. Upon their arrival to the states it turned out they would not go together to one family as was agreed upon but would be split - and go to 2 different families. After some time the older one was rushed to the hospital with clear signs of sexual abuse. What\'s more during the investigation it was revealed that the family the older girl was given to is related to the person that works for EACI and that worked on this particular case.</p>
<p>Despite being informed of this fact the polish agency kept working with and giving more children in adoption to EACI. My guess is that both of them are involved in this. Recently all international adoptions have been banned in Poland, which might suggest they\'re also working on untangling their local pedophile rings.</p>',

            My heart goes out to those girls.  When I think of the poor children that have to suffer at the hands of these evil people.  Even the ones that are not the perpetrators, but are just selling these children off to them for a get rich quick scheme it boggles the mind.  Such Evil.
