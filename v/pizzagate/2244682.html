            I think he’s a pervert. Too much smoke on this one.  We can’t turn a blind eye just because he supports Trump.

            Maybe he's a perv, maybe he isn't, but I think it's odd that no one ever made a report about his behavior on the past 40 years- when he was running for public office. But all of a sudden when he runs for senate women are coming out of the woodwork.

             Alabama is a southern rural state with a political class that can cover up a lot.  I know from a personal experience in a different type of case.  I mentioned on a very small local talk show about a fact that I read in a news paper.  The next day that article disappeared on line.  But there were rumors about Roy in the past.  I never heard the rumors about Bill Clinton until he entered the national arena although they were of course swirling around in Arkansas.

              This past weekend, I spoke or messaged with more than a dozen people—including a major political figure in the state—who told me that they had heard, over the years, that Moore had been banned from the mall because he repeatedly badgered teen-age girls. Some say that they heard this at the time, others in the years since. These people include five members of the local legal community, two cops who worked in the town, several people who hung out at the mall in the early eighties, and a number of former mall employees.

             It's not odd this is coming out now when he's running for a job that only two people in the whole state can get.    For one it puts the national news media on the case to go around to talk to people about him.

               Roy Moore accuser: I got him banned from the mall
ABC News

              <p>
               Here the sourcing the New Yorker had on their story.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                This past weekend, I spoke or messaged with more than a dozen people—including a major political figure in the state—who told me that they had heard, over the years, that Moore had been banned from the mall because he repeatedly badgered teen-age girls. Some say that they heard this at the time, others in the years since. These people include five members of the local legal community, two cops who worked in the town, several people who hung out at the mall in the early eighties, and a number of former mall employees. (A request for comment from the Moore campaign was not answered.) Several of them asked that I leave their names out of this piece. The stories that they say they’ve heard for years have been swirling online in the days since the Post published its report. “Sources tell me Moore was actually banned from the Gadsden Mall and the YMCA for his inappropriate behavior of soliciting sex from young girls,” the independent Alabama journalist Glynn Wilson wrote on his Web site on Sunday. (Wilson declined to divulge his sources.) Teresa Jones, a deputy district attorney for Etowah County in the early eighties, told CNN last week that “it was common knowledge that Roy dated high-school girls.” Jones told me that she couldn’t confirm the alleged mall banning, but said, “It’s a rumor I’ve heard for years.”

              Are you ever going to visit the Bill and Hillary threads and imply that they are child abusers or stick to the threads about conservatives?
