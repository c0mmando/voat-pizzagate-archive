<p>I could make a list. And I did a lot of work and research on the topic of &quot;Un-natural Death&quot; clusters [statistically improbable] around various journalists / whistle-blowers. which got many thousands of views before my Forum was defaced / vandalized. </p>
<p>Here\'s Dan Wallace; related to &quot;Pizzagate&quot; since his buddy Rudowski went on to be a journalist with &quot;Jones&quot; after one day Wallace did not wake - up [in his early 20\'s - no cause of death given]</p>

<p>I\'m just giving Dan Wallace as an example of how un - natural deaths, which are statistically rare, seem to happen to an unusual degree to people who are investigators / activists - And who are free for co - option. </p>
<p>We it\'s all collated together, it becomes somthing.. The data points add up. </p>
<p>So for &quot;Pizzagate&quot; - related un-natural deaths we have:</p>

<a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/nmnm3.png">http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/nmnm3.png</a></p>
<p>So I\'m needing to secure my material before something happens to me, if it does. </p>

<p>I need to figure out how to do this and retain my anonymity - but if this guy was shadowing me, my anonymity is probably lost already?</p>
<p>I\'d like to be upright, as Breitbart; but in life [naturally] Andrew Breitbart talking about Righteous Indignation
There are many more investigators who lost their lives being upright, I feel they will be without peace in the next world, until we do this. </p>

<p>I have screen shots of what it looked like. Right now it\'s just a parking space getting ready to be restored. I have other domains I can use for archive or mirror. </p>
<p>This is from when I was sent the threat letter from the hacker who impostered our Forum founder:

<p>I took a vacation for a month after that.</p>
<p>I ran like hell both times getting off the train because I was scared of him.</p>
<p>I have a lot of material on my Forum that was hacked / defaced on dec. 10th 2016. We were tracing Pizza references in various forms of the Mass Media since the December before , i.e. 2015 .. Someone on our Forum had noticed strange connections around Pizza where he lived in St. Louis and started the thread - which got very long.</p>
<p>Before we were shut down I was up 150% on views from linking from here and from Gab..</p>
<p>We also have long threads on &quot;Predictive Programming&quot; in the Media, 9/11 &quot;Great Sync Thread&quot; showing foreshadowing of 9 /11 for at least 10 years before the event. Dissection of Crisis Actors, Faked Event , Gladio A, B, C on and on.</p>
<p>Can anyone point me to a Php coder who can fix it and get it back up and archived before I get off-ed waiting around to do the right thing?</p>
<p>I also live a stone\'s throw away from the Brooklyn \'Pizza Joint of Interest&quot; visited by HRC and Jefferson, Bradjellina, and Jay - z / Beonce - in a very industrial part of town with many empty warehouses, meat processing, and trucking depots.</p>
<p>I wasn\'t going to go public with this but the face of that alleged assassin freaked me out.. He looked totally bonkers. That could be , yeah, he\'s a patsy..<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/man-accused-fatal-midtown-atlanta-shooting-hospitalized-175459351.html"> But maybe the put him in hospital since he\'s an asset</a> and they need to be able to use him again and get him out of the criminal justice system.. Maybe his arrest was a mistake, since he is so crazy?</p>
<p>Other parts of the story don\'t add up since a man suspected of murder is usually without other prisoners in the same cell. So this also points to that he was an insider.</p>
<p>Please PM me with reputable contacts. ? Also, I need to be able to share / archive the files , as they are.</p>

             It wouldn't be a "clever way" to debunk "Pizzagate" The people making us look silly in the Mass Media don't need to "look clever" They've got the heavy artillery. The reason the story doesn't add up is more likely that the hit man fucked up. And then they have to cover.
            </p>
            <p>
             They will go to all the trouble of killing a woman , execution style, in the middle of the street, just to make "Pizzagaters" look bad.
            </p>
            <p>
             Makes no sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was hit because she had info on the Bridge? Really? Where's the evidence for that? More supposition?
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't think so.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is my post how I saw the same guy on my train last month, which discusses the un-natural deaths around "Pizzagate" researchers , i.e. Monica Peterson, Breitbart, Seth Rich, buried ; while this one, built upon a faulty assumption , in my opinion, gets first page treatment?
            </p>

             Murder of Seth Rich
            </p>
            <p>
             Researchers / Investigators are led to try to "please" the Mass Media, which is controlled,
            </p>
            <p>
             So why bend over backwards to avoid their "Gotcha" moment - which is strictly an hypothisis / supposition which never happened.
            </p>
            <p>
             And even if it did, so what? They have a millions ways to make us look silly and they already have accomplished that

            And if anyone with the power to negatively impact someone's life is reading this... Just know that you can spend decades trying to prevent the truth from coming out, but you guys already fucked up. All this bullshit of messing with people can only, at best, push back the inevitable. I'm sure your prob have nothing better to do.. Why not play some video games. Why not make some music. Why not take your kids out of a cage and go play baseball in the backyard. You guys are missing out on real life man. Slaves to Satan
