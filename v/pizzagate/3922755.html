            <p>
             Sir Richard Henry Friend FRS FREng[3] (born 18 January 1953) is a British physicist who is Cavendish Professor of Physics at the University of Cambridge and Tan Chin Tuan Centennial Professor at the National University of Singapore. Friend's research concerns the physics and engineering of carbon-based semiconductors.[7]. He also serves as Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board of the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Singapore.
            </p>
            <p>
             .Friend's research has been applied to development of polymer field effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic diodes, optically pumped lasing and directly printed polymer transistors. He pioneered the study of organic polymers and the electronic properties of molecular semiconductors. He is also one of the principal investigators in the new Cambridge-based Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (IRC) on nanotechnology and co-founder of Cambridge Display Technology (CDT) and Plastic Logic.
            </p>
            <p>
             In March 2003 Friend won the IEE's Faraday Medal.
             <strong>
              He was knighted for "services to physics" in the 2003 Birthday Honours.
             </strong>
             *cough... cough
            </p>
            <p>
             Friend is married to Carol Anne Maxwell (née Beales) with whom he has two daughters.[1]
             <strong>
              His brother[17] Peter Friend is a professor of transplantation and director of the Oxford Transplant Centre.
