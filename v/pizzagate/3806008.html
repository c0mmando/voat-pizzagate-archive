            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Herschell Gordon Lewis was born in 1926 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Geraldine (Waldman) and Emmanuel.[4] His father died when he was six years old; his mother never remarried. Lewis's family then moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he spent the majority of his adolescence. After graduating from high school, Lewis received bachelor's and master's degrees in journalism at Northwestern University in nearby Evanston, Illinois. A few years later, he briefly taught communications at Mississippi State University. He was lured from his academic career to become the manager of WRAC Radio in Racine, Wisconsin, and later to become a studio director at WKY-TV studio in Oklahoma City.

              Corey Haim died from a sudden bout of the flu...
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Haim had been ill with flu-like symptoms for two days before his death. A doctor called on him and took his temperature, but did not suspect serious problems. Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said: "As he got out of bed, he felt a little weak and went down to the floor on his knees."[62]
              </p>
              <p>
               The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office ruled that Haim's death was caused by pneumonia.[7] Before the autopsy report was released publicly, Haim's mother stated that the coroner had given her a "courtesy call" to state his preliminary findings that Haim died of pulmonary edema and was suffering from an enlarged heart and water in the lungs.

              Natural Born Killers is a 1994 American crime film directed by Oliver Stone which tells the story of two victims of traumatic childhoods who became lovers and mass murderers, and are irresponsibly glorified by the mass media. Notorious for its violent content and

                Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered twelve students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. The massacre ended with both perpetrators committing suicide. It has been confirmed that both Harris and Klebold were fans of Natural Born Killers. Prior to the massacre, they had used the initials 'NBK' as their code. In a journal entry dated, April 10, 1998, Harris wrote "When I go NBK and people say things like "Oh, it was so tragic," or "oh he is crazy!" or "It was so bloody", just because your mommy and daddy told you blood and violence is bad, you think it's a fucking law of nature? Wrong, only science and math are true, everything, and I mean every fucking thing else is Man made. Before I leave this worthless place, I will kill whoever I deem unfit for anything at all, especially life." Harris also referred to April 20 as "the holy April morning of NBK", and in an undated journal entry, Klebold (who was severely depressed) wrote "I'm stuck in humanity. Maybe going NBK w. Eric is the way to break free"

             <strong>
              The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (UPMC), located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania ’s second largest city , has helped the CCP train many organ transplant doctors over the years, and assists in the abuse of organ harvesting for Falun Gong practitioners.
             </strong>
             There is a lot of solid evidence in the world to confirm that in the past 20 years, the Chinese Communist regime has mass murdered criminals of conscience and even harvested organs for transplants for profit.
            </p>
            <p>
             UPMC has the world's oldest organ transplantation research institute with high academic status-Thomas E. Starzl Organ Transplantation Research Institute. The CCP sends people here every year to study organ transplantation. Before 2003 alone, at least more than 130 Chinese doctors studied at the University of Pittsburgh , and 70 of them studied clinical liver transplantation.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition, UPMC also has in-depth cooperation with many medical institutions in China, especially in cooperation with Wanda Group to build large-scale hospitals in 5 first-tier cities in China. UPMC sends management and technical experts to operate.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Epoch Times special article "Viruses Coming Against the Communist Party" article pointed out that countries, regions, groups and individuals that were severely affected by the epidemic have close relations with the CCP. Pennsylvania is the fourth most severe state in the United States. This is closely related to the University of Pittsburgh ’s close cooperation with the Chinese medical community for more than a decade.

             Close cooperation between the transplantation community of the Chinese Communist Party and UPMC
            </h1>
            <p>
             Many Chinese hospitals, universities and UPMC's Thomas E. Starzl organ transplantation research all have close cooperation. According to a report from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Commerce on January 8, 2004, the cooperation center between Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital and Thomas E. Starzl Organ Transplant Institute was established in Shanghai. Both sides exchanged scholars to exchange, visit and give lectures to improve the comprehensive level of organ transplantation.
            </p>
            <p>
             China Tongji Hospital and Peking Union Medical College Hospital once sent directors and delegations to UPMC and Thomas E. Starzl Organ Transplant Institute to visit and recruit talents. Professor Wang Guobin, Dean of Union Hospital, was also awarded as a visiting professor of surgery by the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
            </p>

                A lot of the wacky nonsense terminology they put in those children shows and books are MK Ultra triggers. The two most prevalent works used for MK Ultra are Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz. Grimm's Fairytales and Hans Christian Andersen are also commonly used in programming.

                My mom and dad growing up were Catholic and my dad and my uncles were almost molested by a creep, but they all knew and wanted to kill him, but my grandparents didn't notice the signs until later. My maternal aunt was raped as a teenager. My maternal grandfather was a bookkeeper for the mob. I have Irish and English ancestry.

             and all,
            </p>
            <p>
             Allentown is a close suburb of Pittsburgh with close ties to Racine, Wisconsin as they are used as models for bigger agendas. Rio Rancho is another such community in New Mexico. People and groups are recruited through the network of organizations to create stories and cases that are used to push through similar programs in other areas. This is where newspapers play an important role as they frame any story in a particular way for the desired result to be used as support for other areas.
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyone with knowledge of communities like Racine and Allentown who claim there is ‘nothing to see there’ are part of the network as the evidence becomes all too obvious and the local, state and federal authorities turn their attention to eliminating those who expose it. With the advent of technology they can now use AI and software as their tools to isolate, control, manipulate and target anyone who gets in the way of the agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             The connections between Racine and Pittsburgh go far back including Aaron French, the A. French Company and the Freemason lodges. Another good example is Freemason Ashton Kutcher speaking out against the abuse at Penn State through the Big Ten Masonic network. Celebrities and Cellebrite are both used for control and manipulation as they become increasingly compromised. Why would Ashton Kutcher be involved in federal raids for human trafficking? Why did he back out of the Fight to End Exploitation at the last moment? Why would they shut down the program if trafficking is still an issue? Did trafficking end, or were they exposed?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why did the Arena deal in Racine fall apart after the connections to Allentown were exposed? Why did Freemasons then become the fake opposition for the Arena once it was clear that the exposure had gone too far? Why did they need to get rid of the past mayors once they were exposed?
            </p>
            <p>
             How is the virus being used to usher in new surveillance programs including a billion dollar referendum to force the connections between education, community “health” and community policing?
            </p>
            <p>
             How are these families directly linked with Epstein and his foundation, Podestas, Emanuels, Clintons, NXIVM, Knights of Pythias, FLDS, Scientology, and business associations between DuPont and global food, health and tech giants?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why was Epstein blackmailing top scientists and tech leaders? What was he studying? What was Keith Reniere studying? Are vampires real? What is the hidden knowledge these groups share and control, and what is The Truth they cannot allow the World to Know?

             Kuru was the first human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) or prion disease identified, occurring in the Fore linguistic group of Papua New Guinea. Kuru was a uniformly fatal cerebellar ataxic syndrome, usually followed by choreiform and athetoid movements. Kuru imposed a strong balancing selection on the Fore population, with individuals homozygous for the 129 Met allele of the gene (PRNP) encoding for prion protein (PrP) being the most susceptible. The decline in the incidence of kuru in the Fore has been attributed to the exhaustion of the susceptible genotype and ultimately by discontinuation of exposure via cannibalism. Neuropathologically, kuru-affected brains were characterized by widespread degeneration of neurons, astroglial and microglial proliferation, a

             Pittsburgh's heroin and fentanyl epidemics are really bad. They use drug addicts in satanic cults as slaves since it is easier to control them by giving them the drug their bodies yearn for. They often do a lot of dirty work.

              <p>
               Alexis Felix du Pont Jr. (October 2, 1905 – December 30, 1996) was an American aviation pioneer,[1] soldier, philanthropist, and a member of the prominent du Pont family.
              </p>
              <p>
               For five years, Felix du Pont worked for the family owned DuPont and for a short time became involved in the investment business. With a lifelong interest in aviation, he partnered with brother Richard to found All American Aviation Company which became Allegheny Airlines and eventually US Airways.[3][4][5] He later was a vice president of the Piasecki Helicopter Corp. of which he and

                Laurence Rockefeller
               </strong>
               were early investors on its founding in 1946.
              </p>
              <p>
               ..During World War II, du Pont served with Air Transport Command with an office at The Pentagon. He was then shipped overseas as part of Pacific Theater operations, assigned to combat training and director of glider operations. He retired from the military with the rank of lieutenant colonel
              </p>
              <p>
               On the death of his brother Richard in a glider accident in 1943, Felix du Pont was appointed to succeed him as head of the American Glider Program at
               <strong>
                Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               The Chichester du Pont Foundation was incorporated in 1946 by Felix du Pont, Alice du Pont Mills, Lydia Chichester du Pont, and Mary Chichester du Pont Clark. The foundation, which remains in operation, is primarily involved in supporting youth with donations made to social service organizations for the direct benefit of children. In addition to his numerous charitable works and service on civic boards, Felix du Pont was a trustee of St. Andrew's School, founded by his father.

               China again. People torture animals before slaughtering in China and Vietnam in order to give them more flavor due to the adrenaline. Panda bear symbolism comes to mind. I think this is sex magic from that region of the world. Europe and Africa definitely have their own variants of it too. This world is diseased.

            <p>
             Richard Mellon Scaife (/skeɪf/; July 3, 1932 – July 4, 2014) was an American billionaire, a principal heir to the Mellon banking, oil, and aluminum fortune, and the owner and publisher of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. During his life, Scaife was known for his financial support of conservative public policy organizations over the past four decades. He provided support for conservative and libertarian causes in the United States, mostly through the private, nonprofit foundations he controlled: the Sarah Scaife Foundation, Carthage Foundation, and Allegheny Foundation, and until 2001, the Scaife Family Foundation, now controlled by his daughter Jennie and son David.
            </p>
            <p>
             Scaife attended high school at
             <strong>
              Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts
             </strong>
             where he almost didn't graduate after getting caught drinking off campus at the age of 14.[7] He was expelled from Yale University in the aftermath of a drunken party in which he launched an empty beer keg down a flight of stairs, injuring a classmate. Yale gave him the opportunity to repeat his freshman year, but he continued to skip class and flunked out. With the help of his father, who was chairman of the board of trustees, he attended the University of Pittsburgh and graduated with a bachelor's degree in English in 1957.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Casey was best known for leading the anti-abortion wing of the Democratic Party, taking the lead in fighting Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a major Supreme Court case that upheld almost all the prohibitions on abortion that Casey signed into law. He championed unions, believed in government as a beneficent force, and supported gun rights.. After attending Scranton Preparatory School, Casey turned down an offer to play for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1949, opting to go to college instead. He went to the College of the Holy Cross..
             </p>
             <p>
              Casey brought what he called an "activist government" to Pennsylvania, expanding health care services for women, introducing reforms to the state's welfare system, and introducing an insurance program for uninsured children (which became a model for the successful SCHIP program later adopted nationwide). House Bill 20, entitled the Children's Health Insurance Act, created the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) in Pennsylvania. According to PA's CHIP website, "Pennsylvania's CHIP program would later be used as the model for the federal government's SCHIP program. Legislation for the federal CHIP program was signed into law August 5, 1997 by former President Bill Clinton."
             </p>
             <p>
              ..In 1991, during his second term, Casey was diagnosed with hereditary amyloidosis, an inherited condition characterized by the deposition of insoluble proteins in organs and tissues...To combat the disease, he underwent an extremely rare heart-liver transplant on the morning of June 14, 1993 at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. The announcement of Casey's disease was made just days before he underwent the transplant, and as a result many accused him of receiving preferential treatment with respect to donor waiting lists..

              Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins, known as amyloid fibrils, build up in tissue.[4] Symptoms depend on the type and are often variable.[2] They may include diarrhea, weight loss, feeling tired, enlargement of the tongue, bleeding, numbness, feeling faint with standing, swelling of the legs, or enlargement of the spleen.
