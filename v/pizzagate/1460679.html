The guy in the middle wearing the J\' &lt;3 L\' Enfants-t-shirt is recognized as Christopher Lynch. He is one of the co-owners of Café L\' Enfants in Washington DC. So there\'s an obvious connection to the place he runs and the T-shirt he wears. Café L\' Enfants also hosts <em>La Boum Boum Room</em>... if you have followed pizzagate you will make the connection to another picture displayed on jimmycomets instagram; a picture with of a printed paper attached on the wall saying &quot;Cellphone use is strictly prohibited inside La Boum Boum Room&quot;. <a href="https://dcpizzagate.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/laboum.jpg?w=840">link to picture</a>
So what is La Boum Boum Room? Here is their website: <a href="http://laboumbrunch.com/laboumboumroom/">la bout boum room</a>
As I googled Christopher Lynch I found an interview with him at this webpage <a href="http://bitcheswhobrunch.com/bitch-at-us-la-boum-owner-christopher-lynch/">Interview with C Lynch</a></p>
<p><strong>This is taken from that interview.</strong>
<em>Christopher: It’s a French slang term that means teenage house party. It’s something that teenagers would do when their parents would go away for the weekend. Kids would invite all their friends over from high school, smoke pot, drink all the liquor, have sex in the parents’ bed. There was a movie about it called ‘La Boum.’ It was about exactly that: a teenage coming of age. Of course there is none of that at the brunch, but imagine the freedom of having fun without the parental supervision.</em></p>
<p>On their La Boum Boum-logo it also says &quot;A Pansexual paradise&quot;. 
Hmm ok. So Christopher Lynch is talking about teenagers and what they would do without their parents knowledge. And their logo refers to <em>a pansexual paradise</em>.  Seems a little inappropriate to me. 
If you look closer to their website, which I\'ve linked above, you also find information that no cellphones are allowed inside. 
This picture can be found on their homepage as well.
 <a href="http://laboumbrunch.com/laboumboumroom/img/4.png">La Boum Boum room picture</a></p>
<p>However, at La Boum Boum room there are burlesque shows and one of the performers goes by the name Deanna Danger. She has a blog. <a href="https://deannadanger.wordpress.com/tag/laboumboumroom/">Deanna Danger blog</a>
If you scroll down that page you find a sort of flyer where you can see a statue in the background that looks just like the giant moloch/owl at Bohemian Grove. <a href="https://deannadanger.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/electricforest.png">see picture</a>
Compare it to this actual picture of the owl at bohemian Grove and you will see the obvious resemblance. Keep in mind that the statue in Deannas image shows the backside of the sculpture.<br />
<a href="http://www.lovethetruth.com/jis_images/cremation_of_care.jpg">Bohemian Grove owl Pitcure</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.conspiracyarchive.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moloch-bull.jpg">Moloch picture</a></p>
<p>I looked it up: Electrial Forrest is a music festival held in Michigan.Bohemian Grove is located in California. So no connection there so therefor the symbolism in the flyer she posted may seem odd. <a href="https://www.electricforestfestival.com/">Link to Electrial Forrest</a></p>
<p>I then looked at Deanna Dangers Facebook page and scrolled down a bit. She is a fan of Edgar Allan Poe, the iconic poet and author. If you\'ve seen the TV drama series &quot;The Following&quot;  you know it\'s about a cult of serial killers. </p>
<p>I also came across a link in one of her posts on Facebook to an art gallery in Richmond, Virginia;  <strong>Gallery 5</strong>. They have a satanic logo featuring a devils head. Cool! 
And here\'s where it all gets interesting to those who follow the pizzagate tracks where ever they may lead. 
At Gallery 5 Facebook page I found a very disturbing image of a person wearing some kind of homemade pharao-mask, with the number 666 in the forehead and a actual pizza slice attached to the area around the mouth <a href="https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/14917053_10154747068442193_169732326416885537_o.jpg">Image on gallery 5 facebook</a> 
Is that just a weird coincidence? The picture has the hashtag #andrewhshirley so I clicked on it. 
I found another creepy picture <a href="https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/t31.0-8/15025550_10154771012957193_561850597935916541_o.jpg">Gallery 5 picture</a>. Notice there\'s a stuffed tiger on the floor in this creepy picture. </p>
<p>Gallery 5 is also linked to this page; <em>Carnival of 5 fires</em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Carnivalof5Fires/?pnref=lhc">Carnival of 5 fires fb-page</a> look at their logo. Illuminati symbolism all over.</p>
<p>One of the persons linked to this page is Parker S Galore. On his facebook it says that he is &quot;The ringmaster of Carnival of 5 fires. Ring as in pedophile ring? I wonder. So I start looking at some of the art exhibitions that are being held at Gallery 5. <a href="http://gallery5arts.org/newsitedesign/past-exhibitions">Link to gallery 5 exhibitions</a>
I came across an exhibition called &quot;The Candid&quot;, held in 2015 with artworks from Alex Beck. 
There I found this piece of art of a naked body and a pizza slice with the hashtag #dominos - remember the Podesta emails??  <a href="http://68.media.tumblr.com/8d01868e2612410f5e9bcace0e8009ba/tumblr_oenflpJCcj1r0v18co1_500.jpg">Pizza and naked body-artwork</a>
Here\'s some of his works: </p>

- This picture <em>Artwork 3</em> has the hashtags #grandpa and #nightmares </p>
<p><a href="http://68.media.tumblr.com/76b6e110ac3fa5c51d0fa97b28a20d0f/tumblr_o98vrkRNVA1r0v18co1_500.jpg">Artwork 4</a></p>
<p>You should really look closer to Alex Beck\'s artworks. You\'ll find loads of symbolism connecting both to pedophilia, illuminati, and - as I mentioned - even pizza! Take a look for yourselves! <a href="http://alexthebeck.tumblr.com">Alex Beck Tumblr</a></p>
<p>Another Exhibition includes video art from Jimmy Joe Roche -  You might also wanna check his webpage and video art. You find very disturbing connections to the pedophile code language, Illuminati and satanic symbolism. This is one of his works called basement bleeds: <a href="http://gallery5arts.org/newsitedesign/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Basment-Bleeds-2.png">basement bleeds image</a></p>
<p>Could there be more? Off course! </p>
<p>here\'s another artist exhibit at Gallery 5: Taylor Baldwin.
<a href="http://taylorbaldwinstudio.com/drawing.htm">Taylor Baldwin studio</a>
The number 666 is there in plain sight. Nice! 
And she has also made this &quot;video art&quot;: <a href="http://taylorbaldwinstudio.com/body.html">Video art by Taylor Baldwin</a>
- Dissection of a human body. Does it look familiar? We\'ve seen these types of references before in the pizzagate videos, right?  
</p>
<p>Ok, so the art is obviously satanic and bizarre but is there any connection to children? 
Well, take a look at Gallery 5\'s homepage in the about section: 
<a href="http://gallery5arts.org/newsitedesign/community">About Gallery 5</a></p>
<p>Hope you find this information interesting to investigate further. 
Remember that non of these links are fabricated, and when added up together can be interpreted as &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; that there\'s something very strange and dark going on here, hiding in plain sight.</p>',

           So I started my research/investigation from this well known picture taken från jimmycomets instagram account.
           <a href="https://i.sli.mg/JpF4XF.png">

           So what is La Boum Boum Room? Here is their website:

            Good snooping.... I think it should be pointed out if it hasn't been said already that these artist are more likely links to victims and may be adult victims themselves or have friends that are.  So it should be in no way assumed that they are perpetrators.  As noted they could just be artists with dark content and like pushing emotional buttons ... or ... they could have witnessed things in their life and this is their way of expressing it without outright talking about it.    Even that is of course speculation but i think if this case is going to really get blown open a real victim is going to have to come forward.
           </p>
           <p>
            My point with all this is really just something for us all to keep in the back of our minds. Clues to more perpetrators is good but if anyone comes across a potential victim or goes to an art show and sees this kind of work and has a chance to talk to the artist (in a nice way!!!!).  Just pick their brain about inspiration and see what comes out.   Because in no way should we be accusing them of anything and hopefully they are simply someone who has seen something and may even want to talk about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are extreme victims that will likely never talk but this is a huge network and it is possible we could find someone who escaped early or or had a friend that used to tell them outlandish stories about abuse or something.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's just the more i see these art exhibits the more i think these artist seem sympathetic to the victims. Almost reverent.  Maybe becasue they are creeps too but maybe because they have some inside knowledge of what is going on and have a desire to get it out into the world.

            Good research it seems. When looking at  Alex Beck - it looks not like he specializes in this kind of art though. His portfolio is pretty eclectic. And painting an adult orgy theme does not fit the pedo idea very well either. The most disturbing is probably the one with the grandpa and the child with closed eyes. I said it before though, artists do paint disturbing things, and many of them do not want to be decorative but meaningful in one way or another. Not saying it is bullshit though. Would need to evaluate it further.

            I really like how all the information is presented without the over dramatic hooks some researchers have been adding. Presenting it this way will help give the investigation better credibility to the new comers, who are needed to bring this information to more people so something can be done about it. Great job!
