            Evey person needs to go to their battle stations.  Load up and be ready because all of Hell is breaking lose! At least Trump wont go down  without a fight and something tells me he is taking a few big name Dems out as well.  Trump is not your pansy ass Republican who needs smelling salts every time a Dem makes a statement about the GOP.  Trump is a street brawler and it is now Game On.!! For those less physical load up on popcorn!

            Trump tweeted these tweets cuz Chucky Schumer penis consumer, and Nanny Goat Poosay lintlicker had said they did not meet with Russian Ambassadors, like they accuse Sessions of doing and they say he lied about! However, Sessions did not!
I agree though these Evil Satanic Pedos  need to be in Gitmo!

               I get that too. But I'm also super excited that the community is building things for research sake only. No bitgold con or "send money to help" scam (that I'm aware of) was needed.

            Perhaps it was a coincidence he named the Senate and House Minority leaders. Perhaps it was not, and is related to pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            Further, we do not know if it was truly the same FBIAnon or not. You'll notice all those arrests that were supposed to happen did not. That's not to say some of the other information given can't be real, but just a reminder that we simply cannot be fully certain that this Anon was the same as any of the others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, that said, Schumer almost certainly has pizzadust on him, between mentoring Weiner, helping get an Indian pedo a visa, and generally being a creepy, establishment crook who I could easily see helping Clinton Co. and making offers that can't be refused to those who threaten their little arrangement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pelosi is likely to be pizzadusted, as well, with Goat Hill Pizza and all. Regardless of anons and Trump's tweets, we should dig into both of them.

             On September 7, [Keith] entered the Washoe Medical hospital for knee surgery and died in the Intensive Care Unit shortly after surgery was completed when a blood clot released and entered his lung. The coroner's report listed cause of death as "blunt force trauma." Cryptically, Keith stated, prior to his death, "I have this feeling that if they put me under I'm not coming back". He is survived by two daughters.[3

               what do you do with a family dog who kills a family member? The dog was acquired to protect the family and instead it kills someone it was supposed to protect. The services of such a dog would no longer be required, to put it as gently as possible. That’s the situation we have with the DoD, NSA, CIA, FBI and a murderous array of government agencies, including the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission members and staff director Philip D. Zelikow are accessories after the fact, a felony crime. Selected elements of many organizations lied and murdered thousands of innocent Americans. Every member of the military swears an oath to defend and protect the Constitution, against enemies “both foreign and domestic.” Pretending that nothing happened after the family pet murdered a family member would be madness, intolerable, a “head-in-the-sand” absurdity, not to mention a constant menace for everybody in the dog’s ambit. That’s our predicament today: the overt and covert types hired to protect us turned and killed family members and remain on the loose and in power.

               <strong>
                Third, insiders are on the verge of going public. 9/11 was so “over the top,” so murderous, and the next event will be even bigger, that patriotism and conscience are working overtime among insiders to restore a semblance of sanity to our nation
               </strong>
               . In a hub-and-spoke conspiracy this large, most participants did not know in advance the scope of the planned “terrorist” event. On hindsight, some of the participants are appalled at what they participated in. They are going to spill the beans. Furthermore, virtually everyone across the world inside intelligence services, the military, airline pilots and other technical experts know full well that the U.S. government and selected outsiders did 9/11, not nineteen incompetent Arabs at the behest of a couple of cave dwellers in Afghanistan. Upshot? The dam is going to break, and probably sooner rather than later.

               Unwarranted optimism. Of course we want justice. But just think of the magnitude of the conspiracy and the monumentally advanced science involved to pull it off, and even the best minds in the world really have no concrete idea how it was done. This rogue group – military/intelligence? – just has to wait until we’re just a bit closer to uncovering the game, and they’ll strike again, and get away with it. But maybe incrementally worse. There are billions of us, few of them – but they rule just the same. Martin Luther King almost took the government down. Even a trial bringing out evidence of the FBI and Memphis police department conspiracy in his killing caused not a ripple. I’m just stating the reality of it as I see it. Is it possible humanity has come to a crossroads where justice is no longer attainable?

              It's likely that without the context of the work and research I have myself done, most people would miss it, would miss what I'm trying to write? All my work of 8 years got vandalized on Dec. 10 2016 . And a threat letter was sent in Feb.

              You might miss it if you fail to recognize what was really 9/11 and that the "War on Terror" is fake / manufactured.

He's saying all the Hoopla is not going to unseat Trump, that it's not Trump himself but it is all about who Trump has protection from, on the inside.. - who certainly will remain, but can be intuited to exist by the logic shadows / cues / hints which all fit together ?!

              What Steve P . said  just fits with what Morgan Reynolds wrote 10 years ago [yes, we've been waiting our whole life for this? Or at least since 9/11 was uncovered as a massive fraud - since the JFK? if you are old enough]
