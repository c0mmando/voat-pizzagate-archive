            Baphomet is an occult figure that represents the attempt to be equal to God. In this aspect it is the outward representation of the fallen angel Lucifer, who had been thrown out of heaven by God after the Great War in the heavans when Lucifer became full of pride and wanted to be worshipped. He was sent to the earth along with 1/3 of the fallen angels to wander to &amp; fro until the time of judgement. They could influence Gods creation (people) but at a certain date judgement would come for all to see.
           </p>
           <p>
            Baphomet is the outward representation of Lucifer's presence dating back at least into the the Knights Templar traveling through the Islamic world. It is well documented in history. It is the attempt to become God. This is shown by the adrogony or both sexes represented. 
In fact the Baphomet specifically addresses the upper female presentation and includes language about the erect line in the spine to the Pineal Gland. For those that have not been following the Pineal Gland connection to Satanism and MK Ultra you should catch up.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Baphomet also has a Goat head and other animal parts and has mystic symbolism. Aleister Crowley was a most famous practitioner of the dark arts...black sex majick. This includes all kinds of sexual deviancy of bestiality, pedophelia &amp; others to gain power or eternal youth (life) through corruption of young. To become God or beasts. Etc.

            Baphomet is not Satan. Let's get that clear. Hermeticists invoke 'him' as above (heaven) so below (earth) he represents the duality of all things, much like the yin/yang of Daoism. The pentagram of Levi used in modern witchcraft and onmyoji of ancient Japan represents the same thing, the five great elements (gorinto in Japanese). Rumours of Templars honouring the figure could be correct and could be connected Sufi Islam thus Baphoment being a mistranslation of Mohammet.

              I just saw your edited post. I fear it now doesn't comply with rule 1, definition of Pizzagate: Satanism/Occult as they relate to the ritualized sexual abuse/sacrifice of minors. Wanna edit again or delete and come back if and when you can resolve this?

            not that I'm an expert ...  but I think Moloch/Baal was a idol shaped like a cow that the Israelites and other tribes were sacrificing children to, by throwing via the outstretched idol hands into flames.  Baphomet I believe is a goat depiction of Lucifer/Satan, where Jesus is likened to the lamb.  Its sometimes confusing about Lucifer/Satan, according to the Bible Lucifer was a arch angel along with Gabriel and Michael and was called the light bearer (perhaps he was involved with the creation aspect of light?), when he thought he was equal to god he was expelled down from heavens to the earth and was renamed Satan meaning adversery.  So the two are different I believe, although I guess you are a follower of Satan/Baphomet if you are worshipping Baal/Moloch.

            Also some people think the Owl statue in Bohemian Grove is Moloch - but I think it may be Minerva which is a feminine deity.

            The email mentions moloch, not baphomet.

           <p>
            Typically you depict baphomet by the right and left hand placement,  to represent the left hand and right hand paths as well as 'as above, so below', you know, the significant parts of a baphomet picture. I think your picture as proof is a stretch.
