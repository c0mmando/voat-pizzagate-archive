             "The Ninth Circle was also said to have well organized and secretive human hunting parties that included pedophilia. Privately owned forest groves were believed used in the US, Canada, France and Holland. It appeared children and teens were obtained by the criminal drug syndicate Octopus, which was believed connected to the Vatican. The kidnapped children and teens were said to be stripped naked, raped, hunted down and killed."

            She claims that those who abused her worked with the U.S. government "in close collaboration" and (similar to victim who appeared on Dr. Phil show) talked about their skill at hiding their crimes:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             My perpetrators operated in close collaboration with the USA government and they employed sophisticated methods for keeping their operation hidden.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            For example, they allegedly used doctors to cover up murders:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I said I had witnessed Dr Petrauskas fabricate medical documentation to cover for crimes including murders.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Barnett mentions involvement by the entertainment industry as well, a theme which has emerged repeatedly:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The documentary team located Antony Kidman’s former North Sydney home at 16 William Edward St, Longueville. This matched the description I provided the NSW Psychology Board in my complaint against him. Via realestate.com, I recognised the lounge room and pool in which I was sexually assaulted by Kidman and his famous stage actor friend who is still alive. The assault occurred during a post-production party held at Kidman’s house.

            There seems to be a connection with Nazi war criminals here; not clear if this is incidental to the story or connected to other reports that governments have used them for intelligence purposes after the war:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             They discovered the identity of the man my siblings and I were instructed to call "Dr Mark". Leonas Petrauskas (pictured right) was the adopted son of a Lithuanian opera star, and he played basketball for Lithuania. (My Nazi war criminal grandmother was Lithuanian and friends with Petrauskas.) Petrauskas owned and worked at the Engadine Medical Centre on the corner of Boronia Ave and Old Princess Highway. The documentary team obtained copies of Petrauskas’ family photo albums, passports and Nazi papers. These documents show he was the Nazi doctor who matched the description of him I have been supplying to institutions for 25 years.

            She also discusses the use of a USA military plane for sexual assault of her by a USA politician. The article includes a sketch of the plane. Barnett notes that a 60 Minutes reporter, whom she mentions by name (Ross Coulthart) had difficulty believing her account.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I sent 60 Minutes reporter Ross Coulthart the information I had so far supplied state and federal police. Whilst interviewing my friends and associates, Coulthart questioned the validity of my testimony. He described my memory of being assaulted by a USA politician in the back of a USA military plane at an Australian military airport as far-fetched. Just what do people think international child trafficking looks like? If it is documented that the USA military and CIA have been involved in drugs and arms trafficking, would child trafficking be a physical or moral impossibility for these same people?

            Barnett brings up a connection with the UK government and use of UK government facilities for her rape and a pedophile "orgy". Here again, a connection between US - Australia - UK:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Ross Coulthart also questioned my memory that a Governor-General raped me during a paedophile orgy at Parliament House.
