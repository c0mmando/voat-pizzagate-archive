<p>They seem to use a mixture of Amazon Web Services (AWS) as well as other services:
SendGrid (used to send bulk email such as newsletters and other things like advertisements)
They seem to use a hosted email solution linked to (amazon?)</p>
<p>They seem to use a lot of txt-related records for verification (omitted because they can be used to spoof domains) to verify their domain for various services.</p>

            the jimdo.com will host your website, provide emails, and provide templates for creating your website. There are different modules u can add, 1 of them being a food ordering site-where I am guessing they order food. I also believe that is actually what is behind the login page. I don't think  they are hosting anything themselves
