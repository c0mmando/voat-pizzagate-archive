<p>&quot;What is the LGBTQ+ community\'s moral reasoning behind their supposed rejection of pedophilia, and how does that same reasoning not apply to themselves?&quot;

<p>Here are some responses I received: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This question is mind bogglingly offensive.</p>
<p>Pedophillia is a criminal activity that involves a person who cannot give consent. All I know condemn it.</p>
<p>Consensual sex between consenting adults is not illegal in western countries. 
Being true to one’s inborn sense of themselves and doing gender differently than expected is not a crime.</p>
<p>Consent is the difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Just in case you don\'t understand what pedophilia actually is, its sexual feelings towards children. CHILDREN!!</p>
<p>My question to you is why would you think someone in the LGBTQ community would accept someone like that?</p>

<h2 id="md-only-a-pedophile-would-support-and-accept-other-pedophiles.">&gt;Only a pedophile would support and accept other pedophiles.</h2>

<p>Unsurprisingly, so far, I have not received any answer that articulates a strong rational basis for their rejection of pedophilia; most of them are emotionally-charged non-arguments laced with veiled ad hominems. </p>
<p>From all that I\'ve seen from them so far, the LGBTQ+ community is a political movement, not really having anything to do with sexual orientation compared to their emphasis on political orientation.

<p>Among the LGBTQ+ community\'s goals right now is to hide their inverted satanic morality from the general public as they continue to include more &quot;minor-attracted persons,&quot; like a live frog in a boiling pan.</p>

           From all that I've seen from them so far, the LGBTQ+ community is a political movement, not really having anything to do with sexual orientation compared to their emphasis on political orientation. And with the lack of clarity of their moral stance, at least the Roman Catholic church has their moral doctrines plain and accessible so we can see how hypocritical and evil the Vatican really is.
          </p>
          <p>
           Among the LGBTQ+ community's goals right now is to hide their inverted satanic morality from the general public as they continue to include more "minor-attracted persons," like a live frog in a boiling pan.
          </p>
          <p>
           So when they say "we REJECT pedophilia," don't think it's all hunk-dory now and stop there; at that point, they're basically saying, "pay no attention to the man behind the curtain." Keep picking their brain and seek to understand what they really believe and expose it to the whole world.

            There is far too much in this post.  It makes very little sense.  Honestly, it comes across like you're harassing people, demanding to know why they're NOT pedophiles, and questioning their consent argument because of the line between child and adult is subjective?  Is this actually what's happening?  Or what?  Countries have justifications for their own age of consent laws.  If someone a paedophile or not is determined by if they're attracted to prepubesant features or character traits.  What do you think it's based on?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, this is probably going to get removed.  I haven't posted before but I've been here a while and anything not related to the global or even national elites gets removed.  That being said, I think this is fascinating.  I hope you'll respond.

            It's important to note that the LGBTQ community has been around for thousands of years. Since a man could have sex with a woman, a man was having sex with a man.... As much as it weirds me out, it is entirely natural to that person. I understand all of the inverted morality, or, satanic belief system that is so loosely tied to homosexuals - although I do believe this is a very old and natural phenom. Some people really are just born gay... There doesn't have to be any political affiliations involved for that to be true.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly I want to point out that although your intentions were good here, your execution was poor. Instead of doing righteous and unbiased work, you came from a place of resentment and intolerance.... I'm the first one to point at a transsexual and comment on how unnatural and weird it makes me feel.... But a huge reason we're even sitting here today discussing Pizzagate research is because of freedom. Freedom to say, freedom to do, freedom to love, freedom to hate. It's all equally important in the big picture... It is dangerous to broadly paint the entire LGBTQ movement as "satanic". Close minded absolutes like that will do more harm than good, simply because you are not coming from a realistic place of love... If you have a deep resentment in your heart toward Gay, Bi, or Transexual people you need to look deeply inward and figure out the source of that. Because although I don't agree with it, I'll fight to the death for their right to practice any form of love or hate their heart desires. It wouldn't be a free world really without those fundamental rights.

            The Satanists do not really care about "sexual orientation". 
They are f***king and slaughtering whatever they get in their dirty claws.
           </p>
           <p>
            I even would say, that those satanists, who are raping and killing kids in rituals are maybe not even real  pedo"philes" (like the nonces from sport clubs or creepy teachers, who cannot keep their hands by themselves)  - they are cruel monsters and addicted to power and adrenochrome. They would do anything to be part of the "elite".  If you read the reports by SRA-victims, you can see, they do not care about questions of  "sexual orientation". And the rest is MKULTRA.
           </p>
           <p>
            So do not blame gays for being allegedly "pedo related".

            I can understand why they get emotionally charged and I would feel the same if anyone equals me in anyway with pedophiles. You are trying to get them to admit that their logic of “born this way” should apply to the pedos as well and with that either accept them too or they all should be rejected. You won’t get far this way cause you’re wrong. And I’m a hetero in case you wonder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course we are all born and raised in a unique way. Is the serial killer “born this way”? Yes. Should we accept it? No. Same logic applies to LGBTQ community. Are relationships between adults in LGBTQ community ok? Yes, why not.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedophillia is equal to a serial killer. You literally went and asked that community to agree that they are the same as pedophiles.

Pointing moral double standards and warning them of its dangers in hopes that accountability and integrity can be maintained is "wrong"? Explain.

              You're making an unjustifiable leap between something people natural and something being acceptable.  Even if they are born that way, the issue is that they cannot act on their desires because it's acting upon someone who doesn't understand the significance, consequences, dangers or meanings of the actions.

            , what does this have to do with the abuse of kids by the global elite? Please review the definition of pizzagate linked in the sidebar under Rule 1, and edit your post by this time tomorrow. How exactly does this help us bust elite child traffickers? It seems like it designed to stir drama and discredit the mountains of research we've amassed here.

             I edited the most with more elaboration on the connection to the global elite. Is there anything else I should add?

               I am convinced that the LGBTQ+ community is a front for the global elite's advancement of a satanically inverted, anti-human society, merely masking the inherent moral dilemma that keeps the door open for pedophiles to gain a foothold and perpetuate worldwide nihilistic degeneracy.

              While I agree with the premise, you haven't actually supported it with any linked evidence. You need to show the facts that convinced you, not just say you are convinced. Maybe links to previous threads showing the gay movement trying to lower the age of consent.
