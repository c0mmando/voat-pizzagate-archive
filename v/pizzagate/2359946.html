* 2016 DNA Update -- History Repeats Itself: Twice now Boulder District Attorneys have mislead the public in the JonBenet Ramsey murder case.
On that Christmas night, after Patsy put her son to bed, something prompted Pastsy to fly into an outburst of rage against JonBenet. Perhaps John had begun to sexually abuse his daughter. Regardless, one form of destructive behavior led to another and at midnight, in a burst of anger and emotion, Patsy grabbed a nearby flashlight and struck her daughter in the head, cracking her skull. The forceful &quot;blow knocked her into deep unconsciousness&quot; which at first could have led the parents &quot;to believe she was dead.&quot; Perhaps assuming that their daughter was dead or irreversibly dying and that they could not save her, they set their minds to work on how they could save themselves. Regardless of this horror, neither was willing to give up their millionaire lifestyle. So John and Patsy began to conceal their crimes by staging the scene to look like a kidnapping gone bad. First, they strangle her, which both gets rid of her, and makes what would have been an accidental death appear to be deliberate. Then they planned to dispose of any damning evidence, but realized that, without evidence pointing to someone else, they would be the only suspects. So, if they were to survive, the resourceful Ramseys would have to rework the crime scene to point to an intruder.

            No her brother Burke killed her the evidence is overwhelming he did it he was jealous of all the attention she got he hated her and he was violent toward her previously hitting her with his hockey stick and he was angry she got a better Christmas present then she ate some of his pineapple bits in a late night snack he hit her with the flashlight then took her to the basement and stabbed her with a section of model train track the two small red marks in her body match perfectly where the train track fits to the next  section the two prongs of the model train track match exactly the two red marks on her body then he strangled her and hid her body and went back to sleep. Burke is now suing CBS for $250 Million because they exposed him in that TV special last year the investigators proved it beyond any doubt he did it and his parents covered it all up.

            I believe John Ramsay had been abusing his daughter and letting other men abuse her as well.  Patsy had taken Jon Benet to the doctor many times. Autopsy showed long-term vaginal abuse. I believe John promised Patsy he wouldn't do it again. Patsy was very concerned with appearances. Jon BEnet had issued of bed wetting and soiling her pants (which is a very good sign that sexual abuse is taking place).
           </p>
           <p>
            John Ramsay and his friend were connected to a child trafficking ring. One of the ring's victims came forward and described how the children would be hit over the head to avoid bruising being seen (as hair would cover it).  She described that the abuse of children would take place over holiday periods so that bruises would clear up before returning to school.  (Jon Benet was killed during the Christmas holiday period) She described that men would choke the girls to the point that they groaned. The groan that the little girls put out when they were being choked sounded like an orgasm groan, which is what the rapists wanted.  However, it went too far with Jon Benet and they accidentally strangled her.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the morning that the police were called, only one police officer turned up to the house. She gathered everyone in the living room and told them NOT to leave the living room. The police woman called for back up.  However, orders had been given to authorities to stand down..  Noone arrived for hours. When the police woman got tired of waiting for back up, she told John and his friend they could search the house.  John went DIRECTLY to little Jon Benet's body, picked it up, thus tainting the crime scene.  She was in rigor mortis. John brought the body to the living area, and lay down on top of it making loud noises like crying, but no tears were coming out.  Patsy gave him a look suggesting she knew that he did this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whatever happened, the police were told to stand down and evidence gathered was often secretly handed to John Ramsay's solicitors.  The orders to cover up came from the top.
