<p><strong>Criticism of Kalanick\'s behavior at Uber</strong></p>
<p>In 2017, it was reported that Kalanick had knowledge of sexual harassment allegations at Uber and did nothing.[46] In the same week, he asked his direct report,[47] Uber\'s SVP of Engineering Amit Singhal, to resign after a month for failing to disclose a sexual harassment claim during Singhal\'s 15 years as VP of Google Search, after Recode reported about it in media.[48][49][50] According to Reuters, he has &quot;a reputation as an abrasive leader&quot;.[51][52]</p>
<p>In February 2017, a video was released where Kalanick was shimmying between two women in an UberBLACK, before arguing with an Uber driver during a heated debate in which he berated the driver.[53][54][55]</p>
<p>In March 2017, Uber VP of Business, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Michael">Emil Michael</a> contacted Kalanick\'s ex-girlfriend in an attempt to silence her into hiding an HR complaint. This backfired, with her speaking to The Information as a source present during an executive team outing with Kalanick, where Michael and four more Uber managers selected numbered women at a Korean escort bar, prompting a complaint one year later, by the female manager who attended.[56][57] She also has since spoken to Businessweek about Uber\'s India rape case.[58]</p>
<p>On June 21, 2017, he stepped down as the CEO of Uber because of the pressure from a majority of the investors as he was seen as a liability but will continue to stay on the company’s board.[59]</p>

<h2>[20. [18]: <em>wiki: Klout</em>]:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Klout is a website and mobile app that uses social media analytics to rate its users according to online social influence via the &quot;Klout Score&quot;, which is a numerical value between 1 and 100. In determining the user score, Klout measures the size of a user\'s social media network and correlates the content created to measure how other users interact with that content.[3] Klout launched in 2008.[4]</p>
<p>Klout uses Bing, Facebook, Foursquare, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia data to create Klout user profiles that are assigned a unique &quot;Klout Score&quot;.[5] Klout scores range from 1 to 100, with higher scores corresponding to a higher ranking of the breadth and strength of one\'s online social influence. While all Twitter users are assigned a score, users who register at Klout can link multiple social networks, of which network data is then aggregated to influence the user\'s Klout Score.</p>
<p>Lithium Technologies, who acquired the site in March 2014, announced on May 10th, 2018 that they will end the service on May 25, 2018.[6]</p>

              Criticism of Kalanick's behavior at Uber
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2017, it was reported that Kalanick had knowledge of sexual harassment allegations at Uber and did nothing.[46] In the same week, he asked his direct report,[47] Uber's SVP of Engineering Amit Singhal, to resign after a month for failing to disclose a sexual harassment claim during Singhal's 15 years as VP of Google Search, after Recode reported about it in media.[48][49][50] According to Reuters, he has "a reputation as an abrasive leader".[51][52]
            </p>
            <p>
             In February 2017, a video was released where Kalanick was shimmying between two women in an UberBLACK, before arguing with an Uber driver during a heated debate in which he berated the driver.[53][54][55]
            </p>
            <p>
             In March 2017, Uber VP of Business,
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Michael">
              Emil Michael
             </a>
             contacted Kalanick's ex-girlfriend in an attempt to silence her into hiding an HR complaint. This backfired, with her speaking to The Information as a source present during an executive team outing with Kalanick, where Michael and four more Uber managers selected numbered women at a Korean escort bar, prompting a complaint one year later, by the female manager who attended.[56][57] She also has since spoken to Businessweek about Uber's India rape case.[58]
            </p>
            <p>
             On June 21, 2017, he stepped down as the CEO of Uber because of the pressure from a majority of the investors as he was seen as a liability but will continue to stay on the company’s board.[59]

             Klout is a website and mobile app that uses social media analytics to rate its users according to online social influence via the "Klout Score", which is a numerical value between 1 and 100. In determining the user score, Klout measures the size of a user's social media network and correlates the content created to measure how other users interact with that content.[3] Klout launched in 2008.[4]
            </p>
            <p>
             Klout uses Bing, Facebook, Foursquare, Google+, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, and Wikipedia data to create Klout user profiles that are assigned a unique "Klout Score".[5] Klout scores range from 1 to 100, with higher scores corresponding to a higher ranking of the breadth and strength of one's online social influence. While all Twitter users are assigned a score, users who register at Klout can link multiple social networks, of which network data is then aggregated to influence the user's Klout Score.

             Weinstein had nothing to do with elite child traficking, neither did Matt Lauer or the many human traficking of adults articles you allowed in here. You and Argosciv are both shills, so you can cut the bs as if you are doing your job.

             Kinda ran outta room in the main post, showing the connection between Uber and Klout.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The TL;DR/theory being:
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, I'm thinking that the Awans, Uber, Otto and Klout(et al) are indeed involved in the broder network of global corruption - that Uber + Otto + Klout is involved with the transfer of technologies(whole or in part) aimed at 'spying on' social media interactions and are related to other topics such as Cambridge Analytica, "AI", and Facebook - which takes us back to the 2016 elections(see email dumps; Imran Awan) and even the Obama Administration &amp; prior - with key people like Robert Gates involved, the subject of global corruption and 'terrorism' comes up again. If nothing else, I believe this does all connect up to Clinton/Obama/Democrat efforts to monitor discussions pertaining to topics which could cause them harm, up to and including topics related to 'terrorism' and 'pizzagate'.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some time ago a thread was also started in which discussion was held about UberForKids, which, for a short time I couldn't find anything about - apparently it's listed on their wiki, though. Although there's no direct implication that UberForKids has been exploited, I do still hold some concerns for it - considering all the elements(including shooters and seemingly isolated murder) surrounding Uber - it strikes me as a possible means of trafficking or otherwise cataloguing children, similar to what can be achieved via CPS, it just cuts out the middle-man mostly.
            </p>
            <p>
             With Klout shutting down soon, having been bought by Lithium, I felt it worth looking into them(I had yet to look as far as Lithium, most of the research in the entry in question, was done months ago) and found several hits for places/persons/events of interest, that are often and recently discussed in RoC. (Austin, TX &amp; [Albany, ]New York)
            </p>
            <p>
             Other recurring elements would be cult involvement in this, 3 cults in question being Scientology, NXIVM and David Koresh's Branch Davidian compound(all three of which have allegations of child abuse surrounding them, along with connections to politicians(d's &amp; r's) and cover-up attempts, espionage, etc) - there's more coming on these topics.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             I don't expect the above to be sufficient, the intent of the crosspost was to put more eyes on Klout before they shut down on May 25th, in case it does turn out that my suspicions about Klout/Otto/Uber/Awan are warranted. Can you, at worst, 24hr me with the 24hrs starting as of when the submission was published(meaning it would have 11 hours remaining)? :P

             <p>
              If you edit the main body of the post and add a line that explains this is PG related because Klout is likely another social media surveillance honeypot allowing the Cabal to gather intel on those they want to silence or target for trafficking, the kind of nefarious IT stuff Awan was likely involved in, then we can remove the flair.
