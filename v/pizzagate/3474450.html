            If you're looking for suspected Dens, the Oakwood Apartments is NOTORIOUS for taking advantage of wannabe child actors visiting Hollywood for pilot season.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             1,151 apartments in the Toluca Lake district of North Hollywood, is conveniently located between Warner Bros Studios and Universal Studios, and is less than two miles away from Walt Disney Studios and Nickelodeon.
            </p>
            <p>
             a Mecca for would-be kid actors, a home-away-from-home to as many as 500 young actors and their parents, all hoping to land roles in the new shows the studios are putting together.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Typically you hear about Oakwood pushing exorbitant charges for headshots, acting classes, and agents preying on children and families who don't know better, but I would not be surprised if worse predators lurked there also. It's pure speculation but still worth pointing out, the tunnels (Universal or LA river drainage) could feasibly stretch beneath this hilltop residence.

            I noticed the kid in the cage seems to be wearing a
            <strong>
             bunny rabbit
            </strong>
            costume, a reoccurring symbol within these realms...
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “rabbit” is not exclusively subjected to sexual abuse. This alter is also subjected to horrors – watching the other man get tortured and die.
            </p>
            <p>
             While many alters are sexually abused, it seems to me that “rabbit” is designed to be passive and timid, above all. It’s a supreme victim alter; not just a sexual alter (as opposed to “kitten,” which we’ll see in a bit).
