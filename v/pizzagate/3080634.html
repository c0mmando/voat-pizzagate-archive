            The Denver Airport gets often linked to the Georgia Guidestones.. because.. they're both Masony and both talk about the death of humanity and no one knows who paid for them.

            Why did it cost so much?.? Denver Airport would have you understand that its for an automated baggage system.

            When Denver International Airport opened on Feb. 28, 1995, (really pretty close to Walpurgis Night...) construction had fallen 16 months behind schedule, and $2 billion over budget. The final cost of the Denver airport was $4.8 billion 16 months overdue.. 16 Months before February 28, 1995 is October 28, 1993.

            The pope addressed his vast WYD congregation every day of their joint visit. On Thursday, August 12, 1993
           </p>
           <p>
            Im probably just over worrying.. Im sure that the Pope wasnt supposed to be at the great opening...or that he was trying to be in the area for when the Airport was supopsed to be opened.. right?

            Raytheon, like the companies that held the contract before it, based its Antarctic operations in the Denver area, and Bridwell says Lockheed plans to do the same thing and will likely hire on many of the Raytheon employees

            QUOTE : "This all started with Lockheed-Martin in July of 2015 after they announced they were purchasing Sikorsky Helicopter for $9 billion. They then decided to divest the bulk of their IT business--basically the IS&amp;GS division--either through a spinoff or an outright sale ..... ...On 26 January 2016 it was announced (Lockheed-Martin press release and Leidos (Leidos Holdings, Inc.) Leidos press release) that a deal had been struck to transfer the IS&amp;GS division from L-M to Leidos in a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction.... So what does this mean to the program? So far, not that much other than new logos in office lobbies and new websites, as most of the management folks are still in place"
           </p>
           <p>
            ***IMPORTANT to note: Lockheed Martin's IT division just disappeared into LEIDOS.. who used to be SAIC. and... the same teams, the same staff stay in place.. same old projects and teams being passed to LEIDOS No one is moving, the same people are staying in place.. so same methods.. no real reason why the contracts need to change then...Other than ripping off one logo on the wall to replace it with another...???
Its important, because. LEIDOS brings logistical "know how" on moving spacecraft. But the people already in place in Antarctica.. and in Denver apparently...

             Joan Benet was killed at Christmas '96 and I believe there was a post here a couple years ago that her father once worked for a defense contractor like Lockheed or Raytheon.  It was linked in the post to one of the Columbine shooter's fathers also working in the same place, I think.

             1996 seems to have been super busy in Denver!

              John Paul II was very interested in Denver in 1996.  There is even a big Center with his name on it in Denver.
There are stories about tunnels under Denver.

             So are you saying the Antarctic interest is re: alien technology? I've heard conflicting views on this, from UFOs to penguin pineal glands to Nazi research bunkers/genetics labs... so it is kind of hard (without much evidence to go on) to formulate any opinion beyond "It's cold!".

              That happened in front of a statue of Nataraja, the dancing form of Lord Shiva.  The term 'Nataraj' means 'King of Dancers'.
This cosmic dance of Shiva is called 'Anandatandava,' meaning the Dance of Bliss, and symbolizes the cosmic cycles of creation and destruction, as well as the daily rhythm of birth and death.

              its too late and Im too tired to do a full Antartica response.. Everything you've heard is noise and distraction.
              <br/>
              Who made Lockheed Martin and created the Antartica division.  Who is (was) SAIC.  get the information onboard.  Why does it have to be 'alien'.??   Who keeps saying '"Alien"?
             </p>
             <p>
              Its not cold in all of the Antartica.. (slap in the face n°1?)

             Supposedly a large underground facility under the airport.....probably able to find info ......have read many accounts . Would explain cost over runs and delays. .and it's unusual location away from the city.Have read that lots of experiments go on there on people.

             I was planning on keeping this all tied to QRV or GA...  but while diving into the symbolism between the Airport, Webb, Masonic ties... I came across his son being caught in some serious crimes involving children/pedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't have the smoking gun linking his son back to the Mayor/the airport, but I thought that was beyond a mere coincidence.

             A twisted history of drugs, robbery and sexual assaults? In which the cases were all dismissed because the victims either couldn't be found or they dropped all of the charges once becoming an adult?

             <p>
              At least one of the alleged crimes occurred in 2002, according to court records. There is no statute of limitations for sexual assault on a child.
