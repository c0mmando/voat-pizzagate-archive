            This is why garlic keeps vampires away. They can't tolerate garlic. That is what the old saying "wearing a string around your neck with garlic on it, or hanging it outside your house keeps vampires away." If they know your blood is full of garlic they don't want to drink it.

             Among the most visible symptoms of the human skin disorder porphyria cutanea tarda are disfiguring light-induced blisters that can lead to extensive scarring and skin discoloration. Individuals suffering from severe cases of this and other forms of porphyria may exhibit excessive hair growth on their face and hands, gum degeneration, and neurological disorders. To manage their disease, porphyria patients need to stay out of the sun and should avoid a range of chemicals that can aggravate the symptoms, including certain metabolites that accumulate in garlic. One course of treatment includes repeated blood transfusions. These symptoms, disease management strategies, and treatments are clearly reminiscent of characteristics typically associated with vampires and werewolves, and it is widely assumed that folkloric reports of such beasts may, in fact, be based on the suffering of unfortunate individuals afflicted with porphyria.

            Something somebody posted that I saved a while back.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Original thread in its entirety:
            </p>
            <p>
             As we all know, the Clinton Foundation was all over Haiti when the earthquake happened and that people of course went missing and rumors of organ harvesting abound.
            </p>
            <p>
             I just watched a video in regards to Houston and what might be happening there due to Harvey's destruction. I don't want to go into the video too much because it would appear to be too loosely related to PG, but here's how it's related:
            </p>
            <p>
             As you're watching the video that's linked at the end of this thread, please consider 
1) organ harvesting 
2) people shuttled to places of containment 
3) missing people 
4) blood drives/donations/type casting 
5) what we know happens to cops, investigators, and others who aren't in "the club" 
6) schizophrenia and how it's related to adrenochrome
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Adrenochrome is formed in the body, but we do not know whether more is formed in schizophrenics or where it is made, or are schizophrenics more suscep-tible to the effects of the aminochromes because they lack antioxidants or other protective factors. Future research will set-tle these issues. We need to know where the transformation occurs, in what quan-tities, and why. We need to know the end products of catecholamine oxidation and their pathways. We need to know which enzymes are involved and/or dam-aged, and we need more effective blocking agents which are effective in smaller doses but have the safety, and efficacy of vitamins.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Adrenolutin is another derivative of adrenochrome and more stable in blood. Hoffer and Kenyon (1957) showed that the compound made in blood from adrenaline (Leach and Heath, 1956), was adrenolutin. Leach and Heath found that the rate of con-version was greater in schizophrenic blood compared to normal blood.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             I know I may seem like I'm going way out in left field, but hang with me just a bit longer, and consider how many homeless people are alcoholics. Also think about how PG researchers believe that adrenochrome is one of the major factors at play with SRA.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Only three of the aminochromes have been tested for hallucinogenic properties: adrenochrome, adrenolutin and leuko-adrenochrome (5.6 dihydroxy N Methyl in-dole). The first two are hallucinogens but the third is not. On the contrary, it is a very effective anti-anxiety compound when given sublingually for some very tense in-dividuals, producing an effect within five to ten minutes. The evidence for these con-clusions is available in The Hallucinogens (Hoffer, Osmond, 1967; Hoffer, 1962). The reactions induced by adrenochrome and by adrenolutin are somewhat different. Adrenolutin causes changes which are more subtle, with fewer perceptual illusions. It tends to flatten mood more and its effect lasts longer. Adrenochrome causes more perceptual changes but they are rarely as pronounced as those caused by LSD or mescalin. Its effect may last a long time. It produced a two-week paranoid depression in one of us (A.H.) and a one-week paranoid depressive reaction with visual illusions in a distinguished colleague of ours.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Adrenochrome potentiated the activity of LSD in a few alcoholics.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Between 1954 and 1962 we treated several thousand alcoholics with psychedelic therapy using LSD, usually 200 to 400 mcg. In the usual reaction the first changes would occur in about one hour. Increased anxiety was usually the first reaction. Within two hours they would ex-perience the usual reaction. Anxiety would fluctuate but was seldom high or a prob-lem. However, many alcoholics did not have the usual reaction even with 400 mcg. They remained very tense and uncomfortable all the time. This group did not profit from their experience. In a few patients an in-jection of adrenochrome after two hours would, within a few minutes, bring on the typical LSD reaction. We concluded that LSD did not act as an hallucinogen per se but that it induced an increase in the pro-duction of adrenochrome which was the hallucinogen. An individual who could not make enough adrenochrome would not be able to have the typical LSD reaction. This conclusion was supported by our earlier finding that vitamin B3 markedly reduced the intensity of LSD reactions whether given before or during the LSD reaction. By blocking the adrenochrome effect it would also block the effect of LSD. It would also explain why Brom LSD, a very potent antiserotonin, would not be an hallucino-gen. Brom LSD probably has no effect on adrenalin oxidation and would not increase the formation of adrenochrome. These are interesting speculations. Perhaps now with increasing interest in free radical hypoth-eses and in oxidized derivatives of the catecholamines, scientists will direct their interest back into these areas.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe, in order to see the entire evil picture, we need to expand our manner of thinking and consider how PG involves much more than the children. While the kids are of course the main source of our concerns, the PG spider's web is vast and wide.
            </p>
            <p>
             For those who do not believe the adrenochrome angle of PG, consider the following taken from the same webpage as the above info:
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Adrenochrome and adrenolutin are hallucinogenic. We need more information about the other aminochromes. We need to know which synapses are inhibited, which receptors are involved.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Inhibiting the formulation of adreno-chrome is therapeutic. We need to know why the orthomolecular approach works.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              That the adrenochrome hypothesis is not destroyed does not prove it is correct. Time will tell. It does prove it is a good, testable hypothesis and will continue to direct research in future as it has in the past. Why, then, has it been ignored for nearly thirty years?
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              We may be too close to the subject to really understand the reasons why the adrenochrome hypothesis has been ignored for so long. It did receive a certain amount of notoriety at the beginning, but it was quickly shot down by American psychia-trists led by the National Institute of Men-tal Health. A medical historian may one day be able to examine the issues more capa-bly. In our opinion, there were two main classes of opinion: scientific, and political. The political opposition prevented any se-rious examination of the consequences of the adrenochrome hypothesis. Inadequate as it then was, it was able to direct our re-search in Saskatchewan for 15 years, and could have been examined much more quickly and thoroughly by research insti-tutes which grew very quickly in the U.S.A., beginning in 1955.

            Adrenochrome isn't worth shit by itself, at least, not in the context of it's relation to pizzagate and global trafficking/corruption/abuse.

            Was also thinking with regards to the artwork of Alex Podesta... those big white rabbits (apparently doing bad things to little rabbits).... who spends hundreds of thousands of dollars for his "art"?   More plausible is the sale of those art pieces is part of a money laundering program.... to wash money from illegal activities such as human trafficking...drugs...etc.

            Justin Davis is a ritual abuse survivor. He says they will beat a calf to death and then extract something from them to make a Viagra with that is so strong it makes people's eyes bulge and can do brain damage. He relates it to pheromones. Justin Davis was a master chess player so he probably understands what he is talking about. Too bad he didn't say more about it.

            is pretty smart on this stuff. Maybe he knows something.

             You heard of Viagra ?
            </p>
            <p>
             There a pedo version. Much much stronger than what you can get from a doctor. It has serious side effects-eye enlargement and brain damage. They use it on victims and some even use it on themselves. And just for fun they dose sex offenders with it and watch them go crazy
            </p>
            <p>
             It's made by a guy in New Plymouth. He is brother of Dr Quentin King of Palmerston North Hospital.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of the stuff they can do is really advanced. I try and explain some of it
They make drugs from all sorts of animal chemicals. There are many examples of this in our modern world.
            </p>
            <p>
             You heard of Pheromones. Animal Pheromones can be even stronger than human ones. The pedo viagra is made from animal Pheromones. Mr King is world's top expect in artificial insemination for cows.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's he who makes the stuff. His brother Dr Quentin King is a urinologist.

             Remember Ewen Mcdonald bashing the male calfs to death? This is normally practice on a farm for Bobby calfs. So why do you think he was doing that ? .....

             ADRENOCHROME:  USES, SYMPTOMS, SIGNS AND ADDICTION TREATMENT
            </strong>

            <strong>
             Adrenochrome Definition
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Adrenochrome is an oxidation product of adrenaline. It is a commonly used psychoactive drug from recreational purposes. Adrenochrome gained its popularity from by H.S. Thompson’s movie “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Adrenochrome is uncontrolled in the United States, it is considered legal to buy, possess, and distribute. It is not approved for consumption by human. There is little known about this drugs and its long term effects.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Adrenochrome Uses
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Adrenochrome is used for is visual and auditory hallucinogenic effects.  Studies have shown that Adrenchrome use triggers psychotic reactions like thought disorder, derealization, and euphoria. Large doses of Adrenochrome can result in paralysis, the user is complete aware of their surrounding yet unable to function. The effects of Adrenochrome, when taken at therapeutic doses, are much more mild than that of LSD.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Signs and Symptoms of Adrenochrome
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            An Adrenochrome user may experience euphoria, confusion, a change in train of thought, lack of judgment, poor insight and inability to concentrate. They will seem out of sorts, as if they are suffering from a mental condition, unable to function properly.
           </p>
           <p>
            While Adrenochrome is not physically addictive, users may develop a psychological dependency on this drug. They will feel as if they can not experience pleasure without its use.
           </p>
           <p>
            This begins with regular use of Adrenochrome, resulting in them developing a tolerance to the drug which requires larger doses to acheive the desired effects. Prolonged use at increased doses may result in the psychological dependency. Many Adrenochrome users, if not preexisting, develop psychological disorders. Adrenochrome addiction treatment is required to help them to successfully overcome their addiction and treat any mental or emotional illness.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Adrenochrome Addiction Treatment
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Treating an Adrenochroma addiction requires psychological treatment. Patients undergo extensive treatment focusing on their mental and emotional state. Most Adrenochrome users feel as if they can not experience pleasure without its use. They experience strong cravings to use again, during treatment they will learn ways to control these cravings.
           </p>
           <p>
            A wide array of treatment aspects will be used, including;
           </p>
           <p>
            Detoxification
Individual Counseling
Group Counseling
Family Counseling
Behavioral Modification Therapy
Chemical Dependency Education

            Hmm. I have an old PHYSICIANS' DESK REFERENCE  and an old copy of THE PILL BOOK on a shelf somewhere.   I reckon I'll check them both out for the word "adenochrome."  I also will run that 404'd web address thru the old Internet Archive, aka The Wayback Machine.  Finally, I'll skim the ole Podesta Emails for this.  You never know what you'll find in those emails, no matter how many times you look through them.....  TTYL

              .  I was just fixin' to get in there and start looking.  (Got distracted by some family obligations).  Anyway, I'll keep you posted.  I need to unwind from life so I'll do a little zooming through the Podesta emails.  These slang terms are very helpful.  In my house?  We don't smoke, drink, or take drugs.  We don't know much slang, either.  So this is helpful.  Stay tuned.

             The girl who accused Polanski of assault, well it happened in Jack Nicholson's house.  It just so happens that is where a tunnel from the playboy mansion leads.  It is rumoured that the snuff was filmed in those corridors underground.

            Pizzagate is now babyblood/babyparts/adrenachrome gate.
Simply called cheese.

            Google the 1972 Rothschild baby pics/party
Was adrenachrome the party favor of choice? 
Spirit cooking with who knows at this point? 
On and on it goes.

            And I know this is out there.... but who knows, truth is often stranger than fiction.   Here, Hillary spits out two somethings during a speech.   In the movie, Depp also mentioned chewing on an adrenaline gland.... I know its far fetched... but we never did get explanation of what Hillary spit out.  Not to mention....  the "news" was all over reporting about how Trump took a drink of water, but zero mention of Hillary spitting chucks or any of the occasions of her uncontrolled coughing during speeches.

             I watched her spit that out several times. To me it looked like a big wad of green mucus that she dislodged from the coughing fit.

              Could be, hard to tell... for all we know, she was gnawing on a couple adrenaline glands to keep her on her feet..... and here maybe she done ran out of the adrenaline rush and was needing another fix... lol

            In the effects listed on the now disappeared website was, with large enough dose, a parson can suffer temporary paralysis while being awake and in a euphoric state.   It too may be coincidence, but it would fit with the type of performance Lady Gaga was describing Marina Abramovic as doing... where she lay'd motionless while everyone did what they wanted to her.   Am just sayin'  And I am still interested to know what type of museum Gaga is talking about.. I've never heard of a museum like she describes.... and who are the "museum goers"?   Sounds like the type of museum old Alafanus had in DC.  If anyone remembers, there were photos on here from friends of the pizza place and even the architect who worked on that pegasus place.... the photos showed an otherwise empty room with giant wooden table, no chairs, just a drain in the floor and a rolling loft above for people to watch the action I guess.  And what does Gaga mean by "limitless" surely everyone has limits... like can't tell big lies, can't kill kids...etc.   Seems like these strange museums gaga talks about would be a great place for people to prove they have no limits.  Notice at the end of this interview with Gaga talking about Abramovic, gaga smirks.... according to body language... people smirk when they're getting over on someone... sort of a duping delight tell tale.

             It seems like the rolling loft was affiliated with a company named Foursquare but I am not sure. Foursquare hosts Comet's and other nefarious sites so maybe I am getting the two confused or maybe there are two Foursquares. I just looked and didn't see it.

              I haven't been on here in like a year.... but back when I was on here, there were photos of inside the museum building on the architects social media or maybe his website... they were from the architect or a friend of the architect or something.... they showed it when it was completed.   As I remember, it was a room with just a huge long wooden table and drain in the floor.   Someone should check that drain for human DNA.

            I found one page on the wayback machine that lists the adrenochrome article from a snapshot on Nov 12, but you're right, the acccount is suspended now.  Really weird.

             Yeah, I read through the one that's now suspended just last night.  I can't remember it word for word, but there was a page there specific to Adrenochrome and it listed its use, its effects, and the treatment for addiction.  The effects were euphoria... and it did say with large doses, the person could experience paralysis of the body while awake and in a euphoric state.
