<blockquote>
<p>Nygard also kept a database of potential victims through his company\'s corporate server that had information on more than 7,500 underage girls and women, the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p>&quot;Since filing a rape and sex trafficking class-action lawsuit last week, initially on behalf of 10 women, against Canadian fashion mogul, Peter Nygard, we have received information from over 100 witnesses, including dozens of victims, who have come forward with additional evidence relating to alleged rape and sexual abuse,&quot; Gutzler and Haba said in the joint statement.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also accuses Nygard of sex trafficking at Lyford Cay, a 150,000-square-foot compound he built in the 80s in the Bahamas. The suit alleges Nygard sexually assaulted most of the women when he lured them to the Cay for &quot;pamper parties&quot; that were attended by prominent political figures and law enforcement.</p>
<p>Former Bahamian Prime Minister Perry Christie, Bahamian Parliament member Shane Gibson and Deputy Prime Minister Phillip &quot;Brave&quot; Davis were among the political figures listed in the complaint to have a close relationship with the mogul and to have allegedly accepted money from him in exchange for political favors and influence. They were not listed as defendants in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also alleges Nygard bribed local law enforcement, at the time, to help him conceal his sexual crimes. CNN has reached out to the Bahamian parliament for comments regarding these allegations.</p>

              Canadian I assume? I'm in BC and have been tracking this. Very little in Msm and a bit in alt. If this scenario was focused on DT, Assange, etc it would be 24/7 I imagine. The web of connections are to volatile for upper crust exposure. If journalists dig into the will be black balled or fired. Ben Swann w Pgate is a fine example.

                Ben swanns summary was awesome, the short segment did enough for me to want to know more since he is, even if on local news, was still CBS and actually talking about it as it is - not debunked, not looked into nearly enough

               Makes you wonder what is really going on with Frank Guistra and his boy charity in your area. Same scenario pay for play with underage boys by wealthy donors.
