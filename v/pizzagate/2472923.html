<blockquote>
<p>Broadcaster Emma Freud has joked about wanting to French kiss her 20-year-old son during a conversation about when mothers should stop being physically affectionate   </p>

<p>Clarence Mitchell was a journalist for 25 years, starting out in print and then as a broadcaster with the BBC, covering a variety of stories including the Fred and Rose West murders, and the Soham murders (murder of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells), and Millie Dowler disappearance. As a royal correspondent he covered the death of Princess Diana.</p>
<p>After 20 years as a journalist, in April 2006 he joined the government\'s Central Office of Information as director of the Media Monitoring Unit and in May 2007 was sent to Portugal on behalf of the UK Foreign Office to provide temporary consular assistance to the McCanns. In an interview with the Portuguese press he said, “My job is to control what comes out in the media”.</p>
<p>(Bearing in mind also, that <strong>Clarence Mitchell is a chief spin doctor that managed to get Tony Blair elected and David Cameron in the UK</strong>) </p>

            Molyneux goes traces the modern pedo movement back to the patriarch of the Freud clan (while subsequently blaming Sigmund for setting the cultural framework which allowed both WWI/II to happen.)  It's a fascinating theory.

             'Just Watched It.  While I believe that Freud copped out on the theory that he came to, or the reason that the women were hysterical, which was due to sexual abuse, I think he chose to switch the abuser to the victim because he was an abuser himself.  I think a light bulb went off in his head and he saw the opportunity to vindicate the evilness that he and his fellow abusers were perpetrating on their victims.  He totally copped out and did the all time greatest switcheroo of the century.  In order to have all these pedophiles within the family it had to start somewhere.  I propose that this went way back in the ancestry of the Freud family and even before Sigmund.  We know that he did not just one day wake up a pedophile, he himself had to have been deeply sexually abused.

              Yes, that's what I thought too. This is clearly a thing spanning multiple generations in this family.

               Similar to the generational cults.  With or without the SRA it is still generational spanning generation after generation.  It really makes you get a Mind Freeze.  You can't even fathom how far back it goes and how it all started.  I presume there had to be a large problem within the Roman Empire and def contributed to it's Fall.  Then we have the Greeks, and we know how that turned out for JA.

             I've been wondering for a while how our world has been constructed.  And it's very interesting to look at Freud, the connections with Tavistock, behavioural theories which are fed into the PR and advertising industries.  Which leads to celebrity culture and the accompanying pied piper effect for the sheeple.  London is at the core of a lot that is rotten.

              it is mind-boggling how much of an impact, good or bad, a single person could have on future generations.

             Artist's legacy of sex and sorrow: How Lucian Freud's family has been embroiled in scandals, divorces and disasters as his daughter ditches husband for toyboy 22 years her junior
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Susie Boyt, 47, a novelist and style columnist for the Financial Times, is the youngest of the Boyt brood and says her sister Rose largely brought her up. She went to Oxford University but was devastated when her boyfriend died in a climbing accident.
            </p>
            <p>
             She is married to Tom Astor, a scion of the Astor dynasty, who managed the band Gorillaz and now produces films. They have a daughter, Mary, 16 and live in Hampstead in North London. Susie’s sixth novel, Love And Fame, was published this year.

            </a>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The appointment of Hugh van Cutsem as godfather to Prince George is further proof that in high society you are never more than 10 feet from an Astor — he’s married to one
            </p>
            <p>
             The Prime Minister counts one Lord Astor as his (step) father-in-law and the other as a minister in the Ministry of Defence, and the family supplied two bridesmaids at the royal wedding and have among their number an ex of Pippa and a friend of Cara Delevingne.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was on Lord Astor’s Scottish holiday island that David Cameron was photographed topless a couple of months ago, and at Tom Astor’s Christmas drinks party last year that he was spotted chatting in the corner with the controversial Rebekah Brooks.

            Broadcaster Emma Freud has joked about wanting to French kiss her 20-year-old son during a conversation about when mothers should stop being physically affectionate
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS should not be taken as a joke.  The Freuds have Serious Problems of Pedophelia within the family.  Clement Freud's Pedophilia is No Joke, He went to jail.  His wife was charged by a 16 yr. old with sexual abuse as well.  This has been passed down from generation to generation.  They should all be locked up.

            UPVOAT!!!  We cannot stop posting enough about the McCanns and the Freuds.  They Are Seriously Messed Up.  Posting is how we will keep red pilling people and we know that certain sites come to us for info as well.   I am going to say it again and will not stop saying it.  THE FREUDS ARE SERIOUSLY MESSED UP.

              I feel sad for that son.  But we must remember that he may allegedly already be a pedophile.  Yes Sigh, and also so very very sad.  They do not have a parental love for their children, only a sick distorted version of love.

              Unfortunately he will continue the Systemic Family Pedophilia.  This is what they do.  They keep infecting to keep it going.  They have infected so many I

              to think of the number.  It spreads like a disease.  Sigmund spread it to his children and those children to theirs, and on and on and on and not only within their families.  They spread it to students, children of friends, etc.  The number could possibly be in the hundreds if some where so horribly affected that they too have succumbed to pedophilia.  They care not what they do, only that  they get their "fix".   Vomit Inducing.

                Yes, and we know that even people that profess to be of a certain religion or follow Christ, that even they are followers of Lucifer.  The Jesuits come to mind.

            The Freud Family is really messed up. Clement's wife was accused of sexually abusing a 16 year old boy and he claims it was kind of a "family thing" that was accepted by Clement as well. He had no problem with it. His wife had a connection to Lewis Carrol of Alice's Adventures fame. She was enthralled with Carrol when younger. I found this

            This is a blog of Craig Murray who was a Former Ambassador to the US. Read it all, it is not long, and I found it astoundingly startling. Another interesting fact about Murray is that he swore that he was the person that Seth Rich handed off the Podesta emails to in a DC park. Interesting. Very Interesting. Read the article for it contains a small piece about Freud, and the McCanns and that is also very startling.

              Commenters on this blog directly caused the exposure of Clement Freud in the ITV story. I published an anodyne obituary in 2009 giving my memories of Freud. One commenter wrote:

              <em>
               He was a notorious old goat and his pursuit of young women could verge on the sinister. I met one of his young ‘victims’ who told me about a job interview with him turning into a very traumatic experience.

             </p>
             <p>
              And a second wrote the startling
             </p>
             <p>
              <em>
               Writing as one of his 1000s of sexual ‘victims’,
still surviving, terrified as I write for fear he is not yet quite yet dead – the man was an evil, conniving,
ruthless user for his own bottomless ego of all he came into contact with.
Our children – boys and girls are all that much safer for his demise.

             </p>
             <p>
              And that is just the tip of an iceberg of political and media dirty dealings that reaches into the heart of the broken Britain he has left behind him.

              regarding the freud#respond link, in the comments there were these two replies:  He was a notorious old goat and his pursuit of young women could verge on the sinister. I met one of his young ‘victims’who told me about a job interview with him turning into a very traumatic experience. AND another one that implied that "our boys and girls will be much better off for his demise".  Truer words were never spoken.
