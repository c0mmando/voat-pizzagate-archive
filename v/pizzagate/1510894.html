            She just released a statement on her FaceBook about still being afraid to identify those who did this to her: "In response to the Global Citizen article, many commenters wonder why I don't name names. I am posting a public comment here from the GC site: 'Please understand that trafficked victims who manage to escape their abusers are in constant danger and in real fear for their lives. Traffickers are highly organized, have world-wide networks, and often have law enforcement agencies working on their behalf. Traffickers have what are known as "enforcers" who will track down escaped victims with the sole purpose of killing them to shut them up. Former sex slaves have few advocates and many enemies, and are in constant danger of being murdered. In researching "When Half Spent Was The Night," I read reams of interviews with trafficked victims who were talking with law enforcement officials, not knowing that those very people who were supposed to be protecting them were working for the traffickers.'"

            Anneke Lucas is Belgian, Flemish actually, so dutch language. And I can find not a single article about her in dutch. She did write a book though, in 1997.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.literatuurplein.nl/boekdetail.jsp?boekId=37725">
             http://www.literatuurplein.nl/boekdetail.jsp?boekId=37725
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            We've got a big problem in the Netherlands. The Dutch elite has had a pedophile problem for very long. I think in the beginning(60's) they didn't kill the children so often. So, many eyewitness accounts and victims have come forward. The allegations made by these people are never addressed. It doesn't appear in the media and the state prosecutor just acts like these people are insane. There is no separation of power left in this country. The judiciary has been fully absorbed by the legislative and administrative branches. Everyone acts like it's normal that there are people publicly accusing our king and former prime ministers of these crimes and they have never even formally denied these accusations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like is happening now in America, we have been in that perpetual state, where nobody 'official' or 'on tv'  ever addresses the contents of such allegations. So how did this occur? Well, remember that there live more people in the NY metropolitan area than the Netherlands. For that reason, our elite is very entrenched. The elite is socially very immobile, as there is only a small space for them to operate.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are a handful of old, elite universities supplying their people to virtually every single key position in government, and virtually all business as government spending stands at 44.9% of GDP. Every detail of public life is controlled and regulated.  And as you know, university frats are where the initiations into the occult begin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did you know that if our dynastic King wouldn't sign a law passed by parliament, we would be in a constitutional crisis?
           </p>
           <p>
            Btw, Did you know the constitutional head of State in Canada is the same as in Australia?
