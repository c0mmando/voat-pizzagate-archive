<p>BIG problem happening right now. Transexualising children is having<a href="https://i.imgtc.com/DsSgpUZ.jpg"> a HUGE push on twitter right now</a> and they\'re using the hashtag #Butterfly and have made a TV show called <em>Butterfly</em> about transexual children. I\'m sure most of you know what a <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/V7gORJz.jpg">butterfly and pre-pubescent children together means</a>. They\'re using <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/v4fYxtD.png">this tranny push to start the push</a> for legalising paedophilia by getting these paedophilia symbols and child degeneracy into the public consciousness.</p>

<p>The shitty lib government is trying to pass a law that would allow minors to go through hormone therapy without their parent\'s permission. </p>
<p>Also, and totally coincidental I\'m sure, <a href="http://archive.is/YAuV1">the big UK VIP paedophile scandal</a>, that included the ex (and now dead) Prime Minister Edward Heath that many were expecting to explode has just been re-covered up and one of the whistleblowing victims arrested. This scandal involves not only sexual abuse but also murder. </p>

<p>They cannot consent until 18 years for sexuality, they can\'t consent to sex changes before. Children cannot consent because they are too easily intimidated or manipulated into behaviors. Presuming that the majority of \'child transgenderism\' is not a result of manipulation, this still leaves room for irreversible damage done <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/BDGDX1h.jpg">to children who were manipulated</a>. One will end up having to measure &quot;victims&quot; against each other. Which is worth more protection: the normal child that was intimidated into TRANS hormonal treatment, or the supposed TRANS that was disallowed sex hormone treatment? One must weigh also the economic cost, with transgender treatments working against the child\'s biology, however fascist or \'transphobic\' one might call me for pointing this out. There is an economic argument to bolster the moral one of disallowance. </p>

<p>One has to take the average behavior of children into consideration for the measurement of damage caused to them by adults; and one sees overwhelmingly that most children are normal - and there is nothing wrong with that, despite what resentment that causes. There are, let\'s presume, equal in proportion, parents who will force a transgender or prevent them from having surgery, as there are parents who will force, groom or manipulate a child into transgenderism. One of these are more expensive and it ruins the lives all the more for a victim within society. The normal kid which is groomed into sex change will suffer more greatly than a trans which cannot.</p>
<p>To the people who actually think this shit is normal. It blows my mind. How sub-human is the average fucking person?</p>
<p>You know what, I have no argument. Nothing that will prevent them from calling you &quot;bigoted&quot; and then you subsequently hiding away. You\'re going to have to deal with a government which allows any Jewish, Muslim, gay or transgender teacher, at any time, declaring your kid transgender and, if you don\'t comply with their \'treatment\', then you lose your kid. That\'s on you. That\'s your choice. No one is going to see you as a \'victim\' when you could have talked up about it now. No one is going to \'sympathize\' when you\'re called a bigot daily. You didn\'t fight, you didn\'t care, you went in your little hovel and said &quot;I don\'t care about the implications, I don\'t care about the consequences.&quot; You\'re the one that denied nature, the one that looked at the animal kingdom and said &quot;I\'m 30,000 leagues above that&quot; while denying the very thing you see as true.</p>
<p>You can\'t even protect kids, that\'s how pathetic to this supposed \'morality\' of liberalism you\'ve become. YOU refuse to look at possible bad actors in high positions of power. YOU refuse to see the possible \'bad\' in a conglomerate of media. YOU are confused how idiots could have so much power, while never considering their possible moral depravity. YOU let it continue while, when you actually start caring, you look around like lost sheep wondering how it could be happening. YOU defend your naivety with the same fervor with which they enforce yours and wipe your hands of it thereby.</p>
<p>The Jews really managed to kill off the best of our stock with the World Wars. Today\'s world is of a fully judified spirit, and the last great resistance to it died in 1945.</p>',

            Agree with you - Also, don't let the 'popularity' of the movie fool you. If you look at the 10 star reviews on IMDB, they are mostly 1 day old accounts. Not real users. It's just the pushers of this sick agenda wanting to make it look normal.

            Anyone with a brain can see this is engineered and they're playing the long game. Remember when 'Sir' Elton was found with borderline CP 'art'? I'm English and it was a big story at the time, few in reality were surprised. Fast forward, now the press pander to him and his 'husband' and their synthetic kids. I don't have a problem with gays who don't make it political. Dolce and Gabbana a gay couple know exactly why 'Sir' Elton has children. I think the statistics bare this out. But here, no one dares say anything, or you'll be arrested for 'hate crime'. It's a matter of time before paedos are protected by the UK courts.

            So sick.  I really hate that transgender thing in kids.  They just want to “belong” and join any group that will have them.  Likely adults too on that.

             Kids will do mostly what pleases their parents. I know a woman who has virtually groomed her little boys into being homosexual. She took a normal little boy who was into wrestling, transformers and so on took him to pride parades, getting his nails painted and so on. Her background picture on FB is now her 10 year old son with the caption 'the only gay in the village'. I said something about it, (I know her IRL) and I roasted by her liberal friends. The World upside down.

              Someone I knew posted on facebook mocking a "friend" of hers for accusing her of making her son gay. She asked her "gay friends" on faceplant if it was possible for a person to be made into a homo. Of course they all used the useful political fiction of "its in the genes". Not long after I had a weekend away with a group including the lady, and she devoted her time to trying to get men to do "gay things" including painting one guys tonails. Turned out she was a leader of a University group called Gay Straight Alliance or something like that. Absolutely obviously devoting her life to having everyone she could influence to be gay. Dressed her boy up in her clothes, got him dolls. Her friend was right. I know another woman doing the same thing, but not so extreme. Takes her son to a special ballet group where they dress boys up in Tutus. Another friend's new wife is divorced with a boy. She's dressing him up. Has him wear a beauty queen sash and tiara for photos. Guaranteed way to get rid of her old husband who no doubt disapproves. Disapprove of your son "being gay" and don't expect custody time. That's NZ, I would guess we'd be pretty bad for that now, I suspect worse than the US and Australia anyway.

            The other huge issue is all the shit and garbage poison chemicals they are putting in our foods that most of us are eating. They feminist men and androginize women. GMOs are bad enough but even the so called organic fruits and vegetables contain the spray residue chemicals. Soy is in virtually everything same with modified palm oil. I believe this is further pushing us all into something we are not, especially kids. Also to note, the little girl who was sexualized very young, Thylane Blondeau, is controlled by her mother in everything with her modelling career even though she is not to standard height of at least 5’9” tall and has L’Oréal contracts worth millions and was in Vogue magazine, etc, this girl has been in Kabbalah with her mother all her life with other “celebrity” and elite people in Europe. No doubt this child was passed around and made to do awful things at such a young age for her celeb status and moving up the ladder.

            Thank God this Judge recognized the problem and gave custody to the father.  What scares me is what in the world brain washed this mother into thinking her son at the age of 7 was old enough to make such a decision.  Frightening.  Thank God the boy is headed in the right direction.   Read the story it is a good one.

              It is an article from the U.K., where it isn't uncommon for them to refer to a boyfriend or girlfriend as a partner. This doesn't automatically  mean the father is with another dude.

               Whew! Good to know. Partner, where I am from, means a gay partner. Thanks for the clarification.

                Same here! If someone says partner and they're not talking about their business partner, it means gay lover. I only know about the brits because I read a lot of British news. It has always bothered me that they do that since it's not always clear if they're saying gay or not.

                  So it really is just a normal brit thing to say partner instead of boy/girlfriend? I wasn't sure if it was just the media who reported it that way or that's typical vernacular there. I don't know a lot of brits IRL to ask!

              This is all I could find the first one is confusing and does not mention a partner or that he went with the father.  It does mention a group called Mermaids  pushing gender dysphoria though.  This is a really confusing article and does not give me any answers.

              And then we have this one which proves my thinking.  Yes they are trying to keep us from knowing if it is a man or woman when using the word partner.  Look at this.

              The boy’s 40-year-old mother had separated from her younger partner within 12 months of their son’s birth in 2009. The pair initially agreed to look after their son cooperatively.

              AARRGGHH!!!  They use the same term!!!  Yes, THEY are using words that can mean either man or woman.  Sickening.

              I did not look up whether the partner was a man or woman.  I assumed it was a woman.  They are now calling the other person a partner no matter the sex.  It didn't mention the sex of his significant other anywhere in the article as I could see.
