            Yes, the BBC is participating in an orchestrated plan to change the language used about pedophiles to try and make pedophiles an "oppressed minority" and people who are against pedophilia "pedophobes"

            Victoria Derbyshire is the woman who interviewed Dicky Rearman, whoop mean Ricky Dearman (I heard he used that first name on his porn site, but don't know) anyway, the Hampstead SAR interview reeked of cover up in the same way the interview Megyn Kelly had with J.Alefantis.  Whether RD is guilty is for you to decided, but personally I think there is an agenda here with the BBC, something is going on and I don't know what evil is planned.  I guess what I am saying is I do not trust this woman, its just a gut instinct and my opinion.
