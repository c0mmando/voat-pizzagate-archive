             Flynn will be indicted by the end of the year.  Manafort too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those two are pretty much guaranteed.   Stone will be subpoenaed to come back to the House and answer the question he would not: who did you use to communicate with WikiLeaks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Stone claimed an imaginary journalistic privilege.  I doubt it will hold up.

              It is illegal for you to release info from inside a closed intelligence meeting. You just stated what questions he was asked and what privlege he claimed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Once again I would remind everyone RweSure and AreweSure are not citizen investigators in fact he works for the black hats in the government. He is not only paid by them he leaks information from inside classified meetings which is a violation of criminal law...
             </p>
             <p>
              He thinks no one has this figured out and has not saved and backed up all his comments. He actually believes he is so smart no one knows his real identity. He is wrong there are whitehats insiders who know exactly who he is....several not only know but are watching doing recon....not a good idea for you to continue...Mueller will not be able to protect you.

               I have never worked for the government, never worked in politics in any way.  I work in an unrelated field for a private company.  I"m currently at my desk with with some Famous Amos from the break room.  Mostly meetings today, next week we are planning the next quater and I have to do a bunch of powerpoints.  Taking a break from that.   Otherwise same old same old.

               OK.  I'll reveal my source.   It's Roger J. Stone Jr himself.
Look here he is leaking information from "INSIDE CLASSIFIED MEETINGS!"

               <p>
                Stone said there were "partisan clashes" during the session — and he wasn't holding his breath for apologies he sought from the panel's Democrats — but he said that members were professional and courteous and he was prepared for all the questions asked.
Stone said he did not answer one question that was asked about his "intermediary" to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Stone said that it was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist, though he added he would ask the journalist to release him from the off-the-record agreement.
Schiff said after the hearing there was one area of Stone's testimony where Stone would not answer questions, and that if Stone did not cooperate the committee would need to subpoena him. Schiff wouldn't say what the area was, though it had to do with Stone's description of his intermediary.
Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the panel's Russian investigation, said he agreed with Schiff that the committee needed to get the information about the intermediary from Stone.
He also told reporters that Stone's comments to the media describing the hearing were "accurate."

                </p>
                <p>
                 Anyway,  I instantaneously blocked X when I went back online.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I went round and round with X trying to be open and non-judgmental.

                 X tried to convince her audience that Trump was unable to fire Comey.  I started wasting my

                <p>
                 time. Told X that William Jefferson Clinton fired his FBI Director about a day before Vince Foster's
                </p>
                <p>
                 body was found in Fort Marcy Park.  X would have none of it.  And way back then as far as X was concerned:

                <p>
                 Do not Do not Do not say anything negative about Bill or. Hill.  This was prior to

                <p>
                 Nov. 2016.  Enjoy and follow X of course if you are in that person's vein of believing.  I am not.

            Lying on tv would legally be considered slander, the consequence of which is that you can sue the person for it, unless of course, what they alleged was actually true.

            You stupid cunts think this fight on twatter matters? You think some stupid tweet is is an attack or an admission of guilt? You useless cunting faggots need to hunt these pedo's down in the streets, not cheer because some middle aged faggot insulted the DEVIL. Fuck you pizzagate faggots are good for NOTHING.

            Don't laugh about some stupid tweet. These deep state baby fuckers don't give a fuck about your tweets. Wake the fuck up and give your heads a shake you goofy twats.

            edit: You're all faggots. You're just gonna jerk eachother off online with this shit for another year and a half tops, and the whole world is going to ignore this pizzagate shit because you're all too fucking stupid to actually do anything about it.

             I think it matters.  This 'middle aged faggot' was an adviser to the President.  He gave testimony to the Senate this morning, and called out John Podesta as a pedo tonight.  I think it matters a lot.

              Not only that, but THOUSANDS of followers saw the tweet and Stone's perfect response. People who otherwise knew nothing of Podesta's perversions will know about them now and in weeks to come (as long as Twitter resists censoring this particular feud).
             </p>
             <p>
              I used to think of Twitter as a trivial waste of time -- no longer feel that way, since when you follow the right people, you can catch important stories and updates that mainstream media is forbidden to cover.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since Podesta enjoys flaunting his sociopathic attitude -- Twitter is a great opportunity to shoot that F-ing predator down.
