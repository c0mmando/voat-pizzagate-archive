            Hi
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/MassTooter">
             @MassTooter
            </a>
            , thank you very much for linking this important article! Much appreciated! :-)
           </p>
           <p>
            We added a new rule to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            three days ago: Unfortunately, we don't accept link posts anymore. You can see the new rule below, it's also on the sidebar (when on mobile, please switch to desktop view).
           </p>
           <p>
            May I ask you to please repost as a discuss post? You can leave the headline as is, please simply put the link in the body of the post, and add the headline again to the body of the post. Should only take a couple of minutes. Thank you! :-)
           </p>
           <p>
            Or you can repost as is to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            . Sorry for the inconvenience; the community has decided by popular vote to abolish link posts altogether.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please keep up the good work!
           </p>
