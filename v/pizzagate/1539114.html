            From the title, I don't see how this is related to pizzagate.  Simply putting the word in there for any child-fucking/molesting does not make it pizzagate.  Violates rule 1.

            The only person who abused the kids was the boyfriend of the mother.  He physically and mentally tortured them into saying all this stuff while in Morrocco.  The children were terrified of him.
           </p>
           <p>
            That they suffered at his hands is absolutely not in question.  What is sad is that there are people that hold this guy up as a saint for what he did to them (in getting them to repeat what he drummed into them) and absolutely will not believe that that was all there was to it.  Even when the children said he made them say it and that they never wanted to see him again.
           </p>
           <p>
            He beat them, kicked them, punched the boy so hard he is partially deaf in one ear, held his hands over their mouths so they couldn't breath, made them kneel and poured water over them.  He also was found to have child porn on his phone, at which point he did a runner with the mother when the police came to the house to question them.  It was never mentioned if this was images of the children or others.
           </p>
           <p>
            The man was jailed 37 times before he met the mother for violence, lying and drug offences.  He was already cautioned for beating up one of his own children and also put their mother in hospital once.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a court order forbidding images and videos of the poor children from being put online for their own safety but it doesn't stop those who cling to this story as being true from plastering their images everywhere, for real pedos to see and identify them.  They see nothing wrong with that or the continued damage they do to the children.
           </p>
           <p>
            They will tell you the children told the truth but ignore what the children said after the police started looking into their allegations and confronted them about their findings.  They said Abraham made them say those things which was the real truth and all the evidence and medical evidence backs it up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please stop harming these kids further by rehashing this story and let them live their lives happily away from that evil prick.

             is norobotono a TROLL??
Exactly, the story changed.... AFTER the police interviews!!!  They realised they were in on it too. Bozo!!
You must think the children are genius remembering all those details!!  Not one of the accused 'OFFERED' to show a single part of their body as proof it wasn't true.  The courts secretly threw the case out without enquiry, very much like your Main Stream Media after a pathetic 'interview' 'disproving pizzagate without enquiry'.
You might think that defending pedos is good and they will get away with it but God has a plan especially all who hurt children. 
So if not here right now, thet have something to look forward to since evil is what they enjoy!! 2 seconds in hell they might change their minds but it will be too late, payback for all they did to the children.

              No, I am not a troll and am not "in on it" either.  I just examined all the evidence rationally.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to you and the remaining believers, all the school teachers, children and their parents, police, social services and any single person that questions the story is in on it.  You believe she was the only mother with kids at the school who wasn't "in on it" rather than there is something wrong with the story.
             </p>
             <p>
              You cannot fathom that the kids changed the story when they were confronted with proof that the lies they were telling could not be possibly be true.  You cling to the tattoo story and know full well that even if those people were examined and found not to have any tattoos then you will claim they had them removed.
             </p>
             <p>
              You ignore every bit of abuse inflicted up them by Abraham.  Why are you defending somebody that had child porn on his phone?
             </p>
             <p>
              There was no secrecy with the court outside of that which is afforded to EVERY child in family court, which is to protect the children's privacy. Something you care nothing about.  The mother was informed of meetings and dates but chose not to show up.  The court advised her to get proper legal counsel but she chose to stick with people who know nothing about the law and continually lie about events that happened.  A court case can only happen when there is evidence enough to convict a person.  The only evidence of abuse in this case was from Abraham and he did it in Morocco and therefore cannot be tried in the UK for what he did to the children.
             </p>
             <p>
              The court took the unusual step of publishing it's findings while protecting the identity of the children due to the amount of publicity.
             </p>
             <p>
              I want to know that the person being accused is guilty, not just assume that they are because somebody said so.  If I said to everybody you were a pedo does it make it so?  No it doesn't.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ever asked yourself why the loving and compassionate god which you believe in allows children to be abused in the first place?  Couldn't even make it one of the 10 commandments because property seemed much more important than children there.   How many more children must suffer while your god sits by doing nothing?  It is the main reason I do not believe in god because only something truly evil would inflict that onto a child or allow it to happen.

                 I would submit for a doctors examination in a heartbeat AND if necessary agree for people to see the results if that was the requirement to prove I am innocent of such heinous crimes. 
I have NOTHING to hide so nothing to worry about other than you harassing me on behalf of pedos.

             I'm not going to insult you. I found the videos fishy myself. However, the story as incredibly sad as it is, was very likely placed in the public arena for a reason. Why would the guy with his convictions, and abusive tendencies release such videos? He wanted attention? Was driven my some inconceivable insanity? Maybe. But what's more likely is that he was put up to it to create plausible deniability of any further revelations by genuine victims. These kids were genuine victims themselves, but of a system that knows no moral bounds to the manipulation of public opinion.

              You have hit the nail on the head with this assertion because once you look into this story (and another one from the UK about a girl with down's syndrome), you see the same dubious characters behind it pulling the strings of gullible and damaged people, which is a whole interesting story in itself.  These two were set up to fail with the intention of hiding the genuine cases.  Saddest part is how many were taken in by it and how many innocent lives were ruined (and still are to this day).

              As for Abraham, he is clearly a paranoid and slightly deranged individual, but is one of those people with seemingly enough charm and charisma to have gathered a (now somewhat diminished) following with his rantings.  Long term cannabis use can do that to some people.  He even drugged the children with it as the medical proof showed.  I think he was just used by those trying to promote the fake stories who latched on and inserted themselves into their lives to take over the public narrative.

              The insults will come from those who refuse to believe his version of events, who will not debate the proof and never will answer you if they would be happy for the kids to be returned back into his vicinity.  All they do is harp on about tattoos on the accused, which of course if it were ever proven to them that there were none at all, they would then argue they had removed since it became public.  They ignore all the other proofs and cannot be convinced by any rational argument whatsoever.  In their eyes, once someone has been publicly accused of being a satanic pedo, then it must be true.  When they cannot argue with the proofs you provide, they then accuse you of being one or being in on it... hence the comment I made about incoming insults.  It is rinse and repeat.

               Its great that you agree, the public's perceptions will become more sophisticated over time. And, although the system is cheating in the game, the time is coming (or ending) when we will see beyond the game itself, and start living for real. At which point, they're fucked, then forgotten.

                The story was definitely placed alongside other information deliberately by one Sabine McNeil, who works alongside the other dodgy character Belinda Mckenzie.  She lied through her teeth about the leak being accidental (she was emailing links to people for her google drive everywhere) and even after it was pointed out that the public could see the contents, she did nothing to make it private.  Now those children's faces are all over the internet and no amount of court orders to protect them has stopped that.
               </p>
               <p>
                There was certainly an agenda to push those two particular cases which have more holes than swiss cheese and never would have made it into a courtroom from lack of any evidence that could be deemed even slightly credible.
               </p>
               <p>
                Luckily some people investigated in depth and discovered tons of information about those two and their dodgy connections and figured out the game they were playing in promoting these ludicrous cases while ignoring genuine ones.
               </p>
               <p>
                So many people were taken in by them, gave time and money and still support them and will have not one word said about them or see the harm they have done.  Many of those supporters have been victims of abuse themselves which makes their preying on them even more evil.

                 "discovered tons of information about those two and their dodgy connections and figured out the game they were playing in promoting these ludicrous cases while ignoring genuine ones." Exactly, and in the process, the subject of elite paedophiles is more easily dismissed by the public.

                  Not so much dismissed anymore in the UK, but trying to get anything done about it is too far over the horizon as to not be visible still.  RE:
