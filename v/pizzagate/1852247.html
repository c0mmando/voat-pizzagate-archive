<p>I was just banned for posting several threads with some pretty heavy circumstantial evidence into Glacier dental and was banned along with many others who kept trying to repost those threads. Absolutely incredible. I have tried over 15 different Ips just to put out a everything is okay post we didnt lose interest were just all banned.</p>
<p>All the secrets of the world can be spilled on an anonymous message board. You really think the govt. doesn\'t control it?? LMAO. It is just a govt. test site.</p>
<p>Can anyone else confirm this? I remember this happened months ago and it died off. Not about to let that happen again.</p>
<p>Normally I dont make this many posts but someone has lit a fire under my ass after what I\'ve just witnessed. The banning, scrubbing I just witnessed on 4chan, GLP, REddit with my very own eyes has made me awake. Im watching shadow bans happen. All out scrubbing, 404ing, banning. ThiS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!! PLEASE TELL ME MORE OF YOU KNOW ABOUT THiS!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>HERE IS THE SECOND THREAD THAT IS VERRRRRRRRRRY IMPORTANT. THE PEDO MODS GAVE THEMSELVES UP AFTER DELETING THIS LEAD:</p>

<p>old thread b4 404. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1852412">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1852412</a></p>
<p>My appointment started at 3pm and i didn\'t leave until almost 1 in the morning! They INSISTED on doing work I didn\'t want done until i gave in. At one point I started crying and telling them to call my fiance to pick me up, so they INSISTED I let them put me under so i wouldn\'t feel anything. I woke up that morning in my bed with blood all over my face and no clue what happened. Turned out, they didn\'t even let me wake up from anesthesia before having my fiance take me home. THEY DIDN\'T EVEN GIVE ME GAUZE! I strongly recommend you find a better dentist to go to.</p>

            Not if Trey Gowdy gets in, together with Sessions (and their boss - Donald) can actually drain the swamp and the horrible aligators and all the slimy critters in it - a la Ben Garisson cartoon pic posted here (to great applause). But if he appoints say cross dresser Giuliani than we'll know it's all fake.

             Man, I searched their entire FB photos' commentors and likers. Found absolutely nothing. This lead was a bust, IMO.

            He is not a very good info source. Bill Cooper exposed him as a fraud back at Y2K. You sound foolish and slow on the upkeep. Anybody that has been red pilled know that it is a given that AJ is a shill and a gate keeper.

            Voat is a joke so you slipping in that Voat is one of the last refuges, is a laugher. Vindicator and Millenial Falcon call 9/11 inside job conspiracy and Sandy Hook Hoax, far out conspiracy theories. When I asked how they could think that when they think there is a satanic establishemnt pedophile ring, one of them answered, "I never said that". This place is a joke and it's not funny. But thumbs up on your thread otherwise. By the way, abortionburger is still gone and can still go to hell.

            I was willing to forgive him everything, after all he wants to live  (Monica Petersen, Andre Brietbart, Seth Rich ....) but apologizing to that demon is where drew the line. I unsubed him immediately and I never click on his vids. I have been his loyal fan since 2002. He came a long way from his End Game (I have a copy). As Trump would say - sad.

            PG was a conspiracy that was made for Alex Jones - but he has exposed himself as a shill. With regards to 9-11 he did a complete 180. When he had Trump on his show just before the primaries - Alex humored Trump on his ability to forsee in 2000 how Bin Laden would attack US! When I listened to that interview I sprayed my coffee all over the keyboard, I thought - are we back to this again!!! So we went from inside job (100% inside job - Bldg-7 case closed) back to the Arab terrorists. And now he has publicly apologized to American-pedo-psycho.

            STAY ON THIS..just a quick goole search in my town brings up several VERY shady pediatric dentistry groups...a further search adding the key words "catholic charities" brings up the ones that look the shadiest.  Free "sedation" dentistry for kids?  Isn't this the perfect op to rape or MKUltra kiddos?  Well done whoever dug this up!  UPVOTE!

            I don't think the same doctor being listed as staff at multiple offices is too strange.  It's common practice for dentists Rio wish for multiple offices if they don't have their own practice.

            Isn't Alaska where the owl abductions took place (mkultra)?  It's also the location of HAARP.
Tyler tapes hypnotherapy sessions with three patients who have the same experience: every night a white owl stares at them through their windows. Tyler hypnotizes two of them, and both recount similar terrifying stories of creatures attempting to enter their homes. Tommy Fisher (Corey Johnson), her first patient to go under hypnosis, refuses to admit what he sees and returns home. Later that night, Abbey is called by the police to Tommy's house, where she finds him holding his wife and their two children at gunpoint. He insists that he remembers everything and keeps asking what "Zimabu Eter" means. Despite Abbey's attempts to get Tommy to put his gun down, he shoots his family and turns the gun on himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            After hearing the similarities in the accounts of nightly occurrences, Abbey suspects these patients may have been victims of a non-human kidnapping. There is evidence that she herself may have been abducted, when an Assistant gives her a tape recorder, which plays her voice and the sound of something with a distorted electronic voice entering her home and attacking her. It speaks in an unknown tongue; Abbey, though, has no memory of it. Dr. Abel Campos (Elias Koteas), a colleague from Anchorage, is suspicious of the claims. Later, Tyler calls upon Dr. Awolowa Odusami (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a specialist in ancient languages who was a contact of her late husband, to identify the mysterious language on the tape. Odusami identifies it as Sumerian.

            3 locations within five miles of eachother?  I can only find the one, on Tudor, which is NOT a Ghetto of Anchorage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any info on the other two?  I'm assuming if only one shows up on google at this point, the other two were much more likely the sites of anything nefarious.

            , it's possible the banning and scrubbing is due to legal action the dental place took after they became a focus previously. Few site owners are willing to undergo a defamation lawsuit.

            Maybe it's a glitch or something because it's raining where I live and that's when Comcast connection is horrible, but I know for a fact that I've upvoated this and the other posts regarding the Alaska dental office only for my upvoat to be removed, i.e. my upvoat brought the tally to 53; a few seconds to a minute later my blue indicator isn't there and the tally's been brought back down to 51.

             Yes, that's them. The pictures were added later, but fortunately, the original thread was archived before it was taken down and they show up there along with the map. Take a look

             P.S. I had pinged you to a couple comments, one which held this archive, but it seems you didn't receive them. I didn't get your ping either, I noticed it while I was reading through the comment section just now. Weird.

              The G is a classic pedo logo - in fact carbon copy of the the template logo as posted on 2007 FBI page - declassified pedo logos. Just inward swirl part has been truncated (short) - nice try - classic Pedophile logo just as it was on Besta Pizza (before being changed) !

            In the back of that building there is a "Nova Aesthetic Medicine and SkinSpa" (closed permanently) They have (had)an interesting logo. As does "Nova Eye Care" right down the street.

             Nova is also a very similar name Novato, ca. Which is in Marin county where the coroner was recently arrested. Close to Napa.  I believe that thread was deleted where someone posted the story.

             Teeth, skin, eyes... Sounds like they could be harvesting, corneas, DNA, stem cells, etc, from corpses that have been scrubbed of their organs already, (sort of like a terminal station), to then send the remains to their final destination (to be cremated).

              I saw a youtube documentary (do not watch, trust me) about a 6 year old boy in China who got blinded by a woman who drugged him and gauged his eyes out - cornea harvesting in Asia is big - and it is global! Very disturbing video - I got sick, literally!

              So if there is anything here the dentists place would extract all the teeth then take the body to the crematorium.

              This place was brought up a few months ago I think on 4chan and the threads on it were also deleted.

               We research a lot of things at the beginning, the point being that is how we arrive at our results.  This story certainly pointed towards credible clues to warrant for research.  It is up to each person to decide I guess.  Some just cannot see the forest through the trees and Some are sticklers when it comes to rules, at the expense of the children.  Very unfortunate.  There is a reason it was deleted, with speed.  Quickly. Twice.  Whoever deleted it, is the cause of our suspicion.  That is what happens when you pull or scrub something that warrants investigation.

            The rate of people reported missing in Alaska is almost twice the national average. Alaska has the highest percentage of missing people who are never found.  So many missing indigenous women and girls that CBC did a special investigation. The cases  points to suspicious circumstances and other factors that suggest further investigation is warranted.
Many advocates for missing and murdered Indigenous women say these are exactly the kinds of cases requiring further scrutiny in a national inquiry.  Police say that there is no foul play, even when evidence suggests otherwise.
In every case, families of the women say they do not accept the findings of police. They suggest murder may be involved. Sex trafficking in Alaska is HUGE.  People ask fewer questions when the dead and the missing are indigenous.

             "Investigation is warranted" ...By who? The FBI? haha! The Canadian mounties? Is the establishment covering this up or trying to stop it? Does it not sink in eventually that the entire system is in on it? Yeah, maybe the cops or special investigators will end this.

            Don't want to burst any bubbles but GLP is a government run organization. They purposely allow conspiracy theorists (which is a term that was created) to run so they can steer thought and take hold of any truth being revealed. There are known topics that would get an automatic ban. Known locations most do not know about. If they are banning &amp; scrubbing 4chan &amp; GLP over this you know there is literally no steering room. You are white hot on the target.

            Sina Sena Ultradent Alaska looks like the person/company supplying their lasers. I've scoured every bit of their photos' likes and comments and haven't found anything out of the ordinary. Other than this blonde lady "Sina Sena Ultradent Alaska" who likes more of their photos than any other person, but that could be because she does business with them. IDK guys I think the photo association search is a bust, but at least we know that avenue has been searched, feel free to double check me, two heads are better than one.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: I'm still searching the photos, just not feeling lucky on this venture.
Good luck, stay safe.

             I checked through the FB photos and besides maybe kids looking a bit drugged up (which if it's post operation and they're just taking a picture for FB is reasonable) holding signs with dental puns. They're didn't seem to be anything put of the ordinary. I'll check Instagram next

             Edit Dr. Erik Hanson V. Is a surgeon in Mexico that is liking their photos on Instagram. He's posted some pretty graphic images.

            How do I screen cap in windows 10? I'm using Opera. I'm sorry, but I just got a computer for the first time since 2011. I've been on mobile this whole time until recently.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to point out that I haven't found anything out of the ordinary. Almost nobody comments on their photos and almost nobody likes them. I'm still checking every single person, though. Wish me luck and I did do a search on how to screen cap but it doesn't work. It's an HP notebook.

             There are also methods of "Fast capture" using Photoshop... dump "Print Screen" captures via ctrl + v into a Photoshop PSD that matches your desktop resolution. Or... identify a nice plugin on Chrome to do the screen caps for you.

             Keep using Windows. Macs are for leftist hipsters who have reduced their coffee/mustache wax budgets just* enough to wait in line to get their next overpriced piece of disposable hardware.

                 This is late and I'm sure you've figured it out by now but if you want to use the PrntScreen button on your keyboard you usually don't even have to hit 'fn' first, just click prnt screen button, open windows paint, type ctrl + v (or right click and paste) it will paste your entire desktop, then you can hit the selection tool in paint, highlight what you want, ctrl + c to copy what you selected, open a new paint window, ctrl + v and now you have your print screen without the rest of your desktop in the picture.

                  This is going to sound retarded, but nothing worked. Not even your way. I've googled and tried so many things now, and it's really irritating because after I got the computer I was like, "Sweet! Now I can share things I find on VOAT!"
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But, no, I think I'll have to get that snipping tool some other folks suggested.

                   Odd my home PC is Win 10 too, is yours the new "S" version? I would offer to team view you and see if I could make it work but who the hell is going to let a stranger take over their PC.

              My appointment started at 3pm and i didn't leave until almost 1 in the morning! They INSISTED on doing work I didn't want done until i gave in. At one point I started crying and telling them to call my fiance to pick me up, so they INSISTED I let them put me under so i wouldn't feel anything. I woke up that morning in my bed with blood all over my face and no clue what happened. Turned out, they didn't even let me wake up from anesthesia before having my fiance take me home. THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME GAUZE!  I strongly recommend you find a better dentist to go to

              A lot of doctors are sociopaths. They say that it helps to be one, because of the things they have to do. Combine that with a culture with so little disregard for their fellow humans that they are known for shipping them overseas in containers, and you've got a prescription for evil.

               I am sure I must have been shilled by him or his buddies - I mentioned Jimmy Saville and I got this dossier on Saville that looked way too professional - and desperate.

                  It was birdzeyeview I think and I thought it was JA because his Pegasus museum has that top lookout point with a view of the playground and surrounding areas like a birds eye view. Meaning he sees everything. Remember that google shot of the guy in the top lookout?! I haven't seen any posts of his for a while though.

                  I don't know it's him. Back when he was posting,  there was strong consensus that he was Alefantis based on the way he worded his posts and the timing of his arrival.

            Pedos aggressively infiltrate systems that have the purpose of keeping track of and exposing pedos. So I presume that 4chan has some well positioned pedos nixing anything that may have some real value to it, while letting the more wild speculations slip through. Maybe there's more than than this Glacier thing going on up in Alaska? Tip of the iceberg, to use a pun. So, they're not specifically protecting Glacier, but Alaska itself? As we saw with Comet, these places don't exist in a vacuum. There's a whole support system in place around them.

            But of course, being a child-targeting dental clinic puts you in primo position to abuse them. Be curious to see what their yearly consumption of happy gas is versus other similarly sized dentists.

            Edit: Yep, looking through your 3chan post, it looks like the ideal "one-stop pedo shop" set up. Like HH Holmes Murder Hotel.

             Folks, I just completed a lengthy response to Millenial Falcon re: post by NeverHillary as to why I thought this matter was a legit line of inquiry. His comments challenging the relevancy of research and my response are gone...in a matter of minutes.  I'm going to take that to mean he agreed with me?? I raised the serious potential medical/dental malpractice with this facility unless it was properly licensed and staffed to handle 9 hour surgeries. But agreed it needed more evidence re pedophelia or trafficking. I hope there are no problems emerging here as in 8chann but you all have to be VERY careful about smearing a legitimate business. You need some dental expertise contributions here to see if this is a flybynight, or a scam for government benefits and you need more than an artistic "G" to claim pedo relevancy. You're walking a fine line at the moment.

               They are the reason why I stopped posting here. I complained about one of them because someone asked why their post was removed and they told that person to fuck off....excuse my language. Then after that Every time I tried to post something it was deleted. And I would get the most messed up response from them as to why. This sub has been infiltrated for a while now. So freaking sad.

               I'm suggesting that the harm to the reputation of a business will cause 4chann, 8chan, etc. to delete entire threads. If a business has a low Internet profile, internet communications like these will push the story to the top such that customers will see the alleged controversy when googling for routine business info. Don't underestimate the power of the Chamber of Commerce Org to claim that fake news is harming businesses. You wouldn't  want a rumor going around on facebook that your teenage brother has sex with your baby sister, would you,  even if not true. Just saying...Otherwise I'm defending this case before the moderators, I'm just urging prudence.

                I think Epstein has a dental chair to keep the slaves in very good oral health. Remember these girls are used for the world's Elite. At their age you may have unnoticed  decay and wisdom teeth coming in that need to be pulled or just a good cleaning. They can't be sent to a dentist. They might go for help. And there are patient records and guardian records if you are bringing in minors. To me that would be the reason Epstein has a fully rigged dental chair on site.

                No it's not but dental offices can and do have dental chairs. Look I just don't want to see this matter disappear that's why I was urging caution, you had a mod objecting to relevancy and I defended this thread. What I don't understand is how and why our two  comments disappeared.. I had lengthy comment on why this operation was weird from a medical/ dental standpoint and didn't want to repeat myself, still dont. VOAT  is  a business after all and businesses respond to pushback. Don't give a reason for pushback and keep this case moving forward. P.S I've been to half a dozen ski resorts and all their business logos try to incorporate triangular mountain designs just like triangles are used by tent camping advertizers. Graphic designers  aren't thinking about pedo symbols.

                 Speaking of Sensorship I posted on twitter a rather curious article in relation to CPP being real, by posting an aticle around December, It was circa 1896 - about a notorious serial killer known as H. H.Holmes who had built a hotel next to the Chicago Fair - hotel as it turned out was built with trap doors, booby traps, torture chambers and crematorium. He had allegedly lured young tourists for his 'entertainment' he had killed over 200 people, confessed to killing 27. At the time the idea put firward by one detective seemed ludicrous. So I posted the link to the article and a tweet - right around time when PG broke - It got instantly deleted! I was shocked! 
Think about it guys. This is how desperate they are.

               Not true. We take down almost all of them, unless there is actual evidence -- beyond a spiral that might or might not be related -- of pedo-friendly shennanigans. Smearing legit business is not what this investigation is about; we don't need to be manipulated into witch hunting by deep state shills on here making disinfo posts.

                 That's because they aren't being flogged. Look at how this "lead" was presented. Mega hype going on...very sketchy "evidence" to support it.

               I remembered that very well - it was also the moment when Alex Jones distanced himself from
the PG movement! This was a huge revelation that also exposed the nature of $25 mil - donations from the Saudis to the Clinton Foundation. It was a gigantic jigsaw puzzle and got swept under the rug - and here was a dead give away: ever since Alex Jones jumped on the Trump Bandwagon he had been ranting and raving against the wahabists, Saudis &amp; jihadists! Well, here was a chance to expose a true conspiracy involving the SAUDIS - yet, inexplicably he put out a home video saying PG was a diversion!

             Like I mentioned before, I am being shilled hard by some shady individuals who put out detailed disinfo that seem way too professional for a typical blogger - they are onto us. I got trolled by an actual freemason on tweeter, then by his fellow mason friend who - get this - had a picture of a Goat as his prophile pic!

              Interesting, how did they find you on Twitter, do you go by GeorgeT? Be careful linking anything on here. Fucking Freemasons these psychopaths are everywhere it's easy to spot them and figure them out these days. They're such proud Luciferians, proud of all their ill-gotten achievements, no remorse for all the people they've fucked over to get where they are, their utter and complete lack of empathy for anything including their own family considering the oaths they swear to are over their own family members. Pathetic and sad.
