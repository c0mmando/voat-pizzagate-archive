<p>1) &quot;Alita&quot; is very similar to &quot;Lolita&quot;. If you\'re going to name a character with a Lolita-like name, Alita is about as close as it gets.</p>

<p>2) Her &quot;number&quot; is 99. Flip both and u got 66 which lacks only a 6 to 666. Flip the first 9 to a 6 and you got &quot;69&quot;, which is one of the most sexual number combinations there are. &quot;If sex was a number, it\'d be 69.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/69/">https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/69/</a></p>
<p>3) Throughout the entire movie, her body becomes more and more like a sex doll, or a prostitute. At the end, she\'s a somewhat curvy teenage girl with some shapes for sure. In order to accomplish this story wise, the new ancient-tech armour had to &quot;adjust itself to her subconscious image of herself&quot;, and her tits grew, and her ass grew.</p>
<p>First she\'s a shapeless 12 year old (around there) BUT mentally, maturity wise, she much older and quite shapely. This is a pedo-normalization concept, and it\'s introduced at a large scale in one of the biggest movies of the year. The are some VERY creepy pedophile references in that music video as well.</p>
<p>4) It\'s quite possbile the word &quot;angel&quot; can mean prostitute, or something like it. In the following video Bebe Rexhia is a &quot;liberated&quot; angel who works as a sex worker. &quot;I miss not thinking about you&quot;. (quote from the video, as said after a traumatic rape)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTNnwzXrVdg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTNnwzXrVdg</a></p>
<p>5) In a more subtler fashion, the main guy, the one who built her, becomes quite jealous when a younger boy walks up to her and starts interacting with her. Right when she wakes up, he stares at her longingly and puts a tangerine-piece in his mouth and sucks the juice out of it. There is a creepy vibe about him the whole movie.</p>
<p>6) The main boy, who Alita likes and we have sympathy for, actually takes down cyborgs, rips out organs (parts) and sell them on the black market. But we only found this out AFTER we have started liking him. Clearly introducing organ trafficking at concept level to the masses. But the good guy is doing it just to survive, right!</p>
<p>You can watch the movie and verify everything I\'m saying. These are the main points.</p>',

            I mean this Japanese comic has existed since the 90's and since  it's an anime it's definitely about sexualizing women...  Not sure what you were expecting.  They almost all are.  Japanese perversion is legendary.

            The name 'Alita' means something in the lines of "chosen", "noble", "winged", "truth". The 'angel' part of 'Battle Angel' might just refer to the name itself. You could also make the argument that men should be attracted to artificial girls in order to reproduce less.
