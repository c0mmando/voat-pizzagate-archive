            Reported as Fake News. I don't know what's happened to this place but it's gone straight down hill. Any fucking retard knows the queen didn't make any such speech.

            Yes, the Canadian Residential Schools propped up by the UK Monarchy, the United Church of Canada and the Roman Catholic Church of Canada have yet to pay for this program that ended in 1996. De-nativisation was the primary goal and to do so, they required child traffickers to take the children of natives in Canada by force, supported by the RCMP etc. This mostly happened out west, but also in northern Ontario. I kept looking at a site exposing the progress behind some international court but I stopped looking at it, I forget what the site was now, because nothing was happening on time, but key witnesses like the native guy in BC who was very ill, at 59 year old, lying in a hospital bed, he was medicated enough that he was fit to testify some day but he somehow died of "unknown reasons" the night before he was going to testify about the Queen and Prince Phillip who came to the residential school he was at when he was 10, and they had some kind of seemingly innocent bonfire with all the kids of that school, but the next day, they picked 10 kids and brought them in their plane and went off, he was going to tell about this, right during the Residential School inquiries. That's the most disgusting thing in Canada's history, actual subpoenas were served to a group of people who had exhumed a lot of kids bones on the land of 2 residential schools, proving mass graves were likely on all of those schools terrain, but they had be quashed by the subpoena dictating them to stop excavating ex-resident schools terrain...

            How did those who wrote the article find out that she said these things? If the BBC did not show it, who is supposedly the one who was there to tell us this happened? Zero evidence makes this story worthless.

            She supposedly did a similar message 2015 Christmas, where she said many people would not make it to the next Christmas.. Or so we were told. Seems like Propaganda to me. She's not contrite about anything. Be logical.

             The day she got to the school, I was part of a group of kids that went on a picnic with the Queen and her husband and school officials, down to a meadow near Dead Man’s Creek. After awhile, I saw the Queen leave that picnic with ten children from the school, and those children never returned. We never heard anything more about them and never saw them again even when we were older. They were all from around there but they all vanished.

             Witness to murder at Indian Residential School
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Irene Favel describes in a CBC interview (July 8, 2008) how she witnessed the murder of a baby by staff at the Muskowekwan Indian Residential School, run by the Roman Catholic Church in Lestock, Saskatchewan.

           </p>
           <p>
            I’m Irene Favel. I’m seventy five. I went to residential school in Muscowequan from 1944 to 1949, and I had a rough life. I was mistreated in every way. There was a young girl, and she was pregnant from a priest there. And what they did, she had her baby, and they took the baby, and wrapped it up in a nice pink outfit, and they took it downstairs where I was cooking dinner with the nun. And they took the baby into the furnace room, and they threw that little baby in there and burned it alive. All you could hear was this little cry, like “Uuh!”, and that was it. You could smell that flesh cooking….
