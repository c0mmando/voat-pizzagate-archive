</p>
<p>&quot;William Sanford &quot;Bill&quot; Nye[2] (born November 27, 1955), popularly known as Bill Nye the Science Guy, is an American science educator, television presenter, and mechanical engineer. He is best known as the host of the PBS children\'s science show Bill Nye the Science Guy (1993–1998), and for his many subsequent appearances in popular media as a science educator. Currently, he is the CEO of The Planetary Society and host of the Netflix series Bill Nye Saves the World.&quot;</p>
<p>[<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nye">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Nye</a>]</p>
<p>Notice he had a kids show in the 1990s.  He is also a &quot;spokesperson&quot; type personality along with Neil de Grasse Tyson for NASA.  
</p>
<p>Now, Bill Nye apparently has a new show, and the following article reveals a musical act he had on the show. I find the lyrics and video quite disturbing. I have bolded items that stood out to me as referencing PizzaGate, pedophilia normalization and possibly spirit cooking. I will warn you now that the song is full of disgusting sexual references.</p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/15674/watch-bill-nye-destroys-whats-left-his-credibility-amanda-prestigiacomo">http://www.dailywire.com/news/15674/watch-bill-nye-destroys-whats-left-his-credibility-amanda-prestigiacomo</a>]</p>
<p>From the article:  
</p>
<p>&quot;Airing on his new Netflix special called Bill Nye Saves The World, the Not A Scientist Guy and hero of the Left featured the world\'s most insane, anti-science segment about sexuality and gender performed by a sitcom actress, who are, of course, famous for their <strong>extensive knowledge of biology</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>The performance by Crazy Ex-Girlfriend actress Rachel Bloom.</p>
<p>See the full lyrics of the performance, below:</p>
<p>This world of ours is full of choice</p>
<p>But must I choose between only John or Joyce?</p>
<p>Are my options only hard or moist?</p>
<p>My vagina has its own voice</p>
<p>Not vocal cords, a metaphorical voice</p>
<p>Sometimes I do a voice for my vagina</p>
<p>Please don\'t tell me I\'m the only one who does that</p>
<p>\'Cause my sex junk is so oh, oh, oh</p>
<p>Much more than either or, or, or</p>
<p>Power bottom or power top</p>
<p>Versatile love may have some butt stuff</p>
<p>It\'s <strong>evolution</strong>, ain\'t nothing new</p>
<p><strong>There\'s nothing taboo about a sex stew</strong></p>
<p><strong>Just add salt or Gerard Depardieu</strong></p>
<p>French treasure</p>
<p>\'Cause my sex junk is so oh, oh, oh</p>
<p>Much more than either or, or, or</p>
<p><strong>If they\'re alive</strong> I\'ll date \'em</p>
<p>Channing or Jenna Tatum</p>
<p>I\'m down for anything</p>
<p>Don\'t box in my box</p>
<p>Give someone new a handy</p>
<p>Then give yourself props</p>
<p>(Male voice: Oh you think you\'re so smart, did you learn gay in college?)</p>
<p>Chill with all of that while I drop some knowledge</p>
<p><strong>Sexuality\'s a spectrum</strong></p>
<p><strong>Everyone is on it</strong></p>
<p>Even you might like it if you sit up on it</p>
<p>Drag queen, drag king, just do what feels right</p>
<p>You\'re tall pansexual, flirty wood sprite</p>
<p>Who enjoys a fleshlight in the cold moonlight?</p>
<p>(Male voice: With a sad clown Skyping via satellite?)</p>
<p><strong>Damn skippy, home slice,</strong></p>
<p>Sing it with me all night</p>
<p><strong>Sex how you want it, it\'s your goddamn right</strong></p>
<p>\'Cause my sex junk is so oh, oh, oh</p>
<p>Much more than either or, or, or</p>
<p>Get off your soapbox</p>
<p>Get off your soapbox</p>
<p>My sex junk\'s better than bagels with lox</p>
<p>With lots of schmear</p>
<hr />
<p>I can\'t help but think of Podesta when I hear <strong>Skippy</strong> now. And with &quot;home slice&quot; right after it?</p>
<p>I also looked up <strong>Gerard Depardieu</strong> since I wasn\'t aware of him, and I found this article:</p>
<p>[<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Gerard%20Depardieu">https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Gerard%20Depardieu</a>]</p>
<p>French actor Gerard Depardieu reveals prostitution past | Fox News</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&quot;Among Depardieu\'s confessions, he recalls his mother\'s repeated tale of her attempts to abort him, telling her son &quot;And to think I almost killed you.&quot;</p>
<p>Depardieu, who rose to fame for his role in the 1990 romantic comedy &quot;Green Card&quot; alongside Andie MacDowell, wrote that his family was so poor he began to work as a prostitute at the young age of 10.</p>
<p>&quot;I\'ve known since I was very young that I please homosexuals,&quot; he wrote in his autobiography &quot;It Happened Like That&quot; (Ce c\'est fait comme ca). &quot;I would ask them for money.&quot;</p>
<p>He also admitted to helping an acquaintance dig up newly buried bodies in cemeteries to steal their shoes and jewelry.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>I believe the only way he would know that he pleases homosexuals at 10 years old would be if homosexuals were grooming and molesting him.  He wouldn\'t realize that unless there were men taking advantage of him. </p>
<hr />
<p>Here is another skit I found from &quot;Bill Nye Saves the World&quot; show about &quot;Ice Cream Sexuality.&quot;  Given the PizzaGate code words we have uncovered, this video is particularly disturbing.  I believe it also has racism/white privilege in it, with an orgy of all the ice cream and &quot;nuts&quot; at the end.  
</p>
<p>Given the food references PG has uncovered, and what seems to be the obvious targeting of children for these videos with their cartoon nature, I feel it\'s important this be exposed.

            I agree with you totally. I think we need a real hero, not one of these fake neo maxi types like Spencer or Duke. We just need an American, doesn't matter who it is... doesn't need to be over the top like AJ, just an American who can see what's going on and will speak the truth about it.

            Yes I agree, the 'Skippy' and 'home slice' (pizza) This 'song' is blatant and disgusting. The ice cream one is very disturbing: (1) 'meet you at the bowl' - reports about the Superbowl being the biggest human trafficking date of the year, (2) -  in the 'bowl' it is a checkered base/floor, I don't know of any tin-foil food-container that are checkered on the bottom, a deliberate symbol used. (3) -  'big ice cream in the sky help me'.  Mocking God, showing that asking, no help will come (4) - I see the white supremacy card being played when the vanilla is acting pios, as though hes better than all the rest.   - ALL of this is VERY disturbing!  Its like they are admitting everything in these 2 songs so they can shove it in our faces, then they will say we are the ones who see things where there is nothing.

             Those are exactly the types of signs and symbols that disturbed me about the songs.  It's just so blatant, I can't believe it.  And yes, they will call us crazy for seeing the patterns.

             I think "Hollywood" is one of the biggest things that's been exposed by PizzaGate.  So many things we thought were benign are absolutely not benign and not a "coincidence."
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm starting to think "skippy" has a much larger reference that we haven't uncovered yet..

              I think you are on to something there with the 'Skippy' thing.  We should look into it, because if it was just a 'nickname' it would not really be mentioned in this song?  I am going to check :)  -  Lets keep digging!

               Skippy
              </p>
              <p>
               Name of a prominent Australian bush kangaroo popularized in 60's TV adventure show.
              </p>
              <p>
               The media were unaware that, despite being married, Skippy was a lesbian. No great surprise, she being a "bush" kangaroo.

               Cheap-ass shoes. This term circa 1997. Kids who wore "skippies" were teased relentlessly at the summer camp I went to. Also, the "skip-aa" pronunciation does not apply to this definition.
              </p>
              <p>
               "Skippies... they make your feet feel fine, skippies, they cost a dollar ninety-nine." I don't know if this was an actual advertising jingle or not.

                 A term used to describe somthing that is really cheesy, flimsy or cheap. This particular definintion of the word was developed from the poor kids of the late nineteen seventies and early eighties whose families could not afford Nike or Converse sneakers. Instead, they were left with no choice but to wear "Skippies." Skippies were a generic blue sneaker usually with three stripes on the sides(number of stripes varied from 2-4). Skippies were available at budget minded stores such as K-Mart or Spags. Within the store, Skippies could be found tied together(no box or packaging)piled loosein bins often located in the isle. Skippies were of poor quality and fell apart quickly. Their appearance was cheap queer or gay. Hence anything cheap, flimsy or generic in nature can be called skippy. Or, if something looks cheesy or gay it canbe reffered to as "Skippy"

               also known as the white devil, or fluffy devil. A white male cat that has satan like qualities. Such as, attacking your feetwhile walking by, attacking your headwhile you sleep, attacking your handbecause it moved slightly, attacking your leg because he thought he saw a bug that some looks a lot like nothing. Its powers lie in its looks. It may however look adorable don't touch it. Its fluffiness hides its claws that are always out. It also has an act for playing dead. Another thing is that it moans for no reason at all. the only way to fix this problem is to shoot the cat (highly recommended) or have it castrated. WARNING: if you have a cat like this do not let it spawn its babies will have wings and the taste for human blood. If this was to happen call the local authorities and invest in a semi automatic shotgun.

            Nye has a B.S. in mechanical engineering from Cornell. He also has six honorary doctorate degrees, including Ph.D.s in science from Goucher College and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Does this actually make him a scientist? Has he published anything peer-reviewed?
since other "scientists" consider him a scientist (and colleague) , who else may or may not be a real scientist? Why would Bill Nye think it is okay to lock-up people who disagree with his "science"?  Below, there are some articles and videos about the original post, and also some with additional background. has anyone noticed that the same people pushing global warming are very strong pizzagate deniers? the conversation about pizzagate with global warming enthusiasts is very similar i think to the Tucker vs Bill video i linked below from fox news, they only mention global warming, but the fighting and denying remind me of talking about pizzagate with people lol. 
who else loves pushing climate change this hard? damn skippy

             Leftist pedos worship hollywood "legends" like Bill Nye the mechanical engineer who never earned a science degree.  Then they call them "scientists"  Leftists - redefining history.

            Man, by that logic, why are drugs illegal? Why should guns be outlawed? People will get it anyway lol. Such a dumb way to look at it, because by saying "well it'll happen one way or another." You open the door for that argument to be used in every other instance in which something was made illegal but people still did it.

            This is the identity politics crowd. It's all about 'me'.  And they're stupid to boot. For example, the line 'Sexuality's a spectrum' may be true.  While our sexuality may be a spectrum, our sex isn't. If Bill Nye is a science guy, he should know that science says that there are two sexes: XX and XY. Nothing--no amount of surgery, cross-dressing, makeup--will change that.

              They are the exceptions that prove the rule though.  Intersex people are almost completely overlooked when people talk about multiple genders.

               I think that's cause gender isn't dependant on things like reproductive organs. It's a construction based on ideals people have connected to sex, like "boys like blue and cars" with "boys" being defined as "a human with a penis"

              I actually just watched a video this morning that was linked off of a reddit thread on the new Nye show about this:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnyC2-51tQs">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnyC2-51tQs

             </p>
             <p>
              Also note that the guy in the video, Patrice O'Neal, passed away from a stroke (complications from a blood clot) in 2011 at age 41.

              i think some of them end up dead because it starts out innocent enough when their fame starts and then like the dutch banker when they get exposed to the child sacrifice some of the celebrities either freak out and lose their minds like kanye did and want out or they embrace it like jay z and beyonce did and take it to the next level. too many celebrities have died recently and i think the public can smell a rat but we dont know what to do and who to make accountable. randy quaid described it as people in the know getting your credit cards suspended. your mortgage cancelled. and then the smear campaign begins publicly and he ended up on the run with his wife in canada trying to escape from the ' star whackers '  i think he went public in a desperate attempt to expose the people behind the celebrity assassinations and to save his own life. his career has been ruined by all the negative press now. its a powerful kabal that controls everything

                    he absolutely risked his life doing what he did and he paid for it too. i have a gut feeling kim being robbed had something to do with their involvement with the illuminati. maybe a reminder to kanye that he is not a god and only a mere mortal and they can hurt his family any time they want to.

             Can you expand on this? I'm familiar with most of them. Lawrence Krauss has recently gone down in my estimations due to his love for AI, he seems to almost welcome the destruction of the human race.
            </p>
            <p>
             But what's suspect about Brian Cox? Einstein?

            <p>
             It's sad to think that science, the ultimate test of truths and non truths, can be manipulated and thrust into the public sphere by 'trusted' faces to shape opinion.

              Sure, Pretty much any "Science Guy" that's propped up in the mainstream and has a large following is used as a mouthpiece to spew the nihilistic narrative that we were created out of nothing and we are so insignificant in the grand scheme of things that nothing you do matters and you should just kill yourself. Their goal is to remove God from your life, and have you follow their religion of theory (Scientism) Knowing all too well that there is an Intelligent Design to our world and yet they do everything they can to hide it.
             </p>
             <p>
              All the above people i mentioned follow this narrative and provide the same bs science that's been regurgitated by their fellow peers and none of them possess a shred of critical thought (or maybe they do and are told to shut up.)  Their Science is nothing but Theory- passed off as fact- never questioned because well let's face it, they are the Grand Astronomical Priests of our Universe- So don't question them.

               Ah I see, look I don't want to get into an atheism vs religion debate, but I will say you shouldn't conflate atheism and nihilism. By the same measure I contest the narrative that without religion we wouldn't have morality. There are a great number of people living moral lives without a religious framework (and the opposite is true, too). As I say this isn't the place to debate our beliefs, and I doubt we'd change each others minds anyway.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm in Biology, but even if I weren't I would tell you that they (the public 'science guys') don't know that there is intelligent design to the world simply because there is zero evidence. Science is all theory- the most up to date, best theories we have to date..until they're disproved and replaced by the next assertion. That's all science is- you make an assertion and then try to prove or disprove it. In other words, it is constantly scrutinised and questioned- the public figures would be ridiculed if they were simply lying to the world. Unless of course you suppose that every scientist on the planet is part of a conspiracy to deceive.
              </p>
              <p>
               I will agree with you though that the people pushed into the public sphere should definitely be treated with caution, there's lots of 'bad science' out there I.e. Just plain false.
              </p>
              <p>
               The great thing about all facets of science is that it's not personal, it's not opinion and it's not out of bounds for anyone to possess. The more intelligent and more personable people (such as Tyson, Cox, etc) might be able to retain more facts in their brains, but that doesn't make them priests of the universe! The knowledge is out there, and it
               <em>
                should
               </em>
               be questioned :)

               But back on topic- screw this Bill Nye guy, he seems fishy as fuck.

                The reason "atheism" vs "religion" comes up is because we are trying to show you that the "mainstream" powers that be ARE religious.  They religiously believe evil shit.
               </p>
               <p>
                I believe yes, "scientists" from around the world are lying on purpose, and their friends in the government, schools and media brainwash us to believe what THEY think is true.
               </p>
               <p>
                I believe you are correct that science should be studied and repeated and all the information should be up for debate.  But I'm not sure if you've noticed, but they have manipulated people into shunning and insulting people who wish to question mainstream theories.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's evil how they've treated people.
               </p>
               <p>
                Can people question if vaccines are bad, or if there are chemicals in the sky, or how the planes and buildings on 9/11
                <strong>
                 disintegrated
                </strong>
                ?  Nope!  Because the government paid some scientists to study it, and they are smarter than you, and shut up with your stupid theories, you might hurt the children.

            I felt like the play on words with "Damn Skippy, home slice" (like slice of pizza) &amp; sex stew (spirit cooking) were little hidden double entendre references to Pizzagate, as well.

             Wow, very perceptive. I didn't catch that one... I think you're right on the money man. I guess there might be an entire psy op going on to normalize this crap, and it makes you wonder if the way they rolled out PG (as fake news) is some way to subconsciously suggest it to people while telling them it's fake in order to make them apathetic so when they finally decide to roll it out then we will have been programmed not to object. Based on the false reality we've been sold in the guise of fake news. Fake news makes all these sordid affairs okay in some subtle way because it shuts the conversation down before it takes place.

              Some of the word choices felt like the references slipped into the Katy Perry video "This Is How We Do." &amp; that vid was made before the whole Pizzagate thing, so it seems to be a well known private joke to those in the "know." They're flaunting it.

            Christ, that's the stuff of nightmares. Quite a few BBC connections there, not to mention an alarming number of ventriloquists - you might be onto something. Not willing to believe Brian May is a pedo just yet though :(

            I hate to say it but he really looks like a pedophile. Same as that creepy Luke Kuhn guy who plotted stink bomb attack on Deploraball in CPP. Apparently he's owned by Monsanto, not that his scientific credentials hold any weight anyway. His recent interview on Tucker Carlson creeped me out, got very sinister towards the end

            so i watched and nearly retched during that "musical" number. and not just because of the lack of talent. anyway, at first i found your flagged lines were pretty silly (home slice? been saying that shit since high school.) but i forgot about the gerard de poopoo or whatever dude. that definitely makes it pretty nasty. i do tend to find it to be the only really suspect lyric in there, though, unless stew and bagels are code for something.
           </p>
           <p>
            on another note, bagels are code in my world: i toasted some bagels and ran upstairs to invite my roommate for one. he had a computer setup in his walk in closet for music production and the door wasn't completely closed, so u busted in with the offer for bagels. well he hollered that he hates bagels and slammed the door on me and i figured out he was jerkin off. so now a few of us will just randomly shout bagels to much laughter.
