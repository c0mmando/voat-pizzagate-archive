            Our churches are demon possessed. Look! Normal people don't molest children! Lest of all leaders of a church!!! Something is causing all this molestation in the church. Put 2 and2 together. The rabbit hole starts at our churches and will end there! If our churches are this bad then just imagine how bad the secular world will be and that is what we are seeing!!! Now you going to leave this comment up voat or remove this thread too???

            'The Church of England “concealed” evidence of child abuse by a former bishop stretching over two decades, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has said, following a major independent review. ', "In criticising Mr Carey, the report said he “set the tone for the Church’s response to Ball’s crimes and gave the steer which allowed Ball's assertions that he was innocent to gain credence”."
           </p>
           <p>
            'Lord Carey’s successor, Lord Rowan Williams, was also censured for implementing change at the church “at a pace which now seems lamentably slow”. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'Responding, Mr Carey said he accepted the criticisms and apologised to Ball’s victims.“I believed Peter Ball’s protestations and gave too little credence to the vulnerable young men and boys behind those allegations,” he said. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'After Ball was convicted last year, former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord George Carey denied presiding over a cover-up in the 1990s, but said he regretted failing to deal properly with Ball’s victims. '
