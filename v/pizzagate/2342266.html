<p>Here\'s how to get started from scratch, if you are firing up a brand new Twitter account: <a href="https://twitter.com/Vindic8tr/status/953109146416529408">https://twitter.com/Vindic8tr/status/953109146416529408</a></p>
<p>And here are the official marching orders from 8chan:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>OKAY FOLKS LISTEN UP THIS IS OUR GAME PLAN</h1>
<p>Quick rundown: Phase I is pushing #greatawakening and #wethepeople early wednesday morning. When twitter kills it we switch to Phase II the #FakeNewsAwards, plus Trump should be tweeting about that during the evening (I suspect) which means it will trend no matter what. We set the ground stage for that. Phase III can be done Wednesday night and onwards. We highjack other trending hashtags and post somewhat related images/memes to redpill unsuspecting normies. </p>
<h2>— PHASE I —</h2>
<p>How to make things trend on twitter:</p>
<ul>
<li>We decide a hashtag: GreatAwakening and WeThePeople are top votes. FakeNewsAwards will be part of Phase II. </li>
<li>We pick a day and time we want this to trend: Wednesday morning/afternoon</li>
<li>Which means you have to begin pushing the hashtag very early in the a.m. Anons should begin dropping around 4-5am EST</li>
<li>Keep dropping memes steady throughout the a.m. Even if you don\'t see it trending. KEEP DOING IT. NEVER STOP. ALL DAY!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT: You need 2-3 thousand unique tweets with the hashtag in a short amount of time</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pictures and content-rich tweets with one or two agreed upon #\'s</li>
<li>Original tweets help trend things faster than just simply retweeting things. Likes don\'t really count for much.</li>
<li>Tweets with a ton of hashtags sometimes don\'t count because spam filters. Keep it simple and limited.</li>
<li>Follow all Q accounts, follow back all Q accounts. Twitter will try to throttle it</li>
</ul>
<p>TWITTER ALWAYS TRIES TO KILL RIGHT WING HASHTAGS</p>
<p>We will move to Phase II when see see this happening.</p>
<h2>— PHASE II —</h2>
<p>Once twitter kills a trending hashtag its very hard to make it trend again. It can have thousands of tweets and suddenly disappear from the trending tab. </p>
<ul>
<li>#GreatAwakening and #WeThePeople is Phase I, early morning. </li>
<li>#FakeNewsAwards happen next.</li>
<li>We will set the stage for FakeNewsAwards. Trump will tweet about this which will make it trend no matter what.</li>
</ul>
<p>WE ARE THE FRONT LINE</p>
<p>Continue dropping examples of fake news, bad journalism, and their lies.</p>
<h2>RESOURCE FOR THIS IS: <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/Skill">https://imgur.com/gallery/Skill</a>  Tons of examples in that album. Download and prepare.</h2>
<p>Eventually this too will die down. We move to Phase III</p>
<h2>— PHASE III —</h2>
<p>This will be after #FakeNewsAwards happens and dies down. </p>
<ul>
<li>Throughout the rest of the night and into the next days find hashtags that are currently trending and tweet our memes and info using their hashtags. HIJACK HIJACK HIJACK!</li>
<li>It helps if the memes you\'re posting on a hashtag is relevant to the subject matter.</li>
<li>You can also find large twitter accounts (celebs, journalists, people in media/politics) and reply to their new tweets with our memes/info.</li>
<li>You will get blocked, attacked, and harassed. Report the harassers and move on. </li>
<li>If you see another Fake News Awards poster under attack, comment and help out. Defend each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep this up over the following days. Remember, keep things simple, don\'t get angry and resort to personal attacks, and remember to always take the high ground. Not everyone can be saved.</p>

            Stop pushing this bullshit. They are not being resisted by anybody. These anons are spook opperations. The first step should be to defund the banks. Everybody needs to close their bank accounts. That is number 1. The second thing is to continue down a list of real things to do, like closing all bank accounts. This anon bullshit is a pretend war where the citizens get to sit and watch a play fight and do nothing. Step one, defund the banks. Do not count on leaders or white hats to fight this fight. Do not count on the mods at Reddit or Voat(Goat) to direct you in the right direction. The opposite is what they do. Step one, have any of you shut down your bank accounts? Do you think your freinds family and neighbors are joing us? They are not. The elite are in control and unleashing agenda 21 as we speak. Trump is one of them. Stop following. Shut your bank accounts down in mass. Once that is done, we can move on to a next step. Do something instead of waiting for others to do something for you.

             Trump is making it possible to get the message about Pizzagate out. You see that as "pro Trump"?
            </p>
            <p>
             Interestng. And your aspersion is also interesting. "Pretense" -- so you think all the Bernie bros in here are just dishonest. Because Bernie lost fair and square and they really are Trump fans.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most interesting of all: you see 15,000 people united by a common disgust at truly obscene levels of government corruption and abuse of power as merely "pro Trump".

              I see promoting Trump's stupid campaign and the pro-Trump LARPers at Q as being pro-trump.   Q and the Storm are bascially an anti-American fantasy of Trump doing away with the rule of law and acting like a dictator.  Remind me again of all the folks that are in custody?   Is Soros still at Camp David?  or is this bullshit.

              Actually I see them ignoring in the increased corruption and corporate giveaways under Trump as being Pro Trump.  Not a peep about Trump given away public lands at the behalf of a foreign uranium company for one.   Also 15,000 is a very small constituency.

              oh no I'm outed. Oh dear.
Why I am here?  A bit of sand in the gears of this propaganda machine.  Pointing out facts.  Noting that from Day 1 Pizzagate stands on a false foundation and see that people never want to actually grapple with that.  Wondering who these people are who believe in false theory after false theory.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also think it's hilarious that you enthusiastically share "marching orders" and shill for POTUS on twitter.   Seems like that is what you accuse your enemies of.

               You have a inflated opinion of yourself. :-)  You slow nothing. Sand merely sharpens the knife of our argument and bonds us together. Clearly you lack wisdom, or you would have seen this already. That's the trouble with arrogance. It makes you blind.

             There is no great wakening. Your friends, family and neighbors will not be joining in. Stop being dictated to. The mods tell you we are winning, and you believe it. They are in complete control, no resistance from us. If you are so awake, who did 9/11, why, where does our incom tax go and what is agenda 21, and who planned it? Great awakening my ass.

             I think it may be the other way around -- i.e. Trump is waging a communication
             <em>
              offensive
             </em>
             to get ahead of serious, all-out attempts to bend the news cycle against him leading into the State of the Union.

              I suppose the globalists wouldn't stage a false flag simply to avoid being called out on their Fake News. Although we can't rule anything out....

            Should also been on Facebook, not just Twitter.  Only the mainstream media really pays attention to Twitter and they won't be covering this for obvious reasons.

             My sense is that images are not searchable on Twitter -- you'd have to add the keyword or hashtag to the text of your tweet.

            Other good hashtags to use with the ones listed above:
           </p>
           <h1>
            FollowTheWhiteRabbit
           </h1>
           <h1>
            QAnon
           </h1>
           <h1>
            MAGA
           </h1>
           <h1>
            TheStorm
           </h1>
           <p>
            (Can anyone else think of anymore?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, after the awards, keep spamming all of your memes and information, but use the top trending hashtags at the time as well to further reach larger audiences and keep the tweet storm going strong.
           </p>
           <p>
            The goal is to reach as many people as possible and start red pilling and waking up the masses to the corruption. Hence the GreatAwakening. 💕😊

             Use common hashtags “they” use (I dunno...#trumpisanahole or whatever) and add a digit or something to the end so it’ll pop up in a search. Maybe? Does twitter work that way? I don’t tweet. I’m too old and krotchity for that.
