            Absolutely happening. Look at what' happening to this forum? So many shills ... so little time to call them out.
           </p>
           <p>
            What makes it worse is that they hide behind the skirts of George Webb and AJ. And now? Guess what? Instead of digging up what Alefantis and the rest of the Cannibal Elite are doing, we're talking about Webb and AJ, two inconsequentials and disinformationists that need to be shunned by this community.
           </p>
           <p>
            This forum is really going downhill. Go down the posts and see how many upvoats are given? Top posts received at least 300 and more. You see that happening? People are abandoning this place in droves because they want RESEARCH ... not debating whether someone is an asshole... and not shit posts from shills.

              Hey, I'm sure you know the alternatives. I was on Reddit, but  swore I'd never go back there because of what happened. I'd like to fight for Voat by getting some of the really great investigators to get digging again. It's disheartening to see the numbers drop (not member numbers), and the shills makin' themselves to home. We had the numbers before and used to just absorb these shit posts, but that isn't happening anymore. Someone gets a lousy 13 or 14 upvoats and the post just stays there.

            Now Jason Goodman on livestream is now BACKTRACKING ON THE SETH RICH "MURDER," pointing out MY (AND OTHERS') POINTS of LACK OF DEATH CERT. AND AUTOPSY REPORT.
           </p>
           <p>
            LMAO!!
           </p>
           <p>
            There are TONS of negative comments in chat since Jason is too busy running his mouth to delete them (as he usually does).  What's HILARIOUS is that now even CIA Robert David Steele has distanced himself from these CLOWNS.  Rumor has it that the "Clownsource" trio is LOSING ~100 SUBSCRIBERS PER DAY ON THEIR JEWTUBE CHANNEL.  LOL

             RD Steele said that he denounced Jason, but said he would do whatever he could to support George. I wonder if this isn't why George is free and not in jail, as as any normal person would be. Has he recently taken his support for Webb?

            41 minutes ago A real circus unfolding in oxford. Trish and Jason thrown out of conference featuring Eric Braverman.

              If you think of this as a legitimate journalistic pursuit its a confusing mess but if you think of it as a mish mash of various psy-ops it becomes crystal clear.
             </strong>
            </strong>
            Controlled event - not too large. Someone named Eric Braverman appears in the distance, partakes in a single panel discussion then leaves. Jason and Trish forced to view from back of the room. Some truncated video with Jason exclaiming there he is! Then they are conveniently asked to leave. They don't hang around and try to speak with Braverman. Instead they leave and speculate about why they were kept away from him and lament they're loss of an interview.

If you want to hear an interesting conversation...this one between George and Jason...listen to it and let me know what you think...scripted or not?

            I think the part with Memphis...Dirty Bomb...Mearsk...the locations....then the Charleston port...I think all scripted.   do not see how this starts from Memphis..and in less than 2 minutes later they are at the point of Memphis Maersk...going into port..at that day and time...like that day..when so happens that ship might be in a port 4 days out of every what..40??? I think from the very start it was to end with having the Maersk boarded

StupidSheeple Yes. exactly that. the swift transition from Memphis the city to the ship Maersk Memphis to the port and its rapid escalation. And hardly anyone addresses this. It's blatantly obvious. It follows script and narration. Not intelligence. That's what it looks like.

it ain't normal...like they were climbing a set of stairs to get to the top...the top being..dirty bomb on Memphis Maersk..and oh...look who happens to be turning into the port at that time...(most the friggin time ships are out at sea or in other foreign ports..but noooooooooo...not that day.....so who scripted it?  That is the question and why was it scripted? it's some weird shit...funny how a lot of people it's just words...you really have to listen ..like if you have a legal background..you see this stuff pretty clear. It's beyond bizzare..at this time..our government is ran under Talmudic law...they will indict a ham sandwich...but if you are a kosher ham ...you have a free no prosecution card.

            Superb article. Someone exposing Webb's BS provided the link to me. As I read it, all I could think about was
            <strong>
             <strong>
              Webb's background in behaviorial analytics and Acton's NSA and DHS ties.

            Among the core self-identified purposes of JTRIG are two tactics: (1) to inject all sorts of false material onto the internet in order to destroy the reputation of its targets; and (2) to use social sciences and other techniques to manipulate online discourse and activism to generate outcomes it considers desirable."

             So their goal beyond discrediting us was to derail PG by pivoting to international intrigue (libya-syria) and organ harvesting, and their basis for success was knowing that most of us are males 18-45 who enjoy airport spy fiction and a majority would be entranced by webbs daily-update format? How embarrassing.
