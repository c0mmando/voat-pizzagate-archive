            Yes, and we hope these people or person have good intentions, but some have not used these funds appropriately.  Not saying they would steal, just have different ideas as to what to do with it.  Better to just not involve funds.  That is something that can come later and separately.  Raising money to help the children.  Getting someone like Roseanne Barr or of that stature to head it.  But no, not now or yet.  Not in conjunction with our first endeavor.  We must see what the other side will do and how they will retaliate.  Not at all I hope.  As long as our people keep their cool and show restraint, if they do not, it will be so much the better for our cause.

            I saw Neil Wolfe the jew begging for money. That was the thing that stood out most to me. I think this "protest" is a jew false flag, staged opposition. I wouldnt' touch it with a barge pole. And I wouldn't give that jew one penny.

            Yeah it doesn't seem very professional or written by someone serious and completely sane, if you know what I mean. It would help a lot I think to have something that looked professionally designed and was written well, impactful without being sensationalist and basically looking like something that those types of CNN NYT people would feel was like something that could have been produced by one of their peers . It kind of looks like one of those culty type Christian leaflets. It gives a bad impression when I try to imagine receiving it as someone in the PG is fake news mindset.

            Yesterday they banned my account for posting about david geffen, saying hes not known to be PG related tho his PG wiki is long, hours later I'm accosted in a bar by a "drunk" guy who says I'm a liar and a Rothschild tho I don't look semitic at all and tells me to change my life.

            I have already told everyone what I think, you can see evidence for that in your snarky reply. You are behaving much like a Democrat, following the party line without ever asking a single question, and ignoring any semblance of independent thought. Another similarity, is never even stopping to think about strategy, or even questioning the people surrounding you. This is my cause, it appears that you do not care about any ramifications that can come out of the actions of others, and how it may overall damage the reputation and investigation, in turn placing your own egotistical pursuits ahead of the real issue, which is helping the people being harmed by this network of evil. I don't have a desire to accompany people that feel that they need to virtue signal, and make themselves feel as if they are "doing something" about this issue, when in reality what they are doing is the exact opposite of "doing something." The comet shooter felt like he was "doing something" as well, and we all know how that turned out. If you do not care to look at evidence, facts, and reason, that's on you. If those goes south, it is on the backs of the people that turned a blind eye to the glaring problems with this poorly thought out "strategy." That includes you and everyone else. Believe me, if this does work out to benefit PG, I will be here admitting that I was wrong and congratulating everyone on a successful mission.

            The quote you use for the pizza-related handkerchief has a typo in it. Yoers? Also, this doesn't seem to be a flyer but a 3-fold brochure. Truthfully, as an artist, providing links for people to go home to look up is worthless, they won't do it. It would be better to just have one link to look up. Also, I wouldn't ask for money, then it seems like a scam. I think you should take the strongest evidence and just put it on a flyer with a link to have them research more would be more effective.

            <ul>
             <li>
              Why are they asking the wrong questions, e.g., "why would anyone offer to return a handkerchief via email"?
             </li>
             <li>
              Why do they feature an image with the particular codewords that are widely believed to be inaccurate at this point? They
              <em>
               are
              </em>
              codewords, it's just that their meanings don't quite work in every context. "Map", in particular, has been brought up several times, potentially not even being a codeword but an actual map of "pizza" joints.
             </li>
             <li>
              Why is the GoFundMe campaing in the very fucking central focus of the entire brochure?
             </li>
             <li>
              Why would they alter an artwork that is, in itself, enough of a lead, putting a pizza on it that will just confuse newcomers without the mental context for that image?
             </li>
             <li>
              Why did they choose to feature the "hotard" image that has also been greatly debated, with Alefantis and the other man seemingly calling
              <em>
               each other
              </em>
              hotards? This one is easy to "debunk" in the media, potentially discrediting the rest of the otherwise very strong circumstantial evidence as a big misunderstanding.
             </li>
             <li>
              Why do they use URLs from sli.mg when it has been down for weeks now?
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Do we need more reasons to think this is either a false flag or just very, very stupid?

            The flyer quotes the infamous "pizza related" handkerchief email but leaves out the most damming part which is Mrs Sandler adding in the "pizza related" herself.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I hope no one is pinning any hope on this, it looks sketchy from the get go. Even the pictures are ambiguous and will be used to eviscerate arguments put out by Pizzagaters.

           <p>
            The girl had her arms taped to the table by her sister. And the "Pizza Slut" is a little iffy but not really a big deal. I'm predicting disaster, this demostration is so sketchy in fact you have to wonder who's putting this thing together.

            If people really wanted to grab attention they'd expose what happened in Haiti. They'd tell the story of Monica Peterson and the suspicious circumstances surrounding her death.

              Yes, bad ideal.  The other side will make whatever the can out of it.  And it will not be good.

             Very good, but pedophiles is spelled wrong or is that on purpose to draw attention? People are always shocked to hear how many children are missing every year.

              Yes, and other spelling errors on the one in the Op. Not very professional looking. I know spelling errors seem like small potatoes to some, but when you're trying to be taken seriously, it matters a whole lot.
