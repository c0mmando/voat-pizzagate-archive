            This is a great example of how conspiracy theorists make "facts" out of nothing. There is absolutely zero evidence connecting these fires to Bohemian Grove or to Pizzagate.

            California prone to wildfires.   It just had a mulityear drought meaning a lot of plants and tree were dry and ready to fuel a fire.  Rains came in Jan and Feb, but after that things got dry again.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Fire Department was warning of dangerous conditions on the 7th due to seasonal high "Diablo" winds from the Diablo Valley and issued fire warnings for all of California north of San Jose.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <h1>
             RedFlagWarnings &amp; #FireWeatherWatches in effect until Tuesday across California due hot, dry conditions and gusts of winds ranging from 20-30 mph. When outdoors use caution. One spark can easily ignite a new fire.

            These are exactly the same conditions that occurred right before the Oakland Hills firestorm of 1991 which was also in October. Winds whipped a small fire into a firestorm.  In the first hour 800 buildings went on fire.  One house was catching fire every 11 seconds at one point.  Here's a news reporter remembering how he got caught up in the beginning of the fire and how fast it spread.
            <a href="https://youtu.be/yYj4q_0DwJk?t=73">

           <p>
            Those red flag warnings were right on the money.  The next day fires started in Nuns,  Atlas, Tubbs,  Oroville, Cherokee.  The next day fires stared in another 6 towns.  250 fires eventually occurred in October in Northern California.
           </p>
           <p>
            ZERO fires occurred in Monte Rio, CA.   Monte Rio is the where Bohemian Grove is.
            <br/>
            You can check the CA Fire Map.  Monte Rio had no fires within 15 miles.

            This is pure bunk.

              LOL! No, what I meant is that, given their legislative record and public remarks by Putin and his officials, it's far more likely Russian Federation is doing its best to end child trafficking, first with Russian orphans and in the Ukraine and internationally.

              The closure and subsequent FBI search of the San Francisco Embassy is very intriguing. I have the distinct impression that the FBI was looking for evidence of someone having been hidden in the embassy. Attic and closets were ransacked, floors ripped up, dogs brought in. I wonder if they were looking for evidence of Seth Rich having been there. Remember, Eric Braverman was last seen going into the Russian Embassy in DC. Perhaps Seth also sought asylum with the Russians. Nobody would ever think of him going to San Francisco.

                 Park Avenue neurosurgeon arrested for sexually assaulting patient
                </p>
                <p>
                 A Park Avenue neurosurgeon was arrested for sexually assaulting a patient in his exam room, authorities said.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The victim told authorities the assault happened July 20 when Dr. Eric Braverman ushered her into his office, gave her a massage, and then inserted his fingers inside her.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Braverman, 59, who was busted on Halloween, had “no legitimate purpose” to touch the woman other than “for the purpose of degrading and abusing her,” according to his criminal complaint.

               Alright, I'm open to being wrong. It just seemed too convenient to happen twice and I may have jumped to a conclusion.

                I might be wrong, too. Hard to know anything for certain in the present environment of smoke and mirrors.

                 Pfff, that fucking guy! He's only here at the climax of the story to make you doubt yourself, don't listen to him. I think we can agree that whichever side Russia is on, they may have had some evidence that someone COULD possibly want to destroy - whether it is just one rat on the inside or a malicious attack from an outsider can be theorized upon I guess.

                 To say the least the timing is very convenient.

                  Thanks for the intervention, but AreWeSure and I go back a long way and always have a good time hitting the ball back and forth. I appreciate his/her questions and comments, and in this case he/she is correct, and my attempt to validate were pathetic. I don't have a reliable source for the claim that Eric Braverman sought asylum at the Russian Embassy in NY except for George Webb's videos where I heard it originally, and some secondary news sources.

                  As for Russians burning evidence of human trafficking---this is their response: "The staff were given two days to shut down operations forced employees to burn sensitive documents containing personal information of Americans and Russians used in the processing of passports and visas. “We didn’t have time to pack them all. We had to destroy them,” he said. Acrid black smoke could be seen billowing out of the consulate’s chimney on Friday, prompting a visit from the Fire Department."

                  Sounds plausible. The US govt also rummaged through the Russian archives:

                 <p>
                  "Following the seizure of our Consulate General by the American authorities, some of our archives have been inspected, re-packed and moved without any consultation with the Russian party by a private haulage company."
