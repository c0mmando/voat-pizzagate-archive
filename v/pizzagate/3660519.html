            Jim Jordan is another player in the elite covering for each other. Is he in favor of what Strauss is doing? What’s his purpose for lying and what’s in it for him to lie. Just like those that protect A Schiff and Sandusky. Another Pedo Protector.

             "What is The Truth they cannot allow The World to Know?"
            </p>
            <p>
             The vast empire of Tartary is a country that appears on ancient maps.
            </p>
            <p>
             It had worldwide influence and once covered North and South America, Australia, New Zealand most of Russia, China, Europe, Japan, India and Korea.
            </p>
            <p>
             For the most part the citizens of this country were led by their own guidance of natural law honoring truth and integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
             They enjoyed a high standard of living and dwelt in harmony with nature.
            </p>
            <p>
             They built amazing edifices all over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             The wonderous cathedrals of Europe and the enormous aqueducts in southern Europe and in Mexico.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Grand Canal in China and the Erie Canal in America.
            </p>
            <p>
             The fabulous outside arenas around the Mediterranean Sea.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Coliseum in Rome and the magnificent temples in St. Petersburg Russia.
            </p>
            <p>
             They lived in luxuriant villas.
            </p>
            <p>
             They made ziggurats, star forts, dolmens and earthen mounds all of which utilized Etheric natural energy.
            </p>
            <p>
             They created exquisite statues and crafted golden ornaments.
            </p>
            <p>
             They built the Great Wall in what is now China.
            </p>
            <p>
             Marco Polo wrote an extensive and detailed account of Asia in the 13th and 14th centuries and did not even mention a wall.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Great Wall is not seen on any maps pre-dating the late 1600’s.
            </p>
            <p>
             So most of it’s construction occurred in 1700’s and it was built to keep the encroaching Chinese out of Tartaria.
            </p>
            <p>
             The openings on the wall are on the north side towards the former Tartary not on the south China facing side.
            </p>
            <p>
             It should be called the Great Wall of Tartaria.
            </p>
            <p>

             Megalithic temples hewn out of solid rock.
            </p>

             The Ellora Caves in India.
            </p>
            <p>
             The colossal underground monolithic churches of Lalibela Ethiopia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Extensive underground tunnel systems.
            </p>
            <p>
             The astonishing Serapeum of Saqqara in Egypt.
            </p>

             The earlier the monolithic stone the bigger it is and the more precision it is cut with.

             The earlier the structure the more incapable we are of replicating it.

             Never was mortar used.

             Skeletons of giants are found on all continents.
            </p>
            <p>
             And remains of beings with elongated skulls.
            </p>
            <p>
             Graveyards of little people and horned human like entities have been unearthed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now it is as if these beings have never existed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like the Tartarians they are never mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
             We live in a virtual reality where true history is ignored and covered up.
            </p>
            <p>
             A totally false narrative is taught.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fantasies have replaced truth and everything is pushed way back to the remote past.
            </p>
            <p>
             Older advanced structures are credited to local people who came later who have no idea how to build them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Deception has been utilized to push history back a thousand years and create an artificial dark age.
            </p>
            <p>
             The time of Jesus was less than 1000 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the Middle Ages the i and J before numbers designated Jesus. Not the number one.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example i346 is 346 years after the time of Jesus. It is not 1346.
            </p>
            <p>
             Way back in the Old Testament at the time immediately following the Exodus it states that the Israelites used the Arc of the Covenant as a weapon of war.
            </p>
            <p>
             Against the Amorites, Midianites and Philistines.
            </p>
            <p>
             So the use of energy weapons has been going on for over a thousand years.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was perfected to the point where it was able to take out many millions of Tartarians.
            </p>
            <p>
             The energy weapons melted cities and destroyed the civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome which were approximately of the same time period as Jesus and were heavily influenced by Tartaria.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not only are they pushed way back into remote history, the extent of their empires have been fabricated.
            </p>
            <p>
             Destroying the pyramid complex was the first objective of the Israelites.
            </p>
            <p>
             Puma Punku which is part of the Tiahuanacu complex in Bolivia had interlocking megaliths of andesite and diorite.
            </p>
            <p>
             These are types of granite only surpassed in hardness by diamonds but they were somehow carved with laser like flatness.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now they are broken and shattered and blown to bits.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tiahuanaco and Puma Punku is said to have been built by a simple local migrating tribe.
            </p>
            <p>
             This idea is used all over the world to dismiss and cover-up the ancient advanced cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
             Energy weaponized from the Arc of the Covenant is what brought down the Walls of Jericho.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Arc was an electrical capacitor composed of silver and brass alloys and gilded with gold.
            </p>
            <p>
             It’s true purpose was to store and direct energy from the Earth to outside sources.
            </p>
            <p>
             But transporting it around was very dangerous and it caused people to become sick and die.
            </p>
            <p>
             It had a constant radiation but it also sent out intermittent electrical surges where many people were killed instantly.
            </p>
            <p>
             The ones who carried it had to wear protective clothing.
            </p>
            <p>
             The electrical capacity of such an apparatus would be over 500 volts.
            </p>
            <p>
             Opposing armies would be defenseless against such a weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
             The volume or cubic capacity of the empty coffer inside the Kings Chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza is exactly the same volume as the Arc of the Covenant.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to Egyptian tradition the Israelites plundered Egypt during the upheaval at the time of the Exodus.
            </p>
            <p>
             They took the Arc out of the so called Kings Chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza at this time.
            </p>
            <p>
             The tribe of Israel also used religion as a means to get their foot in the door in the ruling affairs of foreign countries.
            </p>
            <p>
             A religious leader holds great power able to influence many simple minds who believe the leader’s edicts are from God.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Druids who held such sway in England were Jewish.
            </p>
            <p>
             So were the Jesuits.
            </p>
            <p>
             So have been all the Popes and the Mormon leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason why Jewish people look down upon Christians is because they know they invented the Christian religion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jewish beliefs are just a rendition of the former appearances and interactions of planetary Gods.
            </p>
            <p>
             Books written in Tartary were rewritten and sold as Jewish history.
            </p>
            <p>
             Much of the content was fabricated and interfused with traditional local beliefs.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is how they sold their religion.
            </p>
            <p>
             They used Monks to write what they wanted making them think they were doing God’s work.
            </p>
            <p>
             The burning of old books and the rewriting of them in order to change history is the real Reformation.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Library of Alexandria in Egypt was purposely destroyed to limit knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
             Making deals with kings was a way they were able to get control of a country’s financial system.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once one controls the money supply and its allotments then they control the country.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this way righteous kings were replaced by insurgent kings who defrauded the people to take part in unjust wars.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just fake an event such as a murder, blame it on another country, add some patriotic and religious slogans, demonize the other country and you have created a war.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the Middle Ages the spraying of viruses not only eliminated entire villages it caused the Black Plague which killed off over 70 million people in Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             Disease was a favorite weapon used against the Tartarian kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1346 at the Siege of Kaffa in the Ukraine the Tartarians suffered an epidemic of plague brought on by the catapulting of viruses into the city.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fire was used to burn crops and create famine.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 1490’s saw the first signs of collapse of the Tartary Empire.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1666 the city of London was intentionally burned.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tartaria was severely weakened in 1775.
            </p>
            <p>
             But it remained until the early 1800’s.
            </p>
            <p>
             When Napoleon attacked Russia, Moscow was hit by an energy weapon.
            </p>
            <p>
             So was Washington DC in the War of 1812.
            </p>
            <p>
             These wars were actually wars against Tartarians.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first two world wars were to wipe out remaining Tartarian influences.
            </p>
            <p>
             Genghis Khan was said to be a Mogul.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mogul is just a made-up name which is then associated with Mongolia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Genghis Khan fought to restore the kingdom of Tartary and reclaim their land.
            </p>
            <p>
             His mounted warriors were called Tartars.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now Tartary is associated with hell.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many buildings in America demolished or still standing, said to be built by early pioneers or native people in America were in fact built by the Tartars.
            </p>
            <p>
             Disease was also used against the native people in the Americas.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is estimated that 95% of them perished from disease. Mostly smallpox.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Aztecs looked upon the Spaniards as the returning of their light colored god.
            </p>
            <p>
             Their beliefs harkened back to the events in the ancient sky when a light colored god came down from the heavens to save them.
            </p>
            <p>
             But these light colored people came to kill them.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Old World Order was replaced by the New World Order.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the Gregorian Calendar was instituted.
            </p>
            <p>
             To force the common people to accept a new false chronology.
            </p>
            <p>
             Peace and freedom was been replaced by being fenced up in strict borders.
            </p>
            <p>
             The suppression of Tartary coincides with the new teaching of evolution.
            </p>
            <p>
             We just think we are evolving.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have become disconnected with nature and disconnected with reality.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was not always like that.
            </p>
            <p>
             The farther back in time you go the more connected and at peace we were.
            </p>
            <p>
             With ourselves, with the animals and with the land we lived on."
