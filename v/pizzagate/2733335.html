            I just had another thought. I realize this is 99.99% likely to be nothing. But...the Hawaiin pizza is one of the most popular everywhere you go. I wonder if there is any questionable pg stuff where somehow that could come into play.

            A little decoding on the title there: Sacred Garden of Maliko (click top link) - Note the number of letters used - Sacred (6) Garden (6) Maliko (6)- often cultists will use 6 letter words to give a basic word a cultist connotation usually just 2 sixes but this has the full 666 so it must be something special.... and actually I can further decode based on the wording: - Sacred =  holy (Holes of children) Garden = planted cultists (people who are cultists in positions to help cultists) - and note all the potted (6) plants (6) in the pics.  That's a common symbolism thing the cult does to say "Cultist here!"

            I met a guy on Discord who claimed he was the Hawaii Anon.  He also found a large box of unused sterile medical vials, like for blood tests.  Made me think it was for testing people for HLA compatability or blood type.  Right in that place with the slabs and holes underground with WiFi changing.  Really smart guy.

             I posted a long comment on Pelzer, S.C. when I was researching The Finders a while back. Pelzer is home to a prison with a high pedo population. Many are released to rehab in town. It caught my attention when I happened to find out its registered pedo stats: 64 registered sex offenders out of a population of 91!
            </p>
            <p>
             Here's a repost:

            </p>
            <p>
             IT GETS STRANGER!
            </p>
            <p>
             I researched Pelzer, S.C. crime rate and found this:
            </p>
            <p>
             Pelzer, SC	population: 44	violent crime: 637 property crime: 4,115	total crime: 4,752 ALL STATISTICS ARE / 100,000 PEOPLE.
             <a href="http://www.areavibes.com/pelzer-sc/crime/">
              http://www.areavibes.com/pelzer-sc/crime/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "That's why I gave the population link. 64 offenders out of a population of 91. "national average of 16.06 Sex Offenders per 10,000 residents." 64 divided by 16.06 = 3.99 (4). 4 times 10,000 = 40,000. There would have to be a population of 40,000 for the 64 offenders to fall into the AVERAGE range. The statistic is not off."
            </p>
            <p>
             Next I decided to see if there was a prison located there. THERE IS. Perry Correctional Institution with "Sex offender treatment programs."
             <a href="http://www.doc.sc.gov/institutions/perry.html">
              http://www.doc.sc.gov/institutions/perry.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             HOWEVER, its jail population is greater than 40 or 90. The page of registered sex offenders for the area all had STREET ADDRESSES."
            </p>
            <p>
             "With these stats, it's possible that there is a sex offender treatment program in the community:
            </p>
            <p>
             "The sentencing and management of sex offenders is one of the most difficult and controversial issues facing the criminal justice system today. This is in large part due to the brutal nature of many sex crimes and the fact that many victims are children and other vulnerable people— a combination that elicits highly emotional responses from the public."
            </p>
            <p>
             "The increasing reliance on incarceration as a response to sex offenses, together with expanded definitions of what constitutes a sex offense, has driven up criminal justice costs. This has led some states to reconsider their response to sex offenders. While concerns of public safety and the protection of victims remain the primary focus, a number of states—especially those with limited resources—have concluded that incarceration is simply not a viable long-term solution, at least not for all sex offenders. In fact, most people who are convicted of a sex offense will be placed under community supervision at some point—either on probation immediately following sentencing or on parole after having served a jail or prison term. A 1997 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that of the approximately 234,000 adult sex offenders who are under the custody or control of correctional agencies on any given day in the United States, almost 60 percent are under some form of community supervision.5 Although there has been no follow-up study in recent years, this number has likely grown."

            </p>
            <p>
             In my opinion, this info strengthens the connection of Pelzer with the "Finder" info dump I posted. Certain elites/agencies might find these people useful."

             Dude. There are no hotspots.... Meaning No more hot spot than a thousand different cities.  Because Virtually everywhere is a hotspot. You're probably Correct With pelzer- Personally my work hasn't taken me there yet- But only because There are A thousands of hotspots In this country. It's fucking crazy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like, My work has lead me to these hotspots, (More or less, In order of "hotness")
            </p>
            <p>
             Washington D.c- Then Oakland/san Fran- well fuck, every Coastal town in California- Then philly, Pittsburgh, Then your Great Lake Boarder towns; Cleveland- Chicago, Milwaukee, Indianapolis- Hop down to ATLANTA Cut over TO Lousiana, skip through Austin- Houston etc. Fly up to SLC, Down to vegas. Not to mention all of the less than 10,000 Population, Towns, Sprinkled all along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
             But that's simply the route my work has gone- I imagine I could have gone a hundred different ways, and Come up with different hot spots.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's all encompassing.
            </p>
            <p>
             YOu could basically follow the train lines across the country, And every Within 20 miles of that track, Is a Hot spot.
            </p>
            <p>
             And to clarify- I don't just mean trafficking. My work Covers all angles Of the deepstate/shadow governement.  (dissapperances, Kidnappings, Murders,School plays, Social movements Etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
             I Don't say this to be discouraging.... I'm just saying this To say; IF YOU HAVE THE EYES TO SEE, It's harder to find A COLD SPOT.
            </p>
            <p>
             For A global trafficking ring to exist- It requires FAR more resources than anything That has been Discussed On these forums thus far.
            </p>
            <p>
             And The Ironic part is, ITS NOT AS BIG AS IT SEEMS..... It's just that all the mediums For uncovering this shit- Are More or less, IMPLEMENTED TO FACILIATE THIS SHIT.
            </p>
            <p>
             Google maps Doesn't exist- to make the common mans life eaiser. THe local news Doesn't exist, To inform the common man- And We all know That the MSM doesn't exist to unit or inform our nation.
            </p>
            <p>
             The resources that facilitate this shit- Are the resources that will ultimately lead to the entire thing being exposed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Life is one hell of a paradox.

             I allso remember an old Voat post, about a guy who found weird things in Hawaii, found multiple wifi spots.
            </p>
            <p>
             He even drilled holes in the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
             You know which one i mean?
I never know how it all ended.

              TY. Don’t wait too long. We need good researchers like you. I remember all of those things in that old thread. Obama has link to that K School. He also appointed the head of school  to a Judge position. Yes that charity was and still is super dirty. Windsor/Jackson also plays part. She is so dirty too I remember researching her for West Lake Landfill. I believe Mr Potato Head was a hint that a “sleeping partner” had been found etc. All of those that got one well, imo are pedos. Sick. Sick. Sick.

                Holy Moly!  I would help in a NY min but am as non-gifted as you are. You have done a magnificent amount of work and your contribution is Huge. Blown away by the boat rental to JE Isl.  Also the BO connection and yes that horrid abuse story. The back story of that boy and others is heartbreaking. I am so very worried for your safety. You are standing on a land mine of information.   You could divide your info up and post it here in parts 1 2 3 etc.  Stay safe and check often Prayers  🙏 +

                HI Firefighters Recall Deadly Blaze a Year Later
Saturday marks one year since four people died in the Marco Polo high-rise fire, and Honolulu firefighters say the blaze was the worst they've ever seen.

               So- I don't know How often HIgh rise luxury apartments break out in fire On Honolulu- But this one did, 2 days after I talked to DF. And I guess I should mention- I Confronted DF with MUCH MUCH MUCH- more Incriminating evidence, than anything I've presented publicly. I know that some people think that The best way to go about this whole thing- Is just to post Information as you find it- But I have to Disagree with that tactic.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Bulk of my Work- Is not Suitable for A voat submission. Like it's a straight up 2 year investigation. I have tens of thousands Of Voat posts.... I'm trying to contain a few doezen of those at a time, In a video or Presentation or something...
              </p>
              <p>
               You could make a 10 season series out of my work.
              </p>
              <p>
               So that's why I haven't Posted My material on here- Because It's not shit you just post on the internet- It's shit you present...If I was presenting this as a lawyer- It'd take months Of 8 hour days, 5 days a week. Just Bombshell After bombshell, for 3 fucking months.
              </p>
              <p>
               And I have zero Presentation skills- I mean, I can Present, I could be the lawyer for 3 months....  But I can't MAKE THE FUCKING PRESENTATION&gt; I've been teaching myself over the last 2 years.... But What takes Me 2 days To Make, Could take someone who knows what they're doing, 2 hours.
              </p>
              <p>
               So if there is anyone that knows how to make a fucking decent video- Like, Ya know how to navigate photo shop, and Filmora- Or whatever.... hit me up. It would be a full time job, And I wouldn't be able to pay you shit- But the Pay off Would Be Your involvement In dozens of stories, that far surpass everything that's currently been exposed regarding PGATe. Not only that- You could Litearlly cherry pick any Current news story- And I have information that provides Original, Essential context.
              </p>
              <p>
               Holy shit- It sounds like I"m making a voat post- And asking for Someone to OTurn my work into a suitable presentation..... which is obviously not the case- you simply Posted a link To my first and basicaly, Only, Post. From there I'm asking for someone who can turn my work into A presentation.... Because you're telling me not to take to long.... But I'm telling you it will take at least another year, If I try to make the presentations myself. And IT JUST KEEPS GROWING. There is no end. There is always more to this fucking shit show of story.
              </p>
              <p>
               BUt I digress- Sorry- what we talking about? ;)
