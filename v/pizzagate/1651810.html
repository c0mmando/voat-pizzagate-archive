            Norway has given top dollar to the Clintons. This article
            <a href="http://www.rense.com/general96/clintonssoros.htm">
             Rense.com article by Yoichi Shimatsu
            </a>
            claims the Norwegian Pedo bust is a sham:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The short story is: The Norwegian pedophile bust is directly connected to the Clinton Foundation and the CIA running an blackmail operation planting child porn onto Dark Web pedophile sites. The blackmail forced Conservative politicians to approve the appointment of longtime CIA asset Jens Stoltenberg as Secretary-General of NATO. The revelations clearly show the Clinton Foundation lied about the funds received, meaning this is a major fraud with between $60 million and possibly quintuple that amount missing from the organization’s books and the Clintons’ income tax records.

            Well researched post!  You might want to investigate Congo being involved as well.  Clinton awarded huge funds to building a new facility for fistula issues of abused women and girls to a Norway operation even though the doctors who had been running the clinic had been doing a great job. Something was wrong bigtime.

            Per this article and many others, Norway has made contributions to the Clinton Foundation in excess of $85,000,000.  I think they are one of the Clinton Foundation's top contributing nations:
