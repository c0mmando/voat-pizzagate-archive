<p>Was it here that I saw <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26352378">this article</a> the other day about the pedophile group in the UK that was operating openly for 10 years? </p>
<p>I\'m sure this will piss some people off here, but oh well. Fact is there has been a long-standing effort to get pedophilia piggybacked into being &quot;normalized&quot; along with homosexuality. Anyone who has been following the social engineering in this country knows it\'s been happening. This passage from the BBC article above describes the tactics of the Pedophile Information Exchange (PIE):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PIE was formed in 1974. It campaigned for &quot;children\'s sexuality&quot;. It wanted the government to axe or lower the age of consent. It offered support to adults &quot;in legal difficulties concerning sexual acts with consenting \'under age\' partners&quot;. The real aim was to normalise sex with children.</p>
<p>Journalist Christian Wolmar remembers their tactics. &quot;They didn\'t emphasise that this was 50-year-old men wanting to have sex with five-year-olds. They presented it as the sexual liberation of children, that children should have the right to sex,&quot; he says. ... </p>
<p>...One of PIE\'s key tactics was to try to conflate its cause with gay rights. On at least two occasions the Campaign for Homosexual Equality conference passed motions in PIE\'s favour.</p>
<p>Most gay people were horrified by any conflation of homosexuality and a sexual interest in children, says Parris. But PIE used the idea of sexual liberation to win over more radical elements. &quot;If there was anything with the word \'liberation\' in the name you were automatically in favour of it if you were young and cool in the 1970s. It seemed like PIE had slipped through the net.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is my point about all of this? It\'s that it really doesn\'t matter if there\'s a code in the emails. These sick deviants are still trying to influence politics and culture using art and whatever else they can come up with — an effort to normalize exceedingly wicked behavior — and we need to be exposing <strong>that</strong> because it requires no speculation about code languages and connect-the-dots-possible-relationships. That\'s not to say we shouldn\'t keep researching the connections and relationships, but I think if we wander too far out in the weeds, we\'ll lose credibility and interest.</p>',

            I've gone through the Wikileaks posts for two days. There is absolutely nothing there. All they're talking about is getting after hours pizza and beers. And I do have a background in code breaking.   This is simply a case of mass hysteria.   The only thing these people are guiltily of is being into degenerate interpretative modern art. Which is pretty sick!  But nothing usually among the filthy rich.

             What about the different e-mails posted so far? A bunch of ones I've seen are blatantly using code words. I'm not saying they are never actually talking about pizza, cheese, or pasta, but there are several times they obviously are.
