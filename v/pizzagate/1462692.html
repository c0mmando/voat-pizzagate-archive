            This false flag was a shit move. I pointed out all the evidence of it being a false flag to my friends who didn't believe in this conspiracy. They are almost 100% on board now. The moved camera, the Washington Post posting the story early, the assault rifle with no shots being fired, the cops being there extremely quick, etc. This is gonna reach critical mass, I'm excited.

             ITS ALWAYS A FUCKING ASSUALT RIFLE. 
No one just 'has' an assault rifle and goes 'you know what, fuck it... time to investigate this thing properly'
