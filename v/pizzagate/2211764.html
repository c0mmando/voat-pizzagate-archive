            So question and not that I am convinced either way as a there has been good evidence on her part and also I honestly believe that ALL ROADS LEAD TO PIZZA but b this seems awfully time convienent...what say you all about the timing of the brothers charges? Setup...or is he a db that needs exterminating? Asking for a friend

             It's a good question. I'm sort of on the fence about that myself.
            </p>
            <p>
             The most reasonable way to look at it is that Paddock was involved with child trafficking, and that if he were involve, undoubtedly the brother was, too. So perhaps the charge is a means to an end ... a truism in that he was in possession of CP, but that the arrest served a double purpose. The Paddocks don't look like the most dependable people on earth (understatement), so they could be afraid he'd talk .... or try to wring money out of them as blackmail (as if that was going to happen), or get a bigger cut, or move up into the position his brother held.
            </p>
            <p>
             So all of the above, but my best guess is that the CP was real and that the Paddocks were dirty. It's why they were targeted and we can prove that statement true because of the wiretap the DEA took out on him. This was before anything in LV happened. Therefore, there was a loose end, they needed a false flag, and they got rid of Paddock (the loose end) and got their push for gun control.

              listen to the full interview with his brother. eric says he was the youngest brother and basically that stephen is pretty much why him and they're mom are rich. he was talking about how he helped the few who were close to him. he said that his brother was smart enough to do whatever he wanted. he also said:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               When Steve can do this we are in deep shit because there's just nothing there. You find me where someone who's like Steve does this.
               <br/>
               I hope to hell they find when they do the autopsy that there's a tumor in his head or something because if they don't we're all in trouble.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              it's hard to know what he's saying here, but to me he's saying that while he believes his brother is capable of carrying out the shooting, thats not something his brother would ever do. he was hoping for a tumor to explain it but his autopsy didn't reveal anything.
             </p>
             <p>
              what is he referring to when he says someone like steve? someone intelligent, or maybe someone trained?
              <br/>
              why are we all in trouble if no tumor is found? is it because whatever kind of person steve was, there are others like him and might they do something similiar?
             </p>
             <p>
              just questions for now.

               Well, for one this guy isn't wrapped too tight so take everything with a grain of sand.

               No way do I buy the innocent act. He knew, his brother knew, exactly what Stephen was into. You gotta remember that his dad was a scumbag so they're very used to lying covering for the "breadwinner". Think that's what he very inarticulately expressed. As for the tumor, if there were something like that to explain the crime spree, that POS brother could probably get a book and movie deal because "it wasn't his fault"! Yeah, that wouldn't explain why someone would get into trafficking children, and the allegations are out there. See how the loss of the hard drive helps this scumbag?

               It's not always true, but in this case the apple didn't fall far from the tree.

             There are several pictures and videos on this site. Do you think there's just trash on that field? Look at the dead man covering up his wife with his own body, giving up his life for hers. Why don't you Google his/her name if you're really, think everyone whose life was needlessly destroyed on 10/1 was a "paid crises actor."

             I agree no deaths or injuries- the place should have evidence of bullets hitting, walls, the ground, windows, cars, signs - yet nothing. The gunfire came from the sound system. Even people there that night were saying it was fake gunfire.

             GodLikeProductions has plenty of videos showing bullet holes especially behind and in front of the stage. Most videos were taken at a distance IN RESPECT FOR THE DYING. Those are real people among the heaps of trash and not just fake bodies. Close-up videos showing many bullet holes among the mass of blood were immediately taken down out of consideration to the families who had not yet been notified.

               Look I LIVE in Vegas. I know people who worked the concert as a gig. Do YOU? They' were lucky to be working behind the scenes in tech but they'll still have PTSD for the rest of their lives.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sure there are shills on GLP. Doesn't mean that there aren't posters ripping Tavistock &amp; Naval Intelligence apart. Dozens and dozens of videos, especially the beginning ones wiped from the internet for being way too revealing, have been posted on GLP and analyzed by the core of retired military officers and long-term hobbyist gun collectors discussing the kinds of weapons used just by their sound.
              </p>
              <p>
               Would you like me to post the latest &amp; brand new videos never before posted on the internet? Perhaps the ER Head Trauma Nurse who finally had a few moments to be interviewed just 1 week ago can tell you about his experiences running triage for Vegas's main hospital. Shall I get you a list of the surgeons who answered the emergency calls and flew in from UT &amp; CA?
              </p>
              <p>
               How about coming to Vegas and looking for yourself at all of the white crosses by the "Welcome to Vegas Sign" just South of Mandalay Bay. Each one has a victim's name, photo, flowers, and STILL weeping relatives and loved ones trying to honor their memory.
              </p>
              <p>
               Those in the know are well aware a LOT MORE than 60 people lost their lives. Yet sub-humans like you sit in comfort at home and cruelly rant about how ALL of them are fakers. Want the contact number of the TX lawyer whose offering free consults for the victims loved ones? Ask him if he's wasting all of his time talking to "paid crises actors."
              </p>
              <p>
               FYI I've worked as a crises actor years ago when I was new to Vegas. NV requires 1st Responders to have regular drills to coordinate and to time their efforts. I have seen the ads in Backstage West aimed at Vegas, and on Craigslist Vegas. They were NOT getting shot up at the concert, or running for their lives. "Crowds on Demand" of Los Angeles, indirectly being paid by the anti-Christ Soros, sent paid day workers to anti-Trump rallies.
              </p>
              <p>
               Do I believe Mandalay Bay shoved a few faux victims in front of the MSM to make the brainless believe no one was actually hurt? Read the comments of complete outrage all over the internet from the loved ones of the ACTUAL INJURED.
              </p>
              <p>
               Coroner's Office was forced by TPTB to be on lockdown. Victims' number were way underestimated. Why didn't the numbers go up from the initial count of the deceased as is always the case in a terrible tragedy? Severely wounded often end up dying from the loss of blood.
              </p>
              <p>
               Those who LIE without seeking out evidence have NO SOUL. I will post videos of gunshots if that would give you a conscience.

              Nonsnse.  I have seen videos of the scene after 'bodies' removed - no bullet holes anywhere. You can also see many videos of the 'massacre' taking place, yet no bullets are hitting anything, the ground never gets damaged and you also never see any person get hit.

              I don’t think it was fake.  They are definitely lying to us about who was behind it and why they did it.  But I think there were real deaths and injuries
             </p>
             <p>
              Below is video that is the most graphic I’ve seen.  It’s been removed from all sites except this one. I watched it on my phone peeking between my hands
             </p>
             <p>
              So since I watched peeking through my hands on such a small screen, I didn’t REALLY see how real or fake it was. From what I saw through my hands, though, it looked pretty real to me.
             </p>
             <p>
              I tried to post link here but voat won’t allow it so if you want to see for yourself, put the following in the google bar and it comes up:
“squawker there are no emts video“
             </p>
             <p>
              I’d like an opinion on this.  It looks very real to me??

                  The video came out a few days after the shooting And a few people online claiming to be EMTs watched it a while back and commented saying they were likely all people who were alive but had no chance of survival.  Said in triage They have to pick and choose who to try to save.  They said These were likely the ones they left behind.

            Had a thought,  could it been Bruce that was shot in hotel, and the arrest was Stephen?
           </p>
           <p>
            All I heard in regards to the autopsy was that everything looked fine with the brain.
            <br/>
            Saw one bloody pic of shooter, didnt know if real, but could have easily been Bruce.
Then again, maybe there wasnt even a body

             The bloody pic of the shooter is interesting in that it clearly shows attached earlobes, the pictures of Paddock that have come ouy show his were detached

             Hey, I had an even squirrelier thought!!! Here goes some major speculation:: If Paddock was involved in child trafficking, what if Campos was either helping or facilitating trafficking into Mexico. He could have taken that hard drive.

              That's a good scenario, will keep that one in mind

             <p>
              So where's Mister Maintenance?   He riding dirty with Campos?  maybe he the one maybe grazed/shot Campos, maybe he has it?
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't even know if we have a dead body, but we do know Campos and Maintenance man were there And both stories suck

             Every single journalist or independent researcher could have something you could criticise them for... how about we just deal in facts  and not worry about personalities. So many jumping on here to criticise I suspect she is onto something and a concerted effort to discredit her personally is taking place.

             She's come up with solid evidence. She's the one that got proof that Paddock checked in earlier and the timeline changed because of her. She also has a parking receipt that showed Paddock's girlfriend parked the car on Oct 1st. Either that or a woman using her name did.

             I agree.  I don't trust Loomer.  There are tons of social media posts and YouTube videos of eyewitnesses saying there were shooters in other casinos, and generally shooters on the ground, yet she releases a blurry video that might or might not be someones legs that's supposed to be the proof of multiple shooters.  It's "almost" like she is using reverse psychology to make us think there's no evidence of multiple shooters:  "Pay no attention to all of the eyewitnesses!  The best evidence we have is this blurry, useless video!"
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, remember that today MegaAnon's parting thought was:

              [Cory Feldman's] NO different than "Bruce Paddock" and "Adam Lanza" as related to pizza and how (((they're))) USING IT AGAINST YOU by manipulating your good intensions and undying quests for the truth by being all too eager to connect dots with squiggly instead of straight lines.

             In other words, the Vegas Massacre was a deep state operation, but it is probably not connected to pizzagate, and the deep state is trying to bait us into linking it to pizzagate to muddy the waters and lead us down false rabbit holes ("connecting dots with squiggly lines").

             That's just what the lying MSM claims because Loomer wanted to interview "Jesus Campos."  FBI didn't like the fact Loomer was exposing the fact "Jesus Campos," who appeared to be very nervous on Ellen and reading very scripted answers, looked completely different from the real "Jesus Campos" as identified by a Vegas high school student in his class.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please explain why the FBI posted a picture of "Jesus Campos" supposedly receiving an award from MGM Corp at an Aria restaurant with their OLD decor prior to their summer remodel. The date he was claimed to have received this award was clearly AFTER 10/1//17. Photo Shop anyone?
