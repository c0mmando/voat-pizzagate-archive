<p>The fact that a well known Catholic priest in good standing is publicly confirming in a series of videos the existence of elite pedophile in high levels of government and in the Church, is an extraordinary event and vindicates our struggle to bring this information to the public. As a Catholic I can attest that it is unprecedented for a Catholic priest to speak publicly about issues like this. There is no other priest I know who would be brave enough, and maybe even informed enough to talk about US politicians engaging in pedophilia and occult activities.</p>
<p>FR. RIPPERGER DISCUSSES PEDOPHILIA IN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE CHURCH</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://osmm.org/retreats/our-ladys-role-in-spiritual-warfare">Fr. Chad Ripperger</a>, a well known exorcist and traditional Catholic priest, gave a series of (very well illustrated) video lectures on the prophecies of Our Lady regarding our times. <a href="https://gloria.tv/video/NpPFAEU3tQjv2w1h46hmTdFj9">In Part I,</a> he discusses <a href="wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/">the Podesta emails</a>. His experiences as an exorcist have led him to do his own research on the subject of the globalist pedophile elite. His consultations with other exorcists have confirmed his conclusions that we are in the midst of a cosmic battle between good and evil, and the Satanic forces are extraordinarily strong and resistant to the Church\'s rite of exorcism and prayers.</p>
<p>Some of the subjects he mentions:</p>
<p>Draining the Swamp: ( -10:34) &quot;You talk about draining the swamp---what does that even mean? When you drain a swamp, it gets to stinking real bad when you first start the draining process, and we\'re in that phase right now.&quot;</p>
<p>37:01 &quot;If you were paying attention, not to the news media, but to what was going on during the election, Comey\'s declaration that we have to investigate Hillary was a smokescreen, and it was a smokescreen to keep people off of the last stage of the Wikileaks, because in the last stage of the Wikileaks, two things come out which we already know. The first is that the worldwide elite, whom we already know, the Clintons and John Podesta, who was Hillary\'s campaign manager, were involved in pedophilia. It\'s right in the emails. You can read it right out of the emails yourself. I\'m not making this stuff up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Second of all, Hillary Clinton was involved in the occult, and that\'s what they didn\'t want coming out.&quot;</p>
<p>He goes on to mention the growing trend of pedophilia in the US govt, as detailed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpQ5f5U4H3M">The Franklin Scandal by Nick Bryant </a>which describes the presence of call boys at the Bush White House and how heads of state went to the Epstein\'s Island in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Fr. Chad talks about how many politicians and heads of state are involved in occult worship at Bohemian\'s Grove
which is overt Moloch worship. This was revealed for the whole world to see at the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-36428799">Gotthard Tunnel opening ceremony in Switzerland last summer. </a></p>
<p>Fr. Chad said he has to deal with this stuff because he is an exorcist and gets &quot;all this garbage coming at him all the time so he\'s had to make some sense of it. Other exorcists have helped him to get a sense of it. </p>
<p>PEDOPHILE CLERGY IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH</p>
<p>Fr. Chad then discusses the problem of pedophile clergy. The percentage of pedophiles in the clergy (from three different university studies, all of which concur) is about 1.25% of the clergy. He says the real mistake and scandal wasn\'t the fact that some priests are pedophiles, even though the damage they did was incalculable---the problem is how the bishops handled it. That was where the real scandal was. </p>
<p>There was one diocese---which he doesn\'t name---which has never been sued. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Bruskewitz">Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz</a> of Lincoln, Nebraska) because there were two instances of pedophilia that the bishop found out about, and he immediately laicized the priests when he found out the allegations were in fact true, and he went to the families and said, &quot;Let\'s make this right. We\'ll do whatever we can to make this right.&quot; </p>
<p>(I can confirm that I\'ve heard the same claims many times from many multiple sources. Bishop Bruskewitz reportedly kept a shotgun in his pickup truck which he said he wouldn\'t hesitate to use on a child molester priest if he ever caught one in his diocese.)</p>
<p>The reason the Church was being sued was because the bishops were shuffling these guys around and not taking responsibility and dealing with the problem. </p>
<p>The next statistic is that of the general population which is that 2.75% of the general population are pedophiles so the number of priests who are pedophiles is less than half of the general population.</p>
<p>Of professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, 8% have a problem with pedophilia---6X the percentage of Catholic priests.</p>
<p>Of high school teachers, the percentage is 10%. </p>
<p>RISE OF SATANISM</p>
<p>At -14:22 Father Chad starts talking about the rise in Satanism and the unprecedented resilience of the demons to the rite of exorcism and the prayers. Older exorcists have told him that up until the mid-1960\'s the cases of demonic possession would be resolved in about a day to two days. The average case now takes between 10 months and 2 years to break.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lasalette.org/index.php/apparition/the-story/703-the-message-of-our-lady-of-la-salette">Our Lady of La Salette</a> (-4:47) prophesied in 1846 that &quot;all the civil govts would have a plan which will be to abolish and do away with every religious principle, to make way for materialism, atheism, occultism and vices of all kinds.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/AKITA.HTM">Our Lady of Akita in Japan</a> predicted in 1973 a great chastisement on mankind. Today we pooh-pooh this, but if you act badly, God has to punish you because He loves you and wants you to get your act together. Our Lady of Akita said the chastisement will be greater than the Deluge, and fire will fall from the sky. A great part of humanity will perish and the living will envy the dead. </p>
<p>Fr. Chad: &quot;What this all means in the political sphere is that there is a gargantuan battle for the truth. Some say this is just a battle of ideas, but what it really is, is this: for the longest time we were being told that by people that it was really a difference in ideas and an intellectual fight. I think that may be true for some people, but I\'ve come to the conclusion that was just the facade for the evil people to push the process in the battle between good and evil. We\'re in the midst---politically, in the Church, in families---if we\'re not in the middle of a battle between good and evil. This is not a battle between ideas anymore. What the outcome will be is largely dependent upon us and our prayers and sacrifices to turn things around.&quot;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION
Take it for whatever it\'s worth to you, but this is sign that the Pizzagate claims are going mainstream, and it is a promising sign that we have reputable Catholic exorcists verifying our research.</p>',

            I feel like there is a slight misrepresentation in the percentages. The article said about 1.25% of clergy; then 8% of professionals like doctors  and  lawyers, and 10% of high school teachers.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The next statistic is that of the general population which is that 2.75% of the general population are pedophiles so the number of priests who are pedophiles is less than half of the general population."
           </p>
           <p>
            I imagine that 2.75% of the general population is significantly greater than 1.25% of clergy. Meaning that "less than half of the general population" would probably be better represented in actual numbers (or at least a common denominator) than percentages of each group.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, if we have 323,000,000 people being the general population of the US (rather than the 7.6 billion on Earth), and "in 2012, there were a total of 414,313 priests" in the world, then the percentages will show significantly less than "less than half of the general population" which would be an equivalent of  stating less than 50% of the general population (the number of priests in the whole world don't even make up 50% of the general population of the US alone).
           </p>
           <p>
            Although, I understand the point of the article, I feel like it is very important for the sake of misinformation that the scale isn't skewed. I recently had an acquaintance denounce all Catholics for having the highest rate of pedophilia.

            ok, my question is why do you associate yourself with a religion that has all these pedophiles in it? not only that, but the bishops, in positions of power therein, covering all this bullshit up??? and by the way, under no circumstances does God PUNISH people for their deeds. God is benevolent and loving, and as such has granted us FREE WILL. it is up to us as a society to get this situation under control. this fire and brimstone BS has got to go. we, as members of the human race, have to put our big boy pants on and take responsibility for our planet and the people, plants &amp; animals on it. now, having said that, do i think this is a spiritual war? yes i fucking do, but eventually we come together across party lines, religious lines, race lines etc., to stand up to these evil bastards.

            The author Scott Peck, wrote People of the Lie.  Basically exploring evil people.  He became a believer while investigating exorcisms.  In each and every case, the demon was not cast out until the person called out to Jesus.  It is a fascinating book, btw.

            He is the Road less traveled author, too.  Excellent book.

            Catholicism is not Christian. This guy should explore the occult aspects of his own religion and forthwith denounce Catholicism as the heresy it is.

             Catholicism was instituted by Christ.  We follow the teachings of a Christ.  The Bible was written by Catholic monks.   Other Christian faiths did not come into existence until 1500 years later.  We know the Bible is God’s word.  We regard the sacraments as signs instituted by Christ to confer Grace.  He gave authority to the apostles at the Last Supper.  He said to Peter, “ You are Peter ( whose name means rock),and upon this rock, I will build my Church.  And the gates of hell shall not prevail.  Don’t know where you get your info.  If you have any questions, I can recommend many good reads.   As Christ prayed, we pray that someday we may all be one,  God bless you.

              Aha.
             </p>
             <p>
              First of all, Christ is the head of the Church, no one else. Christ never appointed Peter the head of anything. Besides, there is no proof of Peter ever even going to Rome.
             </p>
             <p>
              Secondly, answer truly, did Christ or any of the apostles state that the following things should be done, or are they found anywhere else in the Bible:
             </p>
             <p>
              -pray for the dead and to Mary
             </p>
             <p>
              -veneration of angels and dead saints, plus their canonization
             </p>
             <p>
              -the worship of Mary, which is pure pagan goddess-worship and an abomination(!)
             </p>
             <p>
              -the concept of purgatory
             </p>
             <p>
              -the temporal power of pope
             </p>
             <p>
              -worship of images and relics (idolatry!)
             </p>
             <p>
              -the Rosary and repetitive pagan prayer
             </p>
             <p>
              -inquisition
             </p>
             <p>
              -indulgences
             </p>
             <p>
              -transubstantation
             </p>
             <p>
              -confession of sin to priest
             </p>
             <p>
              -the Bible forbidden to laymen, no doubt so they could not see what a hoax the Catholic "Church" was pulling off
             </p>
             <p>
              -seven sacraments
             </p>
             <p>
              -immaculate conception
             </p>
             <p>
              -papal infallibility
             </p>
             <p>
              -assumption of the virgin Mary
             </p>
             <p>
              I could go on and list more absolute heresies, but do try to point out to me which biblical passages justify all these bizarre pagan customs? Let's face it, the Catholic "church" is a pagan sect. The truth is in the Bible, not in the hoax that is Catholicism.
             </p>
             <p>
              I sincerely hope you will find the truth, reject all Catholic nonsense, read the Bible and turn to the Lord and ONLY the Lord. God bless.

               Not even history agrees with you son.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                St. Cyprian of Carthage (251 AD).
               </strong>
               On him he builds the Church, and commands him to feed the sheep [Jn 21:17], and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles, yet he founded a single chair [cathedra], and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity. Indeed, the others were also what Peter was [apostles], but a primacy is given to Peter, by which it is made clear that there is one Church and one chair. . . . If someone does not hold fast to this unity of Peter, can he think that he holds the faith? If he deserts the chair of Peter upon whom the Church was built, can he be confident that he is in the Church?
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                St. Jerome (376 AD)
               </strong>
               . As I follow no leader save Christ, so I communicate with none but your blessedness, that is, with the chair of Peter. For this, I know, is the rock on which the Church is built! [Mt 16:18]. This is the only house where the Paschal Lamb can be rightly eaten [Ex 12:22]. This is the Ark of Noah, and he who is not found in it shall perish when the flood prevails.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                St. Augustine of HIppo (400 AD)
               </strong>
               . For if the lineal succession of bishops is to be taken into account, with how much more certainty and benefit to the Church do we reckon back until we reach Peter himself, to whom, as a figure of the whole Church, the Lord said: “Upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it!” [Mt 16:18]. The successor of Peter was Linus, and his successors in unbroken continuity were these: Clement, Anacletus, Evaristus, Alexander, Sixtus, Telesphorus, Iginus, Anicetus, Pius, Soter, Eleutherius, Victor, Zephyrinus, Calixtus, Urbanus, Pontianus, Antherus, Fabianus, Cornelius, Lucius, Stephanus, Xystus, Dionysius, Felix, Eutychianus, Gaius, Marcellinus, Marcellus, Eusebius, Miltiades, Sylvester, Marcus, Julius, Liberius, Damasus, and Siricius, whose successor is the present Bishop Anastasius. In this order of succession no Donatist bishop is found.

            Listening to the talk, I agree that satan is ruling through freemasonry and that they're inculcating children with i.deas that will corrupt humanity. Euthanasia laws are the thin end of the wedge. Young people who are depressed or having botched surgeries are now being euthanased in Europe.

            Fake news. The John Jay study commissioned by the Catholic church found 4% of priests were abusing kids, not the ridiculously low 1.25% this phony claims. Many areas were even higher- 10% in Boston. They knew, they still know, it's still going on. A bishop in my area lied under oath about priests who have AIDS and serve in the diocese. They placed a known abuser in the biggest church in the area. 
A respected Catholic exorcist? This is insane. Is this disinformation, shills or what?

              Experts disagree on the rate of sexual abuse among the general American male population, but Allen says a conservative estimate is one in 10. Margaret Leland Smith, a researcher at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says her review of the numbers indicates it's closer to one in 5. But in either case, the rate of abuse by Catholic priests is not higher than these national estimates.

             I don't know here OP cites his figures, but the fact of the matter is that Priests abuse at a lower rate than the national average.

              It does.  In fact, the full rite of exorcism cannot be performed in a parish without the express permission of the bishop.  A priest may attempt it without approval, or with a refusal, but it's not going to work.

              Looking at Church Militant's current story on  the gay Jesuit "father" Martin controversy (he's been chosen to be the speaker at Cardinal Dolan's upcoming Pope Leo award in NYC): Don't understand if in 2011 Archbishop Dolan new to NYC was against gay marriage as an "ominous threat" to everything good and decent  " , he is now firmly in their camp? Someone promise him something in exchange for his support of gays in the Church, all against Scripture and Church teaching?(Like being made cardinal?) Or does somebody have something on him?
             </p>
             <p>
              Strange to go 180 degrees in position in 6 years. Maybe that's what living in NYC does to people: they lose their moral compass,sort of like a Bermuda Triangle .

            Great article!

           <p>
            To paraphrase Ralph McInerny, Notre Dame philosophy professor: "When religious faith goes, far more rigorous dogmas take its place." Rigorous and evil.

            Can't believe the faces of the VIP audience at that Swiss tunnel opening. Not a disgusted,shocked,dismayed look anywhere.
Two ibexes screwing!!!

           <p>
            Do you remember the Temple of Baal reproductions they were going to erect last Easter in NYC and London? They backed down because people voiced their disgust. I sent a email to a couple of the female board members of the Oxford connected group that was sponsoring this. These "professors emeriti" who lend their names to this sacrilege have got to be in their dotage.

             Oxford yes, but UNESCO drew my attention. These sick bastards were planning on going mainstream with Baal, Molech, Isis, ect. Testing the waters, maybe. I am certainly no muzzy lover, and I do support the preserving of original temples for historical purposes even if they were evil in nature, but these religious extremists might have had just cause in this case. I think they know who the problem is, and who they worship. This funding/backing of these groups was indeed to draw them out for slaughter, and plan b for the satanists was to grab Syria for all kinds of gains, not the least of which is the Leviathan pipeline linked to the Qatar. Now that Qatar knows that they would have been blocked out of the plan, they shifted sides after a heated argument with the authors of the plan.

           </p>
           <p>
            Like any father, He disciplines out of love. We do the same to teach our kids to save money, cross the road safely and to not take candy from stranger. Spiritually, it’s no different, as we begin to see things spiritually, we can only wonder at the cosmic grandness of His plan for us, thus we should trust his discipline.
           </p>

            Additionally, all eyes on this friar. I’m not Catholic, but I’m into truth, and I know that there are sincere, God loving people in any faith. I will pray for his safety and success. He will likely be chastised by the Church, hopefully not disappeared.

             Thank you.  So many good and Holy priests are being maligned because of the few bad priests.  if people only knew what Holy priests do.  Visiting the sick at 3 am, praying with the dying. Hearing confessions and granting pardon.  Administering the Sacraments.  Glad to see your comment. God bless .

              Depends where you live, and which Catholics you know.  Our Church has become more devout over the years.  We’ve been blessed with Holy priests who did not shy away from giving homilies about the evils of sin, and the blessings of God’s grace.  Many of our parishioners spend Holy Hours in front of the Tabernacle, praying, petitioning, thanking God.   We’ve had priests speak about Satan, and the war he is engaging in, 
The truth is, the more devoted to God the faithful are, the better priests you get.
              <br/>
              It’s been a terrible scourge on the Church with poorly formed priests, but there is a new generation of good men coming into the priesthood.

            Scientifically proven a majority of Priests doing exorcisms are handling young kids brought up in very Conservative households where sexuality is not discussed. Therefore the victims don't understand when "the Devil" comes to them in the middle of the night to molest them. Alternately they are having disturbed thoughts as a result of severe sexual trauma occurring at other times in their lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            The exorcism process provides some psychological healing. More important it brings family and community light that there's an issue with the child which is definitely not their fault. Many perps dislike the glare of attention by outsiders and therefore stop the abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the molester is a relative who has access to the child, a wise Priest will uncover the truth and be able to intervene. Perhaps this is why the above Priest is such an advocate of decency.

              Because this is bullshit. Priests are "advocates of decency?" Educate yourself. The filth the Catholic church brings to every place it goes is well-known. Look at Ireland- children raped and tortured, mass graves of infants. Look at NY and CA- they refuse to change the statute of limitations because of Catholic control. For anyone from the RCC to present themselves as against Pizzagate- the RCC IS Pizzagate.

               I was referring to situations in which a relative living in the family home is going to the young child's bedroom in the middle of the night and molesting her. The initially sleeping child thinks she's having a nightmare and is being bothered by "The Devil."
              </p>
              <p>
               Yes bringing a very wise Priest to the family home for repeated visits will stop the perp's behavior. Why? Priest who is moral and experienced in exorcisms will know to 1st find out who ever has access to the child's bedroom. Mother may not be able to accept that her relative is harming her child, and therefore would block the info. Often it's a case where the woman has herself been molested and chosen to mentally block reality.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bringing a lot of questioning strangers into the home has outed many perps especially in small town communities. Or the molester will voluntarily leave the home, especially after realizing there will be many follow-ups with the child by the priest or those neighbors trying to find out if the exorcism actually worked.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sorry you don't get the practical advantages of an exorcism. My purpose was also to show how the priest doing the exorcisms was aware to the huge extent of the problem of child sexual abuse by relatives.
              </p>
              <p>
               Online reading shows that this fact is almost universal in poor families who take in borders, or where a lot of people sleep in the same, small area, and young children aren't taught how to combat sexual abuse.
              </p>
              <p>
               Or children are afraid to speak out aware of the fact their family needs the step-father's, relative's or border's financial contributions to the household.

            It's kind of shocking to hear a Catholic priest talk about this.  Are you sure he's Roman Catholic, and not from a breakaway order?
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1886, Pope Leo XIII had a vision in which he was told to include a prayer to St Michael in Mass, as added protection against a growing evil in the world.  The late Victorian period saw the rise of the New Thought movement (a precursor to both the New Age shit and modern magic/occultism/angel worship), as well as secularism, socialism, the general atomization of Western society, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            One reason why exorcisms take so long to get approved now is because of the rise of New Age bullshit, as well as a general heightened interest  in exorcisms, demons, etc.  It was the publishing of that stupid Exorcist book, honestly.  There was so much attention placed on it that the Church decided there needed to be absolute airtight evidence, with as little margin for error as possible, before granting one.  And yes, there are clear signs that have to be documented and verified.
           </p>
           <p>
            Catholics don't talk about this stuff.  Ever.  The most I've ever heard a priest discuss evil in public was before the last election, when the redpill-as-fuck Millennial priest in my parish would give his homilies about why it was a sin to vote for the Democrats.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless of whether or not you believe in the devil, it's not a stretch to imagine that unaccountable, above-the-law politicians and elites would find the occult appealing.  In Genesis, Satan essentially promises that if you just listen to him, you can be gods in your own time.  It feeds into the conceit of power, the arrogance, the depraved desire to indulge every single sick impulse they have.  And especially if you don't believe in anything, why not?  Why not con some underage boy into sex?  Why not participate in a black mass?  What's the harm?

             Thanks so much for your great comments. Fr. Chad Ripperger is indeed a priest in good standing. He was ordained in the Fraternity of St. Peter and left them to start his own order called Our Sorrowful Mother's Ministry which has been approved by  Bishop John Paprocki:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              OSMM was named a Private Association of the Lay Faithful by the Most Reverend Thomas John Paprocki, Bishop of the Diocese of Springfield in Illinois. We are grateful to Bishop Paprocki for this designation and are faithful and obedient to him and all the teachings of the Catholic Church.

              Thanks for the confirmation.  I don't necessarily blame the priests and orders who left after Vatican II, but it's not something that I'm prepared to do myself.  It's nice to know there are principled priests still here.

               I'm not ready to leave either. They'll have to kick me out of the Catholic Church. : ) Doesn't mean I like everything that's going on, but it's still possible to find parishes and people who are of like mind who still believe in traditional Catholicism and carve a niche out for oneself and family.

            Interesting stuff.  I personally believe there is a true battle between good and evil going on and it is supernatural as well as natural.

             This, if you can't see the metaphysical aspects of this whole thing, you're useless to the cause. These people are OCCULTISTS, and if your mindset is "that has nothing to do with anything," then you're not helping anything. The occultism is EVERYTHING. The pedophilia comes from the OCCULT TEACHINGS that these "people" follow.

              Occult simply meaning hidden. I always did like that Christian saying, "you may not believe in Satan, but he believes in you."

                 So, given a basic understanding of some pretty rudimentary math, physics, and biology, this logical argument can be made very quickly. It shows that there must be a creator, and a few things that must be true about him. Once that conclusion is reached, then it can be used in the premise of the next argument, who are what is the creator? I'll introduce some very basic stuff in quotation boxes, so skip them if you know them.

                <p>
                 So using this basic knowledge we can prove to an incredible certainty that one must conclude that there is a creator. Let us begin.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ignoring the "scientific" beginning of nothing exploded into everything and happened to form in great order, we will tackle the lowest hanging fruit, the random generation life, or abiogenesis. In some random corner of the universe everything lined up just right, and voila, we have life. This basic atheistic argument used to work when we thought life and cells were just little blobs of goo. But, the more we begin to understand about science and biology, the more we understand that life cannot appear on it's own. It must be created.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So let's take a step back from the complexities of life forms, and just look at one very basic component. Proteins. Proteins are not complex at all compared to life and it's dna information. Life forms already have thousands of folded proteins. If the universe could luckily form life, surely one small basic piece of only a few parts wouldn't be too difficult right?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let's look at the odds of forming a single protein. There are 250 amino acids, of 20 types chained together in a specific order and then folded. Ignoring the protein folding which is it's own subject, there are 20

                 random protein chains each with a length of 250 amino acids. That is to say, there are 250 times more amino acids(AA) in this hypothetical universe than atoms in the real one. And rather than using the 500 amino acids, we'll use only the 20 that work. Now, the entire universe will shift at once, all of the AA will recombine themselves into new completely random proteins. Now the math will be a bit off because they can't actually all be random, but we'll pretend that they can. Look at how much energy is required for the mass of the entire universe to shift. Now this shifting is going to happen at 100 trillion times every second. Now how long will it take to get an unfolded but functional protein in this universe?

                  Conclusion
                 </strong>
                </p>
                <pre><code>1) At present, intelligent minds are the only verifiable method whereby non-trivial levels of functional information can be produced
2) The genomes of life contain non-trivial levels of functional information.
3) Therefore, the only explanation we have at present for the functional information encoded in the genomes of life is that it was produced by an intelligent mind.
</code></pre>
                <p>
                 There must be an intelligent creator. He exists, but we have proven that his origin could not come from matter as we know it; so his existence is outside the realm of our understanding. He is smart enough to create and code dna.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The next step is to take these conclusions as the premise of our next arguments. There is a god/creator, but how powerful is he, did he create the universe as some speculate? Has god revealed himself to us in the pages of history? Now there are logical approaches to these subjects that don't involve scoffing at the very idea of god and works that only he could do.

                 <p>
                  What if I told you I believe the universe was created, but we as humans will never understand who or what created it. I believe the christian religions and every other form of religion on this planet is complete made up bullshit only being used to control the masses and to gain power. I believe that our actual creator has better things to do than worry about simple lifeforms on a spec of dust the same way we see germs on the floor. Use all the math you want but you will never solve that problem. Until there is clear evidence, say Jesus Christ comes back, then you could change my mind. Right now I believe no one will ever know the truth about such a creator. Yet our species will still fight and kill ourselves over such stupid ideas and prejudices. Thanks for replying though friend.

                    Of course, down through history various alternative naturalistic explanations of the resurrection have been proposed, such as the Conspiracy Hypothesis, the Apparent Death Hypothesis, the Hallucination Hypothesis, and so on. In the judgment of contemporary scholarship, however, none of these naturalistic hypotheses has managed to provide a plausible explanation of the facts. Nor does Dr. Ehrman support any of these naturalistic explanations of the facts.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So why, we may ask, does Dr. Ehrman not accept the resurrection as the best explanation? The answer is simple: the resurrection is a miracle, and Dr. Ehrman denies the possibility of establishing a miracle. He writes, “Because historians can only establish what probably happened, and a miracle of this nature is highly improbable, the historian cannot say it probably occurred.” [8] This argument against the identification of a miracle is an old one, already refuted in the 18th century by such eminent scholars as William Paley and George Campbell, and is rejected as fallacious by most contemporary philosophers as well.

                   Which perfectly explains why acknowledging the existence of god and miracles is necessary to have a discussion about the resurrection of Jesus.

                   Nope. It proves there is A god with extremely high confidence (thousands of decimals). I always start at the beginning. The first step is to prove that there is an intelligent god who exists outside of our knowledge. It's generally been very difficult to get people to admit this! But once there, the fun begins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Proving Jesus was and is that creator requires the premise that there is a creator who can work miracles to begin with. Miracles are possible since we know there is a god who exists outside of our knowledge of physics. Therefore when presenting evidence for miracles, they cannot be laughed and dismissed as crazy, but must be refuted with rational and reasonable arguments. Since a miracle is not impossible, it is possible to use historical methods to evaluate them. How do we know what happened in history? There is a science to history!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We use that science to evaluate the historicity of the bible. Show evidence that the miracles are historical events. The predictions of the future in the past were made before the things happened. But rather than go over every single miracle with care, and take a very long time, it's easiest to pick out the biggest, most foundational and easiest to prove miracle. The resurrection of Jesus from the dead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   When argued from a logical perspective inside the presupposition that there is a god, laughing at the idea and dismissing it is not a valid argument! If the evidence shows that a miracle had a low probability of being a lie, then it can be concluded it was not a lie with varying degrees of certainty. Using the same methods that we use for other historical events, we can prove that there is no other explanation for Jesus' empty tomb other than his resurrection from the dead. It is a longer argument than a simple math equation, and the certainty is certainly not to 10

                Exactly. If you're fighting an enemy who believes that he is sacrificing people to Santa Claus for magical powers, even if you think it's bullshit, you have to understand the mindset of your enemy or else you'll never be able to defeat him. These people AREN'T NORMAL. You can't apply the way that you look at the world to these people, because everything you imagine as being horrible and evil, they see as being holy and good.
