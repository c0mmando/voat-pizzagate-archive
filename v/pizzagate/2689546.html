            Space fronts 1st Street, with outdoor seating capability. Great spot for catering and take away meals., surrounded by condos and hotel. Plenty of street and site parking surrounding property.
           </p>
           <p>
            Across the street from the Holiday Inn on Indian Rocks Beach, which is on the Intracoastal Waterway. Holiday Inn is also currently constructing six and seven story time share condominiums directly across from the premises with a water park. Located diagonally across the street from the Indian Rocks Beach boat slips on the Intracoastal. Also adjacent to the Indian Rocks Beach Public Park where City Events are held.

              But this could be anything.   even organ Harvesting or to be shipped to a island   maybe even nothing but a simple scam.
Be very careful  don't be alone at night or in general if possible 
You could be kidnapped within seconds alone and never seen again.
If anything else happens give an update asap

               This was just random phishing because I'm on the wrong list of phone numbers.  This is the in-person version of the Nigerian Prince scam where they're looking for gullible idiots.  I'm not being targeted specifically.
