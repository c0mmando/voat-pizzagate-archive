<p>A 64-year-old priest was arrested Tuesday by Fort Atkinson police and accused of multiple charges of sexual assault of a child.
The Rev. William A. Nolan, 64, is expected to appear in Jefferson County court 
 where he could face charges of sexual assault of a child under 12 and repeated sexual assault of a child.
Investigators say the assaults took place at the priest’s office at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church in Fort Atkinson and at the rectory.
The alleged victim, who went to police April, told investigators the assaults by Nolan took place over a five-year span from the ages of 12 to 17, more than 100 assaults took place 
Nolan currently is a retired priest-in-residence at Our Lady Queen of Peace in Madison. He served as priest at St. Joseph’s from 2002 to 2007, according to the Daily Jefferson County Union.
the dates were not available, but it is known that Nolan also was assigned to St. John Vianney in Janesville under the Rev. Gerald Vosen.</p>
<p>&quot;Retired priests have faculties to function as priests in the diocese, but do not have assignments. Often retired priests fill in on a Sunday, if someone is ill or taking a vacation. Fr. Nolan assisted in this manner&quot;.</p>
<p>Parishioners in Fort Atkinson used the words &quot;disbelief&quot; and &quot;shock&quot; on Friday to describe their reactions to allegations that a former priest from their area sexually abused a teenage boy.

            This is how they snag them into their web of crime.  They snare young girls that are from lower income homes that have no way to make money and it is easy and fast money.  But what they don't tell the girls is how they can get beat up, and even tortured.  I have read articles about how they get burned with cigarettes.  It is a horrible and personally demeaning life.  Thank God this girl saw the light.  These are also the girls and boys that the priests prey upon.  Children that come from broken homes with too much time on their hands.  Ripe for the picking by pervert pedophile priests.  All of it horrid.

           <p>
            What in the world?  Where have people go their heads?  Up their ying yangs.  It has been all over tv what happened in Pa and also about Vigano and Cupich.  Are these people living on another planet?  Even my parents know.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am shocked and relieved that the police have arrested him.  Many times they are moved to another parish, then another and another.
