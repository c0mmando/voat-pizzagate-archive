            I consider Facebook Poison.  I am really not connected to any social media.  They are all enemies now.  The only time I go on Facebook is when someone links to some symbols, etc.  I hate them all after the censoring they have imparted upon us.  I think some sites are dipping their toes in the water and we must support and contact them to let them know we are paying attention.  I read on here that someone is dropping flyers all over where they live in different places.  Might be an idea.  T shirts are an idea for those that are adventurous.  We must keep at it to let them know we are not going away.

            I know.  We are all having to deal with great disappointments.  I have not seen new movies in the theater since I can't remember.  They are disgusting.  I did recently see Snowden and that shocked me, although I knew some of it.  The size of the NSA Op. in Hawaii blew me away.  The govt. has gotten way too big.  Not the part that should be taking care of us, but the part that is spying on us and killing our global humans.  Our country is not broke.  We have plenty of money it is just going to the wrong places.  When I give them my money I want it back.  That's what it is for, to take care of ALL of us.  These sick Follywood Stars are taking all our money and giving much of it to the pedo elites.   I have a few more names in mind, and it scares me to think of it.  I have been red pilled so much the pills are bright scarlet red.  But I have plenty of disgust left in my body for those to come.  I saw a list of org. and on it was The Salvation Army.  Have not gotten used to that one yet.

            Trump is buddies with the Clintons. He used to say that he would run as a democrat but he believed he would have a better chance as republican since the voters are "dumber". He is and always has been on the side of the wealthy establishment, banks, and oil. He will continue to wage the same wars that Clinto would have if she won, he will keep Saudi Arabia and Israel as our allies and not much will really change. He is a conman and is good at making things seem like something they are not. The candidates for president are vetted by the deep state before the primaries, so it doesnt matter who would have won. Both major parties are owned and operates by the establishment, Trump just hides it better.  He is receiving hate because he deserves it. Trump thinks the anti-semitic hate crimes are 'false flags' ... im fine with seeing hateful and ignorant messages on an anonymous internet forum, but not from the POTUS.

            They're all over the spectrum; stop playing the politics.  And don't get your hopes up for anybody with power or connections to go down.  Consider that the alphabet agencies are complicit as well as the justice system, the few good ones will be squashed or played out in the process.  Or just taken out.  If anything is to be done it will be outside the system; private.  Highly unlikely (but I can hope.)  The best tack is to get the word out about the extent of danger the children are in, and somehow get info to the parents/guardians on how to protect the kids.  No answer for the CPS, adoption agencies, ones who abuse their own.  Let the sickos eat each other, concentrate on our babies.

            yes - it's on both sides of the political spectrum I think as well.  I think what we are facing here is so large and so pervasive that it will take years to unravel and years to change our culture back to one that respects life, and the rights of children.

            Most countries age of consent is 15. I could show you pictures of 15 yr olds you would find attractive your excuse would be, well he/she doesn't look 15. The more you throw this pedophile word around its just like the liberals calling people racist. It's going to loose its efficacy.

            Thank you the only thing that made me question the legitimacy of pizzagate in the beggining is the fact that it was ONLY implicating democrats. I was like thats bullshit if they want me to believe only people who happen to identify as democrat are the ones involved in this sick shit. That made people believe it was just a crazy right wing attack or some nonsense. IF the ENTIRE truth which is that people from both political affiliations are involved in this shit would hurry and be disclosed people would see oh wait its not just a fake BS story concocted to damage the democratic party and hilary clinton.

            Just just a REAL cray disgusting and very real while disturbing story about the reality of what these elite people with money and power have been doing in secret to chldren. To be honest probably they have been doing this forever the age of social media and technology just advanced faster than the safeguards they had hiding there evils and got out.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that they are allowing the news to lie to us and a google search of pizzagate instantly has debunked at the top of the list while other search engines do not lets me know that honestly a civilian resistance to COMPLETLEY destroy all aspects of the united states government needs to be created.

            It has become to compromised to "drain" in my opinion there can be no draining of the swamp only an elimination of all the beasts that dwell within it. Then and only then will the swamp be safe enough for somebody or a group to go in and clean it out but not before.

            Trump is just a wealthy billionaire, worldly, a sinner, but a patriot, and not sold out. "It is hard to carry a full cup" and he has done well not to make shipwreck of his life. His older brother died an alcoholic, probably was a wake-up call.

            From the beginning of this pizzagate it was always an issue because no matter how Trump cleans shop there is still a strong pedo club with the republicans. This is non partisan for sure. Pray for Trump and hope his watchdogs spot all the betrayers

            My thoughts exactly. Someone always brings up his cabinet picks but always shy away from the fact Obama chose his cabinet based off a letter from Citi Bank. I don't know he exact percentage Obama picked based off that recommendation letter, but it's in the 90s

            Pizzagate research on VOAT must remain non-partisan. I had 2 reactions from this post: 1) yeah, duh, and 2) is this a Shareblu distraction b/c the heat is currently more on them?  We MUST stay out of partisan area -- they are ALL in on it. Partisan theatrics is just that -- for show only.

            In a post Hung Magician, Daryl Easton ruled accident, you will find in a comment by baxterbaxter He says he will never look at Tom Hanks the same way.  In A Video  featuring Tom Hanks dressing up a 6 yr old he claimed was his daughter (she was not)  to look like Jon Benet.  He goes on to make her up with makeup and repeats over and over Sexy Baby.  Sexy Feet over and over as he teaches her to walk sexy and Jimmy Kimmel and his daughter and Ron Howard and his daughter are also featured in this Princess contest he is running.  But you get the obvious idea that he is grooming her.  It is disgusting.  I am no longer watching Kimmel nor will I ever see a Ron Howard movie.  Sick. Sick Sick.  I hope you find the video.

            What would be interesting to know is how many on this list continue(d) to serve in politics. It might be better for investigating techniques if ALL STATES WERE MENTIONED. Good find though!!

            Makes sense why no ones tried to make light of it. And isn't it obvious McCain and graham betraying rats? They got people working for them too in Repub party

            Who are the 7 downvotes on this? Can we look into and do something about those people? How would one do that?
           </p>
           <p>
            This list is massive and this is just from one party in one year! Who did this research, how did they source it? Can we get their help to create more comprehensive non-partisan lists for more years? Because if we could compile a few dozen of these, how hard would it be to red-pill anyone? Honestly!

            The Pedo Ring is global!! From the Vatican to politicians and everyone in between.
This is a religion! Satanism. This is what they practice and worship. They don't think they're doing anything wrong and that's what's wrong. 
Nothing for nothing, many 'approved' religions symbolically share the same traits. From drinking blood via wine and eating flesh via a wafer.

            Religion....ALL religion, is the bane of our existence.

            Thank You! Equal Time! (I felt so alone here, so few green libertarians.) This is such a great post. Almost funny, but it shows we got to shoot both barrels.

            (There's also a comment earlier about the need for arranging things to provide to the DoJ, et al. I think the DoJ, FBI, untold journalists, etc have already been mining this place for months. They all probably have storyboards they are looking at like George Webb. That is probably the best style for waking up the walking dead on the street. Voat and other autist centers are supplying a great deal of data to Interpol and every LE in the world who wants it. This is an incredible service. I think you just keep digging. That's what the good guys want, and what makes the bad guys nervous. And we haven't even begun with Weiner yet.)

            Yeah, I have feeling that the whole thing about him wanting to "show Obama" for that roasting he got at that crappy dinner thing, is more along the lines of wanting to take out the whole thing. The people and the legacy.
           </p>
           <p>
            How better to prove Obama was a piece of shit not fit to lick his boots, let alone publicly mock him with no fear of comeuppance, than to expose his support system compromised entirely of the worst scum imaginable.

             Oh this list helps with my idea of asking how many if any are still working in politics. This narrows down the states that they LIVED in at least. Provided they didn't move this will work for that task. thanks!!

            I found it fascinating when she was looking for names of the recent CA pedo busts she was using megans law sex registry and found several convicted sex offenders who are currently employed with government agencies after and before...  Some changed names a bit, but birth dates, photos and other info would always match, some didn't change a thing.  Also it doesn't look like they have updated the registry in over a year.

            this is beginning to sound a lot like what happened in Belgium during the 90s. even 300,000 people in the streets in Brussels had no effect on any high level arrests. if both sides implicate each other no matter what thread is pulled, it will depend on LE choosing between pro-pedo and anti-pedo. This is not a choice for anyone here, but it's still a good question to get out there, especially since the MSM is hardly reporting any of the pedo ring busts around the world, not to mention scrubbing their sites of the Norway pedo ring, a record breaker by some accounts, which seems to have had a thread to Witch Clinton. MSM: is you is or is you ain't a pedo ring enabler/broker? ... and do you still beat your wife?

             I agree we shouldn't think in sides, but:
             <br/>
             Seeing this on the democrats side (Podesta emails) is what brought most of us here, and those of us not following pedo corruption in government until now started by connecting Podesta's network, which tends to be dems. Reps haven't been discussed as much in the natural course of research in this sub.
             <br/>
             Also, most people out there, the ones we need to wake up, are still very much thinking in sides. Showing that both "sides" are part of one two-headed monster is important. Imagine if the lunatic lefties had gotten a hold of this info before the dem shit got out.

             Fuck knows. Every day someone on this sub blames shit on "the left". I support the green party, pretty left right? Does that make me a fucking pedo sympathiser and Hilary supporter? No, fuck off. It's not all black and white.

                   Communism &amp; Stalinism in particular are imperfect systems, but not every leftist ideology is the same. Calling all leftists Communists is as ignorant as calling all Christians "Catholic"

                      Yep! I've read the communist manifesto and all of das kapital. I really liked the first book of kapital, he assesses the problem correctly. But the rest is bullshit as he doesn't offer a workable solution. I've formally studied marx, engels, etc. so I have a pretty good feel for what is and isn't communism. There are a lot of flavors and offshoots of it.

                     <p>
                      Putin is a Eurasianist who really likes realpolitik. Not a communist. In that sense he was easier to stomach than western european leaders for a while. But he's not ideal.

                       Sorry to assume, but it's so often the case that people throw the term "communist" around very loosely. I definitely have seen them as socialist, but I'm not sure I see the Communist connection. I have no doubt they have connections to Communists, but then again Republicans have connections with Libertarians. Its normal to have ties on each of the two supposed sides of the political spectrum. I really would be interested if there was evidence of something more overt in their ranks.

                      <p>
                       My main issue with the Green Party, or any of the prominent third party organizations is that they don't actually spend much time at the upper levels trying to get their grass roots people together unless they need them for something. How can they find out what they really need if they don't have local meetings in every town? Even if budget is an issue, just have local get-together days at a diner or something. Seems like all the solutions we keep getting offered are still essentially top-down management of what is supposed to be a democracy. That leaves people like me pretty lost politically because I believe things that are not really represented by the two-sided political spectrum we're taught to accept as a real thing.

                      <p>
                       For example: gun rights are really important in my opinion, but lots of Americans are also very concerned about guns and the very real issues that come with such rights. The bottom-line though is that one side wants to "compromise" until they win, and the other side doesn't want to compromise at all because there is no trust. Then there's groups like the NRA that LOVE this constant fight and use it as a rhetoric platform that is often more about endorsing Republicans than really developing solutions that make sense and that we can considered truly settled law. The Gun Owners of America is a much better group IMO, but that's a bit off-topic. Abortion is another issue where most Americans aren't extreme on the matter, but the extremists at both ends have truly made realistic solutions hard to find. As long as there are unwanted pregnancies, there will be people who want to end them. A kid is a huge commitment and people make mistakes or have no choice sometimes, but it's also a life and that's a fair point as well. Extremists are not going to resolve that issue, and it will just drag on forever. I'm also for a free-market economy, but I also see the value in protecting and even subsidizing certain markets(especially agriculture). I just want want "free-market" to apply to mom and pop shops as well as the big guys, and until there's a platform that really advances that, I call any claim they make about being "free-market" to be total bullshit.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I guess my main point here is that I am sick of extremists wrecking everything. Psychopaths, people of questionable character, and those foolish enough to follow them just make it really hard to really put Americans first. Power was supposed to be a tool wielded in service of the public, but Left or Right, whoever is in power seems to always put power above the the needs of everyday people. "Checks and balances" was a joke from the beginning and it has been under attack from day one as well. I think a lot of us would love something that is neither branded by Marx or the Koch Brothers.

             Yeah, that's why Trump emerged as the final non-Establishment candidate. Bernie almost had that crown but was either too blind to what was going on or got compromised somewhere along the line.

               I wish I could upvoat on this device. People on voat are touchy about Trump, and they tend to try to contrast him to Obama/Bush/Clinton. They're all just feuding oligarchs. Trump is right on target to save the kids and leave them with poisoned water and outdated drug war bullshit

            It's not just Pizza that is the problem. It is an entire network of systematic criminal corruption in both major parties and across major global industries, and the power hierarchy within the system enables all kinds of crimes at all levels. If Trump is for real, if he doesn't expose the real story of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption soon, he will be compromised if he is not already.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, and Scott Walker are key figures as seemingly boy scout types from Wisconsin serving as front men to cover up the true evils behind Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Paul Ryan's home district - Racine, Wisconsin is the key to Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. It is connected to everything including the most powerful global initiatives and secret societies involved, and Racine is an absolute cesspool of corruption with indisputable evidence and deep ties to the Clintons and the true global evils involved. Loretta Lynch personally stonewalled investigations into Racine, Wisconsin like she did with the private email server and Clinton Foundation. The feds have known about it for a long time, yet have not taken action, and that alone is scary. Now that all so many dots are connected between Pizzagate and George Webb's interconnected investigations, it is even scarier.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is closely linked to Bill Clinton, Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative among more shocking and alarming connections, and it is the barometer to prove whether Trump will actually drain the swamp or if he is simply making deals and not going to hold the people accountable who have been abusing the laws and committing extreme and brazen crimes above and under the color of law. People can claim the possibility of Trump and Flynn's 3D and 4D chess moves, but until he connects the dots that all link to Racine and Wisconsin and announces full investigations and indictments, he is either corrupt himself or out of his league. Racine sounds strange to be connected to so many aspects of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, but there are many reasons why this is true, and it is both credible and incredible. Racine and Wisconsin cover both Republican and Democrat parties, and there is a reason these seemingly boy scout faces suddenly have so much power - it's all what they are covering up for the real puppet masters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine, Wisconsin is the domino that will work better on Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

             Maybe Gingrich will help Trump and get some kind of leniency. Notice he certainly wasn't part of the Trump cabinet pick process.

            There are people out there that like to push a political agenda one way or the other, but this is not a partisan issue, this is a systemic issue. By my estimation, this story finally breaking and being more widely accepted by the masses will eventually bring some high level indictments. After that happens, both parties are essentially nuked. Doesn't seem like anyone is being groomed and I no one is riding in on their white horses.

            The political landscape in this country is going to be changing again here shortly.

            Get ready folks to face the truth about those that you had so much faith in and were so sure they were not involved.  I have had to swallow hard quite a few times when I had to face it myself.  These are not part of our family (thank God).  What we must think of is the children and what they have done to them.  No watching Jimmy Kimmel anymore, Tom Hanks, Ron Howard (Oh Opie how you fooled me).  Time to find new past times and new people to vote for.

             That's a big part of the problem, we've been distracted by bread and circuses. Takes sacrifice on our part. Founders warned that liberty is not free, it takes vigilance. While we're watching Dancing w/ the Stars and football they're robbing us blind through usury and taxation and regulation and, apparently, far worse stuff enables it all.

              I do not really watch Dancing w/the Stars.  Hate the nastiness of the judges.  And I do not partake in sports.  Overpaid.  We are afraid teachers are getting too much money and retirement but think nothing of paying millions to these idiots that play a few months out of the year and yet vilify the teachers for working 9 months out of the year. Another brainwashing by the govt.

             A 'cum panda' involves punching someone in both eyes and blackening them, after ejaculating into the mouth or face. Panda eyes, according to the urban dictionary, can also be caused by choking the person or prolonged, heavy sedation.

              The Panda reference is in Alefantis Instagram as well. I think they called it cum-panda, while this pedo was wearing a panda mask. Sick!

            This list is absolutely priceless. It needs to be sourced! Can we weaponize some sleuths and have all of these cases backed up with verifiable links? Or perhaps even expand upon the list itself to go further into the past/future?
           </p>
           <p>
            A collection like this would be Voat.co/v/Pizzagate "Sticky Worthy"... let the shills feast on this. I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say "No, stuff like that doesn't happen".
           </p>
           <p>
            I was personally aware of no more than 10% of these cases. Holy shit!

            I love this, this is about the kids, not left or right.  Maybe this will help wake up the left?
Although I seriously doubt it, the liberals are so brainwashed, hypocritical and unsympathetic.
I am pro trump, Yet I'm aware of his ties to Epstein, and I am not blinded nor do I have my head in the sand. 
My hope is that even a tainted Trump would drain the swamp if it was the best thing for america....

              rippingtheveil - Prophecy says the 44th president will be the last... it could be right... Grover Cleveland threw off the count with his two non-consecutive terms so technically Trump is the 44th president. Perhaps the likes of Steve Pieczenik are working behind the scenes to completely replace the system. In the meantime, Trump has to get the swamp in order before it can be drained.

              not replaced, the people who run the govenrment need to be replaced. we need to out and prosecute to the fullest extent all of these creeps and put them away for LIFE. We need honest decent people to run for office and have elections that are about the people and not about the government. We are in a constitutional crisis at this point. These people who run our government are sick.

            that is a crazy long list, is it since 2000 or up to 2000? "Sides" and parties are a faux construction to divide us. Anyone who is in a position of power is probably an abuser or compromised to act on behalf of the rich and corrupt, we need to assume that, and demand full complete transparency. Is there a lawyer (any one from Judicial Watch) among us who can start  FIOAs for emails and phone transcripts for ALL ELECTED &amp; APPOINTED OFFICIALS.

              look at who the media are literally in bed with. they are married to the government. each personality you see on tv has pretty much got a spouse that works for the government.

               Yeah at this point, the MSM is just as guilty as the actual pedophiles.  There is undoubtedly a planned coverup, and that shit will get them into deep water.  Trump won't have to break up the MSM lol

              I think it's like the uncertainty about the Manhattan Project. That is, once the chain reaction begins will it ever stop or will keep spreading until it destroys the entire world ?

               The establishment uses that as an excuse, that they can't bring it all down or it will destabilize the system. The population wouldn't be able to handle it, etc.

               It's bullshit. We can put on our big boy pants and deal with it. We're not the defenseless and vulnerable infants they try to convince us we are.

               Also, it never hurts to give it try. Lets see what
               <em>
                does
               </em>
               happen when you take out every single fucking node of a pedo web. It'll be one for the history books, that's for sure. It would literally put us ahead of Ancient Rome and Greece in terms of being able to recover from a toxic period of decadence. And back in line with the ideals of the French Revolution.

                On the one hand we have the known certainty of rape torture, murder, satanism, cannibalism, ritual sacrifice among the elite and that we are slaves to the monetary system etc....on the other hand we have uncertainty of a collapsed system.

               But we are still here. I am not saying that the Manhattan project was moral or anything but I think exposing these acts of evil is the moral high ground no matter what ensues.

                I don't think you understand my point. Scientists were not even 90% sure the chain reaction from the first nuclear detonation would stop, at all. They actually feared that it could theoretically destroy the universe. This thing is so vast it has the power to topple governments and the entire world economy, throwing the world into chaos.

              Ok, we need a steppible-timeline for people to follow as a wiki red-pilling-exercise - we need lessons 0 though 9 in depth... it will take effort and lesson 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, etc will have depth... but we need this wiki to happen all referencing the current state....
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem is that 0.0 is ancient in history and will need to start at like 1600AC - but be adjusted over time, the current #PG is literally 9.9PG on the pedo scale and needs to be defined as such. I need an autists group who can define this scale-timeline out acurately.... so define the events and when they were documented to occur and when they did on a pedo scale of reports. How far back can we trace them/this???

               The information we uncover, collect, and connect, should be amassed into a legal case using case building software. That way it's useful for walking regular people through as well as handing over to the DOJ attorneys.
