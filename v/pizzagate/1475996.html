            Ignore the shitty shills, if there's one thing they love to bash it's people who are genuinely vulnerable and reaching out to tell their story. Too many people say it's delusions or schizophrenia but anybody who's been through it knows that's a load of bollocks.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's funny you mention methoxetamine - I took that stuff one time about 5 years ago and weird shit started happening, there's been no let up since. I took something else as well around the same time (not literally at the same time, but maybe the same week) which I couldn't appropriately identify, I strongly suspected it was flephedrone - that chemical is pretty much the beta-ketone variant of 4-Fa so now that I think about it that might well have been what I had.
           </p>
           <p>
            They sure do love to screw with people who are high (and probably alone) and I know this only too well. Since you mentioned both of those chemicals, I say this story is 100% legit.

             Re-read your post, damn, very similar experience... Shit has not let up for me since I took MXE either, brother. I am currently experiencing nearly crippling chills down my spine and neck, and I am actually getting very noticeable OEV's of shimmering and light in my peripheral. I have had proper rest and food, and have not done any drugs since getting out of that shituation a couple days ago.

              The worse thing about this is that in a funny old way, the drugs help to combat the tension. On the other hand, I really must stress to you that you need to get off it all right now, at the very least take a month off. In hindsight I was coping on the whole, but I can clearly see that you're having a very hard time with the harassment. So get off it for a while, clear your head.

             My life has been a living hell especially since earlier this year. They all call me a child molester behind my back. I hear through my dad's apt walls them starting to call me a child molster as soon as I posted this. All i know is before me being arrested, in the process of losing my virginity, i had an epiphany that I was molested. Friends who have slept on my couch in my room told me my dad would sometimes come in my room and stare at me while asleep, like on paranormal activity.  I am being monitored, to what extent I don't know.

              Mate, I've had all sorts of bizarre attempts to condition me by putting children in front of me in absurd ways, and this in turn conditions the children to think it's normal for them to be promiscuous - like deliberately exposing themselves and, on one occasion, actually fondling oneself, in public during broad daylight. I'm not just talking about 15-year-olds for example, but half of that, it's fucking sickening. People actually do this, they use children as a weapon to recruit new handlers.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are three main reasons for this: one is to condition either the subject or the child to think it is appropriate, so they might have an interest in you being a handler, two is to blackmail you if you were to fall for any entrapment, and three is to assassinate your character or otherwise leave you in a position where you cannot have a functional life should you not play their ball game.
             </p>
             <p>
              This fits in perfectly with Pizzagate because it's clear by now that a main theme is about blackmail.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, if your situation is anything like my own then I'm sorry to tell you that it won't stop simply because the Freemasons and the military are deeply rooted into this crap. You won't get a lawyer, doctors will refer you to mental health who in turn will obsess with getting you sectioned, police will either completely ignore it or explicitly make the situation worse.
             </p>
             <p>
              So my advice is to stay cool, find things you enjoy doing and above all, keep a smile on your face. Trust me, looking as though you're happy and determined to come through it really pisses them off. Also carry a notepad and camera around with you at all times in public (using the camera where laws permit, of course). Keep a diary, both in writing and pictures as much as is possible.

               The sexualization of minors is absolutely ridiculous and sickening. I first noticed this when they sent me from the jail to the arkansas state hospital, and they had magazines in the waiting room that I noticed were obviously sexualizing children. You are correct, they have and will blackmail me. have been extorted financially for years by people I considered my best friends. Over drugs, not pedophilia. Although since it seems you are an Aussie, and I am near the heart of the scandal, hopefully some sort of justice can be brought upon these people. I have faith.

                English, no idea where you got Aussie from. I think I have a mixed talk on the Internet due to the obvious diversity, I must pick up on some really bad habits.
               </p>
               <p>
                Now I'm not calling you a loner but I kind of am (not by nature, I love being around people but it's tough when shit like this is going on). Taking drugs alone like those mentioned are reason enough for the military to conduct covert social and psychological experiments on people. Then when they think you're vulnerable, especially if you're single, they'll use children against you. The sad thing is, it's not even to destroy people - yes that's a part of it but the main reason is to recruit handlers who will in turn recruit more children, and possibly even sexually engage with them (possibly being recorded, which would then be sold to people who actually pay for that shit).
               </p>
               <p>
                I use to know somebody who would record herself in the night on her own, I never really saw her using the internet on her phone but she'd always run out of credit. She got some money dumped in her account one time, telling me she didn't know where it came from. She sold herself, that's what, and I suspect to the military for soldiers out in Afghanistan and Iraq. I think she was trying to get me involved as well.

                 I wouldn't say I am a loner but I definitely spent a shitload of time on video games and forums. I am starting to get super scared. One time I was with my mother in her room discussing religion, and took a picture of her with my iphone. I looked at her face and the distortion of her eyes terrified me so much I screamed like a girl and open palm punched the wall. It was the exact same eye distortion I had seen on the Rothschild family web page. I sense a dead woman is standing next to my bed right now and its not the first time.

                  Well I've no experience in apparitions or the sense of them, but I'm certainly open-minded on it. Could be induced hallucinations, could be a genuine link to the other realm. As to possession, that is something I do take very seriously although I'd rather not discuss that right now - I might make a post some time about a theory I have, but not now.

                   I am almost certainly being played with by spirits right now. Couple months ago I hallucinated a Haitian woman with black hair couching and staring at me in my .5 bathroom.

                    Crikey, well that's weird (now I am sounding Aussie). Keep the Holy Spirit in your heart - if there are any bad spirits trying to get at you then you can keep them at bay with a good prayer. I'm no priest or anything, but I personally find it helps.

            I think this is prettyyyy global at this point. If you guys want me to physicaly check out anywhere in LR tomorrow I will. Lot of suspicious and old buildings. I am probably a victim of hidden sexual abuse. It is ludicrious the amount of people I know that have admitted to molested, and those are the ones that have admitted it.

            Forgive me for having issues but they have made it pretty fucking unnecessarily difficult for me to upload pictures as slimg is available on iphone and not android.

            I don''t have much of non electronic proof I can provide. Instead do you have any questions for me, as i have literally seen it all, seen/felt demonic entities, been in th subfloors of UAMS and seen things that honestly no one would believe. My Grandmother who I often stay with was good friends with Hillary Clintons mother. I mean I can provide proof of my identity... but it could very well be spoofed as my wallet with bank info/social security card was stolen when I was kidnapped earlier this week.

            I have a mind full of knowledge that I should not know, and I am being targeted. I regularly post pizza gate and conspiracy info online and on facebook. I used to be a big reddit user for 5 years until I closed it recently as it was basically an online journal of my life. This is nothing.

             They have dirt on me, and I am being very closely watched. I can not provide proof but my initials are S D V P if something actually happens. I will post ehat comes immediately to mind. Look up google streetview of the club "1836" on cantrell. I used to work for the chef Donny Ferneau. I turned around in the parking lot of the building next to this club, concrete, without windows, and a gated underground entry. I then went to the wal-mart down the street and waited in the car while my gf shopped. 3 minutes later a tattood ex-military looking fellow knocked loudly on my window and demanded me to "slow down".
