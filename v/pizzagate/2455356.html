<p>Prominent Black Lives Matter and anti-Trump activist Micah Rhodes has been found guilty of 2nd Degree Sex Abuse in a case involving an underage girl.

<p>Rhodes has previously been convicted of sex abuse when he was a minor, and was on probation for such at the time of this second incident. Additionally, he was a registered sex offender. Strangely enough, however, he is not listed on the official sex offender registry.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Rhodes also faces another set of sex abuse charges in Multnomah County, this time involving an underage boy whom he met via Grindr.</p>
<p>Rhodes was instrumental in the planning of the election week protests and riots in Portland in the aftermath of Trump’s Presidential victory.</p>
<p>Rhodes had apparently made bail in these recent, and neither the Multnomah County nor Washington County inmate rosters show him currently in custody.</p>
<p>He is very likely back out on the streets.</p>',

            Just another thing to add to my concerns relating to BLM. One was the list of demands. Another was a comment on a Utube video that led me to something that woke me up. I'm all for seeing justice for someone shot/killed wrongly, or someone targeted because of their race, but there is more to their group than meets the eye.

            The plan is to get them back on the streets to continue creating as many more pedos as they can.  The more they heavily abuse a child the more the chance is that the child will become one of THEM.  That's why we have so many pedos.

             Your comment made me think of the Greenbaum Speech which is about "Hypnosis in MPD: Ritual Abuse" (MPD = Multiple Personality Disorder). Have you heard it before? It's a therapist giving a lecture about ritual abuse to other therapists interested in ritual abuse (to help their patients) at a therapist related conference.
            </p>
            <p>
             He talks about desensitizing the public through Hollywood to accept the "Satanic World Order" and how the "Illuminati" using these SRA victims to do their bidding (sex, murder, drug running, ect). This talk is revealing because you get insight from therapists that help SRA victims as part of there career. Its a great talk to give a different perspective and more evidence on what we already know.
            </p>
            <p>
             The article in the post isn't loading for me. But this isn't a surprise. Pedos are put in a position of power, doesn't matter the race. If its a position of power that these sick fucks want , a pedo will be put in to be easily controlled.

              I agree.  Also they love to frighten SRA Victims and Survivors into seclusion.  Staying inside, no social contact with others.  Keeping it all to themselves and suffering the continued memories that they can never forget unless they seek help.  Even then they have horrid abuse pop into their heads without notice.  Flash backs.  The finger necklace is a tool they use to frighten them to death to always be afraid.  To always make them remember that they have complete control over them.  It is horrid.

             The Black welfare families are full of pedos. Low intelligence, trashy, ghetto, rap/street culture and no discipline, morals, parental guidance etc are to blame. The baby daddies are babies themselves and pretty much retarded.

              Not to sound "racist" but I have worked with a lot of low income people, and by far the WORST in terms of intelligence have been black. Don't get me wrong, white people can be stupid and trashy too, but the most absolutely retarded people I worked with were black. I still can't understand how some of them get through he day, they are that stupid! This seems to be why they are more likely to end up in jail or prison

              The baby daddies are just that.  Mostly babies themselves.  This is what the cabal wants.  More children to steal for their parties and organs.  It's all part of the plan.  Also more abortions that create more parts.  It's all in the game.
