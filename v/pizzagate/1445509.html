            Middle aged mom here. Nobody in my circle is particularly awake. They all respect me though and they refer to my as "the walking encyclopedia", so maybe they will listen to me when I start talking. More likely they will think I've gone off the deep end. My family thinks I'm completely nuts, even though I give them evidence for everything I say and I try not to rave too much, lol.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also I am reasonably sure my social media posts about all this "fake news" are being shadowbanned. That is to say, sometimes I get 40+ likes when I post something cute or funny but not a single like for any of this stuff. Which means they are not seeing it; the algorithm shuts it out of most people's feeds.
Word of mouth is going to be key here. And maybe even printed media, which is harder to censor. Memes, social media, and "free speech" sites like Voat aren't going to be enough. FYI, the last canary was heard from a month ago.

            I think someone earlier posted a flyer with a few salient facts and a QR code. As old school as it seems, and you might be tempted to laugh at this coming from a middle aged mom, but I am also tech savvy and I know how these things work. They can censpr the internet, even changing past news a la 1984. For someone with the skills, it's effortless. I suspect a massive amount of lo-fi communication may be a more effective means of dealing with this type of censorship in the long run.

            They can't suicide us all. Unless that's what the FEMA camps are for.

            We got word out about Spirit Cooking to places like Focus on the Family.    You have to present it in a Biblical context and warn ahead of times about the graphic nature of the material.  Tony Perkins has a huge group as well.

             I'm not sure if getting Million Moms and Focus On The Family types involved would be a good way to make Pizzagate seem legit. Sheer numbers aren't always a good thing.
