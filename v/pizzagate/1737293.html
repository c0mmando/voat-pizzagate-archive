            Where are your facts? The more anyone researches this the more it's obvious there is something going on. What do you have against people who simply want to protect children from abuse, trafficking and murder? Your temper tantrums and name calling are childish and unhelpful. I would love it if you could actually prove all this wrong, but I know you cannot because that is how I started in it. Hoping to find it untrue. There has been no true debunking of Pizzagate at all. The articles claiming such are ridiculous. Anyway, best wishes to you for a calm peaceful day and I hope you figure out why this is pissing you off so much.

            Alefantis is great friends with Michael Maccoby whose son is a director of friends of the orphans, the charity Laura Silsby was given children from(for child trafficking). Max Maccoby, director of friends of the orphans, also represented James alefantis and David Brock for a $850,000 blackmail case (I'll link with all the info). Alefantis had several strange photos of children on his Instagram(there's more to the story than just this), he's close friends with the Podesta brother (the brothers who love child torture and morbid art so much that they put it up in their homes), hosts private political party's, has rock bands that almost blatantly promote pedophilia play at some of these private events. Heck, even former D.C. Councilman Frank Winstead accused Alefantis of this in 2008. He's a small piece in a giant ring of potential pedophiles.

            Prove this info wrong and I'll leave you be.

           <p>
            This has happened in other governments.

            Podesta s brother, Tony Podesta(hillarys potential Secretary of State brother and close ally)also mentions a torture room in a Wikileaks email. They both own art of children being tortured and rape. 
And how does this tie to Pizzagate and Alefantis?
The New York Times says they are in this wonderful little piece that never touches on these hot topics that we are all so curious about.

           <p>
            And how are Podesta and Alefantis tied together in this Pizzagate discussion? The New York Times calls them friends. Both own art containing pedophilia, murder and cannibalism. Alefantis Instagram photos are riddled with images of children, jokes of murder and selling kids. He even posted an image of a guy with a baby calling him a chicken lover.

            Way to get ridiculously defensive. Maybe I meant your folks have a pizza joint and you don't want business to drop or people to make jabs. Funny that, day after day, you get angrier and angrier.

            There is no evidence of crime. There is clues that could lead to evidence. Thats why these discussions exist to finally find the evidence. The actions occur beyond a reasonable doubt.

            There are still so many more things. There is 0 evidence of a crime I agree. Only because in the U.S its so hard to have enough evidence to convict somebody. Which is why this board exists so we can find that evidence. Pizzgate to me is true beyond any reasonable doubt. Ive seen so many connections that its ridiculous. Maybe you really are protecting youself.

            I cant tell if your joking or not. I think its impossible for somebody to spend this much time on this board, and for them to still not have realized the obvious truth of pizza gate. Are you being sarcastic?

            You think pizzagate is bullshit?
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a simple question. Why does James Alefantis have a profile picture of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous">
             Antinous
            </a>
            a boy from the roman times who is known to be the lover of an emperor while only being about 13? The statue is known to represent pederasty it even says it on the wiki. Not to mention all of the creepy pictures on the rest of his instagram. Barring in mind these 2 things do you really think its a coincidence?

            Sorry, but if someone starts pushing bullshit like flat earth, they're going to get called out.  The sheer number of people trying to poison the well, muddy the water and drop a turd in the punch bowl is what gives me a lot of confidence that we've stumbled upon something of major significance to powerful people.

             I disagree flat earth isnt bullshit. If you actually took the time to look into it youd see that its difficult to prove the earth is round without taking nasas word for it.I mean they faked the moon landing so why would I trust them at all? 
 Also Everytime ive ever watched a flat earth debunk video the person would use examples of debunks that are debunkable.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also here is a video of Neil Degrasse Tyson suddenly bringing forth that the earth is Pear shaped wtf?

            <p>
             Thats funny what about all of those pictures that are perfectly round?
            </p>
            <p>
             Dont just call something bullshit because it sounds ridiculous. I get it flat earth really does sound stupid, but you shouldnt bash something you never researched. Its ironic because your on this forum over here trying to prove something to people who are doing the same thing that you are.

            We arent stupid. We dont just assume things out of nothing. CTR and that other company exist, and have received millions of dollars in funding. Shills have been proven to exist. And yes there is benefit because if we never kept shills on their toes at least by accusing them than they would have even more power over us.  Even though Alex Jones is one of them hes right about this concept of "info wars there is a war on your mind". Shills are the modern form of censoring the internet, and information control. The elites know that the media was always powerful, but it has certainly lost much of its power because nobody watches TV anymore. Now they need to control info and perceptions through twitter, and through shills. Dont you think this board is very thretening to these people ofcourse they would have to fight against it.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example what about that thread we had recently which clearly proved that this board was blocked by google search? Lol that was so obvious do you think it happened by accident? What about all the possible shills in the thread saying "you can still google it you idiots", yeah because they probably forgot to block both forms of the search result. They didnt realize the /new link would come up, and they made a mistake. This site did not end up on an anime banlist totally by accident.

             There's no benefit to accusing everyone who posts questionable information of working for someone. Best case scenario they just rename the account. Worst case scenario YOU ALIENATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC!

              Its okay if they make a new account because the new account wont be able to downvote, and it will also have a lower lifespan which means less credibility. I think we should keep accusing people of shilling. Otherwise the shills will become a secret majority here which is scary because they will control all of the top threads like on 4chan pol.
