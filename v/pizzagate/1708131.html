            PET (meaning fart in french) was made fun of extensively in Quebec, we had our "Daily Shows" since the mid 80's, our own culture, we didn't even sign the Constitution that he brought back....not that the attached Charter of Rights and Freedoms attached to it isn't good, but we have a "Night of the long knives" where only a couple provinces were happy with the Constitution as is brought from the UK, not much was changed in there, Alberta's PM and Quebec's PM were on the same team (which is like a Texas Senator co-sponsoring a bill from a Massachusetts or Washington state Senator). In fact it was 8 provinces out of 10 that didn't agree, but the prime minister of Manitoba, conspired to turn all of the others against Quebec so when the next morning suddenly all PM's except LÃ©vesque.....of course that was the work of Trudeau behind the scenes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway one of our fake reporters in one of those disguised as only comedy truth-news shows was kicked in the nuts by PET, secession polls spiked to 68%...the following year our secession referendum failed at 49.6%...that was the first massive vote fraud in the history of Canada. But at least Justin got in for real, and I say that as someone who voted NDP and kept his NDP MP, she does a good job, she made the local AFB stop flying over the city all the time, I remember when we had a BQ (4th party in parliament, no power, NDP used to be Official Opposition to Harper at least, and she got that fucking war base to stop flying over the city...during the Lybian war, it was really scary, sonic booms at low altitude by 3 CF-18's at once in a triangle formation right over our heads at 10:45 pm...for no reason. They have TONS of empty wooden land around them but no they practice, a lot too, over this densely populated area of town. I hope the NDP becomes the Official Opposition again, a real left party against the "centre" party which used to be Left in the real meaning of the word, not the distortion that started in the US way back to P.T. Barnum and Limbaugh, the guy who hates junkies, yet takes 3 80mg oxycontin a day. I know it's true he has a bad back, but that kind of dosage (80mg is the strongest oxycontins) and chronic pain patients who can't work usually get 2 a day max (1 every 12 hours), it would be warranted if his fat ass did a physical job but he doesn't. I don't care if his sciatica is hurting from sitting all the time, a couple hydrocodone pills should be enough for this kind of moderate chronic pain. Sorry for all the digressing I'm really tired and a bit out of it. I had a huge ocular migraine that lasted 2 days and I woke 30 minutes ago after going for a nap after dinner and now I'm up at 3:40 am, it always feels weird to wake up at that sort of hour.

            On a related subject, pretty much EVERYTHING on the Facebook Page of Cosmic Adventures pizza restaurant in Ottawa is a pedophile symbol.
Maybe some non-cannibal Canadian law enforcement should have a look into that restaurant/child-sex-slave trafficking operation.

            Interesting stuff about Justin, but having looked into that Waco thing recently on YouTube, I think that David Koresh was probably less of a cult leader than those people in the White House who made a very pleasing sacrifice of Koresh and 75 of his friends to their ancient Canaanite baby-eating fire god, Moloch.

            Very good post, but I wonder about the source of the Maggie Trudeau picture which appears borderline illegal?    Looks a lot like her (especially the cheek bones which are distinct) but some might question it.

            Don't know what to say about it.  If you look however, some on the list are rather questionable (Dolly Parton??).  Who knows, Fritz might have had a vendetta against him. 
Kaka, however, has a lineage in this from way way back to 1800.

             I used to live in the area of Montreal where he was an MP, the southern portion is part of the gay village...he's bisexual is the only thing we heard from people in mild debauchery institutions (bars, when we could still smoke, I don't go to bars anymore since the smoking ban in summer 2006, it's killing many a small town's downtowns). Smoking only became bad when X-Ray's started to increase the chances of cancer because of the race for the creation of the most cancerous agent ever, to kill Castro, hence why Fidel told Chavez to shun anything spikey, needles, even crayons and keys that could be used to "poison" him. Chavez was 100% healthy to dying in 6 months. Read Dr Mary's Monkey to see how the race to find a vaccine to Polio caused this, and why was there so much Polio cases all of a sudden in the US while it didn't happen anywhere else? Antibiotics discovery in 1942.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's why cancer used to be 1 person in 15 000 in the US to now 1 in 3 or 4.Stop panicking about eugenics, the weapon's already deployed, accidentally, I had a doctor refuse to take another x-ray when I was fighting a pneumonia a couple weeks later when after going through 2 shitty antibiotics, they sent me to an emergency appointment with my lung doctor (I have mild asthma) and he gave me an antibiotic that worked and didn't make me feel strange or have extreme diarrhea, he said the antibiotics the ER gave me were garbage that should not be used, and when it comes to the second one they tried, I have to agree, (Avelox), fluoroquinolones, read about them. This whole race to create the most cancerous substance on earth to kill Castro is also why giving everyone the same vaccine is a really stupid idea, even different blood types changes the variables. I could go on but I don't wanna bore you all with the complicated biochem involved here, but it's really terrible to think this happened because they wanted to kill Castro so bad and finally had a high profile lab rat (Chavez). They started doing it in a small town in Louisiana called Clinton (even more ironic) where there is (or was back in the 60's) a max security prison with rapists, murderers etc., nobody anyone would miss. Judy injected a prisoner and he was stage 4 cancer extremely quickly, 3 months or so. That poor little genius of a girl then discovered what she was coaxed into doing, sent a letter to the head of the NIH who was friends with Dulles etc. telling him that these experiments were unethical, an 18 year old telling the head of the NIH that he was doing unethical experiments. He threatened her in a lot of ways, he says if you become a doctor, you better stay away from anything cancer related, become an orthopedist, you never fucking are doing research on cancer (she had discovered a very quick way to give cancer to mice in a high school setting), they thought it was really dangerous and dismantled her lab BUT then offerred her to go directly to PhD, bypassing 5 years right away, of course that offer was removed. Anyway, it's all in that book Dr Mary's Monkey.

            SOMETHING just occurred to me..these elitist satanist are all looking for their messiah or the anti-christ..whether this is a "real" supernatural event or a staged one does not really matter...I had read awhile back that the pyramid had id'ed a "candidate"...reading below and thru this thread about eugenics/Justin/younger Rothschild's...makes you wonder...just throwing it out there...

            Good grief!! Before the Podesta drop I could understand a company or organization using a stylized heart or triangle unknowingly, but NOW? Are we to really believe these "people" haven't heard of these symbols by now? This is as blatant as it comes, IMHO (and no, I'm not a ho. Lol)

            For anyone, like me, who had initial reserves about that domain name. You can find the same pdf on trudeaufoundation.ca. fondationtrudeau.ca seems to be the French language version of the same site.

            The people cannot be ethically serious. Just another world leader tied to criminal pedo society. We can just assume that it is a culture that most elites are  brought up in. To quote Palpatine "wipe them out, all of them".

            Anyone know if the artist Keith Haring is a pedo or boylover? Check out his art on Google.. Looks similar to the boylover symbolism I've seen on voat.

            Yeah, us french Canadians used to have an IRA-like thing, didn't last too long what with the over-reaction of P-E Trudeau who legalized homosexuality / or more accurately had canadian psychiatrist have some thinking about removing it from the DSM-III that it wasn't a mental illness...that is still debatable but tends to be true. At least that symbol is for adult homosexuals, it's not the Young Boy Lover swirl...

            But I'm still finding it hilarious that after the FLQ kidnapped a quebec provincial minister along with the british ambassador to Canada and brought them nowhere in woods in Quebec (which is easy), they sent FLQ manifest to CBC/Radio-Canada (the name of CBC in French) and they say something like "causÃ© par Trudeau la tapette" which is quebec french slang for "caused by Trudeau the faggot". Said in the kind of international french that tv in french canada had people speak, right on the news the evening when Trudeau put the martial law in Quebec over about 10 guys hiding way far in the woods up north in some shacks nowhere, but were rolling tanks in the streets of Montreal for all of October '70...that was fucked up "Loi des mesures de guerre" for a fucking minister of a province and an ambassador of Britain being kidnapped, since they caused this, they killed the British dignitary and the Quebec minister of transport killed himself trying to escape and they had to come out of the dark and give themselves up both guys were dead plan turned to shit, FLQ died mostly, replaced by the PQ which is the social-democrat in people policy but very nationalist and they said that if the next referendum (the last one we got a yes at 49,6% which was fucking heartbreaking...I'm sure there was fraud because apparently ChrÃ©tien (the PM of Canada then) was ready to bring in martial law if he result was yes by under 55% saying it wasn't a significant majority and they even codified a law in the constitution with the vague part that if Quebec won't sign the 1982 Constitution, it cannot secede from Canada if the "margin isn't clearly large enough", seriously that's the big achievement in the 90's of our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. But they are all less bad (a lot less bad, than Stephen Harper and John Baird his fat pork looking lieutenant ministry of defense and zionist puppet who you only had to hear talk on the radio to guess he was a huge tall fat knuckledragging white trash from some prairie village nobody ever goes to, they follow the canadian highway to BC and ignore everything else if they're cool.

              Yeah if you live in New England or for whatever reason feel like visiting Montreal, calling somebody " une tapette" is a bad idea, especially if in a bar, where Hell's Angels occupy 50% of the clientele and they are not a joke like in the US now, they literally have fortified compounds with surveillance towers inside cities all over Canada. The mafia favours the Hell's and gets those American biker gangs gtfo like the Bandidos, they stayed maybe a year or so until they realized they could not survive here.

             Think about it though, before this whole thing, most of us if not all of us had no idea what this symbol was. Sure, it was in the FBI report, but how many non-FBI people read that at all? How many people were looking for these symbols that werent LEOs?

            . . tl;wr . . We need to try hard not to, even inadvertently, screw over others' work by using attention-drawing post titles on our own work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most posters here try very hard to create titles that follow common protocol. It creates a neutral space in which everyone can share their work equally, on a level playing field, creating posts which rise on the merit of their content alone. Much exceptional research here is overshadowed by hyperbolic titles, which, whether intentional or not, serves to push other posts down, sometimes into oblivion and often to the detriment of the kids we are trying to save. While everyone can get excited, no post is more important, urgent or valuable than any other here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The extraordinary hard work and effort of people on this forum is diminished by the use of hyperbolic titles (for example by the use of all or partial CAPS, !!!!!!, "** ****, and or exclamations of URGENT, BREAKING, DIG DIG DIG, THIS ONE TO THE TOP, #PODESTAFORPRISON (all in caps), etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've posted my strong feelings on this in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            , asking them to consider creating a new rule banning such titles. I've also left comments in a meta discussion on the topic, which a user created in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhateverhttps">
             v/pizzagatewhateverhttps
            </a>
            ://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1682030. If anyone is of like mind, please consider:
           </p>
           <pre><code>1 Also reaching out to the mods - 2 Also leaving comments in the meta discussion - 3 Also leaving reminders, similar to this one, in posts with hyperbolic titles
</code></pre>
           <p>
            I will continue to speak out on this until it becomes a new rule - or until I give up. At that point, I believe this will not be a neutral forum that highlights the most important research based on merit. Instead, in all likelihood it will eventually descend into a free for all. If you think I'm exaggerating head over to some of the reddit subs and take a look. It would have very different consequences here because reddit, in large part, involves sharing and opinions, while this is critical research directed at saving innocent lives that, by the hundreds, if not thousands, are being taken as we speak.

            They love to shove it in everybody's face.  But this time people are shoving back. It's hard to imagine enough prison space to accommodate all the sick creeps that need to be there.  Maybe the FEMA camps they have constructed for the people they anticipated not going along with their agenda would serve that purpose well.

            <strong>
             Is Justin Trudeau a Product of Illuminati Mind Control?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Justin Trudeau's autobiography "Common Ground" was not easy to review. Its unspoken subtext involves abuse due to the Illuminati/Luciferian background of both sides of his family.
           </p>
           <p>
            In her book TRANCE-FORMATION OF AMERICA MK-ULTRA survivor Cathy O'Brien stated that many world leaders, including Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney, are pedophiles. She met them in the course of her life as a sex slave trained (with her young daughter) to service high-profile politicians. Other sources support Cathy O'Brien's allegations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over the years, insiders have told me that Pierre's 1968 marriage to Margaret was "arranged" by the military. The couple programmed with LSD at a remote farm in British Columbia.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Trudeau's Jesuit mentor, Trudeau ordered the kidnap and murder of his enemy Pierre Laporte in October 1970, because Laporte was threatening him with blackmail and exposure as a pedophile.
           </p>
           <p>
            After Margaret ran off with the Rolling Stones in 1977, the marriage was over. Soon after, as a single father, Pierre turned to a York University sociologist, John Seeley, for parental advice.
           </p>
           <p>
            John Seeley, a self-proclaimed 'sadist and pedophile' would fly up to Ottawa on weekends to "advise" Pierre on how he should be raising his three sons. Justin was six."

             Really interesting on Trudeaus.  And, imo, it shows us once again why all of this evil had to programmed into victims by CIA because this behavior is so foreign to most human beings.  And it has to be brought about by torture and sexual abuse in order to have it happen.

             At the very least he is a product of the Obama campaign team. Google it.
They are doing the same in the Netherlands at current election  (Jesse Klaver - Groen links)
They even copied the rolled up sleeves.
You will also find them in Israel.  Probably more places.

             Listen to interview of Cathy O'Brien on the Opperman Report with her handler whats-his-name, that person is not telling anything true or if she does its mixed through a random amount of lies, Ed wasn't sure before interviewing her again with her husband who's likely her for-life CIA handler and it was awful, a good show as it shows who not to listen to, he's a P.I. so he knows how to interview people too. To me O'Brien is a complete nutcase not worth my time.

               Listen to the interview and then tell me this is the mind of someone who's telling the truth, yes she is brain damaged from experimentation and that results in being unable to answer questions without going into 40 tangents etc, here just listen to it, he does no editing of interviews, the only breaks are sponsor breaks from the internet radio stations (and some actual radio stations) he's broadcast on :
