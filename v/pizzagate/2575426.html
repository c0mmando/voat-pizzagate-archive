            This is how the police try to explain the purpose of the site away:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A Tucson Police Department spokesman, Officer Hawkins, claimed that there is an ‘ongoing investigation’ into the camp. He also said that police don’t believe it is a ‘trafficking camp,’ despite the presence of many tell-tale signs of such a site.
            </p>
            <p>
             The local police also had a handy way to explain away the rope ties in the trees. They claimed that they were a common way for the homeless camps to string up tarps, to provide both shade and cover from the rain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even the bunker dug into the ground was explained, according to them, by the fact that homeless individuals will often dig into the ground in order to be cooler.
            </p>

              https://conservativedailypost.com/veteran-group-finds-evidence-of-child-trafficking-strange-connection-exposed/
             </a>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            But then, Veterans On Patrol, the guys who found the site, have
            <em>
             lots of experience
            </em>
            with sites where homeless people live - it's basically their job finding these. So  if these dudes think that the alleged trafficking camp is different from anything that they've seen before, they should be trusted imo.

             a lot of military tunnels in Arizona

            <p>
             this map very interesting

            </p>
            <p>
             not sure how old this map is, and wonder how many more tunnels have been made

             1.Fort Huachuca. 290 N 116ºW saucer base below, intelligence training above, mind-control incl. too. Gates Pass Base
            </p>
            <p>
             There are copious assertions stating that many of these D.U.M.B.s tunnels to other sites across the country interconnecting and creating a subterranean honeycombed network spanning the entire country
            </p>
            <p>
             so many military underground facilities
            </p>
            <p>
             Scary to think what they are all doing down there
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't trust what Police are saying,News blackout is very interesting, and waiting for the initial agencies to get involved

            I know this may sound a little off the wall and ot but has anyone made a connection to the owner of CEMEX  Carlos Slim and Wieners famous screen name of the same? Just curious if anyone has ever figured out WHY he chose this particular name?

            CEMEX and Haiti connection
           </p>
           <p>
            Using local contractors to build $8,000 homes was ignored after the earthquake.  More international companies were brought in, additional studies were undertaken, and the first contract was not awarded until April 2012, nearly 2.5 years after the quake and 8 months after the project was approved.
           </p>
           <p>
            The contracts ended up not going to small, local companies but to large international ones.  Thor Construction, based in MN received $18 million, and CMEX, a Mexican company, got over $7 million.  Another $35 million went to 2 Haitian-American firms based in MD for environmental assessments, construction management, site preparation, and other associated projects.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               The followers of William Branham refer to themselves as being in The Message. However, this is not a homogeneous group. There are many sub-cults within the cult that is the Message.
              </p>
              <p>
               Golden Dawn Tabernacle is a message church located at 301 E. Los Reales Road in Tucson, AZ. The pastor,
               <strong>
                Isaac Noriega
               </strong>
               , was described by a former Golden Dawn member as "a very angry, bad tempered man... I remember him yelling at the deacons and anyone else who crossed his path when he was in a bad mood because things were not going his way. He didn't care who you were. He would not hesitate to disrespect you."
