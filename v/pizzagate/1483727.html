            "who work with children professionally" That is a bell ringer considering the number of feminist who work with kids by brainwashing them and who also are commonly involved in pedophilia. Also teachers are very proven not to be trust worthy by looking at their attempts actually successful attempts to brainwash children in schools and the number of female pedophiles busted. Even though none of them ever really serve time.

             her work seems all about doing test on children. to see their response times, and things like that. The way she makes a point of bringing her children, was a worry. When have you ever heard that in article before? "...who brought her children with her:" Quite obviously put there, as part of a make comet look better campaign...

             Additionally, a senator was murdered along with her husband after she had a producer help her make a documentary on the corruption in child services. The documentary was never released even though the producer promised her he would see to it no matter what happened. But he smugly said he changed his mind.

            This is an interesting point.   If media would investigate, it would find out who is the parent (if there is one) of that infant described as "ho-tard" for example.  Shouldn't child protective services be looking for the whereabouts and parents of every child on that instagram?  The one labeled "chickenlover" being held by that guy?

             logically, the parents would have said something years ago, when the photos went up. but certainly when the speculation started. they are in such earnest, to stop this speculation, yet they do not take this logical step? can only be, that they could not take it. the guardians of the children, are perhaps offenders, that would only make comet look worse, or they are orphans ... the claim of alefantis to be the godfather of one, stands out especially. why has she not come out, or someone who knows her, and said she was ok and is ok. its almost like seeing a missing person photo, knowing the person, but not calling the number... makes no sense.

            Some pockets of "progressive" culture are so steeped in the mentality of "anything goes" moral nihilism that many in those pockets probably won't be able to grasp that to most people, using something as sexual symbolism and then using that symbolism with children, is a red flag that something is wrong in the minds of people doing just that. Because again, "nothing is truly wrong" in the minds of those steeped in the moral nihilism that is plaguing progressive ideology and thus making them extremely out of touch with the majority who still think that sexualizing children, even through 'art' or 'jokes', is wrong. I would never in a million years knowingly support a business whose owner and friends think that is acceptable, but then I also haven't abandoned all manner of ethical standards in an effort to seem cool and enlightened, so.

             . excellent analysis. i wad watching mark dice interviews, here they are saying incest is ok as long as between consenting adults, and other worrisome things. One of these people justine, is a member -bassplayer in punk hadcore band Chainsaw Riot. sounds like the kind of band that would play at comet maybe. definitely a nihilist. she also own restaurants. i feel sher knows JA. she looks a tad like abromovic...
