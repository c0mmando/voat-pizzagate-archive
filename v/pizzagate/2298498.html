<p>High profits, high demand, and relatively low risk have made modern day slavery a highly profitable industry. The need to 
unite to bring an end to human trafficking is greater now more than ever. 
the child trafficking industry is a 12 bill illegal operation that is occurring globally a predator can make over $200k each 
a
year from just one victim of modern day slavery. Combine that with the estimated 2.5 million children that have been 
sexually exploited and $12 billion isn\'t such an unbelievable number. </p>
<p>Human trafficking is one of the biggest problems occurring in the U.S. and around the world. If the evolution of high profits, 
high demand, and low risk continues, the growth of this epidemic will continue as well. Due to these factors, criminal org, 
such as the mob and other gangs, have begun to take part in this tragedy that devastates the lives of millions of children around the world.</p>
<p>A large criminal organization that has been functioning for years has moved into the child trafficking industry.  the boss of the 
Gambino crime family and 13 other people were charged with various crimes, one of which was child trafficking. According to U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, this is a “new low” for the criminal organization and the first time the mafia has been caught participating
 in this type of offense. Members of the organized crime family had allegedly recruited several girls from strip clubs to be prostitutes.
 One recruit was a 15-year-old girl. According to the documents filed with the federal courts , the Gambino family had 
advertised the girls\' services via Craigslist.</p>
<p>The victims were driven throughout New York area They were also made available to players at the criminal family’s weekly 
high-stakes poker games for sexual purposes. If the victims were non-compliant, they were beaten with baseball bats.
 Law enforcement officials look at this case as evidence that the mafia still exists today, and it appears there isn’t a crime too horrific
 they would not commit if it is profitable, including child trafficking.</p>
<p>the issue of gang involvement in modern day slavery is growing. Every month, at least 10 to 20 groups or individuals are added to 
the department\'s watch list. Since this number only represents those that are discovered by the police, the actual number of those involved is likely far greater. The tragedy is that children have become a commodity to gangs that are selling them as property to 
adults for abuse and rape.   sounds like the magdalene laundries. There is a shift of gang activity away from selling drugs to selling human beings. When comparing the legal risk between the two crimes,  the penalties for child trafficking is far
 less than that of drug trafficking. Moreover, there is essentially no overhead cost involved with modern day slavery. The fact is 
that gangs are using children for sexual purposes to profit. </p>
<p>Targeting The Demand For Child Trafficking</p>
<p>The largest contributing factor to the growth of day slavery around the world is the demand for it. In a yearly report released by
 the U.S. State Department, they state that an effective campaign to bring an end to sexual exploitation of minors throughout 
the world must address the demand side of the issue. This calls for a global response to enact harsher penalties for those that 
are enslaving human beings. In addition, criminals need to be investigated and successfully prosecuted. </p>
<p>Finally, the public also
 needs to become more aware of the problem affecting children in the U.S. and around the world.

               I emailed the USntreasury about anyone on the planet reducing the US debt...it was a question i posed after reading the UN legal research that the papal.bull of dum diversas is still active and is the basis of international law..
Being the war corporation of Rome..the world police or bailiff..i calculated that they should accept anyones money as rome claims administration of all assets..
The US treasury replied immediately in the positive ..
That means we get surety right over the US ..
..but i am in two minds ..one part says its the US ..another that it is the crown treasury in london..they also have indicated on their website they accept monies and assets to reduce debt..london being in control of the crown has to give this remedy..the oath of the office bearer of the crwon says they are the treasurerr of the holy roman empire..which is the secular administrative unit of rome..
So either the crown or the US ..being its sub corporation running the war declared in the papal bull of dum diversas..is the solutiin...they have to follow contract law..its a part of public record...we are in the blind so corrupt people thrive..but when u hold the institutions to its responsibilities and obligations in public ..they cannot refuse ur request to reduce debt and become the creditor of Rome..and its sub corporations..ie US ..Uk ..the crown and other countries of the empire

            So the way to put them in jail is under the RICO Act.  This has worked before and will again.  We just have to have enough manpower to investigate, and prosecute.  I know that many states are understaffed with prosecutors.  I hear that is suppose to be remedied.  The sooner the better.  Heard that on my news.

             I ll ecplain again..what is a simple remedy via the US debt reduction department...
No one here will consider ..la soluzione..
No one wants to put even a minute of their time talking and discussing silutions..
They just jack off to new stories..all info junkies and disinfo junkies..
            </p>
            <p>
             ..the US treasury has a anti child trafficking arm..which people together can activate by even spending a dollar to reduce US debt..i asked people..on forums ..but everyone just ignores this simple remedy..
When u reduce ur govt debt u activate surety rights over ur govt..and it treasury..the US has worldwide jurisdiction..but people have to activate it by reducing the US debt at it debt reduction department..i emailed them and got a reply..in the positive that they will accept anyones money across the planet..to reduce the debt..
U end up activating courts of universal jurisdiction...wiki it 
..likelihood is people will ignore this simple solution

              Which dumb fuck voted me down..this is what i am talking about..peoe dont want to take responsibility for the debt system...child trafficking is a symptom of the debt growing via depositing in banks ..not just in hsbc..
The debt system was catalysed globally by the opium industry..hsbc is an outgrowth of this ...especially after the opium wars..its business as usual for hsbc..instead of farming opium they farm human energy now..and organs
..again ..the downvoatrr is a dumb fuck

              has written is problematic.  I hate to go line-by-line on something like this, but paragraph one is sensationalized boilerplate.  Paragraph 2 is simply factually inaccurate.  Paragraph 3 is an unsourced claim.  Paragraph 4 is unlikely.  Paragraph 5 is wild speculation.... shoddy journalism.  This makes it harder to track down guys like Weinstein.

               Hey patriot!  Here is some proof.
               <a href="https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/human-sex-trafficking">
                https://leb.fbi.gov/articles/featured-articles/human-sex-trafficking
               </a>
               Not only is human sex trafficking slavery but it is big business. It is the fastest-growing business of organized crime and the third-largest criminal enterprise in the world.2 The majority of sex trafficking is international, with victims taken from such places as South and Southeast Asia, the former Soviet Union, Central and South America, and other less developed areas and moved to more developed ones, including Asia, the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America.3   SOME Pretty Strong Evidence IMO.

                patriot, I sourced the post 2 times, do I need more sources?  How would I source common sense?
               </p>
               <p>
                ....with the numbers being inaccurate etc, I would say it depends how/ where you get your stats from,
keeping in mind there is backlog to updates.  However I don't see that the increase in the no.s   is inaccurate . or sensationalist.  It is real and people  need to be awakened.

                 No one here will consider ..la soluzione..
No one wants to put even a minute of their time talking and discussing silutions..
They just jack off to new stories..all info junkies and disinfo junkies..
                </p>
                <p>
                 ..the US treasury has a anti child trafficking arm..which people together can activate by even spending a dollar to reduce US debt..i asked people..on forums ..but everyone just ignores this simple remedy..
When u reduce ur govt debt u activate surety rights over ur govt..and it treasury..the US has worldwide jurisdiction..but people have to activate it by reducing the US debt at it debt reduction department..i emailed them and got a reply..in the positive that they will accept anyones money across the planet..to reduce the debt..
U end up activating courts of universal jurisdiction...wiki it 
..likelihood is people will ignore this simple solution
                </p>
                <p>
                 Try to source some individuals and act ..in an open source manner ..crowdfunding ..to reduce tge US debt so as to activate and i instruct the US treasury ..ie ur debtor..to act upon its anti child trafficking obligation..

                   Leave all this investigation to the people charged with anti child trafficking ..ie the US treasury..check it out ..and then teamwork to activate that department ..by reducing the US debt..
Speculation..copy pasting govt stats..doesnt solve the issue..the rewson why govt reports these stats is to inform the public to take action..we r the surety to the debt system..and the govt...the govt job is only to service the debt and administer it till the public decide to reduce debt and take control of the purse stringss ..its called surety rights over the debtor..when u rduce the US debt the govt becomes ur debtor ..and u can activate surety..
All this reading about banking..but now one spends a minute understanding the debt system...
Dont u think it is a waste of time..when all a group has to do is reduce the debt at the treasury..

                    Let the people that are committing the raping of our children and planning our demise pay up to reduce the debt at the treasury.  Many of us here have done a great service being here every day when we could have been spending more time with our loved ones.  I am not going to tell people what kind of volunteering they can do.  This site has been responsible for Red Pilling many, imo.  What is your problem?  You keep badgering people for trying to let others know what these sick perverts are up to.  I am not going to donate one $1 to that.  Let the Rothschilds Clintons and Soros and The Crown contribute to reducing the debt.

            Upvoat.  Thanks for having the Courage to post this.  If there are people that still believe the mafia went away, think again.  The are back full force and really never went away.  Also, they are involved in so many operations, including Sex Trafficking.  Yes, unfortunately there is a huge demand for Child Sex Trafficking and wherever there is demand, the mafia is involved.  Money is the Name of the Game.  BIG Money.

             Let’s not forget the global Hells Angels who work for the Freemasons doing their dirty work. Some high ranking members are Freemasons. Hells Angels are Luciferians who will do anything for money, drugs, guns, prostitution, murder. They are also involved in deep web snuff films where people can log in pay by bitcoin and direct the show. Sick fucks.

              There are some masons that are totally clueless of what is going on around them.  These are the Top Elites of the Org.  and Key people in some infiltrated Org.  But yes, the Freemasons have been undermining our Country since they started.  Another Shell Org.   Which reminds me Is Everyone Sick of All the Ads on TV from the Shriner's Hospitals for Children?  They have these Poor Kids shilling for them and the kids get next to nothing from the org.   I get so upset now I have to turn it away.  I Do Not Need Your Bloody Blanket!

             Got that right. Even my own mom knows that. Way back when I was in high school I joked about how the mafia went extinct. Thats when she told me I was very wrong, and the mafia is "alive and well".

              Why would they go away? I know the OG mafia was very unhappy about the world finding out about them selling drugs. They tried to keep a reputation, of literal wise men you could come to, for advice, and protection. Now they are nothing better than drug dealers and pimps, pushing deadly drug products, and underage prostitutes. Tisk tisk
