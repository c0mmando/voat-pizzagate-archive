<p>Here is a history of my findings to what made me bring this up...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found this story because i have been digging deep into the Sonoma County and surrounding areas where i have found multi million dollar donations to a known CIA MKULTRA front Esalen, serious hidden corruption surrounded around child health and &quot;transitional age youth&quot; groups spread out from top to bottom. Kids are &quot;diagnosed&quot; with &quot;mental illness&quot; where they are given psychiatric drugs and treatments and held in these homes for years until their eventual brainwashing has finally worked. All of this is now funded by a handful of billionaire &quot;philanthropist&quot; who donate their money all over the counties to shut people up, and to countless childrens themed &quot;non-profits&quot;. The same group of billionaires hold events and galas to buddy up with their political friends, judicial friends, pharmaceutical reps, business owners, and lawyers etc. Then they host fundraisers and charities to funnel money to these childrens groups who have bankers, police, and powerful former fortune 500 executives on their board of directors. These childrens programs also get piles of tax incentives and are directly connected to in their words to &quot;utilize a collaborative, wraparound approach to treatment that operates across the mental health, juvenile justice, child welfare and education systems&quot;. The same group of billionaires also happens to own major chunks of the local media and again i found them running an event sponsored by their media &quot;competitor&quot; also (surrounding media outlets reports on stories inside their county but they choose not to run it instead). These groups say they have helped 1000\'s of children and have been around for decades and in some cases a 100+ years but i can only find a very few testimonials and the common theme showed they were there for years and they hated it at first but &quot;grew to like it&quot;. Classic cases of traumatic stress and brainwashing similar to stockholm syndrome just stronger.</p>
<p>I\'m still digging and searching and can\'t hand out anymore details but if you start poking around these &quot;tay&quot; groups and other childrens inspired groups that involve mental health centers, juvenile justice centers, child welfare offices, education systems, hotels, resorts, art class, dance centers, They are all run and are funded by the elites of the city. Bankers, lawyers, politicians, police, pharmaceutical reps, business owners, advertisers, &quot;philanthropist&quot;, journalist and media personnel. There are very few people that actually came from a mental health background or from a child services background. The more you look the more suspicious it gets.</p>

<p>Back on topic</p>
<p><a href="https://patch.com/california/napavalley/napa-man-arrested-kidnapping-raping-13-year-old-girl-sonoma-county-sheriff">This story</a> came out you and you guys <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/comments/1763858">reported it</a> but an extremely disturbing detail has been left out of the story.</p>
<p>First lets look at some case details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 50-year-old Napa man was arrested early Saturday morning after he allegedly drugged, raped and kidnapped a 13-year-old girl, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff\'s office.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marble drove them somewhere in the country where they smoked marijuana together, and he allegedly made several sexual advances toward the victim.</p>
<p>Sheriff\'s officials said when the girl rejected Marble\'s advances, he tied her to a tree before sexually assaulting her. He then allegedly convinced the girl to use methamphetamine, and used a syringe to inject her with the drug.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>finally</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After an investigation, detectives from the sheriff\'s office arrested Marble, who has a long criminal history, on suspicion of numerous counts of sexual acts with a minor, kidnapping and child abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now lets go to<a href="http://napavalleyregister.com/news/local/children-the-quiet-victims-of-addiction/article_12385dd6-68aa-11e0-8e18-001cc4c03286.html"> this story</a> where they extremely important part reveals itself in multiple ways.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assistant District Attorney Michael O’Reilley said this was the case during the prosecution of Timothy Lee Marble, who sold drugs to an NSIB agent on three occasions with <strong>his 10-year-old developmentally disabled son</strong> in the vehicle with him. <strong>A later search found meth, syringes, hydrocone and marijuana throughout his home</strong>.</p>
<p>The district attorney’s office filed <strong>eight drug-related charges and three child endangerment counts</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A Napa County Superior Court judge dismissed the child endangerment charges after a preliminary hearing</strong>, and Marble later pleaded guilty to the drug counts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WTF really? For one where the fuck is his son? This is the absolute only evidence i can find that this child exist i\'m sure on the three occasions that the NSIB officer didn\'t hallucinate when he saw the child and three cases of child endangerment were filed but not a single mention of his &quot;developmentally disabled son&quot; anywhere on any recent news reports.</p>
<p>But wait remember when </p>
<blockquote>
<p>After an investigation, detectives from the sheriff\'s office arrested Marble, who has a long criminal history, on suspicion of numerous counts of sexual acts with a minor, kidnapping and child abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long? Before or after the previous story? The motives with the syringes and drugs are the same. Why where those child endangerment charges not filed if he had such a long history?</p>
<p>Again i have to quote</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After an investigation, detectives from the sheriff\'s office arrested Marble, who has a long criminal history, on suspicion of numerous counts of sexual acts with a minor, kidnapping and child abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>WHY WAS HE NEVER REGISTERED IN THE NATIONAL SEX OFFENDERS LIST?</strong></p>
<p>Why besides that 1 story from 2011 is there no mention or warning or any other info on this guy before the April, 2017 news stories? If he has such a large history where are some of the other news reports or court case filings on him like you can get on other criminals. </p>
<p>I feel like some type of &quot;Right to be forgotten&quot;, or &quot;Online Reputation &amp; Brand Protection&quot;, &quot;reputation repair&quot; service was used to hide and erase all of his past connections he may have had with people around him. You don\'t know where he came from, or where he worked, who his friends where, where he got those drugs from, or maybe even what childrens group home he probably grew up in.</p>
<p>All i know is that there is a suspicious amount of information missing on this guy but it only take that 1 story you missed to break it all back open again.</p>
<p>This is all centered around sex, drugs, mental health, corruption and children, sound familiar? There is a major &quot;created&quot; problem in the Sonoma county area and the rest of the country. This is happening by design for huge profit.</p>',

            I believe this is horrible, but you will not brainwash somebody with meth, hydrocodone and weed. It might actually give them a mental escape when the torture is over. If they had barbiturates, which unfortunately (for me), the US and Canada have gotten rid of off all of them except 2 very weak ones, butalbital in Fioricet/Fiorinal and phenobarbital, which is very very weak, used to detox from things like xanax and valium when taken at too large doses for too long, more often used by vets to control seizures in dogs...then maybe, some are still available from other countries, although nobody wants to make nembutal anymore except for Oregon's euthanasia program. The Danish company that was selling the US the stuff (nembutal..strongest of all barbs) when they decided to stop selling it to the US because of the moral angle regarding death penalty, some states have been using torture cocktails of drugs that killed the person in 1h30 of feeling like they're choking to death and giving them seizures. Obviously they weren't good people (although, more than half of those in death row are not guitly in hindsight...glad we got rid of it in '76...1976...when the real Democrats still existed, that Halloween Massacre will always make me like Carter, but his being influenced by a guy from my own country, a Polish-Canadian who became an American-Polish Canadian (ZBig...may you rot in hell) got Carter to bend to his will with Operation Cyclone....otherwise, the man was the last decent President you had and that's not a job requirement it seems...) Anyway the point of lethal injection was to make it painless and they're scoffing at the rebuttals. A Firing Squad would be more humane, by far.

            But yeah, all those children help places....it used to be legit, I remember when i was a kid, there was commercials and people who wanted would put these signs with a crying child and an adult hand going there way. It was Parent-Rescue, it helped kids who were lost while playing outside getting way too far from their home. And then a few pedos in the early 90's destroyed the whole thing.

            One thing I clearly remember is the Angel of Love Children Orphanage (not sure of the exact wording but it does contain Angel of Love) unfollowing EVERYTHING people would find on Reddit back then, even obscure stuff they shouldn't be following on Instagram, you'd see them unfollowing everything when shit hit the fan (sort of, reputations ruined anyway if we can take some satisfaction regarding Alefantis and Podesta, it's what we can take..for now). I loved how O'Neal trolled him after going to see a lawyer and the FBI and putting everything back on. His message to O'Neal was just...while he was awaiting for it "why are you a liar Ryan?" "why do you lie?"
