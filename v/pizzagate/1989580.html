<p>The Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Donald Trump, Jr. in the Trump Tower last summer, is a person of great interest. She was in the U.S.<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/manhattan-us-attorney-announces-civil-forfeiture-complaint-against-real-estate"> to defend her clients in a civil fraud case brought by Preet Bharara </a>and was intent on finding support in the U.S. for overturning the Obama-era Maginsky Act. </p>
<p>This law which sanctioned 39 Russian businessmen and barred them from entering the U.S. resulted in Putin signing into law on Dec. 28, 2012 (the Feast of the Holy Innocents) the Dima Yakolev Law which banned Russian adoptions in the U.S. (More on the so-called &quot;Herod Law&quot; which was fiercely criticized by progressives in Russia and abroad on this Voat thread: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1987091#submissionTop">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1987091#submissionTop</a></p>
<p>Natalia started a foundation, THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACCOUNTABILITY GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOUNDATION, ostensibly to overturn the ban on Russian adoption in the U.S. and restart the Russian adoption program in the U.S.. Her <a href="http://archive.is/EhQK2">organization\'s website</a> claims the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dima_Yakovlev_Law">Dima Yakovlev Law</a> was passed in retaliation for the Magnitsky Act:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Officially, the Russian law was passed following outrage over the 2008 death of Chase Harrison (original Russian name Dima Yakovlev) – a toddler adopted by a Virginia family, left to die in a car on a sweltering summer day.</p>
<p>Unofficially, Russia passed the law in retaliation for the 2012, passage of the US “Magnitsky Act” by the U.S. Congress, which imposed sanctions on Russia and on individuals blamed for the death of the Russian citizen, Sergei Magnitsky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Russian govt. has <a href="http://tass.com/politics/955627">denied any connection</a> with Natalia Veselnitskaya.</p>
<p>What I find interesting is the huge uproar over the Dima Yakolev Law by the usual suspects: UN.  Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, MSM in the U.S. , Catholic News Service, etc. Granted, there are needy orphans in Russia, but Putin added provisions to the law by executive order with the aim of improving domestic adoptions and the care of orphans, so one would imagine that folks would applaud such measures and also applaud his concern over the abuse and deaths of numerous Russian orphans in the U.S. instead of condemning him as a monster, and Herod &quot;cannibalizing&quot; his nation\'s children.</p>
<p>Some details on the measures in <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/12/21/russia-reject-adoption-ban-bill">Putin\'s executive order</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the day he endorsed the adoption ban, Putin signed an executive order aimed at improving support for domestic adoptions and foster care arrangements, simplifying adoption procedures, and changing attitudes in Russia about adoption. The order also calls for introducing tax breaks for Russians who adopt orphaned children, increasing salaries for orphanage staff, and increasing monthly state welfare payments for children with disabilities and those who care for children with disabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Misplaced outrage, to say the least, and the fact that Natalia V. is so outraged by the cessation of Russian adoptions in U.S. that she has launched a personal crusade to restart the process all over again is not a little puzzling.</p>
<p>N.B. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dima_Yakovlev_Law">Wikipedia article on the Dima Yakolev Law</a> states that Russian Orthodox Church applauded the Dima Yakolev Law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Russian Orthodox Church supports the law. Church spokesman Vsevolod Chaplin said that the orphans adopted by American citizens &quot;won\'t get a truly Christian upbringing and that means falling away from the Church and from the path to eternal life, in God\'s kingdom&quot;.[18]</p>

<p>Russian Orthodox Church spokesman nails the issue right here: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Father Vsevolod Chaplin, a high-ranking priest and a spokesman for the church, said the law was &quot;a search for a social answer to an elementary question: <strong>why should we give, and even sell, our children abroad?&quot;</strong> (my emphasis)</p>

            Browder tells TheDC that he will testify about Fusion GPS, Simpson, BakerHostetler lawyer Mark Cymrot, and Akhmetshin, the former Soviet agent who is now a Washington, D.C.-based lobbyist and consultant.  I would not trust this Akhmetshin.  He could even be a double agent.  He was also thought to have done hacking. And he is working in DC as a lobbyist?  This reads like a Russian/CIA Spy Novel.  There definitely are  some really covert playing around going on here. I now know why you had to process this.  I am still working on that too.  Yikes.

            Andrei Nekrasov, the director, is there for same reason Natalia Veselnitskaya is there.  They work together.

            This is also about Lavoy Finicom who was murdered in Oregon during the Bundy stand-off. The property in Oregon was owned privately as well as public lands. This is the location Uranium was found and HRC &amp; Podesta made a deal with Russia and sold off the land which is about 1/5 of the Uranium in the US. Bill Clinton gave a bogus speech and got a check for 1 million with Podesta racking in 35 million and the Clinton slush fund got huge paybacks. While she was Secretary of State. John was in the Whitehouse as Obama's counselor.
           </p>
           <p>
            The dispute later on was by the landowners and Finicum was killed and a shootout with FBI ensued.

            Yeah, I can't figure out who she was really acting for (it could even be Putin, he is a smart cookie) but I don't think for one minute she had any info on HRC.  That was a ruse.

            I think the answer lies in here.  This is from Wikipedia and I believe that she was really working for these people, and used the Hillary info thing to get a meeting with him, for how else was she going to get close to him? Natalia Veselnitskaya is a "Russian lawyer whose clients include Russian "state-owned businesses", including Petr Katsyv's son, Denis Katsyv. The latter owns Prevezon Holdings, an investment firm, and his father is the "vice president of the state-owned Russian Railways and a former deputy governor of the Moscow region". Veselnitskaya is known for leading a "multi-pronged" attack against "the Magnitsky Act, which provoked a Cold War-style, tit-for-tat row with the Kremlin when President Barack Obama signed it into law in 2012".[16] Veselnitskaya's campaign included an unsuccessful attempt in Washington to repeal the Act and to "keep Mr. Magnitsky’s name off the Law.[16] She was "also deeply involved in the making of The Magnitsky Act – Behind the Scenes—an anti-Magnitsky film that premiered in June 2016. She provided the film crew with "the real proofs and records of testimony" according to RussiaTV5, a "station whose owners are known to be close to Mr. Putin".[16] In response to the adoption of the Magnitsky Act, the Russian government denied Americans adoption of Russian children, issued a list of US officials prohibited from entering Russia, and posthumously convicted Magnitsky as guilty.[17] In addition, the Russian government reportedly lobbied against the legislation acting through a public relations company led by Kenneth Duberstein.[18][19] In June 2016, Veselnitskaya met with Donald Trump Jr. to discuss the Magnitsky Act after promising him information about Donald Trump's opponent in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton.

            You're thinking what "they" want you to think.
           </p>
           <p>
            Logic:If she's pro-Russian adoptions and an opponent of Putin's Magninsky Act, then she's a friend of Obama, the Cannibal Queen, and the Pedo Elite. The giving her a hard time and yada yada yada is all for show and making her someone they could use to set someone up. You've got to get used to these stupid dog and pony shows the Pedos put on. Liken it to a False Flag. Then they have an ally that is ready to get on the chessboard and help them play the game.
           </p>
           <p>
            She's a douchebag and a liar and not to be trusted. The joke is that this was: (1) after the election; and (2) demonstrates anti-collusion since Putin pretty much said nyet to Russian adoptions. And there's no contradiction when you view this from the proper perspective.

            Sounds like they were definitely: (1) Setting him up; and (2) Feeling him out. Must be a very lucrative operation and they wanted to see if he'd bite. Blackmail on the son of POTUS would be good to have.

            If are still up where you are, this whole thing is really perplexing me.  I will have trouble falling asleep.  I don't like going to bed wondering about these people.  Maybe she is running her own adoption thingy with someone here?  or in Russia.

             Misplaced outrage, to say the least, and the fact that Natalia V. is so outraged by the cessation of Russian adoptions in U.S. that she has launched a personal crusade to restart the process all over again is not a little puzzling.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            None of this is puzzling.  You're coming at this backwards.  It's not about adoption. Putin doesn't care about the adoption issue at all.  He just needed something to make America look bad. As you point out this is about economic sanctions and the Magnitsky Law.  The adoption issues is a cyncial tool he used.
           </p>
           <p>
            Putin hates the Magnitsky Law and how it exposed how his government works.  He needed something he could retaliate against the US and he used what he could.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are looking at this from the adoptions angle, you're looking through the wrong side of the magnifying glass.    This whole story makes perfect sense if you understand they people yelling about the adoption issue, don't care about the adoption issue.

             With all the child trafficking going on throughout the world with the help of elites in Europe, USA, and Australia, you may be the one looking at this backwards. Putin may be as disgusted as the people on this forum with the abuse of children. I'm sure he has heard more than one story of abuse of Russian adopted children.

            I'm a tad confused. After all this time, this is the big "Russian collusion" story we've all said doesn't exist and this is the best they can do? Some random pizzagate related Russian woman tries to meet with DTJr to find out if they can restart US / Russian adoptions once Clinton goes bye bye and he says no?

             That is clearly a 'foundation' created by intel services as a plausible deniability angle on the REAL REASONS Russia stopped adoptions to the US, as pointed out in the

            Hmm.  Maybe I should look into the Russian Orthodox Church over here.  Much better than the Catholic Church maybe.  Maybe they have not been infiltrated by the Nazi Jesuit Mafia.

            She was evidently shilling for TPTB.  Trying to get one of their Money Making Productions to come back here.  You can't blame a girl for trying.  We bit another bullet.  I doubt though that Putin would have allowed it.  He is pretty forceful when he sets his mind to it.  He would have flexed his muscles and shot it down.

           <pre><code>On the day he endorsed the adoption ban, Putin signed an executive order aimed at improving support for domestic adoptions and foster care arrangements, simplifying adoption procedures, and changing attitudes in Russia about adoption. The order also calls for introducing tax breaks for Russians who adopt orphaned children, increasing salaries for orphanage staff, and increasing monthly state welfare payments for children with disabilities and those who care for children with disabilities.***THIS is the kind of law we need.

            I just heard that on my local news. They are pretty good, actually surprising.  More Russian children meeting their deaths, is that what we need?    All Adoption Ctrs should be investigated.  If complicit, Shut Them Down.  Edit:  Thank you for your post.  Great Work. Upvoat4U.
