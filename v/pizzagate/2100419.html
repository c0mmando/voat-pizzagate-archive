<p>....&quot;Sexual exploitation of children is not only nationwide but worldwide.&quot; </p>
<p>M1 SAID , a clandestine for the &quot;boy love&quot; market that is published in Chicago, Its well known in Los Angeles. He also said boys are recruited in Los Angeles for a na- homosexual ring that is headquartered in Chicago. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A case in New Orleans, which led to arrests in other parts of the country, further demonstrates the connections that exist between child abusers In widely scattered localities. </p>
<p>New Orleans police, acting on a tip, last summer arrested Richard S. Hal- and Raymond T, Wood1all -on charges they had set up a Boy Scout troop for the purpose of sexually abusing children. . </p>
<p>Eventually 19 men were charged in the case with multiple counts of crimes against nature. New Orleans -Detective Mason Spong said the <strong>investigation extended into 34 states</strong>. </p>
<p>Among those arrested were Richard C. Jacobs of A\'lington, Mass., mil- president of the Jet Spray Corp. and a former part-owner of the New England Patriots football team; Robert B. Mallers, a California millionaire; and Hugh Scott Mellor of Brighton, Mass., millionaire president of a real estate holding company. </p>
<p>New Orleans police said Jacobs has forfeited a $50,000 bond to avoid standing trial in Louisiana. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>They said Halvorsen and Woodall went to New Orleans from Coral Gables, Fla., where they had worked as maintenance men for the <strong>Adelphi Academies</strong>, identified by Florida police as a former male prostitution front that-was recently sold to legitimate operators.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1974, Halvorsen nad Woodall organized Boy Scout Troop 137 with about 40 boys as members. From that group they selected about 10 to go on Scout trips. Police said sex sets between the men and boys occurred during these trips, and in the process one boy suffered inju- ries that resulted in his being hospitalized. </p>
<p>Halvorson and \'Richard A. \'Pass,, one of the 19 men charged in the case, also <strong>recruited boys for sex by working with community volunteer agencies dealing with runaways or boys from broken homes</strong>, police said. They said the two men gave the boys guitars and - cles as an inducement. </p>
<p>New Orleans District Att. Harry Connick said the Scout leaders also drew up applications for state and federal money to establish and operate homes for boys, but had not carried through with these plans. </p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>PETER BRADFORD, formerly a CO- owner of the <strong>Adelphl Academies</strong>, is among the 19 men charged in New Orleans. 
Sgt. Tony, Raimondo of the Coral Gables police Said evidence shows that Halvorsen went to a number of mothers in New Orleans and recruited six boys for the Adelphl Academies. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>He told the women he could get free scholarships for their sons to a Coral Gables school that would provide better education than they were getting. </p>
<p>Now Orleans police said Bradford then flew to, New Orleans and had sex with one of the boys and met the parents. Bradford flew back to Coral Gables and the six New Orleans boys subsequently enrolled at the academy. </p>
<p>Bradford is charged with two counts of aggravated crimes against nature in New Orleans but Has forfeited bond and remained In Miorlda, where no charges have been filed against him, </p>
<p>As in indication of tie close links that exist among child sex abusers, police said the address book of John Norman, now in the Illinois state prison at Pontiac, contained the name of Raymond Woodall. According to Chicago police, Norman operated a ring that sent boys around the country to serve a net- work of homosexual clients. </p>
<p>Woodall and Halvorsen have both been\' convicted and are awaiting sentencing. </p>
<p>A police search of. Halvorsen\'s files turned up the of Rev. Claudius Ira :[Bud] Jr., 47, who operated a. home for wayward boys in Winchester, Tenn. </p>
<p>Tennessee authorities were notified; and began an investigation. Vermilye was eventually arrested on charges that his <strong>Boys Farm, Inc</strong>., which had been partly financed with state and county funds, was a front for child pornography and sexual abuse. 
Vermilye is awaiting trial on 16 charges, including 3 counts of crimes against nature, 8 of aiding and abetting crimes against nature, 4 counts of contributing to the delinquency of minors, and one of using minors in the production of pornographic materials.</p>

            In case any visitor here still questions the connection between immigration and child sex rings here's the portion of the 1977 article pertaining to that:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Recently, Sgt. Lloyd Martin, who leads a special CDIl police unit set up In Los Angeles last September to deal with the problem, estimates more than 3,000 children....

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...Martin told The Tribune, police have found evidence that Mexican children are being smuggled into California in specially constructed cars.
            </p>
            <p>
             They lay eight children under the floorboards and fender wells, he said.
            </p>
            <p>
             'They stuff those kids in, Then they take them across the border, put them into a hotel, and clean them up."
            </p>
            <p>
             MARTIN SAID several young Mexicans have been killed recently and their bodies found in plastic bags. He suspects they may have been among the children smuggled in for sex purposes, and may have been
             <strong>
              murdered by "super sadists" who can only achieve sexual climax by torture and killing.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Martin said 70 per cent of the cases he deals with involve abuse of boys by men.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            (for visitors) This has been going on a very long time, and by all indications, it just became worse and more entrenched throughout our society...gone are the days when newspapers pose the question:
            <em>
             Why haven't the child pornographers been legislated out of business?
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead we see people behaving completely infantile, bemoaning the need to more accept the sexualization of children and normalization of pedophilia, screaming for the overthrow of our Constitution and demanding that unlimited numbers of undocumented, and unaccompanied minors, be "welcomed" to stay here.  (An open arms Welcome! from the US nationwide pedo rings and related international rings)

              Over a 13-month period, four white, middle class kids, two boys and two girls, were abducted, kept alive for several days, and murdered.
The killer was dubbed "The Babysitter," because the children showed evidence of having been cleaned and fed their favorite foods.

             The Suicide

             <p>
              A life of privilege wasn't enough protection in the end.
             </p>
             <p>
              Boarding school in Switzerland, multiple homes --- they mean nothing when you're sick inside and can't, or won't, stop yourself.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was the Monday before Thanksgiving, 1978, when police were called to investigate a suicide in one of metropolitan Detroit's wealthiest neighborhoods.
             </p>
             <p>
              The 27-year-old man lying in bed with a bullet between his eyes had led a troubled life for a long time.
             </p>
             <p>
              He'd been repeatedly arrested for criminal sexual conduct with minors.  His obsession was boys, many, many boys, coerced, bribed, and forced.
             </p>
             <p>
              Neighbors would recall a parade of young boys traipsing through the house.  When things got bad, the man's wealthy parents would appear with a quiet request and a wad of cash.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now he was dead, a 22-caliber rifle by his side.
             </p>
             <p>
              The man's name was Christopher Busch.  Sound familiar?  You might recall the blurb about the
              <strong>
               North Fox Island child pornography ring:
              </strong>

             suspect who had implicated himself in the case during a polygraph with Larry Wasser, though the victims' families, and the public, wouldn't learn his name until that fateful conversation at a Las Vegas convention nearly 30 years after his death.

               A convicted paedophile linked to the unsolved murders of four children in the 1970s after a breakthrough in DNA technology has a startling history of sex abuse, court records show.

               Arch Edward Sloan, who is serving a life sentence for raping a 10-year-old boy in 1983, has been named in the case of the Oakland County Child Killer, who went on the rampage for 13 months.

               Investigators reopened the case into the murders of two girls and the rape and murders of two boys in 2005 and found strands of hair on two of the victims matched a strand found in Sloan's car.

              <p>
               One suspect was sex offender Christopher Busch, who was named by another suspect as the killer. When he committed suicide in 1978, police found a drawing on his wall that looked like Stebbins.

              <p>
               In March 2009, the FBI found that that mitochondrial DNA from James Gunnels, a 47-year-old parolee, matched the DNA from a hair fragment found on Kristine's body.

              <p>
               Although a mitochondrial DNA match isn't as precise as a nuclear DNA match, the FBI said the findings were significant. Gunnels said he did not know how it got there and was not charged.

               Police in Parma Heights, Ohio arrested Ted Lamborgine, a retired auto worker believed to have been involved in a child porn ring in the 1970s. On March 27, 2007, investigators told Detroit television station WXYZ that Lamborgine was considered the top suspect in this case.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Lamborgine pleaded guilty to 15 sex-related counts involving young boys, rather than accept a plea bargain that would have required him to take a polygraph test on the Oakland County child killings. Lamborgine also rejected an offer of a reduced sentence in exchange for a polygraph on the case.[20]
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               In October 2007, the family of Mark Stebbins filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Lamborgine seeking $25,000. The lawsuit alleges Lamborgine, who lived in Metro Detroit in the late 1970s, abducted Mark and held him captive in a Royal Oak house for four days in February 1976 before smothering him to death during a sexual assault.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lamborgine has never been formally linked nor charged in the death of Mark Stebbins. Attorney David A. Binkley has sought compensation, including funeral costs, for Stebbins' brother, Michael, but stressed that money is secondary.[20]
              </p>
              <p>
               The truth is authorities never really caught a good break. Twenty years turned into thirty, and the case languished in the cold case files. That's why it was shocking to come across a recent headline announcing that the family of one of the victims was filing a wrongful death lawsuit against a 65-year-old Ohio man, claiming that he was “more likely than not” the Oakland County Child Killer.

               <strong>
                The man’s name is Ted Lamborgine. In 2005 a tip from a prisoner led investigators to question Lamborgine about a child porn ring that operated in Detroit in the 1970s. Lamborgine copped to being a pedophile but remained silent on the Oakland County murders.

             </p>
             <p>
              The similarities are damning. Lamborgine and a pack of sick buddies preyed on poor kids from the Cass Corridor, a particularly run-down section of the city, but Lamborgine liked to cross 8 Mile Road into the tonier areas to troll for kids and mix with suburban pedophiles. One of his victims described being held captive, assaulted, and then fed. Lamborgine packed up and moved to Ohio right around the time the murders stopped.

               <strong>
                But the strongest and most damning piece of evidence against Lamborgine is what he won’ t say. He pleaded guilty to 15 sex-related charges involving young boys rather than accept a plea bargain that required him to take a polygraph about the Oakland County killings. He also rejected an offer of a reduced sentence in exchange for a polygraph on the case. It's hard to imagine an innocent man making such a decision.

               The Devlin, Mendenhall, and Oakland County Child Killer stories all received varying degrees of publicity this year; they certainly can’ t be categorized as neglected or snubbed by the media. But one aspect of the stories has been mostly missed in the coverage --- the possibility of other victims.

               Wow... I wish there was a way to quickly connect dots moving forward in time. So many of these stories from the 70s/80s/90s just dead-end once it's all wrapped up. It never goes into their accomplices, lists of hundreds of clients, purchasers, distribution channels... etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               Each of these cases are so massive, there's no way that the arrest of small groups actually damages the infrastructure. Why wouldn't these stories continue over time via the investigators? It's sick.

                I'm going to work on a timeline (one of my favorite tools lol), but there is a lot I have to work with so it'll be time consuming and there is still digging I want to do.  I don't know if I'm going to have to just do the free trial subscription to get a look at that newspaper article, because all references to it are scrubbed.  In the search however it appears to be a huge article done as a promo of his Fox Island Company I believe.

                I cringed when reading  "Many weekends he takes young friends along to North Fox Island"....

              Wow. Lots of names here. I've never heard about any of this. I have a lot to look into. This is horrible. Have you looked into how much time they got? Specifically all of the active sponsors at the farm. Hundreds. what are these people doing today?

               I know, I just found the article last night...a lot of digging to do no doubt.  We know how the Franklin scandal was swept over, but with such an established nationwide pedophile ring already in place in 1977, it's beyond hard to believe that there aren't ties between some of the players.
              </p>
              <p>
               The more instances we can show of a continuity of the nationwide pedo ring, and then ties to the international UK systemic pedo nation that they are, things just keep getting uglier, and what seems like unrelated events may just be symptoms or cover up of that underlying international sex trafficking, child porn industry.
