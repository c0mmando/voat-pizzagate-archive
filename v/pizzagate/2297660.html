<p>Hillary and Bill Clinton took an extraordinary interest in Silsby’s case from the moment she was arrested and almost immediately stepped in on her behalf. The Harvard Human Rights Journal stated that one of Bill Clinton\'s first acts as special envoy for the United Nations in Haiti &quot;was to put out the fire of a child abduction scandal involving American citizens.&quot;</p>
<p>On February 7th, 2010, The Sunday Times reported that Bill Clinton had intervened to strike a deal with the Haitian government, securing the release of all co-conspirators except for Silsby. Prosecutors ultimately sought a six-month sentence in Silsby\'s case, reducing charges for conspiracy and child abduction to mere &quot;arranging irregular travel.&quot; A shockingly light penalty given the circumstances of her arrest, which would likely not have been possible but for the intervention of the Clintons in Silsby\'s case</p>
<p>On February 9th, 2010 Hillary Clinton consulted with Counselor Cheryl Mills and other attorneys in an email discussing the U.S. Government\'s &quot;options&quot; regarding the arrested Americans. The heavily redacted memo attached to that email does not reveal what these &quot;options&quot; consisted of. However, the State Department\'s American Citizens Services is only authorized to offer lists of local, English speaking attorneys to Americans arrested or detained abroad. To go beyond that authorization is a severe violation of protocol and is illegal. Additional emails reveal that the State Department was involved with making statements on the Silsby scandal and preparing to assist Silsby\'s co-conspirators with their return to the United States, although this is consistent with State Department protocol in these situations.</p>
<p>On February 11th, the New York Times reported that Silsby\'s original lawyer, Jorge Puello, was suspected of leading an international human trafficking ring involving women and minors. According the the Harvard Human Rights Journal Puello was ultimately arrested in an investigation being lead by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in connection with the ring. He was wanted in the United States, El Salvador and Costa Rica for his involvement with a network trafficking Central Americans and Haitians. 
At the time of his arrest, his wife was already imprisoned in El Salvador and “faced charges of presumed sexual exploitation of minors and women.” Puello was ultimately sentenced to three years in federal prison for &quot;alien smuggling.&quot; Another surprisingly light sentence given the original charges he was sought for. It it not known at this time whether or not Laura Silsby was associated with Puello\'s criminal enterprise.</p>
<p>On November 4th, 2016 The Daily Beast wrote a non-factual and intentionally misleading article covering the Clinton-Silsby scandal. They accused Wikileaks of publicizing a &quot;Reddit conspiracy theory&quot; which was &quot;riddled with incorrect information.&quot; The author, Ben Collins neglected to do basic research on the totality of the links presented in the post as evidence. Mr. Collins attacked the policies of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald">r/the_donald</a> towards freedom of speech and accused the forum of being racist without citing extensive or definitive proof. At no point did The Daily Beast provide proof that the allegations were not true, and did not disprove any of the evidence submitted. A link to an extensive study of the case by the Harvard Human Rights Journal which clearly linked Bill Clinton to the scandal was totally ignored. They similarly failed to acknowledge or address emails published by Wikileaks between Hillary Clinton and her legal counsel which may potentially indicate that she violated State Department policy for the treatment of U.S. citizens arrested or detained abroad.</p>
<p>The Daily Beast is a holding of American media conglomerate InterActiveCorp. Chelsea Clinton, Vice President of the Clinton Foundation and daughter of Hillary and Bill Clinton, sits on InterActiveCorp\'s Board of Directors. The proximity of the Clinton family to the organization responsible for oversight and direction of The Daily Beast raises questions about the publication\'s journalistic independence and their commitment to factual and ethical reporting on current events and topics of public interest. Given their slanderous and incorrect reporting on the Clinton-Silsby scandal, it seems clear that they do not hold these values in high regard</p>
<p>And how many more media outlets are doing cover ups?   I think we know which ones</p>',

            Just found out that the 10 missionaries had TWO lawyers!
Jore Puello AND Edwin Coq
           </p>
           <p>
            Coq was hired by PUELLO! He was fired by PUELLO when Coq was accused of BRIBING missionaries' way out of jail. Bribery is not uncommon in Haiti. IS THIS WHY BILL HAD TO INTERVENE?

            "Edwin Coq, Haitian Lawyer For Jailed US Missionaries, Fired PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti - The Haitian lawyer for 10 U.S. Baptists charged with child kidnapping tried to bribe the missionaries' way out of jail and has been fired, the attorney who hired him said Saturday night. The Haitian lawyer, Edwin Coq, denied the allegation. He said the $60,000 he requested from the Americans' families was his fee. Jorge Puello, the attorney in the neighboring Dominican Republic retained by relatives of the 10 American missionaries after their arrest last week, told The Associated Press that he fired Coq on Friday night. He had hired Coq to represent the detainees at Haitian legal proceedings. Coq orchestrated "some kind of extortion with government officials" that would have led to the release of nine of the 10 missionaries, Puello charged. Coq denied the requested $60,000 payment amounted to a bribe. "I have worked for 10 people for four days working all hours," he said. "Look at what hour I'm working now, responding to these calls. I have the right to this money." On Friday, Coq had told the AP that he was working for no fee. Puello said Coq initially requested $10,000 but kept asking for bigger and bigger amounts."

            The missionaries' lawyer, Edwin Coq, said he had requested the 10 be released provisionally pending the further hearings, but no decision was immediately taken on that. Coq said the Americans, who had been held at police headquarters up to now, were taken after the questioning on Friday to established prisons -- the women to a women's prison in the Petionville suburb and the men to the quake-damaged central prison in the capital.

            <p>
             You're just learning this?    They actually had more than two lawyers, not including Puello who was not a lawyer.
            </p>
            <p>
             You knew Puello was not a lawyer right?  Who did you think was representing them in court?  They needed a real lawyer licensed to practice in Haiti.  Puello was exposed and disappeared before they got out of jail and certainly before Silsby trial which was months later.
            </p>
            <p>
             He claimed to be a lawyer, but he was not Haitian.  He was living in the Domican Republic, so he was not licensed to practice law in Haiti.  He was acting as legal adviser.  Puello was just a conman.  He found out where the missionaries were from and contact their families in Idaho and that's how he got hired.  I don't think he spoke to Silsby or anyone else in Haiti first.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Two days after they were arrested on Jan. 29 while attempting to take 33 children across the border from Haiti into the Dominican Republic, Mr. Puello called up an Idaho church where five of the 10 Americans attend, offering pro bono legal services. Two relatives called him back and accepted, and Mr. Puello then began acting as the group’s lawyer, even though he lacked a law degree. Since his background has emerged, some of the detainees have sought to distance themselves from the man.
             </p>
             <p>
              “My clients have never met Mr. Puello and know nothing about him,” said Caleb Stegall, the district attorney of Jefferson County, Kansas, who is representing Drew Culberth, Paul Thompson, Silas Thompson and Steve McMullin. “As far as my clients are concerned, Mr. Puello never spoke on their behalf and as far as I am concerned, Mr. Puello has no involvement in this case now on behalf of my clients.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Hiram Sasser, who is representing Jim Allen, said his client never authorized Mr. Puello to represent him, either.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I think Puello was trying to steal Coq's legal fee.   Coq was a real lawyer.

             ?
“I help people in this kind of situation. We’re not going to charge these people a dime.”
But other lawyers for the detainees said that the families had wired Mr. Puello $12,000 to pay for the Americans’ transportation out of Haiti if they were released, and that they had been told by Mr. Puello in a conference call late Tuesday that he needed an additional $36,000. Mr. Puello said that he had not participated in a conference call.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              One lawyer for the families said that Mr. Puello had told him that he was licensed to practice law in Florida, but the lawyer said he had checked and found no such record. Mr. Puello said in the interview that he had never said he was licensed in Florida.

              So far, there is no indication that Mr. Torres knew any of the Americans before they were detained by Haitian authorities on Jan. 29. Instead, it appears that on Jan. 31 Mr. Torres called the Idaho church that five of the 10 missionaries attended and, using the name Jorge Puello, offered his legal services pro bono.
Relatives of some of the detainees took him up on his offer, apparently not knowing with whom they were dealing. He ended up receiving tens of thousands of dollars, a small amount of which he said Tuesday he intended to return to the families. “It’s in the bank,” he said. “The problem is, I can’t show up in a bank and say, ‘Here I am.’ ”

            "Clinton brokers deal over Haiti orphan abductions
 Tony Allen-Mills February 7 2010, 12:01am, The Sunday Times A DIPLOMATIC deal over the 10 American missionaries jailed in Haiti on child abduction charges may lead to the release this week of all except the group's leader, Laura Silsby, according to legal sources in Port-au-Prince.
           </p>
           <p>
            The intervention of Bill Clinton, the former president, who is co-ordinating relief efforts in Haiti, may accelerate the resolution of an affair that has embarrassed the US government, dismayed relief agencies and angered many Haitians who believe their plight is being exploited by unscrupulous foreigners.
           </p>
           <p>
            During a visit to Port-au-Prince on Friday, Clinton said the Haitian government was "not looking for some big fight. They just want to protect their children ... I think they'll find a way to defuse the crisis"."

             Nobody is saying Bill Clinton wasn't in Haiti in Feb 2010.  Anyone who is familiar with what happened knows this.  Yes, he was there on the dates, but why was he there?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the problem with coming up with a big shocker of a story and then looking for evidence of support.  You don't end up looking at the whole picture.  6 years after the Haitian Earthquake, a guy on Reddit claims he discovered a scandal in Clinton's email regarding Laura Silsby and claimed there was a cover up.   His entire story rests on the COMPLETELY FALSE claim that Clinton knew of Silsby from 2001 and basically argued it was because of this personal connection that the State Department followed Silsby's case and claimed the media covered this up.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was no media cover up because the claim that Clinton knew Silsby was false and the State Deparment's consular services are available to any American, including Americans arrested overseas.  In ensuring the legal rights of Americans arrested overseas
             <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/arrest-detention.html">
              is one the highest priorities of the State Department.
             </a>
             William Craddick/PleadingtheYiff knew his audience would not know any of this and this is how he built his deceitful argument.   International Media would absolutely know about consular services and many of them would have had need to make use of consular services when they reported in other countries.  This is why there was no media outcry even after the Clinton emails were released.  These were not shocking.  Everyone knew the Silsby case was an interntational incident and that Secretary Clinton would be asked about it.  Baptist leaders were calling on Obama to intervene.  Conservative newspapers were calling the Adminstration feckless for letting Americans rot in a dirty Haitian jail.  The NY Times ran a sympathetic story about the terrible conditions these poor Baptist missionaries were kept in.   This is why this whole Silsby narrative only exists on Reddit and VOAT and was not used by Republicans campaign operatives looking to hurt Clinton.  It's not true and everybody who covered the story knows it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everybody except one guy at the UK Times, story that no other media from the US, UK or Haiti backed up and that UK Times never mentioned again.  septimasexta says this story is backed up by a CNN article showing the dates match up.  In fact, the Times article was late. The quotes used in the The Times article were already used by CNN 2 days before the times article.  And the CNN article makes a couple of things clear.
            </p>
            <p>
             A.   The US government is not going to interfere with Haitian judicial process.
B.   Bill Clinton was in Haiti on behalf of the UN, not representing the US government.  (Even as an ex-president and wife of the Secretary of State, he was just citizen and would need authorization to speak on behalf of the government.)
C.   Bill Clinton's quotes (later used by the Times UK) were actually in support of point A.
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact, Bill Clinton's quotes only come at the end of a long article where both Hillary Clinton and State Department spokesman make clear the Baptists fate is the hands of the Haitian court system.

             So this is two days before the UK Times article and this is how other outlets reported it as well.  Note that the Times article never claims this was some secret mission.
            </p>
            <p>
             One day after the UK Times article, this article on Clinton's time in Haiti doesn't mention the Baptists at all.

            </p>
            <p>
             Two days after the UK Times article, the entire premise of that article is rejected by the State Department
             <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/02/09/haiti.clinton.arrests/index.html">

              The State Department also has ruled out any special role for former President Bill Clinton in a possible release of the Americans.

             <p>
              "It is unnecessary for former President Bill Clinton to play the role of intermediary as he did in North Korea in the case of the journalists being held," Crowley told CNN on Monday. "The situation in North Korea and the situation in Haiti are dramatically different. In Haiti there is a functioning government with which we have diplomatic relations and established channels to monitor and deal with bilateral issues. North Korea is an opaque society with which we have no diplomatic relations."

            <p>
             So the premise of that UK Times article based on an anonymous source was explicitly rejected by the State Department.  No other media reporting this no in the US, not in Haiti, not the International Press.  None.  Then's it's rejected on the record by the State Department.   Nothing comes out in the 7 years since it happened to indicate the Times got their story right, not here or in Haiti, even after Clinton runs for President.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the nail in the coffin?  The UK Times drops it completely.   Here's their story on Bill Clinton's heart surgery

             No mention AT ALL of this world exclusive scoop from the UK Times.  They do mention he went to Haiti twice at the urging of the UN.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Mr Clinton has been to Haiti twice since the earthquake in his capacity as the United Nations special envoy, as well as making time to campaign for the losing Democratic candidate in the by-election for the late Edward Kennedy’s Senate seat in Massachusetts.
             </p>
             <p>
              Last week, the UN asked him to co-ordinate the international aid effort in Haiti and he is scheduled to present a UN humanitarian appeal for the shattered nation on Wednesday.

              FEBRUARY 6, 2010 / 5:28 AM / 8 YEARS AGO
Bill Clinton urges solution to Haiti 'kidnap' case
             </p>
             <p>
              PORT-AU-PRINCE, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Bill Clinton urged the U.S. and Haitian governments on Friday to resolve the case of 10 American missionaries accused of trying to take children illegally out of quake-hit Haiti.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Clinton, named by the United Nations to coordinate relief efforts for survivors of the devastating Jan. 12 quake, made the appeal during a visit to the shattered Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, his second since last month’s disaster."
             </p>
             <p>
              The Americans’ case is diplomatically sensitive and aid groups complain it has distracted media and world attention away from the struggle to feed and shelter hundreds of thousands of Haitians camped out in wrecked streets.
             </p>
             <p>
              "What’s important now is for the government of Haiti and the government of the United States to get together and work through this," Clinton told CNN in Port-au-Prince.
             </p>
             <p>
              He said he understood the Haitian government’s efforts to try to protect its children from possible child traffickers and unlawful adoptions following the catastrophic quake.
             </p>
             <p>
              But he also said the missionaries could be telling the truth when they argued they simply wanted to help the children and did not mean to violate any laws. Evidence has emerged that many of the intercepted children were not orphans but were given up by parents who wanted them to have a better life."
             </p>
             <p>
              CHECKMATE  YOU LOSE
Personally, I think this leak is how the Lynn De Rothschild types control the Clintons. HE WAS WARNED.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The government of Haiti ... (is) not looking for some big fight here. They just want to protect their children and they also want to make sure they have a good inventory so they don’t send children away that maybe have an aunt or an uncle that have an income," Clinton said."

               It's not that I don't trust the UK Times.  I think they are legitimate source.  I see no support for this story.   All legitimate newspapers get things wrong because real jouralism is hard.   To me it seems like a source in Haiti heard Clinton came to town at the same time the Silsby case was causing headlines wordwide and made an assumption passed along incorrect information.  The Times said nothing about this being a secret mission.  When Clinton or Carter acted as envoys for the US government it was public info before they even left the United States.
              </p>
              <p>
               Again this article has no support at all from any other media source or from the various lawyers (including a few Americans) working on behalf of the Baptists, no Hatian media reported this.   Nothing in 7 years came out to support this one article when tons of info came out on the Clinton's during the election.  It was explicitly denied a few days later AND THE UK TIMES never repeated the claim even in an article on Bill Clinton 5 days later.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've seen this Reuters article and it's one of the reasons I think the Times is wrong.  The Reuters article completely supports my point of view.  It's the same quotes as used in the CNN story I posted.  The CNN story with those quotes came out on Feb 5, the Reuters story Feb 6 and the UK Times article on Feb 7.   Clinton goes to Haiti as the UN envoy for relief efforts and is obviously asked about the Baptists.  That is the context of all these quotes.  These are not official pronouncements of all these quotes.
              </p>
              <p>
               Clinton is not saying he is working on something.   He is saying he hopes the US Government and the Haitian Government can work something out.   Bill Clinton is speaking as an outsider, as a citizen.  He does not represent the US Government.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>

               <p>
                ...."I think they’ll find a way to defuse the crisis and work through this," he added, but he said the case was not his direct responsibility.

                The U.S. government, which is spearheading the big relief operation in Haiti, has said it is providing the Americans with consular access and monitoring their case, but it has made clear it does not want to interfere.
               </p>
               <p>
                "Obviously this is a matter for the Haitian judicial system," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is Bill Clinton’s wife, told reporters in Washington.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               You can do a search for February 5-7 2010 and Bill Clinton and see how other media articles covered Bill Clinton and used his quotes from that day.
   Only the UK times report some diplomatic role.   ABC's Nightline spent the day with him on Feb 5. He helicoptered in from the Domincan Republican and spent six hours on the ground. He brought supplies, visited an AIDS clinic, etc.   Remember the earthquake was a much, much more urgent event and story than the 10 Baptists.   This is what I was talking about when viewing the past through a filter.   If you only search for Silsby, you don't get the whole picture.

                "Well, I think first the State Department and the Haitian government are both on this, and they are going to find a quick and just way to do it," Clinton said. "And they are represented by lawyers, they haven't been mistreated, but the Haitians are very sensitive to what has happened in countless other places around the world in the wake of natural disasters, where people have come and taken children, had parents that still wanted them, or had aunts and uncles that still wanted them.

               <p>

               <p>
                According to Reuters and The Sunday Times, Bill directly inserted himself into the Silsby affair. Bill was not working directly for the U.S. government at the time, so of course his WIFE, who WAS working for the U.S. government, could claim "The U.S. government, ....... is providing the Americans with consular access and monitoring their case, but it has made clear it does not want to interfere."  Bill is the messenger to Haitian officials and Hillary is the enforcer. BONNIE AND CLYDE!

                 You again are wrong about this.  Reuters contradicts the Times.   Reuters points out that Bill Clinton was not involved in the Silsby affair.
I don't think you are actually concerned at all with what Reuters actually said.  You want to maintain your fantasy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And it's not only Reuters, you can't find another media outlet who reported what the Times reported.  And the Times did not say this was some secret mission. It was publicly refuted days later by the State Department.  So what did the Times do?  Did they do a big expose on how the State Department was lying?  No.  They dropped the claim and never mentioned it again.  Even on the article on Bill Clinton 5 days later.   Why did the UK Times drop this claim?

                 Emergency heart surgery for Bill Clinton after Haiti trips
James Bone in New York

The Times
                </p>
                <p>
                 Bill Clinton underwent emergency heart surgery last night after he complained of chest pains.
                </p>

                 The former President, who was reported to have been tired and suffering from a cold after two trips to Haiti since the earthquake, had two stents inserted in one of his coronary arteries at a hospital in New York. He was in good spirits and up and walking around after his surgery.

                <p>
                 Terry McAuliffe, former Democratic National Committee chairman and a close friend of the Clintons, said that Mr Clinton participated in a conference call on earthquake relief as he was being wheeled into an operating room.

                <p>
                 His wife, Hillary, the US Secretary of State, remained in Washington to attend a weekly Oval Office meeting with President Obama before heading back to New York. Mrs Clinton had been scheduled to depart today for a five-day visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia, but officials said that she would now delay the trip by a day.

                <p>
                 The couple’s daughter, Chelsea, was at the hospital with her father. Mr Obama called Mr Clinton to wish him a speedy recovery.

                <p>
                 Mr Clinton, 63, had a quadruple bypass operation in 2004 to clear four blocked arteries. He had a second operation in 2005 to remove scar tissue and fluid that had built up after the original surgery.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Allan Schwartz, his cardiologist, said that Mr Clinton came to see him complaining of discomfort and that tests showed one of the arteries operated on in 2004 needed to be reopened.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “Of the four bypass grafts that he had six years ago, one of the bypass grafts was completely blocked,” Dr Schwartz said. “The artery that had been supplied previously by this bypass graft was opened by placing the two stents.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 He said there was no indication that Mr Clinton had had a heart attack or of any damage to his heart. Dr Schwartz, head of cardiology at the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York, said that Mr Clinton was up and walking around and should go home later today to resume his “very active lifestyle”. He said he could return to work as soon as Monday.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The doctor said the blocked artery was not a result of Mr Clinton’s diet or lifestyle, which he described as excellent. He said the grafts Mr Clinton received in 2004 had a failure rate of up to 20 per cent at five

                  Bill Clinton underwent emergency heart surgery last night after he complained of chest pains.

                  COMMENT
In hindsight, this part of the article is quite revealing. Didn't Breitbart die from a heart attack? Even his coroner was knocked off. BILL is making deals for relief money. The Haitian government holding Silsby needs relief money. DUH. Bills devoted wife can't take the time to be with her husband in the hospital. SHE IS BUSY MAKING TRAFFICKING DEALS WITH THE SAUDIS who were also major Clinton Foundation donors. I would be willing to bet she met with some of the recently rounded up Saudi princes! Poor Chelsea!

Eric Holder, Andrew Breitbart and the CIA Heart Attack Gun
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "Back in 1975, a CIA whistle-blower blew the lid off of a top secret US government weapon called the ‘heart attack gun’. Operating much like a modern vaccine or shot dispenser in lieu of a syringe, the gun shoots a small, dissolvable projectile. The Info Wars article also includes a black and white image from the 1975 US Senate hearing into the matter showing Sen. Frank Church and Sen. John Tower holding up the secret CIA ‘heart attack gun’.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  According to descriptions, the small projectile delivers a shellfish toxin that in 1975, was allegedly stored in bulk by the CIA. Once the toxin enters the blood stream of a victim, a massive heart attack quickly follows. The reason government agents reportedly use the shellfish toxin is because it rapidly dissolves in the blood stream. With the exception of the small, barely noticeable entrance wound, the death would look like a natural heart attack."

                   Breitbart had a history of heart trouble and this is why is family   And no his coroner was not knocked off.   The guy in CA who died was not a coroner who needs to be a medical doctor in CA and he had zero to do with the Breitbart's autopsy.

"Clinton underwent the procedure at the same hospital where he underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery in 2004. The former president had recurring episodes of chest pain over the past several days, a Clinton aide said, and he could have suffered a heart attack if the condition had gone untreated."

               Why did Bill Clinton go instead of the Secretary of State? Because we don't have diplomatic relations with North Korea.  We don't "officially" talk to them, so we can't use official diplomats  If an American in North Korea needs consular services, they go to the Swedish embassy.  Also when Bill went, North Korea rejected other possibilities like Al Gore.  Not high enough status.

               When Clinton was in office and wanted to negotiate on their nuclear program Jimmy Carter was the envoy.  He offered to do the same for President Trump.

                 You seem to be smearing two journalists.  They are actual journalists and they were investigating human trafficking and got duped into being arrested by North Korea.  They were doing a story on the desperate people who escape North Korea into China.  The women have no legal status and no protection and often are taken by traffickers.  They met a source who said he would show them something important, but was working with North Korea and he convinced them to come into NK territory and they were arrested.

                 Yeah, Lisa Ling is a well known TV journalist for a couple of decades know.

                 What exactly is the accusation you're making.

                <p>
                 You seem to be assuming criminality and then simply noting connections without providing any proof of the original criminality and then assuming every connection is criminal too.   Life doesn't work that way.

            This is a complete misread of what happened.   Bill Clinton DID NOT INTERVENE see below.
           </p>
           <p>
            The State Department got involved because that is what they do.  Assisting Americans arrested overseas is a high priority of the State Department.  They got involved with 10 AMCITS as the emails called them--American Citizens-- because they had no idea who Silsby and her crew were.   It went to the top of the State Department because it was an international incident.  This is the key email on this and pizzagaters NEVER discuss this
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3765">
             https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3765
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead they love to talk about "an email from 2001" that is NOT an email and is NOT from 2001.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was zero personal connection between Hillary Clinton and Laura Silsby before she was arrested.  There's no media coverup whatsoever because it never happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            The author of this Zero Hedge article consciously lied about that.  He wrote the original piece on Reddit with this claim:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Hillary has a LONG history of interest in Ms. Silsby. Wikileak emails dating back till at least 2001 have been found in her archives discussing Laura's NGO.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This story is completely debunked here
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2122876">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2122876
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The document he claims in an email from 2001 is quite clearly not an email and also quite clearly was written in 2010 AFTER the Haitian Earthquake. This is why I say he's a liar.  Most pizzagate people are not even aware of this email
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3765">
             https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/3765
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            It shows exactly how that Word doc from 2010 got in Clinton's inbox.  It was an attachment to that email.
That email quite clearly shows the first time that Clinton even became aware of Silsby's group.  It absolutely proves that Clinton nor anyone else at the State Department knew who Silsby was before she was arrested in Haiti.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Harvard Human Rights Journal stated that one of Bill Clinton's first acts as special envoy for the United Nations in Haiti "was to put out the fire of a child abduction scandal involving American citizens."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This law article states this but it is false.  It was reported in one media outlet that Bill Clinton intervened in this case, The UK Times, but it's highly dubious that was true.  No other media reported it at the time or in the seven and a half years since it happened, even as H. Clinton's record was thoroughly examined for two years during a presidential run.  No Haitian media reported this.  And it was never even mentioned again by UK Times.
            <a href="[http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/02/09/haiti.clinton.arrests/index.html">
             It was explicitly denied by the State Department two days after that original report
            </a>
            ](http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/02/09/haiti.clinton.arrests/index.html))  It would have been a very big story for the media to catch the State Department lying about this and they did not.  That is because the UK Times reported on a rumor that turned out to be false.  Bill Clinton was back in NY while all 10 Baptists were still in Jail.
The Harvard journal article by the law professor relies on the false UK Times report.  It's not a second source.   And the law professor says Clinton was in Haiti for 30 days working on this deal, that is false.

                It seems like you're dumb enough to believe there are pictures of Silsby and Clinton.

              I merely assumed Sillsby and Clinton were buddies based on the fact that the Clintons are scumbags, but I don't see anything in the e-mail leaks supporting this notion.  If 'shewhomustbeobeyed' is correct, then your namecalling and continued assertions of bogus information being true will only serve to discredit

               I doubt Silsby ever even voted for Clinton.   What do we know about Silsby?

               She was from Idaho.   She was a Baptist.

              <p>
               Clinton doesn't have ties to Idaho that I know of.   It's also so Republican, I don't know if

               White Southern Baptists from red states don't tend to be Clinton Supporters.  And Silsby's church was from the conservative wing of the Baptists and very opposed to things like gay marriage.

            Why did Vernon Howell change his name to David Koresh? striking similarities between Koresh and Cyrus R. Teed, a former Union Army medical corpsman in the Civil War who changed his name to Cyrus Teed Koresh and founded a religious commune called the Koreshan Unity. Why were the Governments so scared of this cult that they needed to wipe them all out? Were they getting to close to some truths?
What did Teed Koresh believe to be true? is NASA and the government hiding more from us than we could ever imagine? Just a thought.
