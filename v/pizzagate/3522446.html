            , what exactly is the pizzagate thesis, here? The article you linked was a shitty review of the restaurant. This board is for serious research submissions, not those that quote things out of context and then imply a nefarious meaning that isn't actually supported by the evidence you've presented. Here's the quote in context:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             None of this mattered, of course. I was prepared to suffer any indignity to sample Cecconi's famous house speciality: risotto made from rare white Alba truffle. This truffle, which costs £900 per kg, is the rarest and most expensive in the world. It comes from northern Italy and is only in season one month a year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two weeks earlier, Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey had made a pilgrimage to Cecconi's to feast on this dish and had run up a bill in excess of £500. This promised to be a meal I would never forget.
            </p>
            <p>
             Oddly, there was no mention of white truffle risotto on the menu, but my waiter assured me that if I was prepared to wait for 25 minutes I could order it as a main course.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Are you claiming Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, and Kevin Spacey were there to rape kids and "white Alba truffle risotto" is a new type of pedo food code? If so, you need to come right out and say that. And then you need to provide some other supporting evidence that this restaurant might be involved in trafficking kids -- some kind of info on the owners or some connection to pedos or pedo-related imagery. As this stands, it does not meet Rules 1, 2 or 3 of our submission requirements, and belongs in our speculative subverse,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            From where I stand, it looks like you are mocking this board.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I am willing to consider that you are new and don't understand the submission rules, so I will give this our 24 Hour Grace flair, so you can edit.

             The video was not filmed at Buckingham Palace, and it was made for a commercial iirc. It's not an actual video showing someone who is trying to escape.
