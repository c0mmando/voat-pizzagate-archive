<p>Hinckley Studios has kids classes taught by&quot;the incomparable Karna Robinson, a kid favorite.&quot;

<p>Is this the right person, or someone with the same name?

&quot;Tide ranger enterprise&quot;?</p>
<p>A lot of people come thru the Hinckley studio:
&quot;The studio serves about 200 students per week at approximately 16 classes. Students come from some of D.C.\'s biggest law firms, companies and even the World Bank, said Weber. The studio has had students from six of the world\'s seven continents, she added.&quot;

<p>Karna doesn\'t have any of her art on the internet, not that I can find.  Nor any evidence of being a kids favorite other than the ad for classes at Hinckley. And on the about us page for Hinckley, she isn\'t included amongst the &quot;our instructors&quot;.</p>
<p>But she does have this: she owns a nuclear consultant company.  <a href="http://www.manta.com/c/mtm2ddh/tide-ranger-enterpri">http://www.manta.com/c/mtm2ddh/tide-ranger-enterpri</a></p>
