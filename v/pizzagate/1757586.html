            Think the many personal ways of getting the news out are great ideas.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, the computer-generated likenesses of the Podesta brothers and Weiner seem questionable in my mind.
NOT that I don't think they were involved.  I think very likely they were involved.
But from what I've read about how those likenesses came about, they were based on a report by an Irish witness
which was secured by a detective working for the McCann's at one time ... who ultimately embezzled funds from them.
And, I've read one report that the Irish witness retracted his statements.  Nothing new in all of that.
These computer-generated likenesses are quite different -- even showing some very small marks on Tony Podesta's face/
forehead which I would question whether any witness would have noticed??
It's been suggested that the detective may have had suspicions that the Podesta's were actually involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another point is that it may be better overall -- given 50 years of previous investigations by NYPD where three very serious investigations were stopped once they began to collect names of higher up's -- to continue to connect PEDO-GATE with Pizzagate since Pizza seems to equate to "Alefantis" accusations.

            I say hit up church youth groups. I would hope there would be an interest in kids getting trafficked, they are also tight networks.  Speak to a few of them and they will spread the info through their whole church.  Possibly without even touching a comp.  Imagine if Joel Osteen could make a statement about this during his Sunday worship.  I think at least 5K people go to his church.

            Although I honestly don't want to put one step anymore in America, I still wish I was there just so I could spread awareness. Where I'm from in Europe, the problem is big as well (and you all know that) but we don't have the kind of developments like recently in the US. That's where it will have to start, the rest will follow. I have been raising some awareness through facebook, with modest succes, but of course I'm making myself look like a lunatic.

            Success is always about proper target selection. Handing flyer's out on the street, most will  get tossed unread. Handing out flyer's to a captive group who are in the grip of boredom will greatly increase the amount that get read. Hand them out at crowded bus stops or train stations. Taxi drivers have turned up in many recent news stories about child trafficking. Canvas not only the drivers but also the companies dispatcher. Get the owners of small, heavy traffic connivance stores to post the flyer's so the customers can read them as they wait in the check out line. Keep your eyes open you will see lots of high yield local targets.

             exactly thats why they get stuffed in the mailbox. and they get handed out at public pizzagate protest events. they should have been doing that at all pizzagate protests.

              Remember only the mailman is allowed to put anything into the mailboxes. It is against Post office regulations for average Joes to deliver messages through mailboxes without paying postage.  " 2.11, the receptacles described in 1.1 may be used only for matter bearing postage. Other than as permitted by 2.10 or 2.11, no part of a mail receptacle may be used to deliver any matter not bearing postage, including items or matter placed upon, supported by, attached to, hung from, or inserted into a mail receptacle. Any mailable matter not bearing postage and found as described above is subject to the same postage as would be paid if it were carried by mail".

            I like this idea of a guerrilla campaign.  Since the FBI has let us down, and also the NYPD, (just posturing and giving the vibe they are unhappy with the feds for not releasing weiner's emails), we just may need to do something like this.

            Does anyone have a copy of the wanted flyer op's referring to? I'm presuming it's just something that was created by one of us or another interested party?

            yeah energy is a different transaction than money lol. your argument is done stop shilling. I lend my energy to looking at my mail every single day. I also know it "cheaper" to spend 5 minutes going on a computer than going out and earning $10 bucks.  No comparison because 5 minutes of my free time is not worth ANY EXCHANGE OF ANY CURRENCY. Because exactly its free time. cant even believe im arguing nonsense with a shill but must prove him wrong lol. there's also no way you could have typed that up without it being planned im typing insanely fast with grammar mistakes and you have none so i guess reply must be planned copy pasta lol.

             "yeah energy is a different transaction than money lol. " Energy IS the essence that the 'money' represents, dolt.

             You cannot understand that you are choosing to PAY attention to a poster on a thread right now? It is not 'free' time, in the sense that it is now spent, gone. You chose to PAY in in a direction that may not have yielded you anything of 'value', but you 'spent' it none the less.
            </p>
            <p>
             You think someone being able to type, or have knowledge about the metaphysics of energy and economics must be a shill? For who?

             Again, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but flyers carry a dismal ROI.

               ROI is life, not 'money'. Efficiency of energy, exertion, effort. Learn about it.

                 Name calling doesn't change logic. ROI is not always about money, it is about getting the most return/results from the most effective, and efficient effort. Maximizing the impact and return from the least energy. That is ROI. If you could take off the capitalist blinders and understand I am not taking about money, perhaps your rat will start running the wheel.

                  I understand VERY CLEARLY. you think an $8.00 investment plus 20 minutes of your time is a terrible ROI for saving children. Man you're even bad at shilling that you know marketing. If one of my employees gave me 5 leads for $8 dollars and 20 minutes of time I would give them a very good bonus. That equates to $2,000 in my business. You on the other hand would be fired at my firm. LEL shills saying "but im good at capitulism" and shill they know what a good ROI is and don't even know what a good return on investment is LMAO.

            Hi, I know folks here are not lawyers or police, but this is not a hot idea.  Poster this flyer below would be committing defamation
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://media.wix.com/ugd/0284de_fb24af1a8c2f46458b64a0da7a37f28c.pdf">
             http://media.wix.com/ugd/0284de_fb24af1a8c2f46458b64a0da7a37f28c.pdf
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            You would be committing  libel if you posted that poster.   Now maybe, you want to commit civil disobedience or you figure that there's no real risk, but you should know that as the poster is right now, it would be libelous and open you up to a potential lawsuit.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the reason the poster is libelous is the simple fact that neither Tony Podesta or John Podesta are wanted by the police.  That is simply false.  They would be in no fear of arrest if they walked into Scotland Yard or any police station in Portugal. And the way you labelled the photos and the sketches while cute would not be a defense.  It would be an admission that you knew John and Tony Podesta are not wanted by the police

             You are right that is why we are now discussing poster ideas and voting on them so we can all avoid libel and any potential legal action against us at

            <p>
             you are wrong however about it being libelous if that poster just had WANTED instead of Wanted by police. 100% legal.
            </p>
            <p>
             poster should be more informative but yes images are very powerful. Thats why we are putting together the greatest pizzagate mainstream meme arsenal of all time and voting on it at

              Wanted by Police was also unidiomatic.
             </p>
             <p>
              But you're not correct that just having WANTED would make it legal.   Lots of real Wanted posters including Washgington, DC just have WANTED as their headline.
             </p>
             <p>
              They have Wanted, the crime and the reward in large type.   See here

             <p>
              The top right has a DC logo and in pretty small type they have MPD, but you have to look for it.

              Also it makes no sense to direct them to this sub.  You should direct to particular page.

            While I appreciate your enthusiasm, that is not how marketing numbers work with regard to flyers/handouts/mailers. Actual engagement numbers via that medium yield at best 5%, more typically around 1%.
           </p>
           <p>
            So for every hundred flyers 1-5 people will take notice/action....

              LOL. We are ALWAYS selling: our perspective, our information, our links, etc....

              You are ALWAYS selling.
             </p>
             <p>
              You have to convince (sell) someone on the idea of why they should transact with you. They PAY their attention to you or your product or your information. There is an exchange   of energy taking place. In order to facilitate that transaction, a sale of some sort is made.
             </p>
             <p>
              Has anyone ever tried to hand you a flyer? Think about the one's you took, and the one's you declined. Did you read any? Why? Something either the presenter or product offered. The sale.

                 yeah your right. but that other guys argument is its more 
"expensive" to spend 5 minutes of free time on a computer than spend actual money on someone trying to sell you a yearly $700 cable bill. wish people would see through that. i think people do.

                  No it is not my 'argument' at all. I am merely stating that the cost of flyer-ing, both in labor and materials, offers a terrible ROI, based on the historical metrics surrounding flyer-ing as a medium.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It cost me way more time (labor aka energy) to make and distribute one hundred flyers, that maybe 5 people will read and take action on, than other means by which I could have larger reach and impact/influence.

                   10 minutes at the local library. $8.00 for 100 copies. have good relationship with mail man. slip him $20 and say hand these out? what am i missing. In fact its an insanely great ROI. Assuming you ONLY get 5 leads. $8.00 for 5 leads will make you skip 5 levels of promotion and make you a marketing executive over night. please stop shilling.

                    I have explained it to you already.

                   <p>
                    Please explain what you even think a shill is, as your use of the word is wildly off. Who is paying me to state obvious truths here, which you are calling shilling?

                    What are you out? $28 and 10 minutes.

                    You could have a greater reach with less 'cost', yet you fail to realize this, and believe that someone is paying me to attempt to explain this to you. Not so much.

                     Tell me a better way to spend $28 dollars reaches 100 people LMAO. google censors everything first of all and second of all $1.28 per click gets you 14 impressions lol not actual leads. I GET 100 with flyers. plus i have my own printer so really its FREEEEEEE. So your telling me id rather get 14 impressions and maybe .4 of a lead for $28 dollars. WOWWWWWWWW. cant even believe im talking about people who possibly would help with the pizzagate investigation as a lead. Confirmed pedo and govt. shill you are

                     . And third of all signs cost $300 but possibly could reach 100 people. I'd rather spend $28.00 for 100 people to see then $300 LMAO. such a fucking shill you are. So honeslty tell me a better way LMAO. but i already know your a shill because you are SHILLING a narrative that this is a bad idea. not only do you lie and say i dont know what a shill is YOU GO AHEAD AND ACT LIKE ONE LOL HAHAHAHAHHA. woow  you give yourself up way too easy and then upvoat your own comments with SHILL accounts to make yourself look relevant when really you look even more like a SHILL HAhAHHAHAH. I think i had to just explain to you what it is cuz even a SHILL doesn't know what a shill is LMAO. its someone who shoves forth a narrative down peoples throats because they cannot let the truth come out. FUCK OFF AND LMAO SHILL HAHAHHAHHAH

                You are PAYing your attention. There is always an energetic exchange in every transaction. 'Money' is merely a physical expression of our life force energy. We pay for everything. Including this website, this interaction, etc. We have an energy supply from which we pay.
               </p>
               <p>
                Calling me a shill for your ignorance is childish at best, and lazy at worst. Look into someone's posting history, consider their information, before dismissing it out of hand due to lack of understanding and immaturity.
               </p>
               <p>
                Money is merely a token of energy. That is why it says federal reserve note on it, it is a debt note. Meaning an IOU. And the debt exchange is energy. What do you trade your energy or 'labor' for? Debt notes.
               </p>
               <p>
                When we decide what information to injest, to PAY attention to, to SPEND time on, we are paying our energy. Simple concept, really.

            Just a thought but you could also place them up on the boards in the grocery stores ( by the shopping carts ) with a stick pin , a lot of people still stop and look at things hanging up on those I know my family does .

             And no one can deny the long history of the Catholic Church's involvement with sexual abuse of children.

             This is old news, new news and current news.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also keep in mind -- for precedent setting awareness -- that the US government in its campaign of genocide versus the Native American was involved in kidnapping native American children, denying their parents access to the children, putting them into "Church schools" where they were forbidden to speak their own language.  They were forced into Western European clothing, their braids cut.  They were beaten, murdered, hung -- sexually abused in every way.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is our history -- it is the very history of this nation and organized patriarchal religions.

             Hijacking top comment to re-introduce my idea for a better sticky.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sure, the executive summary should be near the top and easy to find. But let's face it, most people who aren't paid to be here already know the evidence for pizzagate. We come here to look for new developments and to see if it is "happening" yet.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can still link to the executive summary in the sticky, but let's include some more relevant information for ACTION that we can all take. We should have phone numbers, mailing addresses, email addresses, twitter handles, and any other means of contacting authorities or people who can make a difference. Poster/flyer templates that we can print and share would be a great idea as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Outlined here is my idea for a postcard/letter writing campaign that the mods have STILL not responded to.

             Now is the time to move beyond research. We've all researched the shit out of this. Sadly, I don't think any amount of information posted to this site will help speed up this process in any way.
            </p>
            <p>
             Phone calls, emails, letters, and flyers might. We've got nothing to lose by trying.

            I like it. What we need is more CALLS TO ACTION. I can personally commit to placing flyers in my little town. I may have to do it in the darkness of night but I think this is a great idea to help build awareness.
           </p>
           <p>
            I support any and all ideas that are action oriented (and peaceful) and involve more than just sitting around being cerebral on this sub and attacking others, all while waiting for some big brother authority figure to fix this problem. It is clearly not happening...
           </p>
           <p>
            TIME FOR ACTION! this is a good one that any of us can do.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anyone comes up with great flyer ideas please post here!

             Keep persevering to voat another day! ;-) I think most of us have a metaphorical dog in this fight, either from abuse, neglect or just protecting our children.  As with all things, things will reach critical mass if energy keeps getting applied to this fight.

             Try and get an account older than 14 days lol. Way too obvious for a shill haha. Also Advice. Don't shill older members of this community. Makes you even more obvious. Attacking strong credibility with no facts automatically makes you look bad.

             Edit: one of my only concerns is that normies coming in here have zero clue with the amount of shilling that actually goes on to cover this sheeit up. They have no idea what we've been dealing with ever since this broke. They just nod their heads and avoid conflict normally so when we do get an influx of people in here from the flyers It will be interesting to see what America is really made of. Patriots or cowards.

               Wouldn't waste any time or money. Printing 100 sheets costs $8.00 at your local library. And some mail men would honestly hand these out for free because they're not all satans spawn like you.

               Lel didn't know saving children was retarted. You sound like someone who knows this would be a good idea and is actively trying to stop it. Didn't know it was bad to get 1.2 more million people investigating this lol. Maybe your just worried you can't keep up the shillin with all the new people? You know I'm right too hahahah

                We should NOT involve mailmen in doing this. Everything we do needs to be according to ALL rules and laws. Giving the mailman some money so he can deliver something that doesn't have paid U.S. postage on it just isn't right, and would be doing a "false flag" for the pedophiles against the investigation. The media would love to report on such a fraud situation, "bribing mailmen to avoid paying postage"! At this point, leftist activists could get away with this, and the media would barely cover it. But a pizzagate investigator doing this would be tarred and feathered in the national media, and it would become yet another part of the corporate media's pizzagate narrative.

                 to counter most mailmen would do this for free. but no its not illegal at all actually. very legal actually. Its not a bribe if they are not selling anything.

                  I'm sorry, but I just don't believe that, and the burden of proof is on you to demonstrate that what you say is true.

                  The mailman are federal employees (though working for the non-gov U.S. Postal Service) getting paid to deliver mail that has paid postage. They are using the USPS resources to do this job. They aren't running their own off-the-books delivery service on the side, which would be what giving them a chunk of cash to deliver flyers would be doing.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What's to stop them, then, from taking a bribe - for that's what it is - from a local restaurant that wants to save on the costs of distributing a flyer by cutting out the "middleman" - USPS? By just handing it to a mailman and paying him, they can cut out the postage costs, and the mailman can make some money "under the table," tax free?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I can't believe there is no USPS regulation against mailman doing just what you are suggesting.

                    And how do you know that? You're talking about paying a federal employee under the table, unreported income, and have no trouble with that, yet you say you know that it's legit to do this.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Again, the burden of proof isn't on me, but on you. Otherwise you shouldn't be advising people to do this, although I'm quite sure just about no one here would take your suggestion.

                     its at your own discretion obviously. but i dont think you'll get sued over $20 and handing out flyers that want to save children lol hahahah. lmao shill. like i said they'll probably do it for free. talk to them and maybe they might start doing it themselves. Anyways its a one time deal anyways. not like were systematically gaming the system day after day lol. people get the message once and thats all they need to see it and then its done. Like i say the problem with pizzagate is not that people dont want to hear the message its just simply censored beyond belief. the message is just difficult to get out because of the insane amount of censorship. if normies knew the kind of censorship going on theyd march on washington.

                      Oh, I see. Someone disagrees with you and they're a "shill," a "shill" for questioning your suggestion of paying a federal worker under the table, something that could open the pizzagate investigation up to bad publicity.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And it's not like that paying a letter carrier is the ONLY way to hand out flyers, either. Far from it. For $50, you could mail 100 of them yourself, legitimately - and you wouldn't be relying on the route of a single carrier, either, so you could get them out to many more areas. Or you could mail part of them and then distribute the rest in any number of ways.

                 LEL i know plenty of mailmen who would do this if you handed them 50 bucks and a stack of flyers. You're very mistaken my friend. Also, its their job to be on their feet for hours your telling them to do something they're already paid to do LMAO. are the shills getting worse or are they giving up now? or after brocks heart attack they have a bunch of newbies working or what haha.
