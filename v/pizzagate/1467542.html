<p>Sorry to be a downer and rehash the past, but those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. 
Anyway, I have no good ideas to share that will help the cause, but needed to share my concerns. 
To end on a positive note, I am encouraged by the number of people waking up and seeing how the MSM is deliberately misleading.  Strength in numbers is a positive.  Thank you all for the long research and fighting the hard fight for the young and innocent.  Good night.</p>',

             Great article thanks!  It also states that the NYPD and FBI both have copies of the evidence.  chances of pressuring to have it released publicly?  It's already considered illegally obtained so it will never be used in court anyway.

            I think it is fairly close to confirmed actually. In fact, that's pretty much the most solid thing about this whole case. I think Comet Ping Pong is shady, but the code in the emails is the thing that is impossible to explain away, which is why none of the "debunking" articles have even touched it. Plus there are some fairly reliable sources explaining the handkerchief code and the "chicken" meaning.

             I mean confirmed by the authorities and or real pedos.  The hanky code has black confirmed but white is not. Also not confirmed:  pizza, pasta, hot dog, walnut etc...  We can tell it is code but the Pedo code came from 4chan who say it's from dark web with no proof that I've seen.
