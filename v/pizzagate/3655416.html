<p>I took a unique angle in going through this, looking at it from the lens of swamp creatures back in 2017/2016 that may have been rattled by the Pizzagate activity. Remember, this was back when the Podesta dig was heating up and when they had to shutter their lobby firm nearly overnight. </p>
<hr />
<p>So, first up, <strong>Arun Rao</strong>. <strong>PAGE 121 of 384</strong> ... Sound familiar? This guy was &quot;liking&quot; images that James Alefantis posted on a regular basis. Requesting a meeting w/ RR, in which it was granted. </p>
<p>More intel on Rao - check this link and search for his name/scroll down about 20%: <a href="https://steemit.com/personsofinterest/@ausbitbank/persons-of-interest-james-achilles-alefantis-aka-jimmycomet-at-comet-ping-pong">https://steemit.com/personsofinterest/@ausbitbank/persons-of-interest-james-achilles-alefantis-aka-jimmycomet-at-comet-ping-pong</a></p>

<p><em>(Possible connection to Ahna Rao - significant due to heading up the recent Shadow App used in the Iowa Caucus... also developed &quot;Paddle8.com&quot; - a ping pong theme art auction site... hmmm... and then was the Product Manager for Hillary for America) - but at this time I can\'t find any evidence outside of some Chan Chatter that Arun/Ahna are related in anyway</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Next, <strong>Mark Filip</strong>, <strong>Page 112 of 384</strong> who was involved - at least at some capacity, in what materialized as the Epstein/Acosta &quot;sweetheart&quot; deal, with Epstein\'s lawyers (including Dershowitz) getting a chance to plead his case in an attempt to squash the prosecution: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/the-pressure-on-a-prosecutor-how-epsteins-wealth-and-power-steered-acosta-toward-lenient-deal/2019/07/12/2a7bdd08-a421-11e9-bd56-eac6bb02d01d_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/the-pressure-on-a-prosecutor-how-epsteins-wealth-and-power-steered-acosta-toward-lenient-deal/2019/07/12/2a7bdd08-a421-11e9-bd56-eac6bb02d01d_story.html</a></p>
<p>Related Tweet/Thread on Filip\'s approval of this deal: <a href="https://twitter.com/techno_fog/status/1098688506866610176?lang=en">https://twitter.com/techno_fog/status/1098688506866610176?lang=en</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Finally, <strong>Phil Heymann</strong>... <strong>Page 298 of 384</strong> being &quot;anxious to talk&quot; to RR, tried reaching out to him 2 or 3 times in short order. Not only did Heymann weigh in on the confirmation hearing of Mark Filip (above) from a legal POV, but he is also acknowledged in a book by Alan Dershowitz - in the same sentence as &quot;Jeffrey Epstein&quot; as a listed friend &amp; colleague: <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u8w8Yg-5ecsC&amp;pg=PP17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">https://books.google.com/books?id=u8w8Yg-5ecsC&amp;pg=PP17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false</a></p>
<p>Heymann was a former Watergate prosecutor, friends w/ Bill Clinton + Eric Holder... and Heymann\'s son, Stephen Heymann - was actually the lead prosecutor in the case against Aaron Swartz: <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2014/01/02/bob-swartz-losing-aaron/4/">https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2014/01/02/bob-swartz-losing-aaron/4/</a> ... hmmm... Swartz, the co-founder of Reddit, with a questionable storyline and a horrible ending with a surprise suicide by hanging? </p>
<p>And following the Heymann/Swartz/MIT thread, leads me to the recent news of the Epstein/Gates donations that made there way to MIT... specifically their Media Labs Dept. Which lead to this story: <a href="http://techrights.org/2020/01/10/gates-sponsored-mit/">http://techrights.org/2020/01/10/gates-sponsored-mit/</a></p>
<hr />
<p>There are undoubtedly more connections in these Rosenstein emails. But Arun Rao, Filip, Heymann??? All connecting dots pointing back to persons of interest in the Pizzagate research? Something stinks here.</p>',

           Finally,
           <strong>
            Phil Heymann
           </strong>
           ...
           <strong>
            Page 298 of 384
           </strong>
           being "anxious to talk" to RR, tried reaching out to him 2 or 3 times in short order. Not only did Heymann weigh in on the confirmation hearing of Mark Filip (above) from a legal POV, but he is also acknowledged in a book by Alan Dershowitz - in the same sentence as "Jeffrey Epstein" as a listed friend &amp; colleague:
           <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u8w8Yg-5ecsC&amp;pg=PP17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Heymann was a former Watergate prosecutor, friends w/ Bill Clinton + Eric Holder... and Heymann's son, Stephen Heymann - was actually the lead prosecutor in the case against Aaron Swartz:
           <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2014/01/02/bob-swartz-losing-aaron/4/">
            https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2014/01/02/bob-swartz-losing-aaron/4/
           </a>
           ... hmmm... Swartz, the co-founder of Reddit, with a questionable storyline and a horrible ending with a surprise suicide by hanging?
          </p>
          <p>
           And following the Heymann/Swartz/MIT thread, leads me to the recent news of the Epstein/Gates donations that made there way to MIT... specifically their Media Labs Dept. Which lead to this story:
           <a href="http://techrights.org/2020/01/10/gates-sponsored-mit/">

            I've been looking into Joichi Ito some , he recieved money directly from Epstein, besides being Tim Learys godson he owns a company called Veritrans (go figure).
           </p>
           <p>
            The company sets up payment portals for companies &amp; maybe facilities services for pimps like Epstein ???

            Isn't Paddle8 connected to Meghan Markle and she is connected to the Bronfmans, Trudeau etc? Makes me wonder if Meghan wanted to get out of the British tabloid royal spotlight to avoid her own skeletons being exposed. Harry too. He was always the party prince and I'm sure many people were more than willing to provide him with anything he desired.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember just after the news broke about Prince Andrew and in the lead up to his disastrous interview on the BBC, Harry and Meghan literally fled the UK to Canada and stayed on Vancouver Island "off the radar" for SIX WEEKS. Well it was most of November, all of December and several days into January, so sounds like longer than six weeks. When they returned to the UK they announced they were quitting as royals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prince Andrew lost his role as a senior royal due to the Epstein scandal. Is it possible the Queen gave her grandson and his wife the option to walk away rather than face the same humiliation?

             If we can connect Paddle8 to Markle &gt; Rao &gt; Bronfmans &gt; Trudeau &gt; Royal Family... that would be significant. Especially if the Rao's in question are actually* related, that connects Epstein to Alefantis indirectly.

             Interesting theory about Markle and Harry, rickman. Another possibility -- perhaps more likely -- is that M&amp;H were tasked with creating drama to clog the news cycle and take the heat off of Andrew.

              When Markle had her baby shower in NY city, Gayle King went ...and the black tennis player. No other famous people were there. Which is odd to me.
