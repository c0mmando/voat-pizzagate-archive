<p>This is NOT the best story, that\'s the problem with this \'investigation\', if you wanted to get Podesta in Jail, you would research his involvement in the recent Turkish Failed Coup. Clinton Foundation got a lot of money with the promise of engineering a coup in Turkey and Podesta was the major player. This McCann story is just bullshit, so that ppl feel sorry for the Podesta\'s and what they went through. Think about Plan A,B,C; Had Hillary won PODESTA would now be a KING.</p>

<p>People have hard on to destroy Podesta, read his emails and do what fbiANON told you focus on the Clinton Foundation, I\'m sure that HILLARY was selling children to the SAUDI\'s to fuck. It\'s there, but nobody is looking, everybody is fixated on  jimmy-comet or Portugal non-kidnapping</p>
<p>Hillary got huge money from all the country\'s that have massive child-prostitution. During Hillary at least 500,000 children from ten country\'s disapeared, where are they dead? Many are in Macau, Israel, Nevada working as prostitutes. Who owns these whores houses all over the world? Sheldon Adelson</p>
<p>Turkey has huge whore houses that specialize in foreign boys&amp;girls, where do they get these white kids? Macau or HongKong you can have any flavor you like white,yellow, brown, or black. Where do they come from?</p>
<p>Google wikipedia study the enormity of the world child prostitution business. Keep asking how did 50,000 children in the past year just disapear being transported from Syria to Europe.

            What about the possibility that the Podestas were framed? All of the McCann evidence against the Podestas is from the spooks, and John Podesta is an exception because of the ET angle.
           </p>
           <p>
            jimmycomet's  instagrams are still circumstantial evidence that Alefantis is part of the group, even if there are no new leads.

            <p>
             Here's the DEAL Podesta engineered the COUP in Turkey, Pizzagate is #1 trend in turkey, they're pushing this to the max to get back with Podesta for the COUP.
            </p>
            <p>
             McCann is BULLSHIT, its a known fact that the parents sold the daughter to Freud is now dead, just like Saville. The girl now could be dead or anywhere, but it can never be proven that Podesta or Wiener was involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             US Congress today passed a law banning Russian influence on net, Turkey is not expert at this shit making a meme go viral, but Russia is, perhaps Russia did all this a favor so in order to destroy Podesta/Brock; Going after Alefantis a lover of Brock is pure psychological mind-fuck.
