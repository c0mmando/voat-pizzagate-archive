            Thanks for the mention! Personally, I don't think this job ad is a problem. In order to get a work visa for China you need a criminal clearance and a police clearance from all the countries that you have worked in.
           </p>
           <p>
            China is actually now one of the hardest countries in SEA to get a
            <strong>
             legal
            </strong>
            job teaching English. The government have done their best to try to clean up the industry but the problems remain in the provinces where it is difficult to attract teachers and school owners are known to fabricate documents for less desirable applicants.

             It must be those other provinces you mention that Disney is referring to in this job post when saying teaching experience is not required for "certain cities in China."
            </p>

             It is interesting that teachers who have worked for "Disney English," as the company is called, say that Disney apparently skirts some legal requirements in China by not identifying their centers as schools.  Here is an excerpt from a post on expatforum.com by one of them, notwhatitlookslike, who was talking about working for the company:
            </p>
            <p>
             "You will be reminded on numerous occasions not to write ‘teacher’ as the job profession on the visa application. Instead you are asked to write ‘trainer’. The reason given is that Disney English School is not actually a school; it is a training center."

              Maybe, but personally I think pedophile teachers head to countries where there are zero background checks and very poor people, like Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar.

              There are so many children that these pedos are after in Asia.  That's why Kidman and Savile made many trips there.  It is still going on today.  Walt Disney was a member of this society

              and so is Bill Clinton and Mel Blanc was too.  Many others.  There is a Chapter in Racine as well
