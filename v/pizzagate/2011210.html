<p>This thread is going to show that people who claim to be Roman Catholic are the ones pulling the strings and hiding behind the Jews and good Catholic people</p>
<p><em>This relates to pizzagate through the Rothschilds and their connections to all the pizzagate players. These are likely the people controlling the pedophile manipulation</em></p>
<p>The Rothschilds run Chatham House (Royal Institute of International Affairs), but a man named Lionel Curtis is responsible for putting it all together. Chatham House and CFR are essentially the same thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Royal Institute of International Affairs finds its origins in a meeting, convened by Lionel Curtis, of the American and British delegates to the Paris Peace Conference on 30 May 1919. Curtis had long been an advocate for the scientific study of international affairs and, following the beneficial exchange of information after the peace conference, argued that the method of expert analysis and debate should be continued when the delegates returned home in the form of international institute.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the British and American delegates formed separate institutes, with the Americans developing the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.</p>
<p>The British Institute of International Affairs, as it was then known, held its inaugural meeting, chaired by Lord Robert Cecil, on 5 July 1920. In this, former Foreign Secretary Viscount Edward Grey moved the resolution calling the institute into existence.</p>

<p>Here&apos;s a little about Lionel Curtis and who he trained with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Curtis was born at Coddington, Herefordshire in 1872, the youngest of the four children of an Anglican rector. He was educated at Haileybury College and then at New College, Oxford, where he read law.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_George_Curtis">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_George_Curtis</a></p>
<p>Both Winchester College and New College were originally established for the education of priests, there being a shortage of properly educated clergy after the Black Death.</p>

<p>As a result of discussions at the Peace Conference, a small group of British and American diplomats and scholars met on May 30, 1919 at the Hotel Majestic in Paris and decided to create an <strong>Anglo-American</strong> organization called &quot;The Institute of International Affairs&quot;, which would have offices in London and New York. Due to the isolationist views prevalent in American society at the time, the scholars had difficulty gaining traction with their plan, and turned their focus instead to a set of discreet meetings that had been taking place since June 1918 in New York City, under the name Council on Foreign Relations. </p>

<p>Up until recently the Bilderberg group was one of the most secret societies. So much so that David Rockefeller felt the need to thank the media for keeping their secret..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years.&quot;</p>
<p>It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries.</p>

<p>In the late 90&apos;s a man named Lord Peter Carrington was the chairman for Bilderberg, here&apos;s a little history on him..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Carrington served as Secretary General of NATO from 1984 to 1988. He was also appointed Chancellor of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 August 1984,[20] serving until June 1994.[21]</p>
<p>Apart from his political posts, he was the Chancellor of the University of Reading and has served as chairman of several companies, including Christie&apos;s, and as a director of many others, including Barclays Bank, Schweppes and the Daily Telegraph. <strong>He also chaired the Bilderberg conferences for several years in the late 1990s, being succeeded in 1999 by Étienne Davignon.</strong>From 1983 to 2002, he was president of the Pilgrims Society. He was appointed Chancellor of the <strong>Order of the Garter</strong> on 8 November 1994, a role from which he retired in October 2012.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by Étienne Davignon another &quot;Roman Catholic&quot; man, here&apos;s some info on him...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After receiving a Doctorate of Law from the Catholic University of Leuven, Davignon joined the Belgian Foreign Ministry, in 1959, and within two years had become an attaché under Paul-Henri Spaak, then Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>As chairman of Société Générale de Belgique, he was a member of the European Round Table of Industrialists. He is the current co-chairman of the EU-Japan Business Dialogue Round Table, chairman of the Paul-Henri Spaak Foundation, president of the EGMONT – Royal Institute for International Relations, chairman of CSR Europe, chairman of the European Academy of Business in Society and was chairman of the annual Bilderberg conference from 1998 to 2001.

<p>The one on His right isn’t visible but the two on his left side are Order of the Red Eagle badges. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Order of the Red Eagle (German: Roter Adlerorden) was an order of chivalry of the Kingdom of Prussia. It was awarded to both military personnel and civilians, to recognize valor in combat, excellence in military leadership, long and faithful service to the kingdom, or other achievements. As with most German (and most other European) orders, the Order of the Red Eagle could only be awarded to commissioned officers or civilians of approximately equivalent status. However, there was a medal of the order, which could be awarded to non-commissioned officers and enlisted men, lower ranking civil servants and other civilians.</p>
<p><strong>Classes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grand Cross - enameled <strong>Maltese cross badge</strong> worn on a collar (the Kette, or &quot;chain&quot;) at ceremonial occasions or, at other formal occasions, on a sash on the right shoulder; plus a gilt, eight-pointed breast star worn on the left chest; typically awarded to male members of the royal family, to members of the Order of the Black Eagle, to noblemen, and to foreign royalty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1st Class - oversized, enameled cross pattée badge worn on a sash on the right shoulder, plus a silver, eight-pointed breast star on the left chest; available to general officers, high nobility, and heads of foreign state</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2nd Class - enameled cross pattée badge worn on a neck ribbon, plus a silver, four-pointed breast star on the left chest; available to general officers and nobility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3rd Class - enameled cross pattée badge worn on a ribbon on the left chest; available to (usually no lower than) field grade officers and minor nobility</p>

<p>Due to time constraints IRL and Character limits I’m going to cut this off here, but I think this sheds some more light on who the Rothschild’s really are and who their loyalties are with. Let me know what you think.</p>',

           Due to time constraints IRL and Character limits I’m going to cut this off here, but I think this sheds some more light on who the Rothschild’s really are and who their loyalties are with. Let me know what you think.

            I've been doing this for a fucking long time. 12,600 years ago a meteor struck the Earth and killed 90-some percent of people on it, advanced peoples. The Brotherhood/Priesthood of Amun Ra is the "Jew behind the curtain". They are the original lineage coming out of that extinction event. It's basically a religious occult. These people believe in magic, literal mind control, Old Testament Gods, etc. You name it. They own the world. The Catholic Order was founded to "clean up" the knowledge of mankind's complete history as an advanced civilization (which goes back anywhere from 50,000 to 10 million years old).

            the rothschild fortune is estimated in mainstream sources at 2 trillion dolllars or 5x the combined wealth of the 'world's top 8 billionaires" and they are tools of jesuits?

            the vatican's wealth is estimated in the billions yet the rothschilds are their puppets? 
ok several chairmen of the bilderberg group have been gone to catholic schools, what about the makeup of the 30 to 40 'sterling members' of the bilderbergs?
            <br/>
            these jesuits and catholics are influencing world events and politics to do what swell and protect the coffers of the catholic church? protect and grow the individual fortunes of the chairmen you mention? idk...

             It's actually Mayer Bauer.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bauer changed the name to "Rothschild" (meaning "red shield") for a reason not generally known. Yes, he had hung a red-shield sign/symbol above the door of his shop while still a poor/common family man, but what did it mean? Apparently, the protection and/or advancement of something red...and I don't think it had anything to do with red potatoes. Probably a red people. It just so happens that he was an Ashkenazi Jew, and that Ashkenaz was a region in Magog where the so-called "red Jews" of Khazaria had ruled an empire on the north shores of the Black and Caspian seas. Several voices are now proclaiming that the Rothschilds, and most other Ashkenazi Jews, are descended from the Khazars.
            </p>
            <p>
             While the Jews of Khazaria had been the small minority among both Christian and Muslim citizens, they ruled the empire absolutely; it had been the law of the land that only Jews could rule! There were two kings, an invisible one called a "khagan," and a visible one called a "beg." Interesting, isn't it, that the invisible Rothschilds are now a few Jews ruling the world.

              Yes. In 2013 DNA studies proved the Rothschilds and the remaining illuminati families were not Jewish at all. They were from the Khazarian region and had interbred trying to keep their bloodline intact?

           <p>
            One of the greatest examples of that is found in the person of Larry Silverstein. He owned the smallest stake of the World Trade Center complex yet he's the owner on record.

            And in the case of Larry Silverstein they're the bag men.

            The Rockefeller's had been trying to build the World Trade Center for years before construction started. When the opportunity came David Rockefeller jumped at the chance. Now the really bizarre part is David Rockefeller

             <strong>
              The Jewish Encyclopedia (Vol. 2, p. 497) admits that…

            </p>
            <p>
             “A number of Catholics undertook to organize a competitor bank to rival the

              Rothschild
             </strong>
             power… sometime about 1820. The Rothschild’s crushed it.”
            </p>
            <p>
             It says further:
            </p>
            <p>
             “It is a somewhat curious sequel to the attempt to set up a Catholic competitor to the Rothschilds that at the present time (1905) the latter are the guardians of the papal treasure.” (#)
            </p>
            <p>
             So the Jewish Rothschild banking dynasty controls the Vatican treasure.

             They Cannot Explain Away

            </p>
            <p>
             If the Jesuits are so bad and evil than how do you explain Bishop Richard Williamson? Catholic Bishop (Jesuit) Richard Williamson is a great man who has valiantly publicly stated that 9/11 was a fraud, a lie, and that the holocaust was also a lie. Many of these Black Popers will shy away from any reference of Bishop Williamson and nary a mention of one of his excellent sermons exposing 9/11 among other crimes. I have even heard some pathetic cretins say he is “controlled opposition” like stoppering little maggots. These cowards won’t hesitate to defame a person who has more courage in his fingernail than they have in their entire bodies. Bishop Williamson puts his very livelihood and safety on the line when he speaks out about these subjects. Soulless cockroaches who attack him because he puts to shame this “Jesuit Conspiracy” claim are a complete waste of oxygen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Conclusion...
            </p>
            <p>
             Do Jesuits control the Media, own Hollywood, the Federal Reserve, and constantly inhabit high positions in government? Nope. Have Jesuits been expelled from 109 locations since 250 AD? Nope. Did Jesuits run the African Slave trade, instigate WWI &amp; WWII, invent Communism &amp; Neo-Conservatism, perpetrate the 9/11 attacks, attack the U.S.S. Liberty, assassinate JFK, run the Diamond District, Porn Industry, run the Drug Trade? Nope. Are you called “anti-Catholic” for blaming Jesuits for everything under the sun that they don’t even do? Nope, but we’re called anti-Semitic for blaming the people which ALL of the evidence shows are the ones responsible.

             <p>
              Catholics are not Jesuits and Jesuits are not Catholics. That equivalency has only occurred over hundreds of years.
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQJ2IfIDLts">
               Ignatius of Loyola
              </a>
              was for lack of a better term a Catholic Mystic. Given his military background he bullied his way into the Catholic church who at the time was run by peaceful Benedictines.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was the Protestant Reformation that drove the Jesuits into power via the Counter Reformation. The Jesuits finally took over the whole show in the 1960s in reaction to the Communist threat to Western Europe. The Jesuit run Catholic Church is an entirely new church based much more on Mysticism and Free Masonry. The Catholic Church today had no trouble merging with the Mafia and the CIA. There is a very good reason every head of the CIA has been a Jesuit trained Catholic. John Brennan would be the ultimate example of a Power Jesuit. Brennan is no Muslim, Jesuit's have faked membership in countless of the world's religions over the years. And John Brennan the Muslim has disemboweled Islam. Is the Islam of today the threat it appeared on 9/11? Of course not. The Jesuits and "The Jews(tm)" recognized a common enemy and the rest is History.
             </p>
             <p>
              And it is very telling that today's CIA director,
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pompeo">
               Mike Pompeo
              </a>
              , is the first director who was NOT Jesuit trained. The reason is the Jesuit run Catholic church just like the W.A.S.P. Mafia Skull &amp; Bonesmen who run the Deep State are on their last legs for obvious reasons. We all know their crimes now. They just busted a massive gay orgy in the Vatican for Christ's sake.

               LOL thats the easiest answer ever, besides when your mom asked to blow me (NO), it is revealed in the way Jew media tries to instill shame and guilt in whites so that any sense of group solidarity/cooperation cedes to whites' inherent empathy and altruism.

                 WASPs would otherwise be more dangerous BUT for their lack of appetite control; Jews are universally regarded as the most dangerous because they exploit the weaknesses of the host society until making debt slaves of them.  For example a Jewish barkeep will inflate the bill of a drunk who passed out and cant remember.  This breeds resentment until theyre expelled.

                    So Germany can fool people into thinking they're still not trying to take over Europe.

                   <p>
                    Hitler's plan was always to take over Europe first and then the world. That applies to killing Jews as well. He planned on killing every Jew in Europe first and then going international once the Soviets were killed off.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You're implying my argument is that Hitler sent out death squads internationally to hunt down and kill Jews. That's absurd and not my point at all.

                     Hitler's plan was always to take over Europe first and then the world. That applies to killing Jews as well. He planned on killing every Jew in Europe first and then going international once the Soviets were killed off.

                     You have less historical sophistication than my little sister, who does not exist.  As if YOU KNOW "Hitlers plans", faggot! 
Wasnt it the SOVIETS who went on to take big parts of the world? LEBENSRAUM FAGGIT

                    <p>
                     You're implying my argument is that Hitler sent out death squads internationally to hunt down and kill Jews. That's absurd and not my point at all.

                     LMAO DONT YOU REALIZE ITS EVEN MORE PREPOSTEROUS TO SUGGEST HE WANTED TO RULE THE WORLD WHEN HE DIDNT EVEN WANT TO BOMB LONDON.

                      My point exactly. He should have stuck with bombing airfields and radar installations. Hitler had an uncanny ability to always snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

                        Again you've been fooled with partial facts. World War I was Germany's Debutante Ball. It was their official "coming out party". It was Kaiser Wilhelm putting his cousins on notice their exclusive colonial rights were no longer valid.

                        It's not worth responding any more than that. Your knowledge of European History seems to be limited to the 20th Century. The secret's in the other 19 centuries. I'll leave it at that.

                        If I had to guess you've got a relative who's a Muslim or a close friend or maybe you are a Muslim. You've got all the talking points on Judaism covered. Hitler is a hero to Muslims. After all Muhammad famously killed 900 Jews in one day. Islam even says all the Jews on planet Earth need to be killed before Salvation.

                         Bingo, bitch! The only countries without Jewish dominated media and historiography like Hitler for standing up to Jewish abuse and supremacism.  Might as well be a confession signed in Hebrew, also you admitted the Holocaust is BUNK and that's literally the cornerstone of our education.  LITERALLY. IT IS A PHYSICAL STONE

                          I'm glad we cleared that up. I personally have no trouble with Islam. In fact it pisses me off that Bush, Rockefeller and THE MOSSAD pulled off 9/11 not any Muslim terrorist. Did you catch that? I AGREE WITH YOU: ISRAEL HELPED CARRY OUT 9/11. Would a "Jew shill" tell you that? My only point is they weren't running the show for like the 100th time.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          What I don't understand is how you can limit your anger to just the Jews. Bush and Cheney have murdered MILLIONS of Muslims but I never hear a peep out of you about them. It's only Jews, Jews, Jews and more Jews.

                           You're wrong about the Muslim thing first of all, and you fool NO ONE as you make blatantly clear that your m.o. is to CONFINE THE JEW PRESENCE as much as possible, even postulating a FICTIONAL WHITE HAT MOSSAD FORCE WITHIN MOSSAD ITSELF WHEN WEBB GOT EXPOSED LOL
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Jews as a political force would be despicable even WITHOUT Pizzagate, so your job is to run cover as much as possible and make it appear there can be a few Jewish fall guys and the rest are fine.  NOPE there will certainly never be another Jew on the supreme Court for example, they've done quite enough damage.

             Yet the Jesuit priests are the ones getting caught fucking kids all the time. Fuck off shill boy, you have nothing but a bunch of bullshit propaganda. That's why you don't source shit. Isn't that right Don Quixote - the crazy Jesuit crusader.

              Dude your "research" literally consists of pasting from geoegetowns alumni list.  Mine uncovers hundreds of obvious fronts and gives me new connections to the clintons in every industry.

                     Pegasus is Greek mysticism. Medusa was not Jewish. Taking pictures of someone elses opinion is not presenting facts.

                       So your point is "Jewish mysticism" isn't really Jewish at all. It comes from Greek mysticism. Got it. You've lost every argument you've presented, everyone can see that you're a Jesuit shill, Don Quixote the crazy crusader.

            Yeah maybe the Vatican used the Jew to do their banking interest at one time....but the Jews in Portugal and Spain were forced to change to Catholic or move by force....the ones who converted under force faked it.  They moved into the Church and began the Jesuit Order....the Jews hijacked the whole damn thing.....so I think you misunderstand who runs things now.  The Pope is now a Jesuit....which is nothing but a Crypto Jewish Order.  But really this is not a Jewish thing.  It is a Sabbetean Frankist Luciferian thing.....they hide amongst the Jews....keep the Jew clannish and scared of others because the Pogroms the Sabbeteans do under the name of the Jew and raise the hatred of the normies.....

             I'm afraid it's you who has been brainwashed with propaganda, or you're just a shill like DonkeyHote. The Jews were bought into positions of power within Banking back in 1066 by the Norman Anglo-Saxon Monarchs. All you "Jew rule everything" shills always claim that the Jews created banking and for this reason they were expelled from countries for financial manipulation. The truth of the matter is the Knights Templar created credit and banking during the crusades. Here's a good article about it, learn you something..
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Knights Templar were warrior monks. A religious order, with a theologically inspired hierarchy, mission statement, and code of ethics, but also heavily armed and dedicated to holy war.
             </p>
             <p>
              How did they get into the banking game?

                       so far Revelation is on track, I am aware that some of the Gnostic gospels are suppressed. I am aware the story of the Father and the Sun have been borrowed. and I am aware of the lineage of Cain. and I am aware of the "Great Plan", the rebuilding of Babylon Tower (EU Parliament). The one thing that the Brotherhood of the Snake did not anticipate, was the internet. New World Order is a failure.
