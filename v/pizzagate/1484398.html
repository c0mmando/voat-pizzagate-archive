            Inbefore you make another thread about how you got downvoted by bots for exposing a shill. I'm not a bot and I downvote you because
this guy does nothing but rquesting critical thinking, which indeed is welcome. 
He states that he doesn't believe in pizzagate. He doesn't hide it, he doesn't spread misinformation, but he asks people to think critically... SHILL! no not really.
           </p>
           <p>
            Would all pizzagaters only provide facts without overdrawing everything, this guy maybe wouldn't even stand on the opposing side.
           </p>
           <p>
            With posts like this and the call to forget all criticall thinking you let us all look like stupids and the result is more people becoming sceptic.

              Because everyone who links to MSM is a shill right!?
             </p>
             <p>
              Newsflash, there are people who believe the MSM and when they come here and see people like you who obviously don't like critical thinking and overdraw everything and call things proof which clearly are no proof of anything, they might start to belive pizzagate is completly based on people being like this.
             </p>
             <p>
              And I guess that is kinda whats up with this guy. I blame people like you.
             </p>
             <p>
              We see his comments and nothing there proves that he is a shill instead of just a misinformed person, but you are convinced he is a shill. And that is the problem. People being convinced of stuff they don't have any proof for, making all of us looking as if we don't need proof in order to believe anything...
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe I'm wrong and he is a shill, but that wouldn't change, that bad judgement from our side plays into their hands...

               Wow, thanks for this. Yes, not a pizzagate believer but I'm very interested in it.  I just hope to provide another perspective here.
Also, my witch hunt comment probably could've been more specific initially since I could see that as being possibly antagonistic.

                Well, you're welcome, but since you are here now I would like you to take your critical thinking and use it to really look into some evidence.
               </p>
               <p>
                For example I saw you were pointing to J.A.'s explanation for the bondaged girl image.
Well, nice explanation at first, but being the sceptic I am I immedietly had to wonder...
               </p>
               <p>
                When I see two children playing/ doing this and think hey that's funny I want to take a photo of this, I would take a photo of exactly this, two children playing, but that is not what we see. This picture doesn't present us playing children, it presents us a bondaged girl with a man standing behind her.
               </p>
               <p>
                Why would I wait till that one child is done bondaging the other one, then tell it to go away so I can take a picture only of the bondaged girl with a man behind her and then not even giving an explanation how this happened when I post this?
               </p>
               <p>
                Makes no sense...
               </p>
               <p>
                All those photos of children in his social media accounts make no sense. How do you explain "hotard"?
               </p>
               <p>
                A gay man taking a picture of a baby of other parrents and than ads "hoe retard" and no mother in sight asking why he calls her baby like this.
               </p>
               <p>
                Why do we see so many different children on his accounts, but never do we see a mother or a second child.
Why do we find dozens of seemingly perverted people liking those pictures, but not one of them is a father or mother of one of this children?
               </p>
               <p>
                Chickenlover... How the fuck is there ANY explanation, why a gay man ads this hastag to a picture of another gay man holding a little boy of other parrents, other than what we claim it does?
               </p>
               <p>
                Chickenlover is well known codeword for gays who like little boys. Sure it could also be about loving actual chickens, but why posting this on a picture with no chicken and no food at all, but with a man and a little boy?
               </p>
               <p>
                I am always sceptic, but this leaves no space for none sick explanations.
               </p>
               <p>
                Not that this is the best evidence we have, but it's the first thing, that should leave every honest investigator with some justified questions, to say the least. 
Look at all his photos, the comments, hashtags, explanations for those and the people who liked those pictures and tell me this ALONE is not much disturbing.
               </p>
               <p>
                Thousands of people saw this and were just this, disturbed. They kept digging and found more and more and more evidence till the point of no doubt left.... No proof, yeah, but ockham's razor, you know!?
               </p>
               <p>
                It is true and I guess you just didn't look into it well enough and had an idea what is going on before you even really looked into it. Happens, but now look at it again.

                 Before the explanation by Alefantis of the picture of the taped girl existed there were a lot of scenarios that you could imagine for why this picture existed.  Occams razor asks what is the most mundane explanation for something? What explanation would be the most common explanation for a scenario like this, what's at the top of the bell curve?  I would say, and the explanation I've seen most people come to, is that it's a joke picture.  The girl is having fun and there was some inside joke going on when the picture was taken, possibly the 'new seating procedure' person was there and knew that's what the joke was.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And then the video came out of Alefantis explaining it and it wasn't exactly what people were thinking but it was
                 <em>
                  pretty
                 </em>
                 close in that it was a playful situation and a very mundane not at all sensational explanation.  But the explanation I and other people initially thought could have been true and so could a whole
                 <strong>
                  spectrum
                 </strong>
                 of possibilities have been proposed before we got to the very smallest part of the bell curve: pedophilia.

                 I would argue that this is not how occam's razor works, you're meant to be asking what is the most mundane explanation. So if we're asking does his explanation make sense, is your scenario the most plausible one you can come up with? You seem to have come up with a situation that is purposefully bizarre. You assume he is standing there waiting to take the picture, why do that?  Why would he have to tell the other girl to go away? the picture is taken pretty close to the girl I'm pretty sure she doesn't have to be standing anymore than a foot away from the girl in the picture and still be out of frame.  If he
                 <em>
                  isn't
                 </em>
                 a pedophile he wouldn't look at that picture in a sexual way and so wouldn't think he
                 <em>
                  needed
                 </em>
                 to give an explanation, it just wouldn't have occurred to him to see the picture in that way.

                <p>
                 Again there is a whole spectrum of possibilities that could explain this, pedophilia is there but if you're being honest is it a large possibility or small?  I think maybe the guy is calling alefantis this, like maybe that's what they call each other as a joke between friends.  Maybe that's some other bizarre inside joke and doesn't actually mean ho retard.  Maybe that guy is close with the childs parents and that's just the way they joke, that would be unusual but I've heard families call each other things like that in an affectionate way. Or maybe that guy is an asshole and he doesn't know where to draw the line.  I could go on and on but with no further detail what do you honestly think is the most likely explanation?

                 I would say that the general method you all claim to be using is right, which is that enough circumstantial evidence produces a solid suspicion. If he had many pictures that taken by themselves could have a plausible explanation but that taken altogether were difficult to explain
                 <em>
                  without
                 </em>
                 pedophilia then you would have suspicion, but still not proof.  But after having scoured his instagram and life generally the only things that might suggest alefantis has a sexual attraction to children, much less acted on them, are like 4 or 5 pictures. Not convincing enough for the very serious accusation of pedophilia.

                  I didn't bring up occams razor in the context of those pictures like you are implying.
Iirc I said people digged and found more and more evidence AFTER entering the rabbithole through those pics or e-mails, so that the most liekly explanation left to explain all this is indeed a childtrafficking conspiracy.
So no, one picture of a taped child doesn't convince me occam like of childtrafficking and I didn't say that.

                  Well, every mother and every father and actually every normal person would like to have some clarifying context to a picture of a bondaged child I would assume... (those were public posts)
I am no pedophile, so when I post a picture of a bondaged child I would always make clear what this is about because I'm also no retard and know, that people could get that wrong, no?

                  I guess doing this took the "other child" quite some time and I also assume, that this girl wasn't bondaged like this for a very long time, so I think it's safe to assume, that like 95% of the time this girl stood there, there was the "other child" at this position as well, but James took the picture when there was no other child...
I didn't reallly think he sent the other child away, but am asking, why is there no other child in this pic. Why does he wait all the time till the other child is done with it's work before he takes the photo?

How can you just dismiss that? There is a gay man with child of other people in his arms and another gay person comes makes a photo
and adds #gaymenwholikelittleboys to the photo when he uploaded it.

                  And there is soooooo much more. Those pics or the podesta E-mails are only what every critical thinking persons needs to feel the need to do some more research.

                 <p>
                  When I looked at the e-mails first, I was sceptic, when I saw James' social media.. I was a little disturbed, interested in finding out more but still sceptic, but after looking at all the evidence for weeks I lost all doubt, like everyone who just looks at it would, because guess what, it is true!

                  There was a lot bullshit/ fakenews and whatnot between all of this, but everything I base my opinion on is unquestionable. There is damning evidence alone on this bord here, you only have to look at it.

                   "Bondaged child". People don't think in these terms if it's actually two kids playing, it's just a girl whose sister has taped her hands to the table.  If you were in that situation and said that the girl was bondaged to the table people would look at you like 'what the fuck is wrong with that guy?' because it sounds sexual.  You're intentionally looking at it with that lens instead of clearing your mind of any bias. 
The fact that he posted the picture at all is evidence against the pedophilia claim because this is not how people behave, they don't post their crimes online publicly.

                   You are assuming things again, there's nothing to say that alefantis was there with the children the whole time.  Maybe their parents called him over to see what their children had done. Maybe he showed up right at the end.  Maybe he WAS there the entire time then decided to take the picture when she was done, no pedophilia necessary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The hotard thing: alefantis doesn't say it first, another person does then he says it possibly referring back at them since the first mention of hotard the guy is already talking about alefantis and not the baby.  Who knows though, I listed many possibilities.

                   The chickenlovers thing: Is it true that the man in the picture is gay? I hadn't heard that. Also is it true that that's not his child? If they aren't pedophiles they wouldn't know the phrase like most people don't.  The phrase is so innocuous and such a simple one to put together without talking about pedophilia. Just type in chicken lover into google and you will see, here are some results from the first two pages:

                   I've been looking at the stuff for a while and haven't seen any evidence that alefantis or anyone is a pedophile or any sexual misconduct generally.  Someone should update the sidebar with that stuff if there is, the main infographic is mainly stuff like we've been talking about.

                   You say this but when you first messaged me these are the things you chose to talk about.  My point has been as you can see from my comments is that be wary of conspiracy theories, a hallmark is that they grow wider not deeper.  You exemplify this in your response talking about how MUCH evidence there is, it will never be about any specific evidence it will always be about the MOUNTAIN of 'evidence'.

                 I'm sorry you probably won't get a reply from him from my knowledge they usually just ignore all evidence or critical thinking as you call it and just start a new thread claiming its fake and on a completely new account just saying , lets see if he replies to your comment about your observations we'll see.

                  Look he replied, but I guess he only wrote this huge reply to prove you wrong after you assumed he wouldn't reply, right? xD
I'm rather certain (not 100%) that he is convinced about what he is saying and has no bad intention.
He should make up his mind though.
