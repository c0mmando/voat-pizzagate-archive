            Since there's lots of Beatles conspiracy theory on this thread, here is my latest research about John Lennon as Satanist:
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently Lennon was one of many musicians who claimed he'd sold his soul to the devil. Here's a tale about that:
           </p>
           <p>
            "There’s also a hoary old tale of a young hopeless musician who sold his soul to the Devil on the bridge of Rose Lane. In December 1960, so this tale goes, John Lennon, aged 20, had heard the weird tales of the 'Devil’s Bridge' and became obsessed with the idea of selling his soul to Beelzebub in return for fame and fortune, as he wanted to be bigger than his idol, Elvis Presley - a performer who had ironically been accused of being in league with the Devil and playing the fiend’s music – rock and roll. Lennon sneaked out of his house, 251 Menlove Avenue, where he was living with Aunt Mimi, and walked just over a mile through the December snow to the bridge of destiny, arriving there just before midnight. The Devil duly appeared as a tall shadowy figure with horns and the same uncanny-looking eyes described by Mr James. A bargain was struck."

            It turns out December 27, 1960 was The Beatles breakthrough concert. Music fans usually came to concerts to dance, but this time they rushed the stage screaming. This was the start of Beatlemania:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Live: Litherland Town Hall, Liverpool"

            Lennon was killed December 8, 1980. ("It was twenty years ago today...")
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently he had premonitions of his death:

           <p>
            Lennon's assassin, Mark Chapman, claimed demons made him do it:

            I got the main concepts for this research from the following article, "John Lennon's Pact with Satan", a Catholic site review of a book

            Bummer. George was my favorite. I think I’ve seen enough to convince me to throw out all of his music. Heck, I’ll start listening to polka if it helps bring justice. BTW, it’s gonna get a lot worse before it gets better. Stock up on intestinal fortitude, cuz it will be worth it, tho.

            Someone at CDAN mentions Jerry Garcia, of the Grateful Dead. So far I found this crappy board posting, hardly proof, but rumor:
           </p>
           <p>
            'All members of the Grateful Dead, including Jerry Garcia, are pedophiles"

            Then there's talk the GD were CIA connected. Also their dancing bear logo!
           </p>
           <p>
            I visited San Francisco in the mid 70's and the rumor was the whole band was gay (I'm not conflating this with pedophilia).

             Oh yes, at least Bob Weir of the
             <strong>
              Grateful Dead
             </strong>
             is a  member  of the "

              Bohemian Grove

             Lots of recent posts seem relevant to #metoo and exposure of high-level corruption. This one only exposes individual corruption, but might bring down a popular 'idol' and lead to public cynicism. I'm hoping more information emerges.
            </p>
            <p>
             For now, this totally sucks, as we are dragging various individuals through the mud. I think exposure of the dark side of the Beatles is always good though.

            But I did  already some resaerch about the
            <strong>
             Beatles
            </strong>
            a few years ago   -  and found out,  they did know Superpedo
            <strong>
             Jimmy Savile
            </strong>
            quite well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is something about Jimmy Savile owning a club called "Three Coins" in Manchester:

            Jimmy Savile also was part of their 1964 "Christmas Show".

            And, at the release party of the album
            <strong>
             Sergeant Pepper
            </strong>
            at Brian Epstein's  flat (24 Chapel Street) at May 19th in 1967 there were not many people, but one of them was Mr. Savile.

             Brian Epstein
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            As everyone knows, Epstein was gay. I do not blame gay people for being gay.  But it's guite interesting to have a look at the "gay music scene" of the UK in the "Swinging Sixties". There we can find people  like
            <em>
             Joe Meek
            </em>
            (who killed first his landlord then himself with a gun he took from his boyfriend , the singer
            <em>
             Heinz Burt
            </em>
            )  -   and we also  can find the
            <em>
             Kray twins
            </em>
            with connection to
            <em>
             Savile, Lord Boothby
            </em>
            and
            <em>
             Cliff Richard
            </em>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also rumours that Epstein went to  "sordid  parties" with Savile and  another DJ,
            <em>
             Alan "Fluff " Freeman
            </em>
            ... but, that's just rumours!
           </p>
           <p>
            here we can see Brian Epstein and Savile sitting at  a table in 1964  "the duke (Prince Philip) meets the Beatles".
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            After 1967, the death of Brian Epstein, there seems to be no more contact between the Beatles and Savile. So maybe Epstein was the "link" between them? Epstein  was found dead in 1967. Officially it was "suicide" or an  "accident"....  but you never know...

            <strong>
             Trivia

            :
           </p>
           <p>
            Savile once had a Café  called  "Norwegian Wood".
           </p>
           <p>
            And he wrote a preface for the Book  “The Beatles Lyrics” (1969).
           </p>
           <p>
            The Beatles were just once live at TOTP, for playing "Paperback Writer" in 1966.
           </p>
           <p>
            Savile always used to boast about, how well he and the Beatles did get along, he claimed that John Lennon "stole"  the "glasses" from him (Celebrity Big Brother 2006) and that he was there, when  Paul McCartney got the idea to write the song "Paperback Writer".

             This Jimmy Saville really seemed to be at the heart of British entertainment and royalty. I had never heard of him but know that he was the host of Top of the Pops. So the music connection makes sense but I still don't understand how he hooked up to the Royals especially as he wasn't Royal and they only like posh folk.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you think Paul was replaced like others think in these comments? I don't see it personally. But I'd believe it knowing what we all now know about truths and deceptions.

              Thanx ;) .   Savile had very good connections to the "elite".
             </p>
             <p>
              He is said to have been a "pimp" for the pedo elite and groomed children and teenagers for their parties....  He did a lot of charity and visited orphan's homes and hospitals....
              <em>
               cough
              </em>
              ....
             </p>
             <p>
              The story goes that he once met
              <strong>
               Lord Louis Mountbatten
              </strong>
              (aka „Dickie“ or “Mountbottom” - nickname est omen),  when he took part in some  training with the Royal Marines  in 1966  (which is rather odd, as he looked like a hippie, but in fact mingled with the conservative elite of the uK - not so much with "left wingers")
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               He was first introduced to the Royal Family, he reveals, by Lord Mountbatten. In 1966, Jimmy became the first civilian to be awarded a Royal Marines’ green beret. Mountbatten was comm­and­ant general at the time and realised that Savile could be a useful contact.
              </p>
              <p>
               “Coming from Lord Louis, who was the favourite uncle of Prince Philip, that was quite something,” he says. “So obviously I hooked up with the Prince – what was good enough for Lord Louis was good enough for him.”

              smells very much like bs.  I never believed it. I saw Paul McCartney two times live in the last years and I really think it's him.  He sounds like thim and he moves like him and he looks like him.
             </p>
             <p>
              An even worse rumour claims that Paul was the same person as Vivian Stanshall or Tara Browne...  that's beyond bullshit.

               I read a little about it. Stephen Ward was American and a charmer.Friends in high places. keeper of many secrets. Christine would go meet her sugar daddies at Dolphin Sq which is where all the British politicians molested young boys. Someone needs to raise those buildings down.

                As I am not only a Beatles- but also  a Bowiefan  I did some research.. and found this interesting bit:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 The infamous Dr. Stephen Ward once told me all of the kids at the St. Barnardos he worked at for free as a councillor had been sexually abused at some time. But anything at St. Barnardo's stopped when Johnny Jones rose in the ranks and took over. Johnny ran a tight ship, suffered no excuses, was hands-on, often doing surprise inspections. He sacked a few people.....
                </p>
                <p>
                 ......I liked Johnny, despite his problems he was one of the good guys, and was thus, at a suitable age, invited to St.  Barnardo's, driving there in the tiny Fiat 500 2-seat that came with the job, seeing a man I'd seen before, at Leonard  Cheshire's care-home. The aforementioned Ward. Who used to help Leonard and Sue for free, too. He used to  hypnotise the kids and dig out the problem, and try to deal with it......
                </p>
                <p>
                 ...Johnny Jones was David Bowie's dad. ...

                This was written as a comment by an "Anonymous", but I am pretty sure, this was written by that guy, who - about 10 years ago -  wrote a lot of weird stuff on several websites and called himself
                <strong>
                 Sverre Helgesen
                </strong>
                (don't know if this was his real name).
               </p>
               <p>
                When I read it first I thought it must be bs. But after I got a bit more redpilled, I tend to believe, that there is indeed some truth in it, but  I thought, that maybe he was a bit confused or suffereing from  mental  problems, when he wrote it....

                And now I just found THIS website!  -  the author shows a picture of himself - it's the same picture that I know from "Sverre Helgesen"  -  Story also looks similar.
               </p>
               <p>
                That Blog is rather recent (2016!)   -  and it looks not as "confused" as some of his older posts...  Sverre Helgesen (or what's his real name) obviously wrote a book.  So I think it's worth to have a closer  look...!

              Dave McGowan’s works “Laurel Canyon Days” (or something like that) and “Programmed to Kill” lay out a bunch of entertainment/MKULTRA connections. They’re surprising and poignant. Totally relevant to pizzagate, the granddaddy of pizzagate.

             Although yes, the "new state of mind" (man) could certainly apply to Morrison too.

              And you're presuming a lot. There are tons of Top Ten Band list where The Beatles don't even get on. Think The Rolling Stone had ABBA as number one. ABBA? Yeah, I know! Then there are The Beach Boys. The were into the India thing and a LOT of people consider them the best band ever. I just don't know that much about them, but they were Californication boys.

               I'm not "presuming a lot", thank you. I'm going with the overwhelming majority, among which are die hard Beatles experts who fully agree (+ not just on Voat.)

               CDAN is hitting us with the hard stuff atm. Brian Wilson aint it. Neither are Bjorn or Benny. Younger generation have no idea who they are but old, young, black, whit alike know john paul ringo and george.

                I'm not buying into Harrison being that much of a fraud. You expect me to believe that he's such a fraud that he's outing Faul and Ono?

                And Brian Wilson is over Don Henley in terms of status and Henley was referred to as an A-lister. Common sense tells us that enty is speaking about what happens in Cali.

            I'm going out on a limb here and saying it can't be Harrison. There are too many incidents that would back up his not being this scum bag. How about Keith Moon? That guy was Luciferian nuts.

              The Stones were the ones that used that phrase, not The Beatles. And, evidently, The Who used the phrase to refer to live performances.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many people would categorize The Who as that. Harrison just doesn't fit. He's the one who spoke out about Faul ... and Yoko being a POS. He was very honest and forthright and seemed to live in line with his beliefs. He could have fooled me ... but it doesn't seem that way.

            Ah yes subversive tonal scale designed to make listeners mad, no wonder all those 50's english wankers were so silly stupid over Theodor Adorno's chaotic caco

            Folks. This is all a beautifully horrific psyop played on all of you. You were told the Beatles were the best rock group on the planet since you were children by your irresponsible parents and peers. All the warnings that it was the devils music were right, which you STILL refuse to accept. But the truth is staring you in the face right now, who ARE YOUR IDOLS?
           </p>
           <p>
            IDOLS, funny thing huh, who in the WORLD would worship a golden calf? And WHY in the world would you stop someone from their religious beliefs today from worshiping a STATUE? Well, that's another psyop, they weren't worshiping a statue they were worshiping what it stood for (and the psyop not to question other's religious beliefs), which meant they were PAGANS SACRIFICING CHILDREN TO THEIR GOD. We do that symbolically every single day here in modern America, we give our children up to someone who claims to have their best interests whether it be a politician or clergyman, and we trust that our children and the artists catering to them would not give them a product that would harm them or be someone unsavory they would rather them not be associated with, but the powers that be have taken advantage of ALL of those old trusted norms and have done the complete OPPOSITE FOR A REASON.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a DEMORALIZING TOOL. You spend half or most of your life admiring someone, say if you were a young black man motivated into being a pediatrician based on your love of The Cosby Show perhaps. Well, imagine what struggle the black man in America is going through right now JUST BASED ON THE ACTIONS OF ONE MAN, Bill Cosby.
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS IS MAGIC BEING USED ON US PLAIN AND SIMPLE FOLKS, AND THE TELLS ARE RIGHT THERE BEFORE YOUR EYES, HIS DEAL WITH THE DEVIL WAS MADE A LONG TIME AGO AND THE DEAL IS, WE WILL MAKE YOU FAMOUS BUT YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHIN FOR US, YOU GOTTA TAKE A FALL IN THE END.... WHY? haven't I made that completely obvious?

            They were aLL dirtbags and were created as dirtbags FOR THIS VERY EVENTUALITY, to make us all feel as though we have been played and taken advantage of.

             This demoralization is a tool designed to make you question the EVERYTHING that you are, WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. You are a programmed idiot. Everything you know about this world was given to you by them, with everything stripped away, which soon it will be, you will be an empty shell of NOTHING, and you will be weak,  you will be in pain, you will be suffering, you will be vulnerable and desperate, you will do anything to survive, without conscience, you realize you are valueless without being propped up by their illusion, you will be the Beasts of Men, your inner demons, The Walking Dead, that is, unless, you have a higher power and can remember who you really are, only those with enough strength to be moral will survive.

            It's four different men. The real Beatles were killed and replaced before the premiere of A Hard Day's Night. They never got to see the movie, which also has the replacements acting in it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The replacement of The Beatles was being organised during the first US visit, and by the second US visit the real John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr had been replaced by imposters.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fake Beatles appeared on all album covers after A Hard Day's Night - which include the now notorious Yesterday and Today.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've only been on to this for a couple of months after finding that there's a conspiracy theory/urban legend that Paul McCartney died in a car crash in 1966 and the other three hired a double to take his place. This is a misdirection and disinformation psyop to stop people digging any further - all The Beatles were disappeared and the last time I see them is on the Australia tour of 1964.

             What a crazy thing to read. Wow. Reminds of the time that I read about astronomers finding sugar asteroids in the center of the galaxy... it was a legit, straight faced report in popular mechanics or something, I swear. Upvoat!

            The real Paul McCartney was killed in a car crash in 1966 this is beyond dispute if you look at photos of Paul from 1964 to 1966 then compare him to the New Fake Paul (a lookalike named William Shears) they are two different guys. MI-6 helped the Beatles do this switch to continue the band they could not let the world know that the Real Paul was killed in a car crash his head was smashed in very badly then in 1969 Lennon wrote the song "I am the Egg Man I am the Walrus" that was referring to what Paul's smashed head looked like there are videos on YouTube that show the two different Pauls very clearly now the Fake Paul is very old and for over 50 years he has lived as McCartney but he's really Shears.

             this is when i began to realise that the beatles were nothing more than a cia mi5 mind control experiment after they took over the band which is why the beatles were all so unhappy in the end and john lennon was assasinated by an mk ultra mind control slave they say paul mccartney isnt a very nice person

              i've also spent some time last year studying the photos that the FORENSIC SCIENTISTS studied and there are many differences. they came to the same conclusion that i came to (b4 me) - there is no possible way they are the same guys.

             Oh you're clever aren't you? You've learnt the conspiracy theory verbatim. Fake Sir Paul appeared in A Hard Day's Night in 1964 and on Ready Steady Go in 1963. Pictures of Paul between 64 &amp; 66 include other doubles and fake Sir Paul with prosthetics. The last time I see real Paul McCartney is on the Australia tour of 64

            The Beatles were straight up satanists. The Beatles and Wings get their names from Crowley's book The Winged Beetle, which was ghost re-published by McCartney in the 70's. And in many satanic books it encourages pedophilia and sodomy to get closer to opening portals to other dimensions. If that sounds crazy that's because it fucking is.

            Damnit. But knowing what I know now about the whole Beatles/Tavistock/psyop thing, can't pretend I'm surprised.
           </p>
           <p>
            The timing of the alleged upcoming lawsuits is interesting. Why all of a sudden now? Is this another Tavistock move to divert attention away from the Luciferians who are raping, killing, and eating children while they rule the world? I don't think they'll bury this story. In fact, I think they'll highlight it as much as possible. After all, the guy is dead so nobody will be going to prison, hung from the trees, or have to step down from running a country.

               That was a reference to their albums being "butchered" by executives when they took a song or two off earlier albums to compile for another disc, for money.
But yeah, why the fuck is Crowley on the front cover of Sgt. Peppers?

            Since reading a bit of Miles Mathis I have come to  suspect the Beatles were an astoundingly successful psyop, and the public's image of them is way off the reality.  Even in the official story, George  was very young himself when he joined the Beatles.  My memory's a bit hazy but I thought one of the reasons the Beatles had to leave Germany back in their Hamburg days was that George was only fifteen ie. still legally a child when they got arrested there for possession of drugs.

             Also likely true. The psyops, along with MKULTRA all go hand in hand with elite satanist. Ask Michael “Eyebrows”, aka “the Colonel”.

             So much, more than the public could ever digest, has been written about them over the years. We all think we know them. But we don't.

              Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

             doing hanging out with them anyway during that time? So random and suspect.

                I was thinking if Dakota was a Satanist center, a la
                <em>
                 Rosemary's Baby
                </em>
                , Crowley would be attracted. It could also be the other way around, Satanists attracted to the place because of Crowley. (Again, I have no proof he was staying at the Dakota at all.)

                Apparently he was doing an "Amalantrah Working" and opened (but then closed) a portal that an entity called "Lam" used. A picture of this entity looks a lot like a gray alien, except without the huge eyes.

              John, Paul, George and Ringo were all killed and replaced in 1964 by doubles who had been performing and acting as them since 1963.

                I only saw this one for the first time two nights ago. It is allegedly from the Washington Colliseum show they did on their first US trip. I was watching it with my mum - I said, "What did he just say?" My mum couldn't repeat the word, although she knew what it was and she knew what it meant - she has been in utter denial over this. Listen to the first 12 words the "Paul McCartney" says at the start of the video. What does he say? Notice also the camera angle on some shots shows no audience in the background.
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                I have to conclude from this that the fake Beatles were also on that first trip and doing gigs to an audience that would be the people who carried out the replacement.

                I know what you're saying about a punch in the gut. I've only researched this after stumbling on the "Paul is dead" conspiracy theory a couple of months ago. When you get to know the real Beatles and the imposters/secret agents, everything you think you know starts to crumble.

                You are in for a shock if and when you wake up from this one. What you have to do is get to know the real John, Paul, George and Ringo, then when you've done that you might be able to spot the imposters. I'm going to link you to two videos of interviews with The Beatles and the man who sat in for Ringo Starr who was ill with tonsilitis at the beginning of their 1964 world tour to Europe and Australia. The first video is of the real Beatles in Australia
               </p>
               <p>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/gWiJqBIse3c">

               </p>
               <p>
                The second video was recorded a few days prior in The Netherlands. It's the same Jimmy Nichol, but a different John, Paul and George.
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>
                Pay attention in the Australian interview to George's immediate reaction when asked about the Shakespeare television play. He has to think about what to say because although they rehearsed for the show it was the fake Beatles who actually did the recording.

               No, there's only overwhelming evidence that Paul was replaced, none of the others. And that was 1966.

                Sir Paul has overwhelming evidence that was him before 1966, because that was actually him before 1966. So if you're trying to make a case against Sir Faul appearing in 1966 he's got tons of evidence in his defence.
               </p>
               <p>
                The conspiracy theory was devised by the people who killed The Beatles so it would get the same reaction you are showing. There are also plenty of shills trying to police the investigation so people come to the same conclusion.

                 Not trying to be argumentative but I've researched death of James Paul McCartney extensively. He was replaced in 1966 by William Shepard. Aka Billy Shears. If you read the book Memoirs of Billy Shears it will be very helpful, you can start w/ the condensed version "Billy's Back." Here's a good interview w/ a guy who's researched it probably more than anyone. There are several different good ones out there w/ him. I am certainly open to looking at any evidence you might have but it has to be solid.

                  Of course there's a fake breadcrumb trail to lead people away from the truth. I don't really care what his name was, he's in A Hard Day's Night and on the cover of the album of the same name. Watch the movie where he turns to the camesra and goes "ZAP!" That's the imposter Faul.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I haven't read any books on the subject, but I have been watching exhaustively the movies concerts and TV appearances and I can tell the difference between Paul and Faul even in his prosthetic make up.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Paul and the rest of the real Beatles are gone before the second visit to the US and they never even picked up their MBEs - that's very clear.

                   I agree, and that's one of the biggest proofs, the ears ... I'm just disagreeing w/ the guy above who's saying ALL the Beatles were replaced. There's no proof of that at all, not that I've seen, and is a bit far fetched.

                     I don't know what you've been seeing but there's plenty enough out there to convince you. I looked at it for about a year. Sir Paul is older, taller, skinnier, session musician who can read music. Different ears, eye color. Heck just read his book, Memoirs of Billy Shears, that should do it. It's actually Sir Paul who wrote it. He explains the meanings to all the song words. It was the clincher for me. Gosh he wore a wig for a while in 1966 and 67, and a fake mustache.

                      Ruby T was about Keith's old girlfriend and possibly about Marianne Faithfull who he dated and ditched and then she became jagger's exclusively but he still carried a torch. Or so I thought!

                       Well Ruby Tuesday talks about death. Yes, if you haven't spent enough time it's difficult, it's one of those things you have to discover yourself, and when you do a light will go off. I grew up w/ the Beatles, I was in middle school, thus the fascination. Let me know if you ever embrace it, you'll never go back.

                        I will research. Now I'm super interested. The part of me that has seen paul/faul live does find it all a little hard to swallow, but Im curious why Im not seeing what everyone else is seeing. For me, teeth are a dead giveaway and the 'two' pauls both have the same set (from what I can see.)Hmmm.

                         Here are the forensic scientists, husband and wife, who set out to prove Paul wasn't dead, but had to admit he was. They studied the teeth. There's so much to this. I assume you've seen The Winged Beatle, if not that is good, but the book seals the deal, did for me. I'm totally convinced, and British govt. got involved when he died, MI6 specifically. And Tavistock, Brian Epstein enlisted their help. And on and on. Read the book and find out why "she came in thru the bathroom window," and tons more. Some occult involved. Well cheerio as the Brits would say, off to bed. Believe me, everybody that has accepted his death has been thru the same sad and morbid feelings, it's very common, it was very difficult for me to accept, but as they say, where certain rumors persist for years, they often turn out to be true. Where there's smoke there's fire. Talk later. (I have a facebook friend, Mark Rodney, his dad is Red Rodney and has a big wiki write-up ... Mark hung w/ all these Laurel Canyon folk and he knew Hendrix and Joplin and often posts his own personal pics of everyone, Joni Mitchell, David Crosby, Jackson Brown, on and on. But they all hate Trump lol.)

              The very language they got us using has a virus in it..
English is a language of spells and grammer
The spell is cast via a corruption of grammer..grammer means magic
English is a language constructed from hebrew heiroglyphics..which in turn is derived from egyptian heiroglyphics..the beatle is an egyptian symbol..
Enjoy
