<p>At exactly 11, on November 1, the OFFICIAL FBI Records Vault twitter account, after several months of inactivity, dumped many tweets, the first one being a seemingly random document about Tesla &amp; Fred Trump.

The FOIA link they tweeted is them telling people to send in requests so they can dump documents and we can put the pieces together which people like you have had great success doing with the arms business. The Podesta emails and the FBI pedo imagery doc were just the more incendiary additions and the one people are going to latch onto. A lot of people aren\'t going to care about the slaughter and instability going on in a part of the world we\'ve been at war with for almost 20 yrs, but almost everyone is going to pissed at the thought of kids getting molested and traded like cattle.

My question is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can we confirm or debunk this theory about the FBI Twitter account?</li>
<li>For example, is it possible that (A) FBIanon was a LARPer who reads tons of anti-Hillary books (like Partners in Crime) and just got really lucky and (B) the LARPer, or other people, just submitted a bunch of FOIA requests back in July, and then the FBI Twitter account spitted them out around Oct. 30?</li>
<li>Didn\'t the Twitter account start posting before Nov. 1, on Oct. 30?</li>
<li>I thought that the Twitter account tweet happened at 9 o\'clock, not 11 o\'clock? But what about time zones?</li>
<li>What was the specific tweet at 11 o\'clock? Was it about the Clinton Foundation?</li>
<li>Is any of this archived so we can go back and investigate? The FBI Twitter account is still up, but what about the 4chan Tesla/Trump story, and what about the predictions that the tweets would happen at 11 o\'clock on Nov. 1</li>
</ol>
<p>I want to confirm or disconfirm this theory. If we can confirm, it is just one more nail in the coffin of doubt that FBIanon was fake. Everything he said, more or less, has come true - everything that matters anyway (nobody cares about Brexit or California election results).</p>
<p>Help me confirm/disconfirm this theory. If it can be confirmed, it\'s probably the strongest evidence that FBIanon is legit and he was fucking talking to us from the inside!</p>',

            Via the fbi record vault Twitter, it  seems they were dormant for a year and 22 days, their one post from 10/8/15 was about making FOIA requests.
Then, a year and 22 days later they suddenly tweet after being dormant for so long on 10/30/16 at exactly 4:00am about Fred Trump. A few others, of course, and one about Nikola Tesla at 4:00am. There were 20 tweets that day.
Then, on November 1st they made a tweet about the William J. Clinton foundation, released documents,etc. it was tweeted out at 12:00pm. This is what it says anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            What were the times FBI anon said? Because if you were in the time zone of the Las Vegas area, you would be 3 hours behind. So 9:00am there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll link them later.

             I keep seeing different things for the time. I'm starting to think that the Twitter displays the time differently depending on your time zone.
            </p>
            <p>
             What time zone are you in? Mine says 9 am for the CF tweet on Nov. 1. I am in Mountain Time, so that fits the 11 oclock prediction, which would be eastern time (presumably).
            </p>
            <p>
             Actually, I'm pretty confident now that this is legit.

                 I think we can't confirm that this was FBI 100%. But I'm basically 85% right now. Either it was FBI or a LARPer with a genius skill level and work ethic.

                  I just don't see how they'd be able to be spot on, then have the FBI account publish all of that. I feel the same though.

                   But even if it isn't, we have everything else: predicting CF investigation on July 2, predicting human trafficking on July 2, coloboma on four different sets of eyes, etc.
