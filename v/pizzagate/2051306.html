<p>This is related to Pizzagate because it concerns the dark underbelly of the international adoption industry which as <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/investigate/adoption/index.html#TheLie">one critic</a> describes it, has been &quot;a Wild West, all but free of meaningful law, regulation, or oversight&quot; where babies and children from poor countries are bought and sold by unscrupulous entrepeneurs.</p>
<p>Russian adoptions have been in the U.S. headlines for the last few months because of the sensational news of the meeting in Trump Tower last June between Donald Trump, Jr., and Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Russian attorney who claimed to be lobbying influential Americans for the restart of Russian adoptions in the U.S.  
</p>
<p>Russian adoptions were banned by Putin when he signed the Dima Yakovlev Law in Dec. 28, 2012, the Feast of the Holy Innocents, a date of enormous symbolism. </p>
<p>The law met with instant international outrage and Putin was accused of being &quot;Herod&quot; and &quot;cannibalalistic&quot; and denying disadvantaged Russian children opportunities for American adoption as political retribution for the Magnitsky Act which sanctions on Russian officials. </p>
<p>As I have explained before, however, the Russian govt. had taken measures beginning in 2008 to introduce stricter controls on Russian adoptions in the US because of a number of cases of abuse and suspicious deaths of Russian adoptees. </p>
<p>In fact, a year after the Dimi Yakovlev Law was passed, the Russian govt. launched <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/criminal-probe-child-trafficking-769/">a criminal probe</a> into online trafficking of Russian children in the U.S.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Investigative Committee spokesperson Vladimir Markin said the case was started due to a journalistic investigation by Reuters and NBC initiated in September.According to investigators, illegal markets were created in the US on Yahoo and Facebook websites, on which illicit transactions concerning children adopted by US citizens were performed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He added that, following the reports, the committee had checked the information and decided to open a criminal case on human trafficking involving minors.</p>
<p>Thus, among others, transactions involving 26 underage Russian citizens were made and moreover, it was established that as the result of the deals some of them were sexually abused,” Markin said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>NEW DEVELOPMENTS</strong></p>
<p>In a surprising (or not so surprising) turn of events, today Sputnik News reported upon the sudden discovery of hundreds of Russian-speaking children in an Iraqi orphanages in Mosul which was recently liberated by Iraqi and US coalition forces from Daesh terrorists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MOSCOW (Sputnik) — On Friday, the Chechen leader (Ramzan Kadyrov) said that there could be some 300 children from Russia and from other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the orphanages of Iraq. At the same time he added that there could be about 400 children in the crisis-torn countries of the Middle East, citing Russian Presidential Commissioner for Children’s Rights Anna Kuznetsova.</p>

<p>An RT article also reported on the case, claiming that dozens of Russian children whose parents joined ISIS are being repatriated to Russia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A four-year-old Chechen boy has been brought back to Russia after living with his jihadist father, who was fighting alongside ISIS in Mosul. Russian authorities are now seeking the return of several dozen such children from Iraqi orphanages.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps this tragic discovery can be attributed to predictable fallout from war, or perhaps these children are trafficking victims---it\'s not possible to tell from these articles. What is certain, however, is the peculiar outrage of the zeitgeist over Putin\'s Russian adoptions ban, which is summed up very well in this sinister tweet I found today responding to a WaPo article on Paul Manafort\'s house being raided by the FBI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do not. I repeat, DO NOT screw with Russian adoptions.</strong></p>

            if some are the discarded offspring of dead or fleeing Isis followers, chances are many of these ones are already very possibly beyond redemption/rehabilitation (of the earthly kind anyways) . Unless the Govt/Organization responsible intends to dedicate an impossible amount of funds for an inordinate amount of time, along with rehabilitative personal and assorted other material, the only productive use for them and their already heavily impacted skill sets, would sadly only consist of Govt sponsored upkeep, further training and further indoctrination until legal age to enter Armed Services or something of the like ( Intelligence agencies et al, but definitely NOT Law enforcement though). I've seen way too many of their shitty caliphate inspired live-fire training and live execution video's featuring dozens upon dozens of completely different early-teen and younger Individuals from different ethnic groups/languages (the common denominator being Islam or more rightly the wahabist/salafist sects) and freely/willingly participating in these all child-brigade weapon tactics and training clips and also on closeup torture, murder, assassination videos of (innocent??) adult Iraqi civilians, sharia-law breakers, non co-operative tribal leaders and captured soldiers. As dangerous as any adult fanatic with a firearm or combat knife.

            This Pope keeps pushing his own agenda.....his books, his friends, his dogma and just out and out strangeness. I believe we saw a coup d'etat when Pope Benedict was pushed out. Pope Francis was put in to help the globalists. Nothing anybody can say about him would change my mind about what his part is in this enormous play.

            I go back and read his AMA's when I feel discouraged or confused about world events. He did say that it would take time to straighten out the mess of the last 25 years, but do not despair.  Stay strong and do not give up the fight to take our country back from the deep state.  (I know that many believe the deep state began its stranglehold in 1963, but they acted covertly until 1992, when they saw that bubba got in.)

            If ISIS was holding them in Mosul they were most likely sold for their organs. I think each kid is worth about $300,000. I don't know any other reason why those orphans would have found their way to Mosul. That's a pretty long way from Russia and in the middle of a war zone obviously.

            It seems there is more reason to believe Vlad Putin will protect those children when he gets them back than we do in this country. He started investigations this in 2008 then passed a law in 2012 forbidding adoptions due to pedophiles and Satanic worship. Just listen to his Christmas 2016 speech you will wonder why we are fighting one of the only countries left that is based in the ideas of Christian culture and instead joining the one that openly have riots and migrants threatening to kill us all. He might be no angel but it is possible the media and military use him as a bogeyman to get more funding for war.

             How about you 'do the research'. Just google(other search engines are available) Russian orphanage abuse and work through the multiple and and varied sources explaining the brutal conditions inside Russian orphanages.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you're going to push that bullshit about Russia while claiming to be 'thinking of the children'. Then you have no shame, morals or integrity.

             Remember our friend FBIAnon said that the globalists want to destroy Russia because it is the last stronghold for Caucasian, Christian people. The plan, he said, was to get Hillary in and start a war with Russia to ultimately destroy her traditions and society.   And bring in the immigrants like they've already done in Europe. This being done, they've got that continent. Done and done. I feel Pres Trump understands their evil plan.

              Exactly. For those unaware Putin kicked the Rothschilds out of his country for good several years ago. He had to be ruthless and there were many assasination attempts but he accomplished it.
