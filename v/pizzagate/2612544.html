<blockquote>
<p><strong>French soldiers in the Central African Republic allegedly sexually abused children, as exposed in a UN report leaked by staffer Anders Kompass. After more than nine months, no action has been taken, other than the UN suspending Kompass for the leak.</strong> </p>
<p>On May 7 [2015], Inner City Press posed more questions about this, to the UN\'s Special Representative on Sexual Violence and Conflict Zainab Bangura and to the French Mission to the UN and its Ambassador Francois Delattre, video here.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Another report: <a href="http://www.innercitypress.com/bangura1tabitafw041515.html">On Rape and War, After Ladsous Cover Ups, Bangura Talks to Sudan, Report in Limbo</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amid the speeches on Sexual Violence and Conflict in the UN Security Council on April 15, abuses by and covered up by the UN\'s own peacekeepers were barely mentioned. The principle of &quot;Doctor Heal Thyself,&quot; as soon often at the UN, was ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On November 9, 2014, peacekeepers went to Tabit in Darfur where hundreds of rapes are alleged to have occurred, then issued a press release that the residents got along well with Sudanese security forces.</p>
<p>The press release has never been retracted, and the UN has not regained access to Tabit. Inner City Press has repeated asked UN Peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous about it, as about his previous cover up of rapes by the Congolese Army in Minova, but Ladsous openly refuses to answer Press questions.</p>
<p>Relatedly, Ladsous refused to answer on a damning internal UN report on sexual abuse BY peacekeepers which was leaked this year by AIDS Free World. </p>
<p>Inner City Press asked the UN\'s Zainab Bangura about both on April 14.</p>
<p>Bangura to her credit does answer questions. On Tabit, she seemed genuine engaged, having for example raised the issue to a Sudanese minister who came to the UN for the Status of Women meetings recently. But once Ladsous\' UNAMID did the first cover-up, the decision had been made.</p>
<p>This made Bangura\'s second answer all the more troubling. The damning internal UN report went ONLY to Ladsous\' DPKO, and DFS which he dominated, and not to Bangura\'s office.</p>
<p>How can the UN have an Office on Sexual Violence and Conflict which does NOT cover abuses by its own peacekeepers and personnel? </p>
<hr />
<p><strong>And another report: <a href="http://www.innercitypress.com/ladsous1reuters041113.html">On Minova, Ladsous Launders Self-Exoneration Through Reuters Lapdog</a></strong></p>
<p>This is how it\'s done at the UN: the media that openly push for answers are stonewalled, those that sit and wait are used as pass-throughs for non-critical stories. .....</p>
<p>...So Inner City Press contact the office of Zainab Bangura, Ban\'s expert on sexual violence and conflict. Mattias Sundholm of that Office, copying Jerome Bernard, responded that “I understand that DPKO has promised to come back to you regarding Minova, so I will refer you to them.”</p>
<p>Inner City Press replied that Ladsous and his DPKO refuse to answer Press question, preferring to dole the answers out to friendlier media.....</p>
<p>.....<strong>This threat obviously implicates Reuters and the role it has come to play for the UN, like UN Peacekeeping, and some Permanent Missions like those of the UK and France.</strong></p>

<p><em>It is no accident that a deviant 22 year old had such a handful of high profile positions with international agencies working with vulnerable children.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In the wake of our initial report, astounding questions have been raised about Davis’s history as well as that of the organization he founded. Disobedient Media has learned that Davis, 22, is a two-time college drop out, (from both American University and Columbia University) and was pursuing a third attempt at completing his undergraduate degree at the time of his arrest.
            </p>
            <p>
             Upon examination, it appears that Youth to End Sexual Violence (Davis’s NGO) is no longer a registered 501c charity. Records show that the 501c status of Youth to End Sexual Violence was revoked in May 2017 due to the group failing to submit relevant tax forms for three consecutive years.

              That's huge that the Langley architects Harrison and Abramovitz designed Morningside Heights apartment buildings; there's a lot of concerning history in that area!

              However I just noticed the building associated with Youth2ESV and Joel Davis, 622 W 114th St., named "Revere Hall," was
              <strong>
               designed by brothel architects
              </strong>
              Schwartz and Gross, in 1907.   In 1924 S &amp; G designed a 15-story brothel known as Majestic Towers, in NYC, complete with hidden back doors and secret staircases including down to the basement.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wonder what if anything is hidden in the design of "Revere" Hall at 622 W 114th St.

                An insane person would think that there was a long-standing pedophile ring, which owned a bunch or properties and has inflicted their curse among many.  There's a good chance the the building was/is a pedo factory for the last 100 years.

              So clue me in...Do you think that he was low hanging fruit that was given up to deflect from the size of the group and it abuses is he just an individual working on his own or do you actually think that he is innocent? I read some of the things he supposedly said and he was quite graphic and disgusting VERY EMBOLDENED...Almost like he wasnt worried about getting caught.

             Background info on Anthony Romero, ACLU executive director who apparently had planned to go on the Sandler-Podesta trip to Martha's Vineyard ("handkerchief" with "pizza-related map" emails)
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             wasn't familiar with the name, but discovered with some searching that the ACLU's current executive director is named Anthony Romero, and he is likely the one mentioned in this email. In a number of John Podesta's emails released by Wikileaks, he writes to Podesta about ACLU business, and the Sandler Foundation has been a big donor to the ACLU, so he is likely well acquainted with the Sandlers. Even if somehow it's another Anthony Romero being referred to, this is still relevant information, given the ACLU's backing of censorship of "fake news."
            </p>
            <p>
             Below are some links on Romero's background. He's been executive director of the ACLU since 2001, and many in the ACLU organization have accused him of being secretive and unprincipled while others have come to his defense. The previous executive director, Ira Glasser, has tried to remove him for improprieties:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The irony is that Ira Glasser created Anthony Romero. After heading the ACLU for 23 years, during which time he earned respect for a firm presence at the rudder and an almost bloodthirsty acumen on television debate programs, Glasser decided to step away in 2000. At the time, Romero was a young executive at the Ford Foundation who oversaw human-rights grants to the ACLU and others totaling $90 million a year. Though Romero had none of Glasser’s telegenic appeal, he is a lawyer by training—Glasser is a mathematician—and had something else going for him: a compelling personal narrative. Being Latino and gay made him a double minority and a trophy in the eyes of a place where diversity is a crucial value. ("Freedom to Backstab," link below)
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Former ACLU board member Wendy Kaminer also accused Romero of improprieties, and the ACLU of compromising its principles to cover up for him:

             These are Facebook messages that DIE ZEIT has and has partially published. On June 26, 2012, Emma wrote to Paul: "Ahhh Paul I miss you so much," and that when she was high at a party she had sex with a friend and his buddies. On Aug. 29, 2012, two days after the alleged rape, she wrote she wanted to see Paul. "We still haven’t really had a paul-emma chill sesh since summmmerrrr." And on Oct. 4 she wrote: "I love you Paul. Where are you!?!?!?!?!"
            </p>
            <p>
             Emma confirmed that the messages were authentic when asked by DIE ZEIT for her version of the story, but she did not give a reaction. Her father, Kerry Sulkowicz, a well-known psychoanalyst, also did not want to comment.

              In 1995, Dr. Foley became director of the

               Open Society Institute’s Project on Death in America
              </strong>
              , a $45 million, nine-year project focused on transforming the culture of death in the United States through initiatives in science, the humanities, education, and professional training. Recognizing a critical need for developing leaders and palliative care experts in order to facilitate change in patient care, Dr. Foley and her team created leadership programs for physicians, nurses, and social workers around the country, including at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
