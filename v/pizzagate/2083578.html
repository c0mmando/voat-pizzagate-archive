The UK fought his extradition back to Kenya, even though his wife was found guilty of stealing a child previously.  He had also been charged, but found not guilty of raping a girl in a circus British court.  Something strange about this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bishop Gilbert Deya has been extradited to Kenya for child trafficking. <strong>He is wanted in the country on five counts of abducting babies, illegally registering them and trafficking them to the United Kingdom.</strong>
The controversial preacher arrived at 5 am on Friday after <strong>his extradition request was rejected by a UK court.</strong>
According to his lawyer, John Sakwa the preacher was going to arrive after the August 8 elections.</p>
<p>The father of five had appealed against the extradition citing fear of torture and facing the death sentence.
The preacher has been accused of deceiving his followers that he could make infertile women deliver miracle babies and was in 2014, acquitted of rape and sexual assault charges.
<strong>His wife, Mary Deya was in 2004 arrested and charged with stealing babies and ten other kids who were found at their Mountain View estate house in Nairobi.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Deya who moved to the UK in 1997 is to face charges of child trafficking after being accused of stealing babies at the Pumwani maternity hospital between 1999 and 2003 to give to couples in his church who were unable to conceive after lying to them that he could deliver miracle babies .
<strong>Deya’s wife was jailed for 3 years after being found guilty of stealing a baby at the Kenyatta National hospital in 2005.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In December, 2014, Gilbert Deya, Kenyan minister working in UK, stood trial in for charges of rape a school girl and keeping her as a sex slave.</strong>  It appears a cover up may have been in the works when a witness, the girl\'s mother,  spoke for nearly an hour in a foreign language without notice by the court, and the interpreter couldn\'t remember anything said.</p>
<p>He has 36,000 church membership in UK.</p>

<p><strong>He was found NOT GUILTY  in the rape trial</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>United Kingdom-based controversial televangelist Gilbert Deya has been acquitted of rape and sexual assault charges.
The London Crown Court comprising 12 jury members on Friday ruled there was no evidence to support allegations that Mr Deya of the miracle babies saga raped a woman identified as Sia Kellie and sexually assaulted her daughter Gloria Richmond.</p>

**3. Ten children, none of whom had any genetic connection to the Deya family, were found at Mr Deya\'s House.

The babies were placed in foster care after DNA tests showed they had no connection to their alleged mothers.  
Rose Atieno Kiserem, a former pastor with Deya\'s ministry was jailed along with Deya and upon her release from jail, Kiserem confessed that the \'miracle babies\' were a hoax created by Deya and his accomplices to deceive God-fearing people. 
 

**4. Deya\'s wife, Eddah, was arrested in November 2004, charged with obtaining registration for five children irregularly.
 

**5. Gilbert Deya\'s church in Pekham, South London has 34,000 members

            EVERY ROYAL has a TITLE in the ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.  Look that up.

            That is because they are all CRYPTO JEWS.  QE II is a German crypto Jew whose bloodline includes fellow cryptos Mohammed (commissioned by the Vatican) and the original Crypto Jew, Jesus.  You can look that one up too.

              There are some, not all thankfully, who need to pin all the evil in this world onto one convenient scapegoat.

              The path of least resistance can become a crutch for self-sufficiency. Slaves must be docile and highly dependent.

              It makes a complicated life seem more manageable. I see it as evil manipulating Autism into a weapon of suicidal proportions.

              The Church of England is a notorious sponsor.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not only through economic control, but the best interest of National Security.
The Queen and her git are the head Satanist,

              Err, I mean the head chopper.

              No, I meant head honcho. Yeah, that's the ticket. Head of Civil Security and the Military.
             </p>
             <p>
              Say, is that not conflict of interest? Not for the Queen. Her bloodline owns her servants.
