            It's less a central point, and more of several investigations colliding together to form one huge, major clusterfuck.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our story begins in 2012, with Operation Yewtree in the United Kingdom. It was a year after Jimmy Savile's death, and it was found that for the past several decades hundreds of people had made allegations against him for being a pedophile yet remained protected by the BBC. Many well known entertainers, primarily those active between the 60s and 80s, were found guilty and brought down with him. This is what got the ball rolling and many people worldwide began to question just how many are truly involved in this? Who got away?
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the front got quiet for a while, until 2014 when the first allegations against Bill Cosby started in the US. The furore surrounding Savile was heavily referenced and many parallels were drawn. This got Americans thinking about who else in their entertainment industry was guilty?
           </p>
           <p>
            A year later, and the SLC Daycare conspiracy appeared on Reddit and 4Chan, concerning a very suspicious "Daycare" in Utah. Both sites extensively censored the threads/posts, citing "spam", along with many shills trying to derail genuine discussion. Several people were reported to have visited the site, only to have a suited government official approach them and telling them to leave, their cameras and other communication devices confiscated. It caused quite a stir, with many sites centered on a creepy and conspiratorial content linking screencaps and other useful tidbits of information.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now with the Election being the major dominant news topic for this year, everyone was looking for something to destroy the other candidate on, but the absolute motherlode fell on Clinton. Trump used this to his advantage by bringing Clinton's supposed victims to the 2nd debate and digging up old dirt. There are books, documentaries and other sources where victims such as Cathy O' Brien claim to have been sexually violated by both Bill and Hillary. Now because of the debate they are all back in the public eye.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the same time, Wikileaks uncovered hundreds of thousands of e-mails, firstly with Hillary, to which quite a lot of disgraceful political tactics and strategies were discovered by anons, but much later on we got John Podesta's emails. We scanned through them intently, finding more diabolical behavior, until we discovered E-Mail #32795, otherwise known as "Did you leave a handkerchief?" The language struck many people as odd and secretive, and soon we found more of it. Then the investigation ballooned once we linked people together, and realized the computer generated photos of Madeleine McCann's kidnappers strikingly resembled the Podesta brothers. Eventually, you end up at today.

            I think in the WikiLeaks Podesta e-mail dump that had the Spirit Cooking mention kicked things off. People began rooting around in that batch of mail and looking at what "spirit cooking" was.

            U can go to 4chan, you can google the fbiANON thread there are now 100's of backups,  it was from july 2016, from there it festered on /reddit/the-donald until october, then they created /reddit/pizzagate, then it got bounced over here to voat about 10 days ago,
           </p>
           <p>
            Originally fbiANON limited shit to clinton-foundation and child-fucking to all levels of gov, it was the alt-tards on 4chan that became obsessed with pizza, recall that before last year 4chan was a pedo site with real Child-Porn, so the majority of autists ( autistic ppl who play with their dicks an masturbate to child porn on 4chan ) immediately thought child-porn when they saw pizza in podesta dump the only place that sold the most pizza was comet-pizza so the witch hunt began, so long as it was limited to clinton-inc only it was all fine with /reddit/the-donald, once the DON was elected the autists were no longer useful idiots
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the">
             r/the
            </a>
            -donald tried to have it shutodown on reddit, but it jumped over to voat and now has a life of its own, if you want to know truth you need to go to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagateunedited">
             /v/pizzagateunedited

            as this thread
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            is moderated by the same assholes working for donald-trump as
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the">
             /r/the
            </a>
            -don
...
In summary fbi-anon said ALL GOV left&amp;right, DNC-RNC was fucking children, but the assholes on /reddit get it limited to DNC only, and still on voat its limited to DNC,
           </p>
           <p>
            In reality RNC fuck children 100X more than DNC

            , and welcome to Voat!  This subverse has some very specific rules on the sidebar to help keep the investigation from being forum-slid or flooded with things that do not help further the investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1457582/7042912">
             Here
            </a>
            is the situation we mods find ourselves in.  Would you please remove your submission and ask in one of the alternate subverses in the sidebar?  I'd really appreciate it, as every mod action is under a microscope and tip-toes past a hair-trigger.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks in advance for your consideration and understanding!
