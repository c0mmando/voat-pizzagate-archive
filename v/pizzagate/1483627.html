<p>In 2011, Arun G. Rao was one of the prosecutors in a former National Archives employee theft case. <a href="http://archive.is/q2O8d">http://archive.is/q2O8d</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leslie C. Waffen, 66, who was chief of the Archives’ audiovisual holdings, pleaded guilty to embezzlement of government property.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Arun G. Rao said in court that one item sold by Waffen was an original master copy of a voice recording of Babe Ruth on a December 1937 hunting trip.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>A 2004 New York Times article described Waffen’s efforts to preserve the only known audio recording of John F. Kennedy’s Assassination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Waffen is a longtime researcher of the JFK Assassination.</p>
<p>From the 2004 New York Times article: <a href="http://archive.is/uPrHl">http://archive.is/uPrHl</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recording was made through an open microphone on a police motorcycle during Kennedy\'s motorcade into Dealey Plaza, where the president was shot to death. The sounds were captured onto a Dictaphone belt at police headquarters, but scientific analyses of them over decades proved anything but conclusive, fueling arguments about how many people were actually involved in killing the president.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Once that is achieved, Mr. Waffen said, the scientists could \'\'clean it up, like peeling layers off an onion to get down to the sound floor\'\' of the recording. And that, he said, could reveal how many shots were fired.</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>\'\'Scientists have studied these sounds for 25 or 30 years and have still reached different conclusions,\'\' he said. \'\'But with today\'s technology, we can get a better reading and answer the question, one way or the other.\'\'</p>

<p>Could the arrest be connected to the globalists somehow?</p>',
