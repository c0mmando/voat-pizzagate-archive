<p>Sasha Lord, working as a tour manager for a group called Prince Rama, hosted a rooftop show at the Standard in New York.</p>
<p>Rama have performed at Comet Ping Pong, but for the sake of this investigation, they produced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAu9WWe4Sfs">music video/movie that ends in a blood orgy.</a>. </p>

</a>
The Harbin Hot Springs scandal is a notable because it has received almost no press, yet multiple victims have come forward and given very specific information about its links to the CIA and MK-ULTRA-style programs. Per several examples:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.</strong> &quot;I experienced ritual abuse, or MKULTRA type abuse. I saw the trafficking of children in cages myself. I saw murder. I was given drugs and I experienced near drowning. I saw others tortured and die. I saw rape, experienced sexual abuse. I was used in child porn. I saw birth, I saw abortion. I saw people cut open, I saw worse. I was electroshocked and I was terrified of masks, and people in costumes. I was utterly traumatized to the point that I had hysterical fits that looked like seizures. I was to the point of being in altered states with names. I thought I had a different family. My life has been severely affected by these events. Years of time have been taken away from me by regression and PTSD/DID.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> &quot;My name is Eleazar Solomon at mizrach612 at HOT, if anyone wants to contact me.  I knew Donald James Hamrick (AKA Zeera Charnoe) personally. His private psychotherapist was Dr Joseph G(r)oss in NYC. Hamrick was an agent of the CIA, and was part of an orchestrated CIA experiment with middle class youth involving a commune (HARBINGER HOT SPRINGS) with free sex and drugs supplied by the CIA. The operation was called CHAOS and also PROJECT ONE. Rooms had two-way mirrors installed, and all phones were tapped to provide direct input into the CIA controlled OP.﻿</p>
<p>Virtually no one knew, or was even aware of the Project, except possibly John Wester, who was HAMRICKS’ closest aide for a number of years, and who knew HAMRICKS’ CIA contacts were and the nature of the MK-ULTRA experiment. The Vice President of IBM, LOU MOBLEY was Hamricks\' CIA handler, and MARION PETTIE, the head of a CIA front org, known as THE FINDERS, was a frequent visitor to the HARBINGER COMPOUND. The whole experiment involved a secret GOVERNMENT GROUP called the 5412 GROUP. Hamrick was deeply involved in this experiment, and clearly knew of the CIA providing drugs, providing money for many things, including the drugs&quot; (Harbin.10).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Early on in the Pizzagate investigation, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HarbinHotSprings/comments/5gqrq9/the_beginning/">a group of researchers found that several new age centers in the United States and the Commonwealth were linked to Tavistock</a>, a British program run out of London and which appears to also have its hand in the lives of several Comet Ping Pong members and Tony Podesta (<a href="http://svvordfish.blogspot.ca/2018/01/explosive-new-evidence-links-tony.html">see my Tavistock exposé here</a>). </p>
<p>More testimony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spanning from Anon’s testimony and its ties to Harbin Hot Springs, we have uncovered a network of ritual abuse, child trafficking and evidence of Project MKULTRA taking place at institutions ranging from Harbin Hot Springs and Esalen Institute in CA through Ecstatic living, HAI Global and the Human Potential Movement through to The Haven in Canada, Findhorn in Scotland and more. These organizations are tied via the International Holistic Centers Gathering to the United Nations via the Findhorn Foundation, GEN, and Kitezh orphanage and Ecologia Youth Trust. They also share mutual ties and ancestry through the Psychosynthesis Institute, Teens &amp; Toddlers and ARK (a part of the Clinton Foundation) with Tavistock, the Huxleys and Military Intelligence in Britain and the US. Psychosynthesis’ founder then ties back through Alice Bailey to Lucis Trust and finally returns to the occult foundations of the UN.</p>
<p>We have just begun to develop this investigation based on publicly available information. Every link we found important has been archived, but there is so much more out there. We did our best to archive enough so that this investigation can continue without obfuscation. We are asking for help and more eyes on this topic to to see if more proof can be found of any illicit activity by these groups. This may be a piece of the architecture behind pizzagate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So on top of <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2422007">Podesta\'s links to ARK</a>, we now have another member of the same insider group visiting a \'Tavistock\' location. </p>
<hr />
<p>Sasha Lord also shows up at ANOTHER place linked to ritual abuse--Yogaville in Virginia. Although its reputation is not patently horrible, victims have come forward saying almost identical &quot;mind-control&quot; activities were occurring there. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtc.com/a/NZdCSfw">Photos at the Ashram</a></p>
<p><a href="https://culteducation.com/group/1243-yogaville/26485-integral-yoga-institute-yogaville-a-father-s-story.html">This account shows that adherents were subject to psychological intimidation bordering on mind control</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/jun/14us.htm">This article from 1999 provides three separate testimonies collected by cult researched Rick Ross:</a>
&quot;Satchidananda has harmed a lot of people, traumatized many followers, destroyed and ruined a lot of families. Many people call him a cult leader,&quot; Ross alleged.  &quot;He misrepresented himself, took advantage of these women in vulnerable positions and he says he\'s supposedly celibate but he\'s not,&quot; Ross added.  Ross said when he visited the ashram with the parents of the student, he found &quot;the worst case of mind control&quot; he had ever seen. The student, whose name is withheld at the request of her family, did not speak independently and seemed to be coached by responding to secret signs by her &quot;captors,&quot; he said. The family was unable to meet with her privately, he added.</p>
<p>While definitely not a reliable source, allegedly &quot;unhinged&quot; theorist <a href="http://www.gangstalkingmindcontrolcults.com/from-ufo-cults-to-911/">Nico Haupt claimed Yogaville was a Tavistock/OSS mind-control hub</a>, which has been my theory about Comet since late 2016. </p>

<p>Sasha Lord also visits Voodoo Doughnuts in Seattle - <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1525813">A lot written on VOAT about the chain.</a></p>',

            This article from 1999 provides three separate testimonies collected by cult researched Rick Ross:
           </a>
           "Satchidananda has harmed a lot of people, traumatized many followers, destroyed and ruined a lot of families. Many people call him a cult leader," Ross alleged.  "He misrepresented himself, took advantage of these women in vulnerable positions and he says he's supposedly celibate but he's not," Ross added.  Ross said when he visited the ashram with the parents of the student, he found "the worst case of mind control" he had ever seen. The student, whose name is withheld at the request of her family, did not speak independently and seemed to be coached by responding to secret signs by her "captors," he said. The family was unable to meet with her privately, he added.

            I was surprised nobody has made a "fictional" movie based on pizzagate, until I realized they're all jews. I'd have thought a jew would throw a lucifierian under the bus for a few shekels. Unless of course jew=lucifer .....  hmmmm

            Awesome work Swordfish.  Sasha Lord's name has been around forever in the club circles.  She's a MK sex kitten.  I'm not surprised to see her name popping up with The Standard.

             TUTOR /PERINNI/BLUM/DIFI CONNECTION:
"The Tutor Perini Corporation came under fire earlier this year, for submitting a bid for the California High Speed Rail construction that would have been rejected under the original criteria of the project, but HSR Authority officials changed the bid specifications. Critics also point to the appearance of cronyism for the Tutor Perini Corporation for having past connections to the husband of California Senator Diane Feinstein, Richard Blum.  “Blum first became involved with what is now Tutor Perini in 1998 when he joined with Ronald Tutor to help recapitalize the troubled company. He reportedly sold his stock at a substantial profit in 2005.”  Critics of the Blum/Perini connection echo parallel criticisms you hear from the far-left political organizations about Dick Cheney’s affiliation with Halliburton.  They fear past connections will fuel future decisions."
