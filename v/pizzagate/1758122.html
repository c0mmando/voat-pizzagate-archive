<p>And so I present to you.... A sign that ALWAYS, without fail, gets someone\'s attention. A warning/danger sign! </p>

<p>Next, print theses signs, 4 per page onto the labels, and attach them to the post or pump <a href="http://imgur.com/a/f18Ct">http://imgur.com/a/f18Ct</a> at a gas station. </p>

<p>And that\'s it, you\'re done.</p>

<p>I\'ll admit, some would consider this to be vandalizing a property, but in my opinion, it\'s just a sticker that can be peeled off, and it\'s potentially going to save 100s of thousands of lives eventually. That\'s enough to get me motivated and just not care. So to take this plan into action, go get $5 worth of gas at 5 or 6 gas pumps instead of just filling up at one pump. Place a sticker on each pump or the pole near the pump that you use. Bingo. That\'s it!!!</p>

            I love the idea. Since you are looking to mass produce, I am providing a version that has been tweaked to be syntactically correct (four changed items are in bold):
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The
            </strong>
            media
            <strong>
             are
            </strong>
            covering up the largest scandal known to date. It's a
            <strong>
             centuries-old
            </strong>
            tradition of pedophilia that continues even to this day. Political elites are blackmailed into positions of power to fuel this epidemic. These same people are running our nation's largest media outlets and have no
            <strong>
             intention
            </strong>
            of admitting the truth. These organizations believe that you will never look for yourself. Hundreds of thousands of children are dying every year.  Investigate #Pedogate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think "The" is better than "Our" as the media lies extend everywhere...US, UK, Australia. This is an international problem.
           </p>
           <p>
            Great work!

            TIP - Put the sticker lightly on your clothing first, then it can be peeled off without leaving goo &amp; tape buggers.
That way if you get caught you can just peel it off and walk away.
This is the kind of guerilla exposure campaign that will be required to overcome goliath's massive media brainwashing network of fake news outlets spewing lies 24/7. We need to take it to the streets in a peaceful and respectful way, shame the bastards so they never leave the house!
Also you can print these on plain paper and put under windshield wipers, etc, it costs even less and more direct to the consumer so to speak...

            nice initiative but dont you think organizing worldwide protests at the same time can have a greater impact in awareness , being called fakenews, etc ? i think it has more impact then flyers.

             This is more realistic. Worldwide protests are absolutely necessary, but at this point, we can't wait around for it to happen. This sign effort literally takes minutes out of your day. This is a low effort , medium impact objective, as compared to an organized protest being a high effort, high impact objective

              yes im not saying you should'nt make signs /flyers , but maybe hand them out while protesting ?
             </p>
             <p>
              if you think about it , you cannot wait for the establishment to come around the corner with the solution :
yeah most of you people didnt know this , but there were allot of pedos &amp; we took care of it ...  since they made this possible for a very long long time.
if you look at the "narrative" being held up here on voat , its one of no real progress , but rather sit &amp; wait for the establishment to come with the solution while
meanwhile reading reposts of reposts over and over of the same stuff. so only signs/flyers is realistic if you want to wait for the solution in my opinion.

            Very good idea. LOVE the bathroom stall angle. That's a definite place I'll be placing these. Go into the bathroom of every single store that you visit, and place one into every stall. Brilliant!

            Gas station is a good idea. This is moment when man pulls the trigger (gas pump) and his brain goes into a no mans land, seeking action. The sign prompts him to do initiatte noble cause. (I don't know women's psychology ) Gas station will definately work for men!

            Really think that gas pumps are a bad idea -- especially using the "DANGER" angle - might frighten people and doubt that gas stations would be too happy with it --
           </p>
           <p>
            but also on chance that people might not recall "pedo-gate" reference, I think there should be some mention of 
human child trafficking.  If they go to the internet they will find a lot of info on human trafficking.

             Rest area bathrooms are a good place to put stickers. No cameras.  Plus put some info with the brochures.

            Not crazy about stickers.  Over the years I have noticed them here, there, and everywhere but never pay any mind to them. In everyday transit, I am pretty much focused on either where I need to be, what I need to do, and coming home. I think the flyer delivery to mailboxes in the immediate area where we live is a great idea.  Of course, agreement would need to be reached that all flyers say the same thing.  A small committee, perhaps, chosen by app administrators, to draft?  There's no way to police it after the fact, so the honor system comes into play.  Also, has anybody ever utilized the below-listed website to deliver a mass phone message?  I have not.  Just wondering if that could be an option.

             Im just guessing here, but I thought mailboxes were a nono. You would look like you're stealing mail, and that's a felony. I may be wrong, but that's just my thought.

              The mailbox is a no-no. However there is a advertising box underneath normally. You are free to put whatever you want in those. But no guarantee anyone will read it as its all basically junk mail.

            We need to make up FAKE $100 bills and leave them on the ground.  There are religious organizations that do this and when people see it, they think it is real money and snatch it up, only to be served with The Word!
           </p>
           <p>
            Same idea....  Fake $100's with a message of #PizzaGate. 
Hell...  we could staged a fake event where we throw buckets of money off the top of a building downtown...  it'd probably make the news.

             Only problem I see in this is, that when someone thinks he finds a $100 bill only to realise it's a fake, he will probably feel pranked and will rather be mad at whoever did this to him and this will lower chances he will be open to whatever it is about.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just imagine the emotional rollercoaster some people will go through the moment they think they find money, only to realise it's fake the next moment. Some would probably just come here to say "FUCK YOU FOR DOING THIS!" :/

            I have two text revision suggestions:
           </p>
           <p>
            "It's a centuries old tradition of pedophilia
            <strong>
             by elites
            </strong>
            that continues to this day."
           </p>
           <p>
            And then there's this sentence:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Hundreds of thousands of children are dying every year."
           </p>
           <p>
            I would take suggestions on revising this sentence. Do we really have evidence that hundreds of thousands of children in the U.S. are dying every year (perhaps worldwide, but the focus in the statement is only the U.S., and that's what it seems to suggest). Hundreds of thousands of children in the U.S. may be sexually exploited every year by traffickers and pornographers, but at least some of that is the target of investigation and isn't "out of bounds" because of the apparent involvement of too many elites. So how many children might be victimized by elite pedophiles? Do we have any real idea? It's important to have generally accurate numbers or else come up with other statements without numbers.

            Great post OP.  And really good comments and ideas here too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's my contribution:
           </p>
           <p>
            If you saw an envelope marked personal and confidential, would you pick it up? If you want PG to spread like gossip, you need to treat it like gossip.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take some copies of news articles or other redpill material and put it in an envelope. Mark it confidential.
           </p>
           <p>
            Include a vague note (or a detailed memo) that refers to the secrecy of the information contained within. Entice people to find out more, all under the guise that the info is secret.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then let human nature take over.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Wikileaks info would be great here since msm told people it was illegal to look at WL. )
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to entertain yourself, set it up like a prank.  Accidentally leave it places like Starsucks.   Or leave it tucked into "secret" places. Watch to see if it gets found. Find your effective method and employ it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Place removable sticky notes in popular selling books at the dc bookstores. P0litics&amp;pr0se??? Hide them like Easter eggs.  Just a sticky note placed unobtrusively in a book to be found later...remember that a majority of shoppers are just sheeple or tourists who are not in on the secret.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Tourists are a great way to spread information like a virvs. )
           </p>
           <p>
            Target their customer base.  Quietly and Low key.
           </p>
           <p>
            No pushy in your face. Be Sneaky.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tailor messages to book themes. Leave links to relevant threads or websites.  Example: a link to a Deddit/pol thread that has a discussion about PG and a link to voat left in a political book.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can do this easily without much fear of getting caught. Take some friends. See who can tag the most books without getting caught.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if the gig is up, what are they going to do? Report that you are disseminating info without a permit?  (Use removable sticky notes, not labels!) play it off as a prank. Or make a big deal on social media so you can promote the contents of the sticky note.
           </p>
           <p>
            No outlandish claims like this: "you must believe or mankind is doomed! Stop PG!"
            <br/>
            (Yes, you do sound like a kook saying this. )
           </p>
           <p>
            We want regular people to start asking the questions. Taking a closer look. Holding their children closer. Determining their own understanding of how the cps system works. Seeing the alarming articles about cps corruption. And asking questions. Holding the legal system more accountable or at least questioning the status quo.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm guessing that there really are regular people who really don't know that they live in a leech infested swamp. I'm sure the local news isn't reporting it.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a prime redpill targ3t group.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those who enjoy a little rush, use a #pg marked bill at vood00 Nonuts. Use it like you don't know what it means. Play dumb. If you are refused there is always social media. For goodness sake, DO NOT go to cpp. Acquire new targrets.

            Yes, but it's #PizzaGate.  Or both #PizzaGate and #PedoGate.  Anyone who uses ONLY #PedoGate is an obvious Alefantis shill.

               I just find it easier to use one and if I pick one it's going to be the big one that has less baggage.  I don't care if other people use either.  I also just was responding to an absolutist statement that was ridiculous.

             If crooks can openly place credit card skimmers on pumps, switch the hoses around on pumps, snatch purses right out of cars, steal cars, etc, I'm pretty sure nobody's going to get caught palming a sticker on a gas pump.  Place it on the side that the attendant is least likely to see.
            </p>
            <p>
             Doing it over and over, however, may be a different story.

            I don't know about doing this at gas stations, especially the pumps. Considering what the pumps are, expensive equipment owned by corporations for pumping out a highly flammable liquid, I'd stay away from attaching stickers to them. There are certainly cameras there, and while it's not dangerous, the gas stations (pedo-defenders for sure) could have the book thrown at you.
           </p>
           <p>
            But these stickers could be placed anywhere, including in parking lots, on light poles, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            The sticker design is very good, too, but I would suggest maybe soliciting some suggestions on reworking the message a bit. It's not at all easy putting what pedogate/pizzagate means into a few sentences, and this paragraph while not bad, in my opinion, could still be made more clear, and having a group working on it is likely to result in the best paragraph. For instance, a problem I see is that it's not really clear that elites are both some of the pedophiles and the ones covering it up. It's a complicated matter because probably elite pedophiles do cover up for some non-elites (their "lesser partners," those who work for them), and other elites who aren't pedophiles are probably helping to cover up for those who are, for a variety of reasons.

             Great suggestions. I'm no marketing guru, so absolutely I think people should step in and clean up the wording and still get the message across. This was a first attempt, no proofreading, type of thing that I threw together in about 10 minutes after having the idea. I'll edit my post asking for suggestions on wording. Thanks for the input!

              You're welcome. And you really did a great job, especially in just a short time. It doesn't look like a rush job at all, and the use of a "warning" sign on mailing labels is a great idea.

            <strong>
             The media is not reporting on the most explosive and pervasive scandal we will come to understand in our lifetime.  It is the force behind the fact that our government and other institutions continuously fail us - a large percentage of Congress and federal power players in DC are blackmailed with the most degrading material that it is possible to produce - child pornography.  Children are trafficked as sex slaves at unprecedented levels in the United States and abroad, and some are harvested for their organs.  The criminals in the government who do this are able to control the media and are sure you will never find out about this or look for yourself.  Huge numbers of children suffer every day trapped in this life and tens of thousands every year die from abuse or are sacrificed.  AWARENESS IS RISING.             Investigate #Pedogate

              Sounds good.  Another day to get it right is worth it.  Can't you quickly edit your submission, say there is a misspelling and that you will reporst later with a better graphic?

                your focus is on the media, what is going to catch attention is simply the answer to the question - why is the government always crazy?  offering an answer to that will I think get even more people curious.  Everyone experiences that, while most people still think the media is sort of ok.    AWARENESS IS RISING at the end of my suggestion might get people to look who dismiss the whole thing as crazy from the start - skeptics may be interested in how far this is spreading.

                Does the text I offered actually fit in your graphic or would it need to be cut down?  thanks for your trouble.

            we must remember that there is good pedophilia and bad. The good is consensual by  child and his or her parents. The bad is forced or  extorted.  There is no  evidence that the good pedophilia is harmful. Rather it is beneficial.

              Human beings consent from day one of their existence. It is our job to try to understand what they are saying and help to satisfy their desire. Kids can't consent in your mind only because you refuse to see the communications they are trying to make. Before 2 kids can't talk but they use body language. If you are blind you cannot see. Being "underdeveloped" does not mean a child is not a sexual being and that it has not right to sexual contact. Since when does someone have to be "developed" in order to do something they want to do and that will not hurt them? You imply this the this state of being "underdeveloped" means sexual contact will be harmful, but that is not necessarily so. Everyone loves in their own way. Let's let the kids decide. And yes, it is love. Your attempt to deny logical and factual argument by name-calling does not change reality.

            I've been doing this with QR codes for the past few months, but I think this could be more effective because it entices someone a little harder to look into it. The QR codes I've been doing lead people here, but this sign will hopefully get them interested enough which will inevitably lead them to Voat.

             The QR code idea is great.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is why.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can link to a TinyURL... that redirects to here.
            </p>
            <p>
             TinyURL tracks stats (if you are logged in). That gives us metrix.
            </p>
            <p>
             And for the truly lazy way to get stickers, get 'em printed over the internet at a printer like this:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.uprinting.com/custom-sticker-printing.html">
              http://www.uprinting.com/custom-sticker-printing.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The best part is a QR code sticker probably will stay on a gas pump forever. It is like a secret code hidden in plain site. Gas ''n Go employees will think it is some sort of government inspection sticker.
            </p>
            <p>
             Brilliant.
            </p>
            <p>
             Love the idea.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would even include this wording at the top:
