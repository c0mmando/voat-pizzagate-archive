5.) One of Clay Rockefeller\'s Instagram posts is of a collection of his dead father\'s handkerchiefs.  Out of all the objects to remember his father by, he chose his father\'s handkerchiefs (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPgzQnXhirM/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BPgzQnXhirM/)</a>).  Handkerchiefs, which Pizzagate researchers assert is used in a ritual on top of which an infant is raped by an adult, is central to one of the Podesta Wikileaks emails published by Wikileaks (<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/32795)</a>).
6.)  Manya Kay makes reference to cages (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BKRtY9ahL5L">https://www.instagram.com/p/BKRtY9ahL5L)</a>), which are often a feature of memories retrieved by trauma-based mind control victims such as Chris de Nicola, a human subject used for experiments in readiation, drugs, and mind control who was often tied down in cages.  See transcript of her testimony before Congress in the 90s here (search cage) <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/wolf3.html#DeNicola1">http://www.whale.to/b/wolf3.html#DeNicola1</a>.

7.) Nicky Hilton Rothschild is not only married to a Rothschild, one of the more powerful Illuminati bloodlines, but she herself is bloodlined.  She is the 20th cousin of Queen Elizabeth (<a href="http://www.findmypast.com/content/Hilary-Duff-Named-Most-Royal-Celeb">http://www.findmypast.com/content/Hilary-Duff-Named-Most-Royal-Celeb</a>, search Paris Hilton) and a relative of King Henry II (<a href="http://www.eonline.com/shows/the_royals/news/633009/ellen-degeneres-is-kate-middleton-s-cousin-and-more-celebs-you-didn-t-know-were-royalty">http://www.eonline.com/shows/the_royals/news/633009/ellen-degeneres-is-kate-middleton-s-cousin-and-more-celebs-you-didn-t-know-were-royalty</a>, search Paris Hilton), both of whom are descendants of the Merovingian Bloodline (<a href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/merovingians/merovingios_02.htm">https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/merovingians/merovingios_02.htm)</a>), one of the 13 Illuminati Bloodlines.

The cat (and leopard print clothing) is occult symbolism for the sex kitten alter.  Nicky Hilton has made the public admission that she is obsessed with cats (<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2815524/Feline-good-Cat-obsessed-Nicky-Hilton-steps-favourite-kitty-shoes-thigh-skimming-leopard-print-skirt.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2815524/Feline-good-Cat-obsessed-Nicky-Hilton-steps-favourite-kitty-shoes-thigh-skimming-leopard-print-skirt.html)</a>).</p>

            The instagram called "snack time" showing a little girl lying on the couch with her skirt up and no food in sight sends up a red flag.  Why call a picture like this snack time?

            I don't know why people would put naked pictures of their toddlers on the Internet. WTF is wrong with people. Maybe they naiively do not realize or refuse to acknowledge that there are child predator pedos out there... maybe they are into it themelves. The spread legs shots are something a child should be taught not to do especially on camera and to tell a trusted adult if anyone tries to have them do it...That behavior should definitely not be encouraged. 
* and I agree sauce is definitely referring to alcohol here. The child is sitting at a counter that looks like a bar, in front of a glass.

            I'm as much an opponent of the overprivelaged elite as anyone, but i honestly do not perceive anything sexual about those instagram pictures. You need to get some fresh air, man. They are pretty normal photos that parents take of their kids while they're acting dumb or being cute.

            The history lesson was interesting though.

             The photos alone, on a normal persons instagram might be OK. On the other hand the comments by elites are highly disturbing.

            There is nothing wrong with the first 4 pictures. 
Sauce is also slang for alcohol (hence the wine glass)

            Just to point out, hitting the sauce is a common phrase that refers to drinking alcohol, and there is a glass of wine in the photo. More concerning is the appearance of dark circles under the kids eyes, raccoon eyes is always cause for concern of abuse.

              I didn't say it was a normal situation, situation is strange, just that the use of word sauce in the comment wasn't necessarily anything besides the common usage, it's not like the "dominos on cheese or pasta" stuff that makes no sense except as code...

              paste the url in the red box and click save page. The ones I checked had alread been saved.

             I highly agree.  The sauce comment could have to do with the glass of wine but some of the other photos are highly suspect and too provocative especially the first ones.  The poses are not appropriate.  Not at all.  These people are very tricky as well when they comment and remark.  The first link of the girl with her dress raised is really disgusting imo.
