<blockquote>
<p>The first whistleblower to go public with allegations branding shameless Kevin Spacey a sexual predator is dead — and her grieving family is demanding answers!</p>
<p>Now, in a world exclusive, RadarOnline.com can reveal investigators have launched a murder probe into Linda Culkin’s mysterious death, while 59-year-old Spacey faces a felony charge of indecent assault and battery for allegedly groping a young man in Nantucket, Mass., in 2016.</p>
<p>On Feb. 25, Culkin was walking to her home when she was mowed down by a Toyota as she stepped into a busy intersection, Quincy Police Capt. John Dougan told Radar. She later died at Boston Medical Center.</p>
<p>“Linda was one of the first to accuse Kevin Spacey of attacking young men, and I find it very odd that you don’t hear anything more about her accident — or about the person who hit her,” said Culkin’s cousin Cindy, 60. “It’s like it happened, and now there is nothing!”</p>
<p>Culkin, a nursing assistant with mental problems, began cyberstalking and terrorizing Spacey and his team in 2009 after one of her young male patients told her the details of an alleged attack by the American Beauty actor.</p>
<p>In 2014, she was sentenced to 51 months behind bars after pleading guilty in federal court to sending harassing emails, making fake bomb threats and mailing an envelope containing white powder to Spacey’s associates.</p>
<p>But four years later, Spacey’s career went up in smoke after actor Anthony Rapp broke decades of silence to charge that the actor tried to molest him at age 14.</p>

            Had a heart attack, yet the doctors said he was in good health.

            makes an excellent point.
           </p>
           <p>
            Kevin Spacy’s character murders a whistle blower in House of Cards by shoving them in front of a car.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember that Renegade Anon said that Hollywood is run like a mob, thus murder via “suicide”/“accident” is the norm.
           </p>
           <p>
            Possible “life imitates art” style kill.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recall that Judith Barsi died via a likely life imitates art death. Her character in Fatal Visions was “murdered by her father along with her mother”. Keep in mind that Steven Spielberg’s agent was BOTH the producer of Fatal Visions and a founding member of CAA, a talent agency known for covering up the evil deeds of Hollywood.
           </p>
           <p>
            tl:dr, Culkin being murdered is very plausible of we go by the “art imitates life” theory.

             darkknight111 .....my son worked with the mentally ill and violent teen agers.... He was killed last Sept. by a hit and run drunk driver. I believe in some psychics and mediums.....although, I think the most popular ones are usually taking money from gullible people. ....have even heard if the gift is used wrongly, it just vanishes. Anyway, after his death , I used a medium ...very inexpensive , I might add. My son, Buddy , said he was murdered by the govt. I asked who. He said state and CIA. He was a chip off the old block, me. The kids he was working with are in the heart of mkultra country, piedmont of NC. Duke hospital &amp; Ft Bragg are close by.....lots and lots of mental patients and prisoners to use.

              We have known about these security companies for years, they have been around for a long time. So long that there was even an episode of Colombo about it.

              There most likely is a murder industry in hollywood. I suspect that a lot of the drug overdoses are not accidents, but deliberate murder.

              This can't go on forever, and maybe, just maybe, someone will fuck up and the whole thing gets becomes public knowledge.

               Interesting. Do you think there’s any ties between Black Cube and Spielberg/Geffen?

                Steven spielberg was connected to that episode of columbo about the private eyes that killed the newspaper magnates wife because they were trying to control the newspaper...

                My understanding is that black cube was a more recent company, but it is far from a new business model. Executive decisions was that british mercenary company that was hired by the tory party to stage a coup in equatorial guinea. Mark Thatcher, margret thatcher's son, was convicted of financing this, and got a 4 year suspended sentence.

                The Bushs established black water, which later became academi, and they had ties to both the oil industry and the CIA.

               <p>
                Now why am i bringing all this crap up?
                <strong>
                 These companies have to make money somehow when they are not doing government work, and doing dirty work for rich and powerful people gives black mail information to the government
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                It's a stretch at first, but when you look over the history of those pmcs and investigative companies, it makes too much sense. Remember, that the secret service used to be the Pinkerton detective agency. It is a  direction of research, but it is an extremely dark direction of research.
