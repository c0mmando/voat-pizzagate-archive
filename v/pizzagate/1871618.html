<p><strong>Following on from my previous posts on the Child Mind Institute (CMI):</strong></p>
<p>The address of CMI is <strong>445 Park Avenue, New York</strong> which, it turns out, is owned by one of the world’s richest people <strong>Lily Safra</strong>.  Lily has had four husbands and a very colourful past.  Her Wikipedia entry is worth reading in it’s entirety.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Safra">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Safra</a></p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In 1976, [Lily] married husband 4, <strong>Edmond Safra</strong>. The prominent banker was of Jewish Lebanese (Mizrahi) origin and a naturalized Brazilian citizen. He founded Republic National Bank of New York. The couple divided their time among homes in New York City, Monaco, Geneva, and the Villa Leopolda on the French Riviera.  Safra was killed in Monaco in a fire that was determined to be arson.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Guardian did an interesting piece on him, well worth reading. Too many details for this page: <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/oct/29/features.magazine47">The Strange Case of Edmond Safra</a></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Excerpt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As far back as 1957, Edmond Safra was named as a drug trafficker in a US Bureau of Narcotics report. The accusation was later withdrawn, but until his death Safra was the inspiration for countless unsubstantiated rumours that linked him to drug, gold and currency trafficking, money laundering and organised crime.</em></p>
<p><em>In the 80s, Safra and Republic were the targets of a global whispering campaign. Among the allegations that surfaced in a variety of mostly obscure publications was the suggestion that he was involved in the Iran-Contra affair; that he arranged the murder of a security specialist who had supposedly discovered a link between him and the arms-for-hostages scandal; that he had double-crossed the Medellin cocaine cartel; that he was a confrère of mafia legend Mayer Lansky; and that Republic had laundered the drug-trafficking profits of Panama\'s General Noriega.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in this article ... (<a href="http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1996/eirv23n44-19961101/eirv23n44-19961101_057-george_karlweiss_and_the_rothsch.pdf">http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1996/eirv23n44-19961101/eirv23n44-19961101_057-george_karlweiss_and_the_rothsch.pdf)</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Safra is under investigation by U.S. and Swiss authorities for laundering Turkish and Colombian drug money. In 1990, Safra\'s Trade Development Bank (TDB) of Geneva was merged with de Picciotto\'s CBI to create the CBI-TDB Union Banque Privee. The details of the merger are shrouded in secrecy to this day. As part of the deal, de Picciotto became a board member of American Express Bank (Switzerland) SA of Geneva, and two American Express Bank of New York executives sit on the board of de Picciotto\'s Union Banque Privee. Safra had sold his Trade Development Bank to American Express, Inc. in the 1980s. <strong>Henry Kissinger</strong> sits on the board of American Express, Inc., which has repeatedly been implicated in international money-laundering scandals.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From her Wikipedia biography, Lily Safra’s art collection  and enormous body of philanthropic work is described, including the creation of the <strong>Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences at the Hebrew University</strong>. As a member of the Friends of Hebrew University of Jerusalem, her involvement and attendance at an awards event at <strong>Campus Biotech Geneva</strong> was described in<a href="http://www.leisureopportunities.co.uk/detail.cfm?pagetype=detail&amp;subject=news&amp;codeID=327208"> this article</a>:</p>

<p>Lily Safra is also patron of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_and_Homes_for_Children">Hope and Homes for children</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hope and Homes for Children (HHC) is a British registered charity working with children, their families and communities across 8 countries in Central and Eastern Europe and Africa. Mark Cook founded the charity[28] and was awarded several honours including an OBE and a Heart of Gold award from <strong>Esther Rantzen</strong>; Caroline Cook was also appointed an OBE.</p>

<p>Now on to <strong>Aaron Swartz</strong>. </p>
<p>Aaron was a  research fellow with the <strong>Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard</strong> (which is chaired by Lily Safra).</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://theunhivedmind.com/news/2016/12/19/hero-aaron-swartz-exposing-elite-child-abuse/">HERO AARON SWARTZ; EXPOSING ELITE CHILD ABUSE</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>From 2003 till 2009, Yoichi Shimatsu worked on-and-off in Cambodia with an international team of anti-pedophilia activists.
“The team came to Cambodia following up on a slew of leads, including photos of naked infants taken by Newsweek Tokyo bureau chief Bernard Krisher on display at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Hong Kong, a den of pedophiles connected with the Jimmy Savile case.</em> </p>
<p><em>Reportedly, an orphanage was used for child abuse.</em></p>
<p><em>“The Cambodian police shut down the orphanage’s satellite-link tower, which was being used to uplink child-porn videos and connect American pedophiles to their little sweethearts.</em></p>
<p><em>“The teachers told me that computers and satellite communication system were installed and maintained by Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of the MIT Media Lab.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Director of the Edmond Safra Center for Ethics at the time that Aaron was there was<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig"> Lawrence Lessig</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In May 2005, it was revealed that Lessig had experienced sexual abuse by the director at the American Boychoir School, which he had attended as an adolescent.[90] Lessig reached a settlement with the school in the past, under confidential terms. He revealed his experiences in the course of representing another student victim, John Hardwicke, in court</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excerpt from <strong><a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/12061/index7.html">The Choirboy</a></strong>  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Lessig once told me a story about the summer after he left the Boychoir School. Hanson invited him to take a trip to the Hanson family compound in Canada. Lessig badly wanted to go. But his mother said no, and when Lessig asked why, she said, “I don’t know, there’s something weird about this.” Lessig threw a titanic fit. “I screamed, slammed the door, walked out of the house,” he said. “I came back three hours later, and we never said anything about it ever again.” Lessig paused. “They knew.”</em></p>
<p><em>So if they knew—that is, they know—isn’t keeping it from them a charade?</em></p>
<p><em>“You underestimate the power of the human mind to ignore things that aren’t placed right in front of you,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be such a successful charade to succeed in not forcing them into this deeply depressing, painful recognition of not taking steps to protect your kid.”</em></p>

            <em>
             Lessig once told me a story about the summer after he left the Boychoir School. Hanson invited him to take a trip to the Hanson family compound in Canada. Lessig badly wanted to go. But his mother said no, and when Lessig asked why, she said, “I don’t know, there’s something weird about this.” Lessig threw a titanic fit. “I screamed, slammed the door, walked out of the house,” he said. “I came back three hours later, and we never said anything about it ever again.” Lessig paused. “They knew.”

             So if they knew—that is, they know—isn’t keeping it from them a charade?

             “You underestimate the power of the human mind to ignore things that aren’t placed right in front of you,” he said. “It doesn’t have to be such a successful charade to succeed in not forcing them into this deeply depressing, painful recognition of not taking steps to protect your kid.”

            Sorry but that Yoichi Shimatsu article is just wrong. Yes, MIT did set up a Media Lab in Cambodia but it's in Robib, which is a tiny village with no running water and no telecommuncations infrastructure (at that time). It was set up to do tele-medicine. The information is/was downloaded and transferred by motorbike to the nearest village with internet.
            <br/>
            Child pornography (at the highest level) was being sent out of Cambodia in the diplomatic black bags.

            Seems to be quite the (((echo))) in here. Try the coincidence detector. Site is down right now, but should be back up some time.
