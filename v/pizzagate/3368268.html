<h1 id="md-sex-cult-founder-alleged-followers-tied-to-experimental-schools-for-children-still-operating-internationally">Sex Cult Founder, Alleged Followers Tied To Experimental Schools For Children Still Operating Internationally</h1>
<ul>
<li>A childhood education program created by convicted NXIVM sex cult leader Keith Raniere is still operating in France, Guatemala and the United Kingdom.</li>
<li>Raniere founded Rainbow Cultural Garden (RCG) in 2006, claiming it would teach children as young as 2 years old up to seven languages simultaneously.</li>
<li>Many of Raniere’s NXIVM adherents, including his alleged financier Sara Bronfman-Igtet, are deeply involved in the operations of the active RCG schools in France and the U.K.</li>
</ul>
<p>The convicted leader of the notorious NXIVM sex cult concocted an experimental child development program that’s still operating internationally, a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation has found.</p>
<p>But cult expert Rick Alan Ross, who has studied NXIVM for more than 15 years, said RCG had nothing to do with teaching languages to children. (RELATED: Former ‘Smallville’ Actress Pleads Guilty To Criminal Activity After Being Part Of Alleged Sex Cult)</p>
<p>“It wasn’t about language. It was about indoctrinating children to be like him. He was the prototype and he was always interested in cloning himself and perpetuating his ideas,” Ross told the DCNF. “So to think that it was only ever simply about being multilingual is incredibly naïve. It was never just about that. It was about him, his philosophy and perpetuating his world view.” </p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors recognized Rainbow Cultural Garden LLC, a Delaware business entity, as being affiliated with Raniere and his teachings in a May 2018 court filing. RCG schools that operated in the U.S. have all ceased operation or, in the case of its Miami franchise, local authorities shut them down for operating as an unlicensed child-care facility.</p>
<p>But despite Raniere’s conviction, his adherents continue to propagate his multilingual educational methods in programs active in France and Guatemala, and it maintains a presence in the United Kingdom, the DCNF’s investigation found.</p>
<p>Recently Launched French School Has Numerous Ties To NXIVM</p>
<p>RCG lives on in France through a company called Athal Education Group, which Sara Bronfman-Igtet and her husband, Basit Igtet, founded and financed, the French news outlet Le Dauphine reported in December 2018.</p>
<p>Bronfman-Igtet is an heir to the Seagram liquor fortune. Her sister, Clare Bronfman, pleaded guilty in April to charges related to her role in NXIVM. Trusts and bank accounts the Bronfman sisters controlled bankrolled Raniere to the tune of $150 million from 2004 through 2010, Vanity Fair reported.</p>
<p>In December 2018, Athal launched its “Campus Beyond The School” program, which it claims will guide children as young as 2 years old to master their mind, body, expression and world as they are simultaneously taught German, English, Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, French, Japanese and Russian.</p>
<p>The mayor of the French town of Apt, Dominique Santoni, was pictured standing beside Bronfman-Igtet and her husband at the inauguration of Athal’s “Campus Beyond The School,” and the town’s office of tourism helped promote Athal’s holiday camp in April and summer camp in July.</p>
<p>Athal offered to register a child to their summer camp in July when the DCNF first reached out for comment, but the company did not return multiple follow-up inquiries asking about their connection to Raniere and NXIVM.</p>
<p>Santoni, the Apt mayor, did not respond when asked if she was aware of Athal’s connection to Raniere and NXIVM.</p>
<p>A former NXIVM member, Ariella Menashy, who tried opening her own RCG school in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2011, told the DCNF that Athal’s program “100% sounds like Rainbow” and that the languages it teaches are the same ones Raniere mandated.</p>
<p>Menashy also said she interacted with Bronfman-Igtet and many of Athal’s employees during her time within NXVIM between 2007 through 2017.</p>
<p>Most notably, Menashy recalled seeing Athal founder Bronfman-Igtet regularly whenever she visited NXVIM headquarters in Albany during the 10 years she was part of the organization. She also said she saw Bronfman-Igtet’s husband once at VWeek, the cult’s annual retreat in upstate New York.</p>

<p>I just wanted to make note about this teaching of multilanguages to children, in an article written after the NXIVM trial, experts concluded that the use of multilanguages and eight or nine nannies each speaking a different language did damage to the children involved in the social experimentation. Basically, they are now developmentally slow because of the bombardment of such ridiculous measures. This article makes mention of this, but doesn\'t cite that this is proven to harm these children. Here\'s the passage referring to this indoctrination: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Former NXIVM publicist-turned-whistleblower Frank Parlato told the DCNF that the only devotees of Raniere put their children through the Rainbow Cultural Garden curriculum.</p>
<p>“I think the real thing to focus on, the real terrible thing, is that these kids are being abused,” Parlato said. “Their parents are still believers in Keith’s ideas and greatness.”</p>
<p>“These children are being raised by a series of strangers, who are not high paid, who are speaking to them in different languages every day,” Parlato said. “And the kids don’t get a rest, they don’t get the opportunity to just talk with their mother or be with their father.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder how much we\'re going to allow our next generation of children to be abused before this is stopped. The time for social experimentation is over. There is no child that is expendable anymore.</p>',

            Recently Launched French School Has Numerous Ties To NXIVM

              MALTA TODAY:  Celebrity Hollywood film director Steven Spielberg’s US$200 million yacht ‘Seven Seas’ was spotted in Malta’s Grand Harbour. The Cayman-Islands registered ocean-going vessel, complete with a navy hull, was built under the project name Y706 in collaboration with designers Nuvolari &amp; Lenard, Azure Naval Architects, and the Wright Maritime Group.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dutch shipyard Oceanco constructed the Seven Seas specifically to suit the tastes and sensibilities of the director.

             <p>
              The luxury yacht sports an infinity pool with a 15-ft. glass wall that could also be used a movie screen, so that Spielberg and his guests can enjoy a movie while taking a dip.

              <p>
               Rome based shipyard Canados Shipyard has been bought by Michel Karsenti, Yacht-Ology....Karsenti has had over 12 boats sold and produced at Canados in the past few years, including his own new brand: Oceanic Yachts. The brand was started in 2014 and Canados was contracted to build them...Canados started producing vessels for the Italian Navy, Coastguards and Italian Harbor Masters in 1946. In the mid 50’s they started focusing on the yacht market when a representative of a royal family from a small Gulf Emirate requested a yacht for His Highness.

              Last year I saw on twitter that Barbara Bush was involved with RCG in the UK. Boom. The info was deleted. And shortly thereafter she was deleted too. A gentleman highly versed in Childhood Ed. tried to talk to some of these Children and  declared they spoke in babble. As in the Tower of Babble. They could converse with no one. Just despicable. Where are you Babs?

               That's basically what the article I read said. That because of the bombardment of over eight different languages and that many different nannies, they children were developmentally slow and suffering. It said they would need extensive help for them to return to normal.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is beyond disgusting. And, again, I'm not sure why the pronouncement of known results is not cited in that article -- and not spread far and wide. It should be enough to shut those schools down and proof a powerful segment wants them open and proliferating.

               Barbara Bush? She was such an evil woman, but then look at the family she married into. The bloodline probably only worsened with her. I'll try to dig around and see if there's anything out there. But the fact these schools are operating is such a reminder that the Deep State is alive and well and thriving. Look at what's happening here and you'll see that, too. I've never seen such a mess.

                I think you will find nothing about her being involved with RCG. They surely got rid of all of it. There has also been mentioned that she is the daughter of Crowley. But I always thought she was really a man. She looked like Crowley wearing a dress.

                 Well, there goes that idea! I'm sure they scrubbed it. They have scrubbed so many things. Everything on immigration and why numbers were kept low to socialist agendas targeting the black communities going back to Paul Robeson and further, and the most disturbing, that body dysmorphia and gender identity issues being triggered by child abuse. It's the number one sign your child has been sexually abused. The split psyche (the creation of an alter) and thinking there is another person inside is another. All that is overlooked with the new methodology of actually going with it and changing the child from one sex to another rather than rooting out and dealing with the underlying problem.

                  I couldn’t have said it better. They have one goal in mind and that is a society having a sexual free for all with Our Children. May St. Michael the Archangel visit his wrath upon them as he did Satan. Satan has taken hold of this world again and must be conquered as before. Stamp his head with your foot and rid us of his evil once again.

                    NXIVM is pronounced “Nexium”. Sick, disgusting cult. Remember the Clinton Foundation child trafficking in Haiti and Laura Silsby? How about Monica Peterson’s murder while investigating it?

                    I think Babs was deeply involved. Imo she is a real fooler to many. She tried to pull off the motherly act but she didn’t fool me. She had the fetus of a miscarriage of hers on the coffee table. BARF 🤢. Using the Rainbow 🌈 is also disgusting. These people have no shame. TY for finding that. And yes the chapters in France with Macron going strong and the UK we have to work harder at this and push for a Wake Up Campaign. Monica P was another death like Seth R with a real cover up to protect their Haiti crimes. Monstrous Perverts. Possessed by the devil the lot of them.

                      My husband recently passed away. The strange things that have happened when I have lost things or needed help have made by belief even stronger in good and evil. There is an afterlife and there is a devil. Theirs will not be pleasant. What they have perpetrated upon others especially Our Children shall bite them in the asp. I have been consumed with grief and have not been saying my prayer to St Michael the Archangel but I will commence today.  The devil has been making inroads as of late. He must be stopped. At all costs.

                       Yes, it really does seem that way, but remember, The Devil scares us to make us think we can't win. Jesus triumphed over him and the world and we are Jesus' disciples. That one quotation ... something about "Be of good cheer, we've already won," has been running through my head lately. I try and try and try to keep it at the forefront, but I keep losing heart. But that's only The Devil and another of his illusions. I know it seems absolutely impossible, but listen to what our POTUS says. He says, "Enjoy the show," and that's all this is.A show and illusion to make us think they're invincible, but they're not. They had key people in place, that's all. The knew to control the press and the schools so all the propaganda is making us think it's a different landscape out there ... a different temperature. It's not. We do have the power and more and more people are furious and taking to posting videos about the outrage over the lies the press and politicians are telling. That's what's going on. Humble, common folk like us are getting together and saying no more. They love children as much as we do and there's no way they'll go along with an elite pedo cabal. Just no way.

                        You speak the truth. My mother in law always said the devil’s got hold of this world but so does Jesus. It’s another fight this time just like before. Others have fought this same battle before us and won and we can too. But what worries me is that people are more sinful nowadays and letting their Children fall by the wayside too. Way too permissive. This is what I pray for. For the Children for they are our future. God Bless Them.

                         Yes, but they were deluded and bought into the lie presented them. They were told not to discipline their children and to be their friends and that everyone who enters a contest should receive a 1st place prize. No, they should win the prize they deserved to win and sometimes that means a not nice person having more talent or running faster or excelling at a sport or on tests.

                         All they did was raise a herd of sheep ill-equipped to do anything, but retreat to their safe space. They weren't taught skills in deflecting criticism or adversity, and don't begin to know how to tackle ideas that challenge them, or God forbid, be different than theirs! Now the leaders and strategists that set this into motion did so purposefully, but the parents? Unfortunately, they did it out of a very misguided love. No one wants to say no to a child, but you have to. You've doing them a disservice by not correcting and disciplining them. There never is a need to be abusive, but firm? Yes. There's this father that I see in the neighborhood. He is so close to his son. That boy adores his dad, and while the father is an extremely nice man, he constantly corrects his child when he gets out of line. And because he does it consistently, it only takes a tweak and not a battle. It's the difference between reminding someone of what they know and trying to teach them something from the start. If you love your child, you'll teach them how to handle themselves in any situation, and that includes competition and the game of life.

                          I agree that too many are friends and not parents. This is the easy way out. I have heard many say they have seen every team member getting an award when it is only two or three that deserve the top prize. Coaches should give a speech thanking all children but only those worthy should get the trophies. Parents act horribly at games. They are setting bad examples for their Child’s future. This is not love.

                           It can spin around on a dime. We have to keep believing that. The fake media is very much to blame in passing on these false narratives. These are the people we've been taught to respect. These are our authorities. It's hard getting over that. Even now, even though I stick to indie journalism for most of my news, I always go to a ''traditional'' source to confirm an event. You have to these days. But the point is, most people are still relying on traditional news for their opinions, and if traditional news is reporting someone is a racist or colluding with Russia, most will believe it.

                            I have not had tv for 2 mo now. Moved and had to renovate. TV is on hold. I heard about shootings from a Trib email I receive. Believe me I have a filter in my head now. I don’t just believe now. My Grand mother always told me Believe only half of what you see and nothing of what you hear. I remember sitting in front of the tv during the Kennedy Assassination and 911. We all believed what the Boob Tube churned our. I think what really kicked off people disbelieving was 911 and the Iraq War. What a stupid fiasco. They  really bungled both. The jig is up. More and more wake up every day. We must do our own research now. We can no longer depend on the Talking Heads.
