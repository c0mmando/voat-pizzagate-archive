<p>Michael84 posted in this subverse explaining that he found a weird occult website when he google searched \'jamesacorp\' as it is part of JA\'s email address (jamesacorp@gmail.com)   Link to his post: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1768269">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1768269</a></p>
<p>The werid fucking occult orgy of a website that he found (NSFW): <a href="http://octagon.lhohq.info/justin-bieber.html">http://octagon.lhohq.info/justin-bieber.html</a></p>
<p>We learned from Michael84\'s post that the names, contact, and emails of hundred of people implicated in the Podesta emails were hidden in this website. Voaters in that post seem to be convinced this information was put on the website PRIOR to the Podesta leaks. Other voaters also noted really weird hidden data/ non-sensical posts with everything from number sets to weird occult ramblings and really alarming pornographic material. The website itself is an endless rabbit hole of weirdly coded webpages, videos, and occult ramblings. For convenience purposes and from observing that this phrase keeps popping up in this website, we will call these websites Laughing Horse Orifice Headquarters or LHOHQ as that what is repeatedly being used on the sites themselves. </p>
<p>Upon seeing that post, I decided to research LHOHQ and found something startling. </p>
<p>In 2007, an anon posted to the AboveTopSecret forums that found a piece of paper taped to a billboard when he was walking with his friends in Milwaukee: <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread286926/pg1">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread286926/pg1</a></p>
<p>The piece of paper had a weird occult symbol and a cipher of letters. He also posted his story to a  Hacking forum and asked for help: <a href="http://www.blizzhackers.cc/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;t=357587&amp;sid=b7df432ddf141ed9d9329d48df62115e">http://www.blizzhackers.cc/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;t=357587&amp;sid=b7df432ddf141ed9d9329d48df62115e</a></p>
<p>The hackers at this forum deciphered the letters on his piece of paper and discovered the LHOHQ acronym! They also found sites eerily SIMILAR to the LHOHQ site Michael84 found in 2017 from searching that acronym, these sites the BlizzHackers found we know go back to at least 2007, here is one of the websites these hackers discovered on the forums in 2007:  <a href="http://lhohq.appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net/">http://lhohq.appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net/</a></p>
<p>Another site they found is no longer up due to a billing issue: <a href="http://interlude.20m.com/lhohq/">http://interlude.20m.com/lhohq/</a></p>
<p>This is the first recorded instance I can find of anybody on the internet discovering any LHOHQ-type website. Both the AWS and BlizzHacker forum posters seemed to have shrugged this off as a weird occult art project at the time. However, these new revelations lead to significant questions and huge red flags.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>Why does the first LHOHQ site found by Michael84 have the contact info for all those people implicated in the Podesta emails? </p>
<p>Were these emails coded into the website PRIOR or AFTER the Podesta leaks?</p>
<p>What is the Laughing Horse Orifice Headquarters (LHOHQ) and why the hell did they take so much time in setting up what we know for sure are SEVERAL websites with really complex coding and occult references dating back to at least a decade ago?</p>
<p>Why is the first assumed discovery of LHOHQ come from somebody finding a piece of paper taped to a billboard in Milwaukee, and consequently deciphering the contents of that paper?</p>
<p>What do these sites have in common?</p>
<p>What other pizzagate-related data/content is hidden, embedded, or displayed on either of the LHOHQ sites?</p>
<p>This seems too complex and long-running to be a disinfo operation against pizzagate, especially when you consider people were talking about finding LHOHQ websites in 2007. Could this be a dead-man\'s switch or a type of leaking mechanism from a whistleblower within the Deep State? We need answers and investigation into this.</p>',

               nvm, i misread your comment. Confused me by posting the same comment in multiple threads ive commented/posted. Klpusk I think I have a breakthrough in this. It involves a similar site affiliated with lhohq called synt.us ... notice the LHOHQ symbol and acronym in the background.. I'll PM you everything I found when I get home from work. It is seriously creepy.

                That sounds great! Good job &amp; keep up the awesome work!! :-) Let me know if I can help at all. I'm rebuilding my main PC after I was ddos'd yesterday afternoon. I'm using an old XP box right now, but can help w/ research, if needed. Take care of yourself, k?

            Does anyone remember that big trend in the late 1990s of pictures (mostly sold in shopping malls) that looked like the static on tv... but if you stared at them long enough a "3D image" would appear. They were wildly popular for some time... Anyways, on the link above it is a red background with little tiny pink squares moving around... I was staring at the screen and I started to see words and images pop up in 3D JUST LIKE those pictures from the 90s. The problem is that the squares constantly move so I just get flashes... I could be wrong and it could be a result of researching all these flashing pages... but I have a feeling there are hidden messages in the backgrounds.

            Did you just find this? This is a direct correlation to pizzagate. Which raises more questions, is this factual information such as a chat log? If so, is the other data just a smoke screen to bury specifically pizzagate related information? This page just suddenly got more significant, especially considering that 'note' is the first one you see when you go to the page.

            I think it's a "safe" for online information. It's always changing info and layers, but the construction was built some time ago. It's for hiding info, obviously, but you can change that info at any time and add more filters or disable them.
           </p>
           <p>
            What might be interesting is to use wayback machine on them and see what they produce over time.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also think this accounts for the rabbit holeing on the sites. They are not meant to lead anywhere. Each page is the destination, but encrypted.

           <p>
            Guys, here is what I can tell about this website (sorry for my lame english, tried my best) :
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The text contained in the HTML code is the real deal
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Some images are very disturbing and tell a lot
            </strong>
            ... Like this one :
            <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/insider_trading/index.html">
             http://www.lhohq.info/insider_trading/index.html
            </a>
            <em>
             "We know evolution is a lie, we just want to destroy your way of life"
            </em>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Just before the whole "Pizzagate" story blow-up, many users from the 4chan community have found this website. The website is literally** a maze**. It is a huge patchwork of animated gifs as background images, hiding tons and tons of information. They also thought it was a sort of AI.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, it uses an algorithm to agglomerate data from different sources. The HTML code do not display any error, which is a miracle regarding this huge mess. I can ensure my words : some links from the website contain "tanay tandon" as a clue. This guy :
            <a href="http://tanaytandon.com/">
             http://tanaytandon.com/
            </a>
            created such an algorithm back in 2014. This website is ruled by an algorithm. The owner designates the sources ans the algorithm agglomerate the data.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the users started to question the meaning of these information, the author of the website closed the doors with an enigmatic message :
            <a href="http://imgur.com/a/4gmjk">
             http://imgur.com/a/4gmjk
            </a>
            The front page redirects the users to a scientific abstract from Duncan STEEL about 1991 VG :
            <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lqePy">
             http://imgur.com/a/lqePy
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Several weeks after, clicking on this article led us to another article : "The Great Silence" from James Annis :
            <a href="http://imgur.com/a/mZ3to">
             http://imgur.com/a/mZ3to
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, there was a leak about the Benenson Strategy Group in October :
            <a href="http://exopolitics.org/leaked-document-recommends-false-flag-alien-invasion-to-save-clinton-campaign/">
             http://exopolitics.org/leaked-document-recommends-false-flag-alien-invasion-to-save-clinton-campaign/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Or
            <a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/2016/10/operation-firesign-clinton-campaign-has-a-life-or-death-strategy-in-place-to-offset-her-ongoing-poll-crash/">
             http://themillenniumreport.com/2016/10/operation-firesign-clinton-campaign-has-a-life-or-death-strategy-in-place-to-offset-her-ongoing-poll-crash/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            See this video :
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKzsn-lGOQI">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKzsn-lGOQI
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            4 to 5 bright points in the sky ? Really ?
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems like the deep state invested a lot of money in order to terrorize people with every mean available.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the users, the message was almost clear : don't blame the Russia nor the Aliens thanks to the articles from Duncan Steel and James Annis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then, the only redirection offered by the website, regardless of the URL you tried, showed a huge organization chart :
            <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lUwAQ">
             http://imgur.com/a/lUwAQ
            </a>
            (original link :
            <a href="http://orifice.lhohq.info/01010011010101010101111101001000010101000100100101010111010111110101001101001001010111110100010101001000/11435791973760132482785985134578844941834672351655120716.png">
             http://orifice.lhohq.info/01010011010101010101111101001000010101000100100101010111010111110101001101001001010111110100010101001000/11435791973760132482785985134578844941834672351655120716.png
            </a>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            As you can see, the link is quite long.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the link, 01010011010101010101111101001000010101000100100101010111010111110101001101001001010111110100010101001000 can be converted from Binary to ASCII
           </p>
           <p>
            Revealing : SU_HTIW_SI_EH = HE IS WITH US (but who ?)
           </p>
           <p>
            The image name is 11435791973760132482785985134578844941834672351655120716, convert from Decimal to Hexa : 77652E6465616C2E696E2E4D494E442E434F4E54524F4C
           </p>
           <p>
            Then, Hexa to ASCII : we.deal.in.MIND.CONTROL (seems like a troll to the CIA)
           </p>
           <p>
            Mind control, CIA, DynCorp...?
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, note the presence of the Scientology Church right in the middle.
           </p>
           <p>
            More important : back in time, you could get this huge organizational chart for every link you manually entered in your web brower.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example : lhohq.info/xxxxxx (the "view image" option leads to the huge link) redirected to this image.
And the name of the tab in your web browser was : 0833030477. This is an ISBN CODE, a book published by the RAND Corporation (their only one) :
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation#See_also">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation#See_also
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Some weeks ago, the website was totally back online, with its original content (and more).
           </p>
           <p>
            **The content of the entire website is kind of bizarre **: it talks about Echelon, MKULTRA and universities involvement, all known "big brother" ears in Europe, Koch industries, the use of "Jackladder, Orangutan and Dewdrop" by the NSA for at least 10 years with IP address of many victims and list of "participants" (including big names) to mysterious donation requests, the whole story of US surveillance, abstracts about how to manipulate election system with polynomial laws, the use of Fusarium to kill coca plants in Colombia and its consequences on other plantations, Darwinism &amp; Religion... You just have to extract the plain text from each webpage's code. Many information hidden in the HTML can be found online, such as the history of surveillance in the USA.
           </p>
           <p>
            The huge organization chart could not be seen by using "random" URL. Now, a random URL redirects to more intriguing stuff. Try it : lhohq.info/whateveryouwant
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, take a look at this page :
            <a href="http://orifice.lhohq.info/">
             http://orifice.lhohq.info/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "ACDCA Document #M-NPJ-21L-4A4-APN-BW-XXX1, Summer 2007"
           </p>
           <p>
            So, an other website was found at the same time : ACDCA "Applied Chaos Dynamics Control Association"
            <a href="http://acdca.appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net/">
             http://acdca.appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The RAND corporation is mentioned here :
            <a href="http://acdca.appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net/acdca_white_paper_5_13.html">
             http://acdca.appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net/acdca_white_paper_5_13.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            My english level do not allow me to fully understand the meaning of this.
           </p>
           <p>
            More oddities :
            <a href="http://thefireisillumination.appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net/pages/314_illustration_page1.html">

            </a>
           </p>

            Now, they have put online a gigantic dump of information. I have read some of the information in the HTML code, there is first name, last name, email address, postal address, the employment, IP address, phone number etc... from many people. Disturbing.

             A proposed theory is that this network of LHOHQ web pages are a source for leaks. This theory has been supported further by the fact that data was found hidden in the site matching recent intel leaks, with others saying that this data was inputted before a previous intel leak broke. Based off of this, one would assume there would be a pattern amongst the chaos to figure out what kind of data is actually hiding amonst this LHOHQ maze. I think it would be significant to scour the source code and other technical data for patterns to identify a method to discover even more important information this site may be hiding.

              I'm glad to see this website being re-investigated. I spent a lot of time on it and saved 3 different copies of the website using a website-copier. Browsing the content of each folder is quite an adventure. I am also confident about LHOHQ being a credible source for future leaks. Downloading the whole website allow users to look trough each HTML files. In a certain way, it seems pretty obvious they are trying to debunk the upcoming "blame it on aliens" narrative.

The good news for Mr. Silverstein is that the company that insured 7 World Trade, Industrial Risk Insurers, has indicated that it will make a full payment under its $861 million policy. But it's not clear whether Mr. Silverstein can use those proceeds to start building without first reaching an agreement with the mortgage holder on 7 World Trade Center, Blackstone Real Estate Advisors."

           <p>
            I end up here. There's weird stuff. Like a Winnie the poo coloring book where, if you click on Poo it opens to this

           </p>
           <p>
            Here comes the weirdest part. I clicked on Transmission
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170201225859/http://interlude.20m.com/transmission/transmission.html">
             https://web.archive.org/web/20170201225859/http://interlude.20m.com/transmission/transmission.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The page looks like this

             https://imgoat.com/uploads/512bd43d9c/10285.PNG
            </a>
            But things are moving and flashing. The little bars on the right get bigger and smaller see?

             https://imgoat.com/uploads/512bd43d9c/10286.PNG
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm on an iPad. So I would just poke around and, only every once in a while, the bar on the top right, I could long press on it and I chose "speak". It's a voice in another language or something. At the end, it sounds like it says "close ahead". I audio recorded it from my phone.
           </p>
           <p>
            I only got the sound twice. But, most of the time I would long press and I could click copy. When I pasted it, they were .gif files.

           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not tech savvy. This could be nothing. But, as far as I know, .gif files don't have audio. So, anyways, I got the first one to speak. It's hard and you have to do it at certain times or something. I haven't gotten the 2nd .gif link to speak.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the audio recording that I recorded from my phone

             Hey man can you post a download link to the audio file you recorded? That audio is definitely in reverse, I want to flip it back to normal and somebody can translate what they are saying. I think it's german.

            Why would we need two separate posts on this topic, just add the new info as a comment and if found useful it'll get upvoted to the top. I know there are a lot of comments already, but people here are actually reading those.

            I did google searches on whole sentences found in the source code, including the contact information and it seems to be a copy and paste job from many available online sources. Don't know exactly what that means but so far its not original work.

            Theory:  I would guess that between Wikileaks and Anon, they have know what we now know for a good bit.  While WAY to slow for me, Wikileaks probably doing a good job of waking people up to this control structure we have all been subject to.  In order to do this, consider just the shear volume of information a Wikileaks contributor would have to plow thru...they would need that data public accessible as they would need to collaborate.  Perhaps  Michael84 stumbled into the public facing information sharing by Wikileaks or other hackers regarding the "raw" data from #vault7 or other sources?  These pedo/satanist/elitist have certainly been know to some far in advance of the Podesta emails, etc...

            To answer which came first this is the contact list of Sid Blumenthal released in August 2016 under guccifer 2.0 on cryptome over one month before this section(s) of the site went live.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are they similar to a whos who of the podesta emails. Sid was Hillarys unofficial podesta 'fixer'. Same circles
           </p>
           <p>
            This as far as we could work out was linked to old LULSEC pranks / larping. But I cant find the proof of that anymore. Heres a few bits tho, may 2015 few lines on eddit about the site

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            And heres an extended 4chan discussion on this site and the implication its lulsec, I think some of the only tangible writing in plain text was an old motto for them.

              http://lhohq.info/bob.html

            These names from

             http://octagon.lhohq.info/justin-bieber.html
            </a>
            are definitely from Sept 2016, I exported them off the website back then, before wikileaks release.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have updated names on this page, but there are still a LOT of pertinent high-profile names.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've got the names that I exported back in September &amp; will compare to this new list of names. Will run a comparison to determine which names were removed &amp;/or added.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Another thing to note
            </strong>
            I had archived
            <a href="http://octagon.lhohq.info/justin-bieber.html">
             http://octagon.lhohq.info/justin-bieber.html
            </a>
            back in Sept 2016. It was totally accessible until Jan 2017, when someone else archived over it &amp; the gif was replaced w/ this
            <a href="http://imgur.com/Fg0awvH">
             http://imgur.com/Fg0awvH
            </a>
            (which obviously wiped out the gif w/ all contact names, #s &amp; emails).
           </p>
           <p>
            Now this website is back up &amp; running - so that's interesting...

                 I'm uncertain. I gave it some thought, but admittedly don't have a conclusion. It could be a time waster. It could be an attention grabber (for any number of purposes). But it does not appear to any kind of list that couldn't have been derived from an internet search already.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If we knew who posted it, we might have a better idea as to their motivation, but as things stand it does not appear to be all that interesting in and of itself except to the degree that it spawns a frenzy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Personally, I think the forum poster with the recursive heart logo and the Jason Fall quote seems more interesting at the moment.

                there's no point saying stuff like "pre-pizzagate" and using archive.org and archive.is as evidence, simply because these services have shown themselves to be prone to manipulation.
               </p>
               <p>
                I can think of 2 cases, one case where
                <strong>
                 information was scrubbed/altered
                </strong>
                on the archive of donald trump's personal website's whois page, and another where incriminating pizzagate evidence was scrubbed.
               </p>

               <p>
                this makes it hard when there is so much circumstantial evidence pre-pizzagate through archives. sometimes you can see pre-pizzagate evidence without using archives. User Carole Fan's comment should still be on the news article linked in 2009 where she makes some pretty stark accusations against Alefantis.

                tl;dr: archive.org has been manipulated and is being manipulated and will be manipulated

              Just researching EVERYTHING I could get my hands on. I was aware of Epstein's island &amp; was talking to a relative (that's a successful builder/developer) about it...he told me that there's another island that his friend's brother owns. And that Epstein had been there a few times with young girls/boys for guy owning island. It's in Asia, so much easier to traffic. :-( Anyway, I'm gathering as much as I can about it. So far, there's no smoking gun &amp; Epstein's flight logs don't reflect travel there. But I'm continuing to research &amp; will submit to voat if/when I have something concrete.

              It was part of the rabbit hole we went down. Can't remember how we arrived there. It was something as bizarre as this and may have actually been the same route, following his email addy. You have to understand that after FBIanon pointed us in this direction of human trafficking 4chan and reddit went nuts combing through everything. So a lot of stuff I see posted here nowadays was posted way back in the Fall. It's not s bad thing though bc so much has been covered and there are new people coming in everyday who can see the evidence for themselves and follow evidence themeselves which I think has more impact.

                I haven't looked through everything you posted since it isn't archived and those sites are sketchy AF, but the website that has all of the doxxing info and weird images was looked through. Which forum post are you referring to exactly? I don't know if there is an archive of the stuff that was looked through or how to find it if there was. I just remember people went pretty deep into it bc like you've discovered, it's just bizarre and seems most certainly coded in some way. I don't think there was a consensus on what it was actually for, just best guesses.

                 These posts prove that people discovered the LHOHQ sites way back to at least 2007. What's even weirder is how they came to discover the LHOHQ acronym and the consequent sites. Read those posts for more info.

                  I've used  archive.is to archive websites. You just copy paste the address into their box and it produces and archive link. It helps so people can safely search through something and not be tracked to the actual site.

                 <p>
                  I'll read through the links you posted. I went there originally just to see the image which was no longer available. So I misunderstood those also contained the forums you mentioned. Thanks.

             OK, when you see that page, the one with the figure holding the baby, it has flashing red on the right page.  When you scroll down lower, it is all red with a bunch of lettering.  If you can stand it, you will see some names with emails cell#s. What I could see so far was Cecile Richards, Dan Rather, David Brock, Bill Richardson.  I wonder is this a list of global CP customers?  Is someone leaking their names? Or the list that has been blackmailed for favors?  I have a sense that this was leaked for a purpose. Spilling the Beans?

              I exported all of the names back in Sept 2016 to spreadsheet so I had list of individuals. I NEVER followed politics until Aug 2016, so there are MANY names that I didn't recognize &amp; could DC Elite, military personnel, etc. Seeing all of the names &amp; cross referencing to the additional names may help others who are more familiar w/ political figures, elite, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              I recognized Jake Tapper, John Podesta, Clintons, Doug Band, Cheryl Mills, George Soros, Madeleine Albright, Al Gore, David Brock, James Alefantis, Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner, Arianna Huffington, Bianca Jagger, Garry Trudeau, James Carville, John Cusack, Lynn Rothschild, Phillip Reines &amp; Tamara Luzzatto.

               You should look these names up.  Doug Band headed Teneo for Bill Clinton.  Cheryl Mills was mentioned in the Podesta emails many times over, George Soros you must research, he is evil personified and goes all the way back to the Nazis.  If we take him down we have really scored.   Madeleine Albright was Sec. of State under Bill Clinton and is dark too, look up her company.  Al Gore, ran against George Bush and lost. Personally, I think that is the way both sides wanted it.  He is compromised as well, imo.  Brock ran CTR and now Share Blue, and had a heart attack, he is MIA right now.  I have a feeling you know Alefantis, Abedin and Weiner, Huffington has been huge Clinton supporter for ever, Jagger was married to Mick and Mick Jagger has been to Cibolo Ranch where Scalia died.  Trudeau is political cartoonist, Carville whom I nicknamed "Motor Mouth" is a political pundit forever that has a love affair with the Clintons for decades, Cusack I am sure you know, he is probably MK Ultra, Rothschild I am sure you know from readings on here, Reines was assistant to Hillary at State Dept. and Luzzato is the one that sent the email offering the Luzzatto children for a swim in the pool, the rest is history.  We can assume that most of these people have been blackmailed, if not they are too afraid to change course.

                Here's my response to very similar question:
I exported all of the names back in Sept 2016 to spreadsheet so I had list of individuals. I NEVER followed politics until Aug 2016, so there are MANY names that I didn't recognize &amp; could DC Elite, military personnel, etc. Seeing all of the names &amp; cross referencing to the additional names may help others who are more familiar w/ political figures, elite, etc.
               </p>
               <p>
                I recognized Jake Tapper, John Podesta, Clintons, Doug Band, Cheryl Mills, George Soros, Madeleine Albright, Al Gore, David Brock, James Alefantis, Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner, Arianna Huffington, Bianca Jagger, Garry Trudeau, James Carville, John Cusack, Lynn Rothschild, Phillip Reines &amp; Tamara Luzzatto.

             Awesome, I look forward to your findings. I read another theory either on here or 4chan that the LHOHQ sites may be the medium hackers or whistleblowers use to communicate sensitive/leaked information.

             I noticed this too and posted in the original voat thread, but my comment may have been buried too deep at that point. I tried to do some searching to find the origin of the quote, but found nothing [so far].

             well shit. first one is the spiral hearts with some interesting text, apparently by a jason fall, in a work presumably titled 'the state of the comet,' reading 'i don't care what they say, i don't care if i'm the villain, i don't need their acceptance, i only need your hand.' this is some creepy shit.

             followed up with some shit about alice from lewis carroll, who it was widely believed to have been in love with the very young lady the alice character is based upon.

             below this is a barely visible "Name Origins" link, going to another blizzhackers forum which requires a login. anybody have one? i'm not making one.

              Keep an eye out for Paul McCartney if you're running into Lewis Carroll etc. (Alice in Wonderland, and Jabberwocky, which is code speak from the novel.) Wouldn't surprise me.

             I thought it was COINTELPRO when I first saw the sites on Michael84's OP, but now seeing these sites existence and the story of the piece of paper on the billboard in 2007, i dont know what to believe.

                 For what reason, and when was this discovered? Do you have a link you can post that shows this? Look at my OP in this thread, is there anything new or significant with what I found in regards to LHOHQ sites existing in 2007? Or is synt.us something new that you found  from the sites I posted? Sorry Gothamgirl I'm a bit confused as to whether my findings have been discovered or not and how Anon Ghost Sect factors into this. Could you explain?

                  Yes no problem.  I found synt.us first and it connected me back to the Lhohq. Its hard to explain after following clues I came to this video which mention Ghosts.

                  There is also someone named Phale involved. He claims he no longer works for them.

                    Well if the sites are connected I would assume the same people. Do you think they're going to post their real identity?  Look how much classified info is there. I wouldn't.

             No problem! I made this thread to consolidate all of the findings in regards to LHOHQ thus far. I will continue to update it if anything else comes to light, I really wanted to post it as a primer for further investigation, that's why I included the questions at the bottom. I've also posted this to 4chan and hope the autists there can help as well. If a MOD thinks its best to have a separate thread with just findings I am fine with that but would request some assistance in setting that up.
