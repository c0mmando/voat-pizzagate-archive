<p>this <strong>POST</strong> regarding an Idaho reserve policeman, <strong>William Gray</strong>, who was severely burned in a crash in <strong>WELLSVILLE, UTAH</strong> while working at his full –time truck-driving job when his semi-truck was hit by a local man being chased by <strong>LOCAL</strong> police.  This story came to light, <strong>ONE MONTH LATER</strong>,  because  the NURSE IN SALT LAKE CITY, who treated the officer when  he arrived at the burn center,  made public <strong>her arrest video</strong> for refusing to comply with an <strong>ILLEGAL ORDER</strong>  to let a SALT LAKE CITY “DETECTIVE”, Jeff Payne,  draw Gray’s blood for what he said was a ‘criminal investigation\'.   <strong>Payne said he was obtaining a blood sample from 
Gray at the request of the Police Depart of LOGAN, UTAH</strong>, which serve Cache County, Utah, where the accident occurred.

<p><strong>DISCOVERED THAT UTAH LAW TREATED HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS, INCLUDING CHILDREN, AS PROSTITUTES UP UNTIL 2015</strong>  <a href="https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/tag/human-trafficking">https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/tag/human-trafficking</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cases where trafficking of a child may not result in charges for human trafficking</strong>
There are a few reasons why cases where children were trafficked for sex may not result in charges for human trafficking of a child:</p>
<p>•	<strong>Human Trafficking of a Child is a new area of criminal justice. It was only added to the Utah criminal code in 2015</strong>. In the old model of viewing these cases, many times the child being sex trafficked was arrested for prostitution and adjudicated delinquent in the juvenile justice system. Only in the last year did Utah pass a “safe harbor” provision for children engaged in the sex trade that clarifies they should be treated as victims and referred to services.</p>
<p>•	<strong>While the safe harbor provision has helped protect child victims of sex trafficking from improper criminal charges, the criminal justice field at large still has a long way to go in shifting from viewing this crime into a human trafficking lens. In some jurisdictions, these cases are still investigated through the lens of prostitution and not human trafficking. Sometimes suspects are charged with exploiting prostitution even in cases where children were sex trafficked.</strong></p>
<p>•	<strong>Another component of the safe harbor philosophy is that we should avoid re-victimizing those preyed on by sex traffickers by pressuring them to participate in the criminal justice process</strong>. In our office, we often prosecute defendants who we have reason to believe are traffickers with other related offenses, either because the victim does not want to participate in our criminal case or to protect them from having to do so if we can secure justice through other charges.

<li>Davis County, Utah  February 18, 2017 – The Office of the Utah Attorney General announced today the guilty plea on Thursday of Todd Jeremy Rettenberger to charges relating to human trafficking and related crimes.  Rettenberger was sentenced to one to fifteen years in prison for second-degree felony human trafficking and zero to five years for third-degree felony exploitation of prostitution. The sentences will run concurrently.“The victims of this trafficker were girls, barely older than teens, forced into prostitution against their will and compelled to stay in “the life” by threats against their well-being and against their families. Rettenberger was charged in April of 2016 after police received reports that he was running a commercial sex operation out of Bountiful, along the Wasatch Front, and into other states. <a href="https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/tag/todd-rettenberger">https://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/tag/todd-rettenberger</a></li>

             While the safe harbor provision has helped protect child victims of sex trafficking from improper criminal charges, the criminal justice field at large still has a long way to go in shifting from viewing this crime into a human trafficking lens. In some jurisdictions, these cases are still investigated through the lens of prostitution and not human trafficking. Sometimes suspects are charged with exploiting prostitution even in cases where children were sex trafficked.

            <strong>
             Another component of the safe harbor philosophy is that we should avoid re-victimizing those preyed on by sex traffickers by pressuring them to participate in the criminal justice process
            </strong>
            . In our office, we often prosecute defendants who we have reason to believe are traffickers with other related offenses, either because the victim does not want to participate in our criminal case or to protect them from having to do so if we can secure justice through other charges.

             Davis County, Utah  February 18, 2017 – The Office of the Utah Attorney General announced today the guilty plea on Thursday of Todd Jeremy Rettenberger to charges relating to human trafficking and related crimes.  Rettenberger was sentenced to one to fifteen years in prison for second-degree felony human trafficking and zero to five years for third-degree felony exploitation of prostitution. The sentences will run concurrently.“The victims of this trafficker were girls, barely older than teens, forced into prostitution against their will and compelled to stay in “the life” by threats against their well-being and against their families. Rettenberger was charged in April of 2016 after police received reports that he was running a commercial sex operation out of Bountiful, along the Wasatch Front, and into other states.

            i've seen a truck jack-knife and swerve off. 
but the driver just looked like he slumped over and turned the wheel with his body weight, making it knife and flip.
but dude just fell out...like he was shut down.

            obviously lack of sleep is the first reasonable and logical suspect, but is it becoming a cliche?
is there a push for autonomous-driving distribution? and wouldn't that change the face of almost every market?

            Certainly a suspicious coincidence that makes one wonder if the cop "drawing blood" might actually have been Seth Riching the driver. Why stick a needle in somebody who is not at fault in an accident and clinging to life?

             Yes.  This is a very real possibility.  That truck driver could be involved in something and they may want to shut him up.  Why did his boss seem so emphatic about him getting that blood, which meant he would prick him with that needle. Also I think he was the one that had training with the FBI in Quantico.  Or at least one of the characters in this case did.  Highly suspicious.

            The CIA have a weapon nick named a "heart attack gun". It fires a dart like projectile that rapidly degrades. The projectile contains a toxin that kills its victims in a way resembling a heart attack. This toxin will most likely be missed by a doctor unless they suspect the heart attack was suspicious and do a blood test (such as chromatography based ones).

            , isn't the original burned truck driver from Rigby, Idaho? He just happened to be in an accident in this town. I don't see the link between the two incidents.

             Rigby, Idaho is 2 1/2 hours away from Wellsville, Utah. He was working his full-time job at time of accident.   He had a load of sand.  I can't find out who he worked for, but, I am guessing he worked for a sand/gravel company near Wellsville.  There are a few

              Wouldn't a sand/gravel company be an excellent way to dispose of excavated material. So you dig out this big underground facility. What happens to all the dirt?

              What is your take on this so far?  I have gone through everything and it took about 2 hrs.   going back looking at the other threads too.  There is def something connecting this all.  The one guy in Nebraska has a one man trucking co. (I assume he is the employee) One driver and he takes in $87K annually?  Who does he drive for and what does he transport?  Very lucrative money for such a small op.  Also there is a huge HT biz in Neb as well since all of the men were drawn there to work for the oil companies.  But I heard that the oil biz kind of died down there now and possibly the guys need money so they are trafficking kids now.  Also someone mentioned that one of the LEOs trained with the FBI down in Quantico Va.  and there was info about the FBI being caught up with the Mafia.  The Det. was trying to get the blood but what for?  What do they do with it?  Are thy collecting this blood?  It seems that the guy that made him arrest that nurse really wanted him to get that blood. Also, he had been to that hospital before I am sure.  So why did he not know there protocal on the blood. Very odd imo. This is getting really Hairy.

              I'm here.  Was out.  Just looking it over.  My friend follows Jimmy Dore and she said he covered the first case.  I told her there was a video of the crash and she was amazed.  She has not seen it. So we are really do good people. Will let you know when I am done so far I am confused.  Thanks for the ping.
