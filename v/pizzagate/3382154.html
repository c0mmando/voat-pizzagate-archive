<p>I was looking it up and came across intriguing possibilities of who it could be.  Firstly, does this name lead us back to Mohammad Yunus.  Also, could this person have something to do with the passport found during the Epstein raid, the one with the Saudi Arabian address. (Maybe Obama\'s cousin\'s place /s).</p>

<p>Murdoch Misleads Readers About Renewable Subsidies &amp; Saudi Playboys</p>
<p>It is hard to keep up with the Murdoch media. On a daily basis, RenewEconomy receives emails from outraged readers and mortified energy market players pointing to the latest nonsense and falsehood about renewable energy published in The Australian and the News Ltd tabloids that dominate the mainstream news media market.</p>
<p>RenewEconomy simply doesn’t have the resources to debunk them all – although we did contemplate a daily bulletin called the “Un-Australian” at one stage, but someone beat us to it.</p>
<p>But a recent story in The Australian has provoked us into action. The so-called “exclusive” is their front page lead and is titled “Saudi solar tycoon wins $300 million handouts boost”. The story is written by political correspondent David Crowe, who is not usually the worst of the bunch when it comes to renewables, but he’s got it badly wrong here.</p>
<p>The Australian‘s confected outrage is based around the story that a very rich Saudi businessman <strong>(Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel)</strong> is making so much money out of Australian households from the Moree solar farm, and has a son (Hassan Jameel) who is <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4654574/Rihanna-s-billionaire-lover-s-uncle-abducted-daughter.html">dating Jamaican singer Rihanna at the same time.</a></p>
<p>What should we do in the face of this outrage and high-profile romance? Apparently we are supposed to agree to pay subsidies to extend the life of the ageing and unreliable Liddell coal-fired power station.</p>
<p>Except that the story is – like so much written about renewables in The Australian – a whole lot of cobblers.</p>

<p>We see the name crop up in an article about Prince Andrew:</p>

            <p>
             "Alex Counts founded Grameen Foundation and became its President and CEO in 1997, after having worked in microfinance and poverty reduction for 10 years. A Cornell University graduate, Alex’s commitment to poverty eradication deepened as a Fulbright scholar in Bangladesh, where he witnessed innovative poverty solutions being developed by Grameen Bank. He trained under Professor Muhammad Yunus, the founder and managing director of Grameen Bank, and co-recipient of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. Alex has propelled Grameen Foundation’s philosophy through his writings, and in 2007 he received the Distinguished Alumni Award from Horace Mann School. Alex is a board member, and the immediate past Chair, of Fonkoze USA and co-chairs the Fonkoze Family Coordinating Committee – two governance bodies related to the largest microfinance institution in Haiti. He is also immediate past Chair of Project Enterprise, a New York City microlender, and board member emeritus. He sits on the Advisory Council of the Center for Financial Inclusion, and the Steering Committee of the Seal of Excellence for Poverty Outreach and Transformation."

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2015, Fonkoze committed to scale its successful adult literacy pilot program in Haiti to 1,200 people in partnership with Smallholder Farmers Alliance (SFA), Lide, and Federation of Women Associations of Maissade (SWAM). In a country where it is estimated that less than half of the population is literate, it is critical to address this issue to combat poverty and foster economic opportunities. Over the course of ten months, Fonkoze will provide the curriculum, which includes literacy and business skill training, through a train-the-trainer method that identifies local community leaders to serve as trainers. The partner organizations will identify three distinct groups they are working with to participate: smallholder farmers who receive agricultural training from SFA; at-risk adolescent girls who have received little or no schooling and are being given life skill training from Lide to prepare to enter the job market; and women farmers and entrepreneurs who receive agricultural training from SWAM.

             Perhaps Fonkoze is a good NGO, but any organization that is endorsed by Clinton Foundation is suspect; it indicates that some individual(s) have the attention of the pay to play, 'venture philanthropy' underpinnings of CGI.

              In 2006, with support of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, we launched the Microfinance and Health Protection program. MAHP helps MFIs offer clients appropriate financial products (including health-savings accounts, loans and insurance) along with access to education (on topics like breastfeeding, child health and nutrition, family planning, women's health, business management and household money management) and health services and products. These services are delivered by the MFI itself through its own health clinics, or through NGOs, governments or for-profit hospital systems.

                “We are finding it impossible to get landing slots to bring in communication equipment and engineers into Port au Prince,” Mr O’Brien said in an email to Mr Band.
               </p>
               <p>
                “Is there any way you can give me a high-level introduction to someone in the State Department to get this resolved rapidly? I am so sorry to bother you but I am not making any progress through conventional channels.”
               </p>
               <p>
                “Never a bother. Will do what we can,” Mr Band emailed Mr O’Brien back, copying Amitabh Desai, the director of foreign policy at the Clinton Foundation, on the email and telling him to “pls [sic] get on this.”
               </p>
               <p>
                Mr Desai emailed Mr O’Brien about three hours later, including two state department officials on the email.

                “This is Denis O’Brien, a friend of President Clinton and one of the largest employers and do-ers in Haiti, who also has been helping post-earthquake,” he told them.

               Denis O’Brien’s Caribbean connections revealed in Bahamas papers
              </p>
              <p>
               Businessman’s associates are acting as directors of six companies in tax haven
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Irish businessman Denis O’Brien is linked to property on the Caribbean island where Dermot Desmond has been developing an exclusive tourist resort, filings in the Bahamas indicate.
               </p>
               <p>
                The corporate registry in the Bahamas, which is normally difficult to access but the contents of which have been published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, show associates of O’Brien acting as directors of six companies in the Caribbean tax haven.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Bahamas are a well-known tax haven and there is nothing illegal about being connected with a company from that jurisdiction.
               </p>
               <p>
                The files show that in May of last year Denise Russell and Ann Marie Foley O’Brien, both with addresses in Dublin, became directors of Fortress Property (SVG) Ltd, Sandpiper Enterprises Ltd, and Elderberry Investment Inc, all of Nassau in the Bahamas.
               </p>
               <p>
                Russell is a manager with O’Brien’s Irish investment vehicle, Island Capital, while Foley O’Brien is a consultant who acts as a director of a number of O’Brien companies, including the Irish property-holding company, Partenay, and the philanthropy enterprise, the Iris O’Brien Foundation.
               </p>
               <p>
                In the case of Fortress Property and Sandpiper, the two businesswomen replaced Swiss-Italian banker Antonio Saladino and Achille Pastor-Ris, chief executive of Canouan Resorts Development Ltd.
