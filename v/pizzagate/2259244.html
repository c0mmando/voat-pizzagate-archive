            I will never understand this about you people. How has it not stuck yet that the COPS are involved, the EMT guys are involved, the DISPATCHERS are involved, the POLICE CHIEFS are involved (Fraternal Order of Police, anyone?), EVERY SINGLE FUCKING PERSON in the power structure is involved. This isn't a "the system is rotting" situation, its already completely rotted into mush! NO MORE GOOD GUYS EXIST IN THIS BROKEN, DEMONIC SYSTEM. Any good apples get immediately compromised, killed, or have their careers cut short.
           </p>
           <p>
            OH GOLLY GEE, THE LAPD IS BUSTING HOLLYWOOD PERVERTS? The same LAPD that has PEDO BADGES? The same LAPD that has been convicted several times in the past of planting drugs, beating people, and just being general scumbags? OH WOW I REALLY HOPE THE LAPD, WITH THEIR PEDO BADGES, PROPERLY PURSUE THE HOLLYWOOD PERVERTS! SURELY THEY WILL PUNISH THEM ACCORDINGLY WITH THEIR CRIMES.
           </p>
           <p>
            OH YES GUYS LETS HAVE FAITH IN THE LAPD.

            Corey Feldman is a shill. Who the hell cares if the nothing burgers he named are indicted when they have nothing to do with the big wigs running a pedo ring and nothing to do with the death of his supposed best friend Corey Haim!!!! Feldman was JEALOUS of Haim!!! He handled Haim and kept him from going to the LAPD (not that it would have any good, but still ..)
           </p>
           <p>
            Until Feldman gives with the names and actually proves what he says he is, I'll continue to call him a fucking shill!!!!

             he could be a pedo gatekeeper, but I don't see any reason to doubt him considering we know this type of thing happens, and he was trying to make the idea popular quite some time ago.

              Redpilled by his tweets and denial of #pizzagate. Really? The champion of rape victims rights denies pizzagate? Then there was his video of Corey's Angels. If Feldman isn't in hell don't know who is.

             <p>
              Don't you get it? There is a pedo ring operating in PedoWood. So what better way to keep tabs on who's talking, who's thinking of talking, who is talking, then by positioning a "victim" as the person everyone talks to and seeks counsel. He plays the part of the traitor and tells the guys that run it everything they need to know.

               Corey Haim's mother blames Feldman for some of her son's later abuse. She called him a child recruiter for the elite and very jealous of Haim's superior looks.

               "RDJ" or whomever has been speaking under this acronym has always been extremely direct and very detailed, and shockingly revealing in all of his blogs. It was his very long series of posts, re-posted on numerous heavily trafficked sites on the internet like Jezebel and LipstickAlley, which got lots of people in Hollywood and elsewhere talking about serial child abuse and the protection of well-known perps in the industry.
              </p>
              <p>
               Equal blame was placed on unbelievably selfish stage parents who had already raped their young "money makers" as well as physically and emotionally abusing them for maximum control.

                Wasn't aware she said this, but it's my sense. I wasn't there, but damn! The jealousy is apparent the way he talks. Even now he's deriving a great deal of pleasure from soliciting attention from his "dead" friend. At least that's the way it seems to me.

               <p>
                Yes, the stage parents are also to blame, and I believe Haim's mom is one. Why else would she exonerate Charlie Sheen? I'm not expecting her to know if her son never told her, but come on! He'd have to at least be on her radar.

                  He's positioned for precisely this sort of thing. Pizzagate is breaking; Feldman denies it exists. Who do you think is going to believe pizzagaters when the quintessential poster child for victimization is howling it's all fake and a lie? And even after pizzagaters connect it to PedoWood, and this shit starts coming, who does the media go to and center on for quotes? Pizzagaters? Or Feldman? Yes, Feldman! He's the go to victim! And isn't he just lapping things up with a nice big fat bank account from his gofundme campaign to make a movie about these nuthing burgers he's named!

                   The height of immorality was to create a gofundme so he could create a doc on pedos in the industry. Feldman was well aware that an award winning woman director had already made such a film. So will Feldman return the donated funds?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Sickening that everyone knows Feldman has never tackled any of the many beginning steps for would be directors. He's never attended a highly rated film school and/or made B&amp;W silent shorts or even YouTube videos. That's the 1st step expected of future directors.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also Feldman completely lacks the character/personality traits to be a film director. Friends who were admitted to USC Film School due to their national photography awards and/or to the quality of their amazing high school student films, started their own related business and were millionaires before the age of 30.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Yes the #1 requirement of a successful director is the ability to be so focused on your project that you only sleep a few hours a day for weeks on end. "Film school geeks" at USC always stood out due to their tremendous drive and dedication. Perhaps that is why they feel they deserve extraordinary praise &amp; beyond the pale rewards once they're given the funding to make a studio film.

             What changes has LAPD made to convince the public they are now taking previously ignored complaints of child sexual predators very seriously? How are they protecting victims and their guardians against vile threats for speaking to LE? Have they at least issued a press release to the Los Angeles Times, Variety, and The Hollywood Reporter of their new procedures?
