<p>Apparently one of the members who got away a few years back turned to someone she had been ordered to hook up with about a decade ago. That person? A permanent A++ list celebrity known all over the world. She turned to that person when she escaped so she would be safe. I\'m not sure just how safe it is now though because there are all kinds of files and e-mails and it wouldn\'t shock me if there were notes about who and when the A++ lister would visit the compound and have sex with followers.</p>

            Another NXIVM member’s home was put up for sale.
           </p>
           <p>
            The former home of Dr. Brandon Porter and his wife Jane Jeffries is a pending sale via Armida Rose Realty Group (NXIVM member Franca Dicrescenzo’s real estate brokerage company).
           </p>
           <p>
            We all keep focused on the MSM names, but what of NXIVM other members? These people still own and run many businesses which all have employees, which can and are likely used for various reasons as useful idiots.

             Danielle Roberts also worked in the Racine and Milwaukee area.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The doctor accused of branding female members of a New York "sex cult" worked at Columbia St. Mary's Hospital and two of its affiliates as recently as last summer — and reportedly tried to recruit at least one of her Milwaukee patients.
             </p>
             <p>
              Danielle D. Roberts, a 36-year-old family doctor, has been identified in multiple  media accounts as a leader of Nxivm, a controversial self-help group. Some female members were brainwashed by founder Keith Raniere, branded with his initials and coerced into having sex with him, authorities say.
             </p>
             <p>
              In recent weeks, Raniere and one of his top recruiters, former "Smallville" actress Allison Mack, were arrested and charged with sex-trafficking. The group and its bizarre practices have been making headlines for a number of years.
             </p>
             <p>
              The criminal complaint said Raniere, known as "Vanguard," created a system in which women are told they can advance in the group by acting as "slaves" to male "masters." Those at the highest level must do menial chores, follow near-starvation diets and keep the details of the group secret.
             </p>
             <p>
              Members of the group have identified Roberts as the physician who branded them in the pubic area with a cauterizing iron to form a scar spelling K-R-A-M — Raniere's and Mack's initials.  Each woman was held down by four people during the procedure. No anesthesia was used.
             </p>
             <p>
              Records show Roberts has worked in recent years at St. Mary's, Columbia St. Mary's Ozaukee in Mequon and Sacred Heart Rehabilitation Hospital.
             </p>
             <p>
              Caryn Kaufman, a spokeswoman for Ascension Wisconsin, said Roberts was never employed directly by St. Mary's but worked for a staffing agency that provided temporary workers for the hospital. Ascension owns St. Mary's and its affiliates.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Why did Columbia St. Mary's change its name? Why did Wheaton Franciscan change its name? Why did a local dermatologist office change its name after one of the doctors was charged with trafficking?
            </p>
            <p>
             Where did last mayor stay when he visited New York on a city-funded business trip? Why was it a big secret where he stayed? Why did he claim to 'sleep on a friend's couch'? Was he with a mistress? Did she commit crimes with him during his campaigns? Did they attend a special event together in New York? Why did the mayor suddenly resign? What is he doing now? Why did the city administrator resign ahead of schedule? Why did the District Attorney resign? Why did the mayor before him get arrested on child enticement related crimes? Why did another city administrator try to commit suicide? Why did judges end up in the river?
            </p>
            <p>
             Where is the current mayor from? Why did his wife resign? Who are they close friends with? Where did the majority of his campaign funding come from? Why is an adopted Russian boy being groomed to be the next mayor? Who is he very "close" with? What is the American Field Service? Why are Boy Scouts connected with the Knights of Malta and Knights of Pythias? What was the page program at the White House? Who covered for Hastert? Who was Paul Ryan's "role model"? Who controls the newspaper in the area?
            </p>
            <p>
             These are all connected. There are many levels in the pyramid of power and control. Who are the Pilgrims? What is the Sphinx Head?

                The actual control of the cheese and pizza business began with no less a figure than Joseph Bonanno, Sr. Bonanno, living at that time in Tucson, Arizona, was regarded as one of the most powerful leaders of Organized Crime in America. Bonanno initiated a conspiracy to control the specialty cheese business in the United States in the early 1940's and even in 1980, he and his associates controlled the activities of some of the largest and most prosperous specialty cheese companies. Bonanno had direct ties to Grande Cheese of Wisconsin; through it to Grande's exclusive distributor in the Pennsylvania area, Roma Foods of South Plainfield, New Jersey; and through the distributor to hundreds of retail pizza shops which were financed and controlled by the organization in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

            What about his rainbow school for children! Yea sure, this guy just did it all by himself

            This story will be condensed to this. NXIVM Cult leader KAR goes to jail for life. Mack is sentenced to 5-10 the gasps will be audible. And that's it. Probation and house arrest for everyone else.  The NDNY trial of the sickest crimes will be reduced to to the court appearances of KAR getting another life sentence.
           </p>
           <p>
            But in the meantime the good thing is people are awakening to this subject matter  more and more.
           </p>
           <p>
            The only solace I can find here is a what if. What if the tips that the Bronfmans and Salzmans give to the Feds turn out to be their death sentences.  If so expect a Red scarf in the description of the suicide.

             all my info on elsewhere and cant get to it

             it was set up differently
            </p>
            <p>
             people involved, think there was a female adoption attorney, the timing, 1 dy I think stunk
            </p>
            <p>
             the others,  involved with LLC's for 6 months, ever changing
            </p>
            <p>
             think I ended up in a building in Switzerland with a daycare and hokie stuff, reminded my of Oklahoma building

            From the Epoch times article cited in the OP:
           </p>
           <p>
            Porter was charged for conducting illegal and highly perverse experiments for a “fright study” on human subjects. The OPMC accused Porter of showing subjects “an actual video of the horrific and brutal murders and dismemberment of four women by machetes.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Between 2012 and 2017, the doctor also allegedly showed subjects other violent clips without their consent, including “a male African-American being viciously stomped by a Nazi; a conscious male being forced to eat a portion of his own brain matter; and a graphic gang rape.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Porter has also been charged for conducting illegal and highly perverse experiments for a ‘fright study’ conducted on human subjects.

            I can't find him. He's changed his name. Or lives in another country.

             . Brandon Porter, 44, has been charged by the New York State Office of Professional Medical Conduct (OPMC)  with illegally conducting human experiments and numerous other misdeeds as a physician. These are not criminal charges, but licensing charges. A hearing is scheduled for June 27. If the charges are proven, Dr. Porter could have his medical license revoked or suspended. In addition, there may be a criminal referral to the New York State Attorney General.

                There are two Kristins. 
Kreuk, the hypocrite actress now starring in a Canadian tv drama as a crusading lawyer.

                <p>
                 wires been crossed for 2 days now

                 I get things backwards and mix up, dsylexia

                <p>
                 you are so right, I do apologize, but Kreuk was an inner circle
                </p>
                <p>
                 Keefe left I think with the help of a state patrol officer, still looking for link

                <p>
                 will stick to last names so no confusion

                 Kreuk  shouldnt be getting a pass
                </p>
                <p>
                 I think things started unraveling for NXIVM after Keefe left

                 I think the death of Gina and what was happening to son was too much

                Here is an article about the whereabouts of
                <a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/nxivm-powerful-cult-turns-rich-women-mind-controlled-slaves/">
                 Gaelen
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                My whole comment was erased so suffice to say this is the the best part of the article 
Forcing slaves to neglect their children and to face dead pets are classic mind control techniques to induce trauma. And when Natalie attempted to leave Raniere, she was faced with dire consequences.
               </p>
               <p>
                Natalie’s home was broken into; police were sent to her mother’s house; her family was threatened. (…)
               </p>
               <p>
                During those years, Natalie would learn that nxivm had hired the controversial Israeli-born private investigator
                <a href="https://www.truthorfiction.com/juval-aviv/">
                 Juval Aviv
                </a>
                to monitor her home and look into her private life and business activities. Several times, she says, she was visited by F.B.I. agents, most recently this past February. – Ibid.
               </p>
               <p>
                At least one woman did not make it out alive. The circumstances around the disappearance of Kristin Snyder are extremely unsettling.
               </p>
               <p>
                In 2003, Kristin Snyder, a 35-year-old environmental consultant, disappeared after a nxivm session in Alaska. Her body was never found, but in her truck, parked on the shore of Resurrection Bay, was a note which read, “I was brainwashed and my emotional center of the brain was killed/turned off. . . . Please contact my parents . . . if you find me or this note. I am sorry . . . I didn’t know I was already dead.” – Ibid.
               </p>
               <p>
                While most victims are women, another bizarre story involves a motherless child who is being raised by NXIVM.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is alleged that the Bronfmans’ foundations had used funds to pay for the care of Gaelen, the three-year-old boy who has been living in the Halfmoon “compound.” His identity is a mystery. The oft-repeated story is that he was “given” as a weeks-old infant to Barbara Jeske, one of Raniere’s longtime followers, by his grandfather, after the baby’s mother died—either in childbirth or in a car accident. He may have been born in Michigan—where sources say Jeske went to get Gaelen—but even that cannot be corroborated. Today Gaelen lives with Kristin Keeffe, the Bronfmans’ and nxivm’s “legal adviser.” Raised as Raniere’s “heir” and according to Raniere’s child-rearing theories, he is reportedly fed a raw diet, kept away from other children, and tended to by five nannies who each speak to him in a different language—including Russian, Spanish, Hindi, and Chinese. Former nxivm insiders have been so concerned about the child they have phoned child protective services, but to no avail. – Ibid.
               </p>
               <p>
                Is Gaelen an MK slave, too?

                    Boy has the Frank Report changed , that was a great article and that's what I remember reading in the past, now his stuff is pure shit. Like a tampon tabloid. This piece is almost stand alone quality with an obvious slant against KAR true. the suspicions are warranted due to the inconvenient facts. The $500000 ex CIA men that's not an investigation cost that's a hit cost. She was murdered,  totally.

                    As far as the other, ...shooting yourself with a shotgun is not necessarily the preferred female suicide method. However the choice of birdshot may not be a male preference either! Interesting to know the barrel length.

                    I have always maintained that NXIVM is not a sex cult first, it's an extortion racket, run by the intel community like the Epstein Racket. Also money laundering. The sex and the girls and the weird shit they left to KAR. The Bronfmans and the Mexicans and Salzmans were running an extortion racket to gain influence over influential people. The underage girls, most likely Mexican peasant children, was where it was at before the arrests.

                    I think Carlos Slim has a role in this too. The richest man in Mexico.

                      Yea the Libyan connection is really far out. The SNC Lavelin controversy that may bring down Trudeau!  May be also connected to this NXIVM. The fact that Sara Bronfman "married" a Libyan ? Jewish billionaire sand shark makes this even weirder in my mind. , I'll check the links in a bit.

                          It's not so much a thing of accountability to me. Although it would be nice to see the elite in orange suits or worse.  To me it's about something bigger, that outside of hitting the kill switch, the elite to simply be exposed  on a wider level to a tipping point.

                          Just think of where all this was in the 1980sand 90s. And now where it is. Millions of people now are completely aware and millions more know something stinks and other millions are so upset they would believe it now if they were told about the pedocracy.

                             NXIVM is one of many groups involved, much like Scientology, Strangite, FLDS, OTO, and others, with Keith as a central figure similar to L. Ron Hubbard, Joseph Smith, James Strang, Warren Jeffs, Jack Parsons, Michael Aquino, and Aleister Crowley.

                             A very interesting aspect of string theory is how particle physics is very similar to the I-Ching. This is a subject that crosses into so many areas. Understanding Fibonacci math(the golden ratio), how DNA evolves along a somewhat controllable pattern of the golden ratio........It is really intriguing. Most involved in these fields of study are likely useful idiots. The hand full of accredited individuals controlling these fields, they may know more. You would need to understand them individually to know if their personal beliefs guide them....................Anyhow, you learn to understand "magick" you will learn to understand at least the general concept of quantum entanglement. You'll learn to understand psudo-scientific concepts such as "mind over matter". All of that aside...........by unlocking, proving, and quantifying string theory, we have so far created everything from 5G to meta-materials. These megalomaniacs seek to control the very fabric of reality, even if just by using machines they learn to create.

                             You can find peer reviewed articles online dealing with the element gold and how to infuse it into the human genome at the subatomic level. That can have more effects than I care to type out here.

                             Point is, CERN is a small arm but a key arm in opening zero point knowledge and quantifying it for the masses, that can afford it, or are selected to control it, via the groundwork being laid out now, as a new grid system for future development of sustainable smart environments to control the very thoughts of the typical citizens.

                             Anyhurr............I know how insane this crap sounds and most people can't or won't self educate in enough fields to grasp the overview of these world leaders belief systems.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Sorry if I lost you. Again, I know how crazy this sounds. You learn who these people have listened to. The ideologies and philosophies, it is amazing the crap they believe. Something right out of a dystopian Hollywood movie.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Another thing to keep in mind, many, most even, of these people are fifth or more generation indoctrinated into what they do. How their world view is colored from birth. They do not even have the slightest clue what they are doing. They go along to get along. To get ahead and make business contacts. Most of these people, even if they take part in satanic crap, have zero real knowledge of the actual science behind what they do. The psychology of it all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             They like the parties, egoism of the imagery. They never take time to learn the truth of it all.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             No matter what your personal beliefs are, you must try to entertain the beliefs of others to grasp what these people are up to. The "core groups" of these people believe in nothing. No god or devil. They believe in making themselves immortal through science.

                              They don't "believe in nothing". Their 'secret' knowledge is passed through generations, and there are many levels of knowledge and ignorance in the pyramid. Very few know the entire spectrum.

                              <p>
                               Not to get into religion, but I will discuss the philosopher known as Jesus Christ. He lived along the trade routes between China and Rome, so he knew of Buddhism. Reincarnation is part of Buddhism and Judaism. It was removed by the Council of Nicea, likely for the sole purpose of controlling the masses.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               The systems we live under are to control not just our one life with the ego we attach ourselves to, but they seem to be trying to control our karmic debt, which dictates our place when we reincarnate.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               At least that is what it seems like, when you look at the grand view from the ideology of many of these elites.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               My personal feelings about Jesus do not matter in this. I'm here for my own soul. No one else's. I will continue to help those I can, when I am in a position to do so.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               I will not back down. I will not be silent. I will not live in fear. I will induce fear or earn respect.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               We all have addresses. These people will back down or they will see the fruition of a new world disorder, they can not control.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               IF you do understand reincarnation and accept it, you will understand what hell is. To be born again and again in a worst position until you can bring yourself out of it.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               "Heaven" is another dimension of pure thought energy, so to speak. It is what people have called the halls of knowledge, the Akashic records, zero point knowledge.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               If you know what true indigo children are, you will have found that multiple governments have been studying these people for many decades now. The true indigo are being reincarnated with more and more memories of their past incarnations. They are the ones that have literally chosen to return to our space-time, linear existence to try and guide humanity.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               The governments know this. They look for these children. Try to use them. Crush them. Insure they can not position themselves into sectors of society, to implement plans to help humanity in meaningful ways.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               The elites will fail. Earth is the literal battlefield of a war your religions have spoken of for millennia.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               You can look at this from a religious aspect of heaven versus hell. You can look at this from the ancient alien aspect. You can write all of this off as nonsense. I do not care. It is part of these peoples ideology. They do not hide this from you. They make sure you care more about self indulgence, than self exploration and spiritual expansion.

                              Interesting bit about gold insertion into the genome.  Could lend credence believe it not to the David Icke, Gnostic and annunaki contingent.

                              Yes I watched a video on the CERN last year that went to that effect. It's more than a atom crusher.  I remember they wanted to build one in iodate New York a long time ago!

                             <p>
                              I'm lost to why string theory had anything remotely connected to 5G to meta materials.
                             </p>
                             <p>

                              Yes this is for many an inter generational thing. And Dave McGowan touch on this, noting either a military, intelligence,acting or Royal background or multiples of them. They are often abused and often have something to do with a children's charity! When I noticed that the father was an opera singer I was like, yup, check.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              The other day of pizzagate subverse I brought up similar connections with Cathy Oxenburg and Casper Van Diem. Both abused, Cathy a royal, both actors at young ages, etc. 
Mack started acting at age 7
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              They probably have the ability to disassociate during the rituals. And literally think nothing of it when they are signing autographs!
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Immortality through science. Ahh the ((Frankenstein)) trans humanism . So that would make more sense to me about a transhumist use for CERN.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              The movie I watched about CERN i honestly don't remember.

                             <p>
                              Gently entertaining the beliefs of the elite, I agree. But both you and I know what it means to stay down to long in the rabbit hole!?   The other day researching this shit, I stumble on this article about cult killing and it just reminded me of the other two times I went there.
                             </p>

                               I mention 5G to meta-materials, because all of these breakthroughs are connected. All of our modern world has been designed and implemented by virtue of the wealth of a few thousand people. The academia is controlled by another few thousand. It's all interwoven.

                               NASA, DARPA, Skunkworks, Northrop Grumman, Eagleworks, Silicon Valley..............all interwoven. The same minds fund or influence all of these people. Most modern conveniences had funding from the federal government via NASA. Such as the chemicals made by DuPont. The pesticides by Monsanto.

                              <p>
                               Most medical advances are due to military, unethical human experimentation.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               ALL of this crap over the last 100 years, controlled by the same 1000 or so scientists. And the same 1000 or so wealthy elites.

                               The generationalism of their children and all the CEO shuffles does not negate this fact.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               Not to even mention the lodges and fraternities these people all are also part of, which goes into their family bloodlines, tying them back to Charlemagne, Genghis Khan, Solomon.Julius Caesar and a handful of other notable historical figures.  This goes into the useful idiot aspect again. Most masons are good people, but being used. They silently consent to much of this, not knowing what's going on, or even their own writings by men such as Albert Pike and his three world war prophecies.

                               Anyhow, learn the basics of how I-Ching works. You'll gain insight into quantum theory. Learn how the golden ratio applies, you'll gain understanding as to what could in theory be accomplished by controlling the process at the level of particles. Which again goes into meta-materials and molecular engineering, which in turn has given us meta-materials such as carbon fiber. Also has given us the basic premise for building quantum computers. The photonic crystals, which are another meta-materiel, now being used along with Q-Dots, which also are now allowing for color changing paints to be used in commercial areas.

                               All of this is due to unlocking string theory. I know this is severely over-simplification, but that's what I try to do for time saving.

                                 asks many valid, pertinent questions. What can any of us do with the answers? Asking the criminals to stop being criminals is pretty ridiculous. Exposing them, will lead to their own downfall. People will grow sick of the social changes being forced upon the masses, by the few. A tipping point has already occurred. Political correctness for thought policing is a factor to DJT winning. (I do not want to go into politics, just pointing out my personal opinion)
                                </p>

                                 As for simulation theory. We can take evidence in many ways. It is the premise of all circle arguments. I've learned enough that it does seem our reality functions as a computer. Does this negate the philosophical aspect? If we are "SIMS", does it negate our individual responsibility to the earth and future generations? There is no method to escape a cage, when the cage is your entire existence. Now, being so much more than a computer, our "cage" is biological in nature. It is seemingly endless when we observe what little we can. Have we altered the observation, by making an attempt at observing what little we can? What if our "cage" can be escaped, but not by means of any single or combination of technologies?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 I think our universe is more complex than the most advanced simulations humanity will ever be able to produce. Our reality from micro to macro not only functions linearly, but non-linearly. WITH every variable being possibly played out in some aspect.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 I personally accept reincarnation as a fact. I can not offer you proof, nor would I, if I could. I think each of us live out our individual existence attaching ourselves to material objects, in some fashion or another. The ego of our individual existence does not allow us to understand beyond this. I am myself, sitting here typing out these words to you, right now. YET in all other aspects of the non-linear view point, I am you. Your loved ones. Your neighbors. Every other human on earth.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 The word "I" is egotistical, but the only way for me to try to explain this. Detach oneself from the ego point of this, you may grasp this and see how beautiful life really is.
                                </p>

                                 Science is a wonderful tool, but it is just a tool. Men made religions from tools (philosophies) and look where it has gotten us. Men have tried using the tool, science, to disprove some other existence, but continually over look the fact science has proven our thoughts are particles of energy. Energy can not be created or destroyed. It can only change. No one on earth knows how the universe processes that energy, after we shuffle off this mortal coil. Humanity has zero idea of how the universe processes the information of particles.

                                 This fact shows me, there is some form of an afterlife. I do not know, nor do I care what that may be. I personally think reincarnation is the piece that fits in with the question of how does our universe process the energy of our thoughts after we die?

                                  I completely agree. Life is beautiful. Being part of a simulation doesn't make it any less beautiful. In fact the simulation theory makes more sense to me than anything else, Although it's only one piece of the puzzle. Like panspermia it simply kicks the can down the road. Because while it may explain how life got here per se, it still doesn't explain the origination of life, it's the same with sims. Who is the programmer/s.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  That's why I like the gnostic teachings. It goes hand in hand with the simulation theory and panspermia.

                                  We might not be able to escape, nor would we want to! Think Dark City! But we may be able to influence the waves and particles that make up the fabric and beyond of our universe. Like Neo unlocked the secrets of the matrix. Perhaps it is this 2nd law of TD that will help us unlock ours. In as much as energy can not be destroyed nor created, it can, has and will be manipulated by people with esoteric knowledge of it. Think Magick, think spells, think power of positive thinking!
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  That is why I think it's good to not hold onto the negativity that the pizza subject can create. The elite luciferians and their child sacrifices probably don't mind us getting upset at them because it just feeds into their negative energy, like a power grid network can empty into a battery bank. Only making their power more!

                                 <p>
                                  This negativity we need to not resist and allow it flow through us.  like an electrical ground.  It's Similar to the Budhist nonattachment.

                                   Earth has limited resources and humanity has limited time. Men have known this for over a century and post WWII, developed agenda 2030, along the way.

                                   Many know of agenda 2030 and will continue to fight it. Succeed or fail. Those of us making an effort, will not be forgotten by the universe.

                                    Interesting Gen 4:10. Energetic blood of the slain can influence?! The outcomes of future events! In a quantum and post quantum world theory this may be able to be explained! Let's move this to another platform to get some other perspectives.

                                     I do not want to bible thump, nor be attacked for trying to give alternate views of biblical passages, though. There are many passages that can give one insight into our modern world.

                                     Passages about circumcision, once a needed ritual for stopping the spread of STD's. Tithing, once played a pivotal role in social structure. Giving to the community, to preserve during times of trouble. Misused, of course by religious institutions for power and control. The list goes on.

                                     We have all been conditioned to accept the official story or denounce it all, but there is a middle ground. One of free thinking to try and understand the enlightened wisdom of those writers. Divinely influenced or otherwise. That debate I will always avoid. I do not care what someone believes. I am not here for any soul, but my own.

                                       I do think the Gnostic approach of obtaining a personal understanding is what is intended by many, if not all philosophies, including the Abrahamic ones.

                                       I think humanity has words like "god" as catch all's to try and comprehend fourth dimensional existence, one outside of space-time. of pure thought energy. We use the word in reference to monotheistic supreme beings that materialized among men and granted esoteric wisdom upon them. We use the same word to describe beings from the "heavens", being the sky above. We use the word to describe so many various complex concepts. Or we once did.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Now, the word god, is used to laugh off ignorance. To intentionally argue with others for personal validation of our own lack of understandings or desire to pursue those understandings. Some use it as reinforcement of personal beliefs in the universe synchronicity that is observable by anyone that seeks to understand it. Others use it as affirmation of their allegiance with religious institutions, due to various reasons, such as family traditions. There are others that genuinely desire a "superman" to come down to earth and write global wrongs.

                                       So, what form of "god" do we intend when using the word?

                                         It's not that I believe this or not. It is this is the types of thought processes, some of those in positions of power, adhere to. Openly, they'll deny this all day and night. It is so outrageous to think of, most can not comprehend the totality of the various fields of science used to manufacture the devices, they seek to create to attempt this.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         Will they continue needing a physical body?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         Could that form of existence, be what has been written of in countless cultures as, angels, demons, etc?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         Is the entire human experience, including being reincarnated, only part of our evolution? An evolution into become pure conscious energy, that exists in a non-linear fashion?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         Now, if you can visualize this, understand this. Some people seek to expedite this effect. To quantify it for consumerist purposes. To hold "power" over this natural evolution. AND they seek this for themselves, while retaining their personal egos.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         That and that alone is the failure these people refuse to accept.

                                          Are we in some type of parallel universe because I went back to the OP and couldn't find outer discussion!!! Or did the mods disconnect this tangential discussion for the sake of continuity?

                                           Our very thoughts are particles. Controlling that effect, negates the need for massive industries of mind control methods, by virtue of a few machines. Just one small aspect of the psychology of quantum theory.

                                             Personally, I like the man due to the fact, he wrote nothing down. Pure brilliance. He relied on knowing others would write down what he said, from their own personal, world views. At least, I like to think this was intentional.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             The fact there were multiple disciples, all writing down their own recollections of his teachings and experiences. Each carried on their separate ways, after his death. Those teachings spread for over two hundred years,  until the Council of Nicea was formed to solidify the new institution in Jesus name. Only to control his message and image. It took on a life of it's own. Altered accidentally and intentionally over two millennia.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             The only words, alleged to have been spoken by him, that I really think are the most important, "do unto others".
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             Was he a man, influenced by "god". Was he god incarnate? Was he an alien? Perhaps, he was a highly intelligent child, born with the ability to use far more of his brain, than most of us ever will. Who really knows? Was he a time traveler?
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             How would you explain an airplane, let alone how it works to our ancestors, over two thousand years ago?
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             How would you explain the ability to see and mentally influence particle interactions, on a conscious level to our ancestors, only 50 years ago? Let alone two thousand years ago.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             We can write his existence off. What real "proof" is there he existed? Perhaps the pure creation of Tacitus?  The only non-biblical writer known to have mentioned him. His life mirrors mythical beings, such as Mithra, Osiris, to name a few. Is his entire life a fabrication of the institutional church?
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             I think he was a real man. He lived in a place where trade routes from Chine to Rome brought Buddhists into contact with him. He learned of more philosophies than most. He formed a peaceful rebellion against Roman rule at a time when it was needed. His image, stolen and tarnished by the very people claiming head of his house. Altered his words and image as needed to fit whatever era this took place in.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             In my youth I went to church and learned all they had to teach me. They never had answers to my questions. As a teen, I sought out to disprove '"god" and learned all I could. Along the way, I discovered I can not write off Jesus' message of doing kindness for the sole fact of being kind. Not for fear of hell or promises of heaven. Not for benefits in this life or any other. Just to help others, when you can, because you are in a position to do so. That is the influence his teachings have over my life.

                                               You are correct, but look to Josephus' life. He is bias. Although a historian, he was Jewish, as Jesus.

                                                And the Jews say he was hellenized! And his descriptions of the Jews were not always faviorable and have been criticized for that his description of the fall of Jerusalem would make a great movie! I actually have read a bit of his writings a while ago back when I studied the bible prob back in 2003/4 so it's been a while . But I remember enjoying reading it.

                                                 I did wok with a woman when I was 18-20. She always called me Josephus or Joseppi. I never knew why, back then. Now I'm guessing she called me that, because I was always reading crap and talking about shit most of society couldn't care less about. lulz, kinda like as an insult I guess. Who knows.

                                              Something's just have to be believed . I don't have a problem with that. Something plausible can be believed until contradiction comes in a form of a proof. I believe Jesus lived in the 1st century, just like I believe Plato lived in the 5th. I consider most of Christianity based not on Jesus's words but based on Paul's. It's Paulism to me. Paul was perfect for a top down hierarchy, whereas JC liberated with the truth, not about some tribal god but about, but how to treat one another. He proved it over and over again. Prostitutes, lepers, beggars, children, women and his fellow man. He stood up to abusive power and spoke in simple terms to the uneducated! He basically hit it out of the park. The Gnostics wrote that he was married. Some say his lineage lived on in the Catharsis of southwestern France, until they were killed by the ....Church!

                                              Anyway have you ever tried to use your thoughts to alter outcomes or to influence them? What were your results?  I think we all do it naturally but few do it consciously.

                                  <p>
                                   "What's in a name?" You seem to understand the power of words. The origins.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   You understand the "matrix" was cracked long ago. The source code has been manipulated, long before those doing so, understood the ramifications of their actions.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Most that think they possess esoteric knowledge, only possess a very limited, linear, egotistical aspect of it.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Many of these people lack insight and synergy into all the other connections they are manipulating when they think they can take from the "battery" to amplify their own single existence.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Simply put, "they know not, what they do".
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Ever hear of discordia? It is a grand concept when actualized to counter Marxism. I mention discordianism for the fact, words are power. "The devil is in the details".
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   If you sour the battery, what then?
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Too much chaos, breeds a form of order. And vice verse. That is what is going on now with the whole pizzgate thing. These peoples egos need a check and it is happening.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   Lady Liberty is an old goddess, Nemesis. She brings divine hubris to those in need. Even if those in need, do not want it. These people have misused the very gods and goddesses, they now mock. Those "gods and goddesses" are concepts. Ancient words that are infused in all reaches of every aspect of our reality. This does not make those concepts physical beings. But it does make them deep rooted into our psyche.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   This is where understanding quantum entanglement plays in.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   These people are slowly beginning to understand the reality of their words and actions. They still try only to reshape the words to negate personal karmic debt or even group karmic debt. They simply put, refuse to accept the repercussions of their actions.
                                  </p>

                                   The storm only grows and it will continue to built until it encompasses the entire planet.

                                    It seems like the storm is way long in coming.

                                    I don't know about that. If you consider that from the Sumers and down, and def before(as in the megalithic cultures, and perhaps before them) the power of the elite to control has been steadfast. They follow very simple rules to keep that power. I don't believe that they will have some sort of karmic reckoning, unless you consider a slave revolt that has the great potential of reducing our lives to a Paleolithic lifestyle, the elites day in karma court!
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    The pizza gate, the great awakening and the liberation of knowledge from the elites has made some of the smarter slaves angry, resistant to further programming.  Whether through the hubris of the elite, the revolt of the slaves, or deux in machina a collapse will result in the end of all this. Will the survivors be able run operation paperclip 2.0  and gather the string theorists and the meta material researchers and create a better world that will allow us to benefit from what is now known to a few?

                                    A few people who I have read believe that humans have run the race and have fallen short of the finish line!! Others I've talked to, not read, try to convince me that the collapse will bring about a Phoenix moment.  Still others insist that vast numbers of humanity will be eradicated through some mechanism and the elite will live free and fancy free!
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    The advanced scientific outlook needs to at least prepare on pragmatic level for the economic collapse!

                                     I consider myself a sovereign entity. Not to be confused with sovereign citizen. My actions dictate my current existence and will affect my future incarnations. What that means, I am not completely certain, but I do know, "to do unto others, as you would have done to you", is the full of the law. Follow that and you have the inertia of the universe to guide you.

                  I agree after reading the Bl it sure sounds like good ole Hill.  Who else is famous for her emails etc.  A few others replied it was her too.  They get into a lot of hot water, but the never get cooked.  Barbara Bush was involved as well, in Rainbow Cultural Garden.   Who knows what really happened to them and No name.

            I remember the Newsweek article and instantly thought about MK Ultra stories and trauma induced disassociation. In this case imagery and not real life subjects and context were used.  I can only imagine a clockwork orange like situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a lot science can do to the brain.  There is a therapist that I know who uses neural feedback and magnets to help Vets deal with PTSD. And the use of imagery is part of the therapy.
           </p>
           <p>
            So picture it in reverse. Using snuff films and torture videos to induce rather than cure PTSD.

            But yea I def forgot about this thanks I'm going to look him up.

             In this video doc about psychopaths, there is a bit where a doctor shows people with the diagnosis these types of videos, and discovered they have low arousal.

             Seems like a screening device to me, as well as probably leading towards worse experiments we don't know about yet.

              I tried looking up the artvoice piece on his med license hearing but I couldn't
              <a href="https://artvoice.com/2018/06/27/sex-cult-doctor-brandon-porters-medical-licensing-revocation-hearing-today/">

              it. If he hasn't lost his license then well, then we'll what can you say?
             </p>
             <p>
              Think about what you would do! Go to South America. And change your identity. What other options are there? The other doctor D.Roberts is working out of a day spa suite doesn't accept any insurance, like a cash only joint. Yea I'm sure people are lining up.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I'm surprised with is no confirmed mysterious deaths of anyone.

              Let's face it we are dealing with straight up Mexican fucking cartel shit. And big time sexual extortion and running children and CP. yet no suicides no plane crashes, no heart attacks....unless I missed something?
