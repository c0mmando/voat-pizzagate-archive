           I had a lucid dream last night, and it was pretty amazing. In the dream, I meditated on #Pizzagate and how it hasn't exploded onto the map yet. It came to me that although it is amazing we all put in this effort to research the subject, but we have yet to feed it to the masses in an aggressive way. I'm not talking physical aggression - beating people up and what not; no, I'm talking about being aggressive intellectually and vocally. If you remember during the presidential campaigning InfoWars did a campaign where Alex Jones got random people, during live news interviews, to yell "Bill Clinton is a rapist." This is exactly what we need to do. We need to act as if this is a campaign and force feed it into the MSM. This will truly change the game. The sycophantic media has already tried to sweep this under the rug with interviews with some of these pedophiles. We must "fire back" with our own form of peaceful intervention. Put up fliers, during a news interview hold up pizzagate signs and yell "pizzagate is real think of the children!" We must do everything to peacefully expose this.
