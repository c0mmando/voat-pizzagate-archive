            If this is true, and I assume those pictures don't lie, this will set back so many claims by sexually abused Children not only in the MJ case, but actually everywhere.  People will have the seed planted into their minds.  This is setting the stage for possible coming claims against Steven S and George L and friends.  There is a lot at stake for Pedowood here.

            And then there was Gimme Safecuck's claim that Jackson took him on a 'honeymoon' to Eurodisney in 1989 after their alleged mock wedding, the only problem being Eurodisney didn't open until 1992, by which time Safecuck himself admits Jackson had no more contact with him.  Whoops!

            Interesting. I just watched part 1 before reading this. My initial reaction was that for children who were abused they sure don’t seem very traumatized or at all upset by it.  Also the parents who are interviewed do not seem upset at all. One mother laughing and excited to relive the story of how their son was Jackson’s best friend. I remain undecided on MJ but I did find the lack of emotion in the documentary suspicious and now time frames don’t line up?  To quote Comey... “So many question”
