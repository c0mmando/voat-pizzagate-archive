            Great idea. When I have the time I will create blog posts on these such things. If the basement issue has been debunked here then its a good way to prove that people care about debunking or proving things,  we dont just blindly believe stuff or make stuff up. It adds to the validity if we prove that pizzagate researchers are not looneys as the MSM would have you believe. ALL articles I've read so far focus on the non existent basement and the CRAZY UNHINGED SCARY DANGEROUS guy who fired a shot in comet ping pong. However they fail to mention the hard drive he apparently destroyed in a fluke with that one shot. Ahem.

            I've been watching this thread now for 10 minutes or so and it died at least for now.  I think that's an AWS trick.

            However, this methodologicial analysis is very good.  I agree with the OP completely.  Nice work!

            Snopes is a great start for reviews, top of the hierarchy (not for me, but of course you know what I mean).

            I remember the day The 'Podesta e-mails' were posted.  And there were quick revelations about the FBI pedo symbols that cinched it for me as being something that needed to be explored.  Undoutedly, completely, dodgy.

            Alefantis did not lie about Comet not having a basement.  It does not.   His other restaurant Buck's does have a basement.  However, people were not making claims about Buck's basement.

            Can you put together a summary of Pizzagate that does not lead to Pizzagate being debunked?

             I'm upvoating you only  because this whole basement thing has always been a red herring for pizzagate.  CPP does not have a basement but Bucks does. The. End.

             That's true, but you'd expect a normal response to be like the one you just gave. "I don't have a basement at Comet, but I do at Buck's two doors away". No, he didn't want any mention of a basement being made.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't think a basement was ever needed at Comet anyway. I think if they used that place for anything nefarious it would have simply been held in the back room. Too much was made of that location when there are multiple ones involved or ones that could be involved that have had little attention.
