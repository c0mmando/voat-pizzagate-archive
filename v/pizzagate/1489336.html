            But one should remember that something that seems clickbaity like what I have given you below, is actually reality smacking you in the face. If you heard about Pizzagate without discovering it for yourself, you would think that it is a clickbait bullshit article. You have to be good at sifting through the bullshit.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Here is the even bigger picture :)
           </p>
           <p>
            I have studied the elite for 20 years. Pizzagate isn't wholly new to me, but the scale took me aback. The elite sacrifice children for a reason. It is modern worship of Saturn/Isis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the whole story of Pizzagate for anyone interested. The truth is stranger than fiction. The Scottish Masonic Order and their affiliates rule our planet. They are a direct continuation of the Brotherhood of Amon Ra that existed in Egypt 3500 years ago. Knights Templar, Medici's, Pheonicians were just a couple of the links in between. Our leaders are obsessed with Egyptian symbolism, specifically the story of Isis and Osiris. It's basically pretty cool math/geometry, but they have perverted it and made it into an esoteric movement. These people literally invented creationism and our religions. The Star of David is a mathematical symbol.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many people mistakenly appropriate the 6660 inches on the Washington Monument to the Devil/Satanic worship. It is actually a reference to 6/5th's. 6660 inches in feet is 555. This is a not a mistake. The foot was literally defined with this in mind. To these crazy ass mother fuckers, 6 and 5 represent the macrocosm and the microcosm.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here you go (explore the Egyptian/mathematical symbolism through art and architecture of the past 2 thousand years):

           </p>
           <p>
            Please refrain from calling me a shill because that sounds so fucking crazy. I know what it sounds like.
            <strong>
             Downvote me if you think it is a coincidence the the latitude of the King's Chamber at the pyramids at Giza is the speed of light (in m/s), accurate to at least 6 digits. You would have to think Pizzagate is a coincidence too.
            </strong>
            Meter was defined in 1800, but it was merely rediscovered. It is a length ingrained into the architecture of our solar system, as any student of Masonry would learn. Here is the King's chamber when measured in meters:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/wp-content/uploads/KingsChamber555.jpg">
             http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/wp-content/uploads/KingsChamber555.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the meter isn't so arbitrary after all, if it is being used to encode the golden ratio in Egypt, thousands of years before the System International. By the way, the perimeter of the chamber's base is 10 pi meters. They squared the circle at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Numerology and mythology seem pretty fucking retarded, and they are, but our leaders fucking love it. You have to understand it, in order to understand our current situation, and them. It goes back thousands of years. If there is anything that you guys should be learning through Pizzagate, it is that many of the men and the women with the tin foil hats on, were preaching reality in your face (to a limit- I think that limit is aliens, but I am open minded). I think that it can be easy to try to explain this Egyptian symbolism as artistic influence, but major historic figures have gone out of their fucking way to make a point of it (as you will see in the first video).
           </p>
           <p>
            Last thing, FUCK THE BROTHERHOOD OF AMON RA. They sacrifice children like sheep.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just remember that at heart, humans are good. These videos will make you question reality, but we have each others' backs.
           </p>
           <p>
            You guy's have found the tippy tip of the iceberg. This is all of the rest that I have discovered in my 20 years. Goodluck.

             The meter bit might be a bit of a jump but the rest of it is pretty solid looking at first glance. My summary is basically golden ratio and astrological crap sure. Meter, ppprrrrooobbly not.
