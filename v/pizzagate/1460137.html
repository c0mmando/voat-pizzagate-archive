<p>I resisted the urge to write something for days now, but it just becomes too much to not do it.
You all do a honorable job of digging and should really feel proud to be part of a resistance that has no historical comparison. It\'s just because of the age of information that we are as plebs are able to collaborate against the sheer unbelievable amount of conspiracy that seems to go on.</p>
<p>Im not that good at digging but I tend to think strategically and have a background in psychology, and I see a huge lack of strategical thinking on our part, even while actions like the memewars are genius.</p>
<p>It is clear that we are under observation and infiltration of at least some assets of JTRIG or CTR, and it a futile effort to try to identify many of em just due to the structure of our activist movement.
We are completely decentralised with temporary accumulations in threads &amp; boards that get struck down, led off course or spammed into oblivion like playing whack-a-mole, only we are the moles.</p>
<p>This decentralisation is our biggest strength, because we are legion, we are hydra. Silencing an activist by PSYOP or blatant murder is still a resource costly solution for them they only can afford for key targets. They can\'t get us all. This makes aggregation of data difficult but I don\'t see many other options. It is highly possible that every of our attempt of public data aggregation or analysation will become corrupted. Which is why I\'d take efforts like the attempts of creating wikis with a grain of salt. 
We <strong>have</strong> to stay decentralised, there are already anons that vanished (most probably).
I spent (too) much time reading through leaked stuff on GCHQ JTRIG, NSA and other alphabet soups orgs capabilities, and while they are powerful they are not omnipotent. I will list some of their skills and opportunities, for spreading of information and clarity:</p>
<p>They can obviously access all the modern social media like twitter facebook instagram with the capability of inserting content and removing content. They basically own reddit and can track everybody of us, that isn\'t highly invested into anonymity. What makes you safe is being uninteristing.
In terms of direct malware attacks there is one quote I\'d like to share: &quot;If we can get them to click on a link coming to us, we own them&quot; so be suspicious of popping up newcomers that want to just come on this one website. Everything can be screenshot, most information is on well known sites or social media. These newcomers are aswell the people that want us to accumulate effort into single places, which is highly unfavourable of our core strengths. They already learned stuff from us, where to clear tracks. What do you think why the Scottland Yard suddenly gets new funding for the Mc Cann case? Who is in charge of them? And the people that command the scottland yard are whose friends? They are leading the prosecutors towards europe to keep em away from them and keep em busy.
They can not chase bees, they are only hundreds, and we are thousands, but they can nuke a wiki. Pardon for repetition, I just want to make my point clear. We are fighting billionaires, we have to be clever, or people disappear.</p>
<p>Now on topic: These people we are fighting to expose, are all sharing a solipsistic worldview, like a fellow goat just explained really decently (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458322/7048008">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1458322/7048008)</a>) They only see victims, or opponents and operate on this exact view. They make mistakes, become cocky, am egoistic and arrogant. This is maybe obvious in some cases likes James Alefantis or John Podestas blatant mockery in plain sight, but it is important to keep in mind for the choice of modus operandi that they tend to give away information freely, again like Alefantis. Thing is they control basically the whole media today and they will only react defensively once they feel threatened. 
What do you think they do right now? Anally penetrating a toddler? I don\'t think so, they are highly alert and most probably destroy evidence where they can, demolish their easiest to find black sites, bleaching every surface and setting it on fire afterwards. Just remember how they operate on the Comet Ping Pong front. They even manipulate the traffic cam. I am relatively certain we will not be fast enough for many evidence to be found. Next thing is they control all 4 bases of our society, most importantly the judicative and the media. It will be really hard to reach more people for us, there are methods for us though to counter that. What we cant counter is the prosecution problem though. The only option that will not ultimately be a pirrhus victory with most of them getting away freely is open civil disobedience / disorder / revolt. We have to activate so many people that we finally can free our  society of these inhumans. </p>
<p>To become concrete: We have to get rid of the idea that the Comet Ping Pong will lead to prosecution, there is nothing left to be found physically on this place almost certainly, and there will be no prosecution, because there is no power that can justice these inhumans except a gallow. What will lead to the juicy bits? I don\'t know, but I tend to think psychologically as I said: let them lead us to where they don\'t want us. The amount of people that suicided or disappeared at critical timeframes in Clinton prosecution attempts is incredible. As I said, they will always target keytargets to save resources, and they will only react when feeling threatened. We need to generate timelines of events of the Clinton Foundation and put in each and every person that died/disappeared at the correct position on the timeline and subject and we will start to see a pattern what kind of operation they tend to protect the most. Also helpful is filling the subjects in the Clinton Foundation with convicted sex offenders and check every Clinton Foundation associate/donor if there were charges against them that didnt follow through because people disappeared. This is the biggest smoking gun we can have, if we just accumulate the sheer amount of circumstancial death that surrounds them. 
I suggest that in the spirit of staying decentralised that we produce pics of single timelines of single persons, each person can collect easily to accumulate them themselves. </p>
<p>What we can do aswell is weakening their grip on the media by starting to dig towards the media key persons the clintons control, because they are most likely involved. My best bet for now is the NY Times guy that yells the loudest atm at fake news that was working in the BBC and sabotaging when that british pedo billionaire (help me with the name pls) was a non-topic until he died.</p>
<p>Also we can easily use the Fake News tag against them, because the Donald-people are still activated. They just released the biggest Streisand Effect munitions ever, and it will be glorious if we Meme them to the ground about how our Mainstream Media is just FAKE NEWS.
There are so many topics they just don\'t even touch. 2 Months ago the biggest labour strike in WORLD HISTORY happened in India, guess you didnt even hear of it, eh? And so much more, that I bet myself didnt even hear. FAKE NEWS KEK</p>
<p>What we have to be careful with though is our attempts at spreading information, we are long way over into it than easily denyable code speech and art collection. We will damage our efforts if we continue to use this as main munitions at activating assets. 
It is mandatory from a psychological viewpoint to first and foremost involve the peoples emotions that we want to activate. Donald Trump knows this. Instead of showing podesta emails ask: Did you know there are over a dozen CONVICTED type 3 sex offenders working directly under Clinton or in direct vicinity in her Foundation, and that Bill Clinton is even one of them with his best buddy Eppstein? here I show you the list, what they did, what they were convicted for and what sentence they got. Here look at this &quot;Art&quot; John Podesta collects, looks like Trauma therapy doesnt it? Oh and then theres this woman, and this woman and this they all work in child rescue organisations, this on in haiti, but were convicted of sex offenses. and so on. Hard facts.</p>
<p>While soft evidence, like sorros eyes and the other coindices are interesting and can lead to cross referencing suspicions where we can continue digging, they will not help us in publicity work, because most people are not as freethinking as we are, use less phantasy and are fighting their own devil, something called &quot;reduction of cognitive dissonance&quot;.
Our opinions and beliefs are core of our personality traits, some more some less, and the older and deeper a thought is, the harder is it for people to witness reality that contradicts these thoughts. If you always were told your best news source is BBC, and am told BBC lies, your brain will jump to the conclusion that the idea coming from the outside is hostile and discredit it. &quot;It cant be because it goes against my belief, this leads you have to be a liar and not them&quot; We have to be careful at this immense level of conspiracy to not instantly trigger the peoples cognitive dissonance, but slowly introduce them to the idea of things being wrong.</p>
<p>That directly leads me to our options of distribution. Again our strength is decentralisation. Order a 100 1gb usb sticks, and let us collaborate our best writers on an introductory paper with all the images on why the clinton foundation is filled with sex offenders, put it on the sticks and let them laying around in Star Bucks and whatever with a big red edding READ ME, SHARE THIS INFO. They are only controlling the infrastructure here in the web, they can not follow hardware.</p>
<p>Introduce people verbally and ask them to introduce to others, build your own pyramid scheme. We need to wake up the people, because the media wont.
I hope my thoughts help</p>',

            Something like what they sell at PocketMaps.com would be far more effective. If you wanted to drop things randomly around as you go even a bunch of inexpensive business cards would at least number in the hundreds.

            Everyone should aggregate as much information as possible and keep it for their investigation. Only when it's enough to completely break it open (I'm talking hard evidence, not connections) should we bring it all out.

             The amount of people that suicided or disappeared at critical timeframes in Clinton prosecution attempts is incredible. As I said, they will always target keytargets to save resources, and they will only react when feeling threatened. We need to generate timelines of events of the Clinton Foundation and put in each and every person that died/disappeared at the correct position on the timeline and subject and we will start to see a pattern what kind of operation they tend to protect the most.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I think this should be a next step. We need a complete timeline on when people died under suspicious circumstances, what they were doing at the time, and what the Foundation did around the time (both immediately before and after).
           </p>
           <p>
            After we do that I'd think the financial angle should produce something as well.

            Fair observations. I still feel that just keeping pushing back on everything is a valid way to undermine them. It's definitely gotten a lot more people to listen than years back. They've been pushing an agenda of globalization that is starting to fall on deaf ears finally. Just watching people who have pursued this for a living that worked in and around the justice system be ignored and then disappear is kind of a statement against doing it on our own. The power is in the numbers. They don't have to be clever when they control everything from the media to the companies to the government, that was proven all throughout the Bill Clinton administration - every public outrage led to no convictions. But I agree that resurfacing all of those things is to our advantage.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are three things they've used historically to undermine any public awareness to their illegal activities (across the board): the illusion that they are good people doing good work, that the DOJ, CIA, and others are a force for good, and that they are better than the average citizen and therefore should be put/kept in charge. These are the three things we need to continue to chip away at to get others to become aware that none of these things have been true for decades, especially with this crew. Unless one of us is in a position to directly call for an investigation, they won't even respond to us, and if we become a problem or get too close, they will get rid of us - that's what they do. I highly recommend staying in the light - they can only operate in the darkness.

            "We have to be careful at this immense level of conspiracy to not instantly trigger the peoples cognitive dissonance, but slowly introduce them to the idea of things being wrong."
I see where you are coming from. I think that is a misconception however. The best wakeup call is shock. We've tried slowly wakeing people up, exposing this and that, debating politics trying to slowly move them a bit here and there.
This here is a meal best served piping hot. The media is in full war mode labelling everything fake. They may even be short of major censorship.
We have the momentum. The media is at its lowest trustworthyness. This is the time to finish them off. They are down. Don't let them get back up.
We have the streisand effect additionaly. Let's spread the truth. Kek will shine the light praise be upon him.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you can hammer out battle plans and organisational structures and task forces and everything you can come up with that's great.
You sound very organized and thoughtful.
In poker terms this is the all-in moment. We have to call them on their "fake news" and pedophilia cover up.
Our hand is the nuts. And we have them by the nuts. Literaly. We have them where we want them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also the election is over. We won. What motive would we have NOW to make anything up?
Shock, Logic, facts, emotion, persistance, a movement, streisand effect, free speech, Kek.
It's a royal flush.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you understand NLP SHOCK is everything in convincing. See the handshake induction.

            From another conversation on this voat sub I see that I'm probably a little older than the norm here. For those who may not remember, Rathergate was a big deal in its time, it was the first crowdsourced investigation that I was aware of. Not sure what revisionist history says, but I watched it unfold in real time and it significantly contributed to the downfall of Dan Rather, who was a teller of lies cloaked as mainstream news.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are some here who are waiting for the media to cover pizzagate, but rathergate shows that the media won't cover this until the voice of the people shame them into it. I'm grateful to see the eyes of the internet turn toward pizzagate. This target is larger, more nebulous, and more powerful, but I've seen what the light of truth can do when people use it as a laser against evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's important to ask yourself the serious question of what do you have to lose in this investigation? What do you have to lose by sharing what you know? Reputation? Friends? Employment opportunities? Perhaps your life? All true, perhaps. If you are fearful, use anonymity. If you don't trust on-line anonymity, consider paper leaflet drops. Make them your own. Make them simple. Make them. Make them hear.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is safety in numbers, so boldness in the face of fear actually protects you in the long run. This won't be easy. I think we are in for the longest and hardest battle for our lives with pizzagate. Stay fluid. Gird yourselves, and do not grow weary of doing good.

            Thank you for your brilliant post. Have you considered if this whole thing is a control scheme to look into the trends leading up to certain high level paedophile arrests. It's only good for control if you know it will be used if you step out of line, so at least some of the powerful that have been convicted must have broken ranks to have been made an example of. A small example is Jeffrey Epstien he must have needed a lesson taught to him when he got his 14 month slap on the wrist.

            Regarding shill disinformation operation: That basement of Comet Ping Pong starts to seem fishy to me. No other topic has even been posted thrice, only very few were double, but this goes into the dozen. Since it is quite probable that they cleansed the place already this is an obvious dead end they really seem interested in us investing resources into it because they can easily refute it by the media in the next step of operation Fake News, when they start to
            <strong>
             have
            </strong>
            to adress the topic, the basement thing will be the first thing explained. "It's just our party room in the back, that is three steps down, haha, its listed as second floor because of marketing ;) these silly trolls, and this one hacker called 4chan".

           <p>
            There must be loads of people that can and are willing to help. But are afraid of not being capable/not knowing how to do it safe and anonymous.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can we have BROCHURES that also have SPECIFIC GUIDELINES HOW TO PUBLISH/LEAK INFO ANONYMOUS?
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel brochures like that could also include specific hints asking for information about court records acountancy you name it. Evrybody has family they could hand this to, evrybody knows someone that can help.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many victims will be afraid to come out and name names.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even paid shills can be invited to leak how they have been setup to do what they do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even satanist that have seen enough and want to see this stopped, must be out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            They keep this info to be able to blackmail. So there will be at least 100 times more proof out there than we need to stop it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hope to hear more creative sugestions on how we can get that info, as quick and easy as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            Peace and love to all helping to end this.

            What is important is I can imagine situations that would explain this language. If John Podesta claims he plans to open a fast food franchise and was planning it with a friend over some drinks, that could explain scribbles on a handkerchief that are pizza related. We have enough found though to know they are in it anyway, even if some of the emails are harmless. What email I think is harmless for example is the walnut, since some of them are known hobby chefs.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hotdog stand in Hawaii is clear codespeech though, id bet money on that, aswell as the 1 hour pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are also refutable though. "I was just imagining an easier life in a stressful situation, Id love to have a hot dog business and love Hawaii",
"We literally ate pizza, and I only had 1 hour lunch break in between 2 meetings".
           </p>
           <p>
            Why I think they use codespeech that is obvious, being unbelievable careless in face of the prosecution they would have to face if they get revealed:
           </p>
           <p>
            There are multiple explanations:
           </p>
           <p>
            In case of Alefantis, and Tony Podesta, as I said they are self certain individuals that are arrogant and see other people as victims primarily. If you notice you can get away with something socially negatively connotated, you get an adrenaline rush (and dopamine). Since pedophiles are highly urge driven individuals, they will soon come back to reexperience this rush, and start to leave traces, inside jokes and metaphors as mockery and sign of dominance. LOOK AT ME YOU FOOLS, IM HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT. It is a form of power to exercise over your surroundings.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is well documented behaviour of some convicted pedophiles and serial killers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also: carelessness: nobody, not even sociopaths, can be aware and alert 100% of the time. A permanently tensed bow starts to wear out, as one says. This leads to mistakes.
           </p>
           <p>
            They may also lower their guard, because they feel safe, because they use a connection they deem to be safe, after all they worked their way up to be in or close to the government of the fucking united states of america.
           </p>
           <p>
            And then of course is stupidity. Our society is a bell curve, and not only we, also pedophiles have to abide the normal gaussian distribution. Some are smarter, few are genius, some are simple, few are stupid.
           </p>
           <p>
            We cannot evidence code speech, but that isn't necessary anymore anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have hard evidence of them doing this shit.

             Yes!! Hiding in plain sight! The paedophilia symbols on businesses and foundations is what did it for me. You cannot tell me it was by accident. Those who know, KNOW!!! it's like a welcome mat! Because it's such a taboo subject people turn their head. That is exactly how it grows. And it is huge!!! Time to turn on the light and watch the roaches scatter!!!

            It is best to buy them at the local store in smaller badges or at different places. Think like a criminal, because they probably will make you one. Not using the internet or mobile phones is Intelligence biggest enemy

            I think research has to go where it will. But I can see the need to distinguish between the hard evidence and the "creepy" and weird softer stuff, obviously both help to paint a picture though, both are valid.  And remember that do we have any evidence of Podesta or Alefantis sexually abusing children? No.  What we have is clear evidence that they enjoy the subject and have suspicious encrypted files and likely run a kidnapping ring etc...  So I think that we should try and split the research to a degree, but obviously there is going to be more of the less hard stuff and if a prosecutor is not going to action this, then does the hard stuff matter?  Also people do get convicted in court and the court of public opinion based on circumstantial character traits.
           </p>
           <p>
            No the real question though is if "They" never act, then what will it take to make people rise up and take back the power?!  Assuming we even can.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we can't get the system to work for us (it would be a first), and if we aren't going to do a violent overthrow, maybe there is a 3rd option!
           </p>
           <p>
            All Government is based on documents and agreements and public support and perhaps money.
But what is stopping the people from generating a document, some inspirational magna carta like document declaring our sovereignty around the world and unifying insisting that this be recognized as authority?!  I think nothing!
           </p>
           <p>
            We could try and beat them to making a NWO, a one world government by grass rooting it, a sort of global anti-globalist elitist movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            This could be something that the people of each country forces the governments to sign on to and it could install authority in a police force that watches the elite, those above the law!  The basic truth is that the police protects from criminals at the bottom of society but does little to protect society from the criminals at the top as they ot-rank and often control the law at all levels.
           </p>
           <p>
            This could be the liberation of humanity, if done right, and if done!
           </p>
           <p>
            To clarify, I am suggesting that a type of constitution for the people, with ability to provide some degree of global authority, but not actually the total supplanting of countries governments, but rather ensuring that they serve the people and are not corrupted, sort of like interpol if interpol actually stopped the likes of the Rothschilds, Rockefeller's, Soros, Clintons, Bushes etc...

             I think that any real and lasting solution will have to be something which transcends our current system rather than something which serves to replace or improve upon the existing one. Whenever you have a centralization of power, there will exist the potential to corrupt the entire system. We will need something which decentralizes power and which rests upon some very basic principles. In a very real sense, this is already occurring:

             I am sadly too cynic already to see that happening, but it would be the most bold, genius, collaborative effort of humankind and first and foremost breathed and lived open source movement.

              Yes, but we have to do more than just kill them, we need grass roots established sovereignty which stops this kind of thing from happening automatically again!
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's start it here and now...
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               The powerful won't rules themselves, we need authority and even some budget (modest tax?) to Police the police.
              </li>
              <li>
               We need elections which are fair, this means monitored and that the candidates are not unreasonably limited.
              </li>
              <li>
               Democracy is not an elected dictatorship, elected officials can be recalled and removed from power if they act outside of their mandate, they must serve the people's wishes whenever possible and best and noble interests when not in the majority's wishes.  Anything that is not in the interest of democracy is invalid and is done as a powerless citizen and not with the authority of the government.
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              I am sure much more could be added, but it could be done in such a way that it is hard to fault, it is about anti-corruption, fair elections and limiting countries that claim to be democratic, to democratic powers.

               I can imagine open vote by PGP key of an online government that can instantly get blocked with distrust votings if enough accumulate. That would be a world worth being politically active in.

             I like the premise, but we have to be smarter than they are. There needs to be a benign entrance into people's worlds. Something like Bejeweled of Words with Friends. Then hit them all with it at once.

              You are right, your suggestion is a probable answer to that tactic, but if they start that, we will start to print out the shit and leave it laying around. What will they do? Start monitoring printer usage? Fuck you, then I handwrite it.

            People try to strategize too much.  Just hit the battlefield and go nuts till we get somewhere.  Dont stop long enough for them to adjust their tactics quick enough.  We are more agile than them and we are using new methods they dont understand.

             I would like to have your post removed.  There is no place in this discussion for racism.  There are a whole lot of pedo Catholic priests don't forget, and a whole lot of WASPs too - Sandusky for example.
             <br/>
             So take it somewhere else.

               that's not true - a no tolerance for anything promoting violence or vigilante justice is being discussed now by mods.  This isn't 4chan, this is a public forum with an easily opened gate, which means that certain things like racism and violence which is sometimes associated with far alt right forums will do more harm for this topic than the temporary muting of people's free speech to be violence prone and/or racists.  They are welcome to do that on other forums.

                The only limit on free speech  -- legally, and by constitutional definition -- is when the speech incites or could incite physical violence.
               </p>
               <p>
                If voat wants to make it and stay afloat as a viable speech and information forum, the legal definition of free speech should be kept and people should just learn to grow a thicker skin toward speech they 'dislike'.
               </p>
               <p>
                In other words, free speech is for the speech we don't like, not for the speech we agree with.   Merely racist or distasteful speech should NOT be banned. Free speech is a bulwark of any investigation and of any sane society.   It should not be tampered with (unless, as I said, it will result in violence).  We need free speech  - speech that is distasteful, unpleasant, or even ugly -- to be allowed in this way to keep civil society.

                 other forums on Voat can do different things - this forum has a benefit from staying away from race baiting, vigilante justice, violence type comments because of it's specific purpose.
There are plenty of places for people to exercise their speech, this is about investigating pizzagate.
I'm not going to argue with you, if you don't get it, so be it.

              No argument here. But remember that the Jew behind the curtain only has power because we Goyim follow him and his systems. When we reject the Jew, the Jew becomes powerless very quickly.

               I understand your thinking, and while strategically accurate you sabotage the operation if your refer to them as Jew, because it triggers protectionist reactions about religious freedom and antifaschistoid indoctrinations and so on.

              <p>
               They are guilty regardless of their religion, it isn't necessary in this context even though I know of the kind of Zionist conspiracy you refer to. It is even way stronger denied by the majority than pizzagate. That is said without evaluating it, I personally am not really buying it, but tolerating.

               We have to work together for the greater good, and that is a polarising topic you are raising.

                Let me explain to you what pizzagate is about: It is not just another pedo scandal. It is about the fact that the world's gentile frontmen in world politics are all being blackmailed and extorted by their semitic masters. If you are not interested in naming the master then you miss the whole point.

                 That'd be a normal move of PSYOP to distract and troll, but it's an ongoing conspiracy in 8chan for years now, one can't contain it. The only real method of completely ruining all agents efforts I've found is forcing completely constructive dialogue. Everybody who wants to abort, reroute, sabotage, clutter, red herring/disinfo, emotionalise the discussion is easily spotted this way.
