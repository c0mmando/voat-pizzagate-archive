<p>Holly testified that,  Morris attempted to molest her in the following incident: One night Maureene and Morris were sitting drinking wine etc etc ” the brief says. “[Holly] was with them.  Maureene went to bed and Holly stayed up with Morris . Morris kept offering Holly wine, some of which she accepted.”</p>
<p>Holly testified that she declined, choosing to go to bed instead.</p>
<p>“She went to her room and then went into the bathroom,” the document says. “Looking out the window, she saw Morris in the bushes beside the bathroom window looking in. She said ‘Morris, is that you’, but he said nothing and ran away.”</p>
<p>Two months later, things got worse.</p>
<p>“Morris entered [Holly’s] room  the document says. “He was in his underwear and he sat on the bed where Holly was lying on her stomach facing away from the door. He touched her on the back and woke her up. He told her that he had brough her a present, and he presented her with a vibrator. He plugged it in and said he had brought it to her. He proceeded to rub it on her back and said ‘Let me show you how to use it.\'”</p>
<p>According to Holly’s testimony, she declined, but Morris proceeded anyway.</p>
<p>He started to place it between her legs when she raised her voice and said no loudly,” according to the brief.</p>

            And this was from court documents from 1979! If Morris was brazen enough to attempt to molest his own stepdaughter (Holly testified it occurred in 1977), what's the likelihood that was not his first victim?? Now we're in 2018 &amp; I shudder at how many more children he's victimized.

To find out that Pedos run it is no surprise 
It is filled with crooked lawyers pushing US toward socialism and big governement

            Yes, nasty story indeed.  Julian Bond headed SPLC before Morris Dees. I am really bummed out over this.  We used to send money but I started having suspicions so I stopped donating along with all the others.  So sad.  It was a good idea.  Helping others.  They have infiltrated so many.

                It all goes in the garbage now.  I receive all kinds of mail still from Pelosi Schumer Durbin Quigley you name it and the DNC still after not sending money to these people for about 2 years.  What a joke.  Also ALL donations have ended.  Others must do the same.  Give to your local food pantry.
