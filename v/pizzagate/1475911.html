<p>Furman is President of the Furman Foundation, Inc. The foundation is a major donor to the George Soros-backed Tides Center and the Media Matters for America, a left-leaning center for journalism founded by author David Brock</p>
<p>In December 2003, Furman attended a gathering in New York City put together by Erica Payne in order to watch a screening of Rob Stein’s PowerPoint presentation, The Conservative Message Machine Money Matrix, together with George Soros, Peter Lewis, David Brock, John Podesta and New Jersey governor Jon Corzine. After the presentation, Furman agreed in front of the group to donate more than $25,000 to fund Stein to conduct a research project to determine “what kind of groups the Left needed to fund”.[3]</p>
<p>At the second meeting of the Democracy Alliance in October 2005, Furman “demanded to know why the alliance wasn’t creating a ‘nerve center’ that could book progressives on TV news shows”.</p>

<p>I\'m not sure if Gail Furman, her sons, the Furman Foundation or the Furman Foundation school has been brought up before regarding PizzaGate - if not, it appears to be another intertwined connection.</p>
<p>I suspect more dirt and depth can be found on this path.</p>',
