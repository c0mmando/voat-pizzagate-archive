The claims were made during a roundtable discussion which was recorded and re-broadcast by Nathan Stolpman of Lift the Veil (who was himself involved in the same discussion.) Stolpman later made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeSfDOvSg10&amp;t=380s">three-hour video </a>centred on Defango\'s admission.  On the later video, Defango is heard making his admission from 35:27-38:00. During Stolpman\'s three-hour broadcast (which accepts live calls), Defango then rang in to the show and was questioned in a hostile way by Stolpman (2:23:00-2:40.00). Although Defango does not back down from his claim linking the Cicada group to Q he does claim it is old news and goes on to try to justify his involvement with the project.
Defango claims first to have heard of the Q Anon project at the hacker convention, <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-17/dc-17-schedule.html">Defcon</a>, which ran from July 30th-August 2nd. He claims it was presented to him there as &quot;the next big thing&quot; and it was from that point his involvement began.
As Stolpman indicates at various points, Defango is not necessarily a reliable source. However, the link between Cicada and Q Anon seems plausible. Defango presents Cicada, (viewed by some as a CIA recruitment tool) as a vehicle for the best minds to solve problems. He presents the Q Anon project as a problem-solving extension of this, using the Socratic method and the puzzle-format as a &quot;way to get people excited&quot; with the ultimate aim of getting out important information.
Whatever about the accuracy of Defango\'s account, it would seem that the Q psyop is either over or is being moved into a new phase. The fervent Q-supporting stickies on voat have gone (why is that?), the Q posts have slid far down the forum and we are hearing a lot about actress\'s earrings. Was it all a dream?
Perhaps we should all head to Defcon to hear about the next project.</p>',

            This is how hard we got played by the Q agenda. Remember the "purge" of the "bad Saudis?" I spoke against that numerous times and tried to point out that there are no good Saudi princes.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            Supposedly the "good Prince" is the remaining Prince Salman soon to be the new king. He bought a painting from Christi's auction house of "Jesus" supposedly painted by Da Vinci. "Supposedly" Paid 450 Million dollars for it.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            This is the painting. Notice how demonic "Jesus" looks? Notice that hand signal "Jesus" is making? Look familiar? It should. It is the hand signal of Baphomet, the Horned Goat Baphomet.

            NEVER trust high level Freemasons and Jesuits. Always assume their intention is opposite of what you see and hear and you will end up, in the end, being correct almost all the time. Who visited Israel two months before the Saudi Purge? Prince Salman. Who did one of the biggest weapons deals in history with the Saudis just before the "bad Saudis" got purged? President Trump.

            Notice the hand signal Ivanka is giving? Two middle fingers together. That is a Marrano (crypto jew) hand gesture.

            Lift the Veil is a shill. If Defango is admitting he used to be one of them, he is still one of them. There are no ex spooks. Cicada is a spook opperation. True or untrue, Defango is discredited by asociating with a shill and by admitting to have formally been part of Cicada. Q is definately a spook opperation, and that is why the mods have stickied Q threads in the past. But Defango cannot be used as a source any more than George Webb can. Spooks are spooks. There are no friendly ghost.

            De Fango is a grandiose self promoting grease ball. No one should listen to a word he says. Likely he works for the Deep State as a agent of disinfo.

           <p>
            What involvement did I show other than noticing that it was similar to something I told somebody about. I figured out the information and put it out before all the shillstorm and not a single one of you cuck's looked that it. So I had zero involvement other than being the first to expose what was happening, found out who Q actually was and shared it with the world.

             Defango, here's a transcript of what you said on the original audio:
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             "So after I went to Defcon and dropped off the stuff they did a round of recruiting. That was supposed to be it although they were talking about doing this thing, this QAnon thing, saying they were going to do it and it was the next thing coming. They wanted to have the Socratic method of teaching - they were trying not to put the focus fully on them - but they wanted to see if they could maybe entice other people, start using their mental facilities to do things. Seemed like it ended up being very good 
in the beginning but people got really  fanatical about it I guess - look at the all the goddamn youtube channels that 
keep making videos after videos, obviously just freaking out. But, literally,what I've been trying to say, this whole charade -
like I've been a part of it, I wrote half the questions that this dude asked on the message board - I didn't type them out
and put them in myself but you know this was a group of people that worked together to see what we could do with individuals online.
All the information is correct, all the information is good and it's been sourced from the right people."
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <p>
             I think "I've been a part of it" and "I wrote half the questions this dude asked on the message board" equate to an admission of personal involvement. People can read that and decide for themselves the level of your involvement but, to me, it seems rather far from "zero". Anyway, the more important point is that what you said confirms that Q was/is linked to Cicada and is a project and a deception. Q was/is presented, here and elsewhere, as something very different from that.

            It does not matter anymore who Q is because all it did was spread a bunch of lies and create a false belief that a political party is our savior, and its not. Until Americans stop believing in the false right/left paradigm Americans will be slaves. Ben Garrison said it best in one simple graphic.

             Nailed it. But it gets to a point where you have to realize why we have to remind people of this daily. This place is infested with disinfo shills. Are_We_Sure is not even a problem in here. It is those pretending to be fighting this but constantly posting disinfo in an attempt to mislead people to have a false impression of the reality of the situation. As always, we do something or nothing gets done. Nothing. They are already moving on agenda 21.

             The illusion of legitimacy. The allusion of a working system where they could be investigated and punished. It does not exist. They are selling you that it exist and maybe will happen. Can't happen. CIA , like all spook agencies, work for the banking cartel, not the country they reside in. One of their functions is to control the countries citizens through propaganda, social engineering, mind control, manipulation of events. To completely mislead the citizens about the reality of the government and the world and how things work and who is in charge. So the CIA being brought low is a laugher. They do what they are made to do. Their masters would never punish them for it.

             Q distinguishes between good CIA &amp; bad CIA. The overall tone of Q's posts is that the "ourguys" within the US security apparatus have got it covered.

              There are no good CIA. They are all trained as occultist, trained by the Nazis. That is the point. Lying is their trade. Once somebody is identified as a spook, they are uselsess as a source of anything but lies. The good guys vs bad guys is a fabrication. They have to fabricate this, because their is no evidence of this, so they have to say it is a secret battle that you can't see, but the will give you daily play by play. Act like adults people. This is idiotic.

               IMO the biggest problem with this subject is a culture like "The Donald is our God Emperor and Q is his prophet". Q's use of the Socratic method suggests positive intent, but it's easy to use it to direct the cbts culture in a direction which suits your agenda.

             The message pushed by Q, and by those behind him, is that Trump is our saviour -  he is about to drain, or is currently draining, the swamp. If, however, Trump is not our saviour (perish the thought) but instead part and parcel of the same cabal as much (or all) of the CIA then the intended effect of Q would be pernicious. There are plenty of examples of other limited hangouts - Q could easily be another or these - albeit a particularly lurid and entertaining iteration.

              Sure. Just look at  the references to GEOTUS (God Emperor of the Unites States). The United States is fundamentally about statism, which could well explain why US politics serves the interests of Theodor Herzl's Zionist state of Israel. It's about the subversion of nationalism and patriotism to racism and fascism and the devolution of theism into humanism.
