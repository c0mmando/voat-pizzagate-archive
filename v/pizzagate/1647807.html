<p>The map, a <strong>black and white handkerchief</strong>, features the owl at the center of Marfa, Texas, the quiet border town otherwise known for being where Scalia died attending the Cibolo Creek Ranch, a place for relaxation and &quot;pool parties&quot;. The owl is interesting not only because they are associated with globalists and the occult, but because many businesses on that block use typographical ascenders and descenders (<strong>p</strong>olitics and <strong>p</strong>rose, <strong>b</strong>eyond <strong>b</strong>orders, comet <strong>p</strong>ing <strong>pong</strong>, <strong>b</strong>esta <strong>p</strong>izza) to match the &quot;owl eyes&quot;.

<p>Susan also indicates the map is white w/black. But \'map\' isn\'t actually code, it\'s literally a map where they tell you where to go for &quot;pool parties&quot;.</p>

            Carlsbad caverns isn't far from the border.. or where scalia was found dead...marfa owl-  marfa has a burrowing owl that's native to the area.  These people do get into Molech type stuff though.

            There's a lot of drug/human trafficking in that area.  Could be just that they bought the thing when they were doing a show out there.  I know the area down by juarez, especially across the border, is total chaos..

            Reddit User billclintonisarap1st has reportedly uncovered a new mysterious death linked to Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. His reddit post reports that Monica Petersen was found dead under “suspicious circumstances” while working for the Human Trafficking Center in Haiti. Monica had been critical of the Clinton Foundation’s dealings even sharing a highly detailed article highlighting Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation’s despicable dealings in Haiti as well as their connections to Billionaire CARLOS SLIM** and the New York Times. A friend of Monica’s Bella Robinson confirms that Monica was in Haiti at the time of her death and was investigating “the Clintons possible ties to a pedophile ring.” Oh look who it is again, CARLOS SLIM...Note: Mexican financier and drug trafficker Carlos Slim and current NBC General Electric journalist Andrea Mitchell operated as bag man and bag lady. DRUG TRAFFICKER and suspected involvement in PEDO-RING

            Alright, so I came across something interesting. The Trans-Pesco Pipeline
            <a href="http://transpecospipelinefacts.com/">
             http://transpecospipelinefacts.com/
            </a>
            is currently being built and it runs from the border of Mexico up through Texas (SW-Central). Mexican billionaire and Trans-Pesco Investor Carlos Slim is in "bed" with none other than...guess who...Hilary Clinton. Other investors also include Kelcy Warren (Dallas businessman) putting 38 billion into the deal and who is in "bed" with Rick Perry, Texas governor who is current being indicted and Warren's pipeline deal under federal investigation. All this being said, the route of the pipeline is what interested me about this story...guess one of the cities that the pipeline is running right through....MARFA TX!!

            The list of names just continue to pile up. I didn't even start to go into Perry, Warren's and Slim's history/past, but I can only imagine. There have been numerous riots/protest on the building of this pipeline as well.

             Reddit User billclintonisarap1st has reportedly uncovered a new mysterious death linked to Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. His reddit post reports that Monica Petersen was found dead under “suspicious circumstances” while working for the Human Trafficking Center in Haiti. Monica had been critical of the Clinton Foundation’s dealings even sharing a highly detailed article highlighting Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation’s despicable dealings in Haiti as well as their connections to Billionaire

            I think the OP is dubious, and have previously asked ITT what is "pizza-related" about the map on that handkerchief.  (It is at least somewhat interesting that there's a map on it at all.  But that doesn't make it "pizza-related".)

            Nope, not saying that, just saying that MAP can mean multiple things.  I only mention it because I found Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies loosely connected to the circles that people we're investigating with move in.  I tend not to publish my "evidence" because most of it is highly circumstantial, but what I do find valuable is that many, many times, my own correlations match what people are finding in this forum.  For instance I found the Marfa, Texas link a couple of months back, and here it is rearing its head.  I find that very helpful in that it confirms to me that my "evidence" isn't baseless.

            It's fairly hokey, but... not entirely.  Some elements of it are more immersive.  I don't know whether to suggest that you watch it or not.  If you're susceptible to being triggered, probably not.

            This is a major find. Marfa is not just a little town in the SW Texas desert. It is home of the Judd Foundation -- which is the same crowd as the Abramovic 'art' followers. Judd's work is about the excision of emotion from art. Can't help but suspect (or even assume) that a good percentage of the rich (you have to be rich to spend the time &amp; $$ needed to get there) art lovers who make the trek to this out-of-the-way place are not going there simply to bask in Judd's cold geometries, but for other near-by amusements.

            Where does Kathryn Tate mention pizza or map? The one that speaks in codewords is Susan Sandler. She KNOWS what's going on and SHE is being very descriptive "a b/w handkerchief that has a map that seems pizza-related". She knows what it's used for, come on, now. Map = semen and pizza is child. For definite proof that this Baby Alcatraz handkerchief isn't the same pizza-related Podesta handkerchief, it is NOT even black &amp; white. It's blueeeeeeee

            Thank you for sharing.  I have Run across news articles of mutilated women in Albania and Romania too where trafficking is heavy and Became so after the US started trouble there in an effort to destabilize and out Ins mafia government.  There's emails from soros to Clinton telling her what to do on the Albanian front.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also a few of months Ago someone posted pics Of those blue barrels of acid on that weird Hawaii property.  That guy never came back to update us???  He says he would after Christmas.  I'll try to find that thread.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, a SAtanic ritual abuse victim, a beautiful 15 year old girl, in an interview with 60 minutes in the 90s told the man that they disposed of the bodies in bubbling tubs.  After a while there was just film on top she said. I'm assuming the "bubbles" were acid.  Another victim said the bodies were disposed of in pools that were filled in over time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can anyone find the link to the 15 year old talking about this?  Her mom's name was Bridget.  Bridget was a young mother and left her daughter with her motherinlaw and the motherinlaw, "Nan", trafficked her in "the big house"?

            Pizza related map on a handkerchief. 
Hmm i wonder what that could signify. My best hunch is that s where the kiddie fucker  pool parties are held. Who would use the term pizza related map? And we do know pizza is a code word for young underage girls.

            WTF. FYI, the pizza-related map has been discussed here more than you can imagine and yes, they are code-words. If they weren't, PG wouldn't exist. What are you talking about.

            Panda eyes = black eyes kids have from the beatings as shown in a past discovery (thread from some months ago). What a weird thing to have as a costume. Is this some kind of gloating?

            Holy shit. That company actually sells something called "Calm Kid Mist". 
"...Mist around an agitated kiddo or on pillows for night time peace. Spray above the frustrated tike and let the plants' attributes rain down."

            What I find so strange is not, that these progressives are all interconnected. But that there always seems to be a path to either pedophilia or human trafficking.

             It's likely not a Map that changes (spreads info) but that doesn't  mean it's not significant.  They print these bandannas out for the sick freaks to rape the children on.  That's what is in many of the  Victims' drawings and 2 victims have stated they use cloth beneath the child.  The damn owl is on it and we have a male victim claiming they rent boys out at the cibolo ranch.  There are twin beds lined up on the porches of the ranch and satanic masks in the lobby.

            OP are you claiming that the pedo handkerchief is an actual map?  That for every pedo assignation involving a handkerchief it is an actual map?  If so, I have three problems with it:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              If I am a trafficker or a pedo, I would not want the location or route floating around on a handkerchief.  It would make it possible to discover the evidence of the crime or the actual crime while it's going on
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              If I am a pedo, I would not want to keep a handkerchief with a map AND victim's genetic material with my semen.  The last two are incriminating enough.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              It would be way too much trouble to print out maps on handkerchiefs for every assignation.  How many do you print at once?
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Still, it might be true, but I think the handkerchief is a memento for pedos and a sacred 'altar' for satanists.
What I think you have found is more evidence of the privilege and culture that supports child trafficking and satanism(although we of course have no real proof).  They seem to always own hotels where they can video the crimes and blackmail locals or just provide a 'safe' place for these activities.

            Dominos is a fast food pizza joint. Maybe that's their term for "economical" (less desirable) kids? If that sounds like a joke, I assure you it's not. Codewords are just obscure innuendo, if you think about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for handkerchief, I think it either means map (the maps posted in this thread are on handkerchiefs, could be a tradition) or it could be a reference. After all, knockout drugs like chloroform are administered on a napkin one would put over the mouth and nose.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, if you combine the two concepts, maybe the maps on handkerchiefs aren't of where "pool parties" take place, but of where abductions take place. Maybe these bands that circulate at Comet are the ones doing the abductions, they have territory nobody else interferes with, and they bring the kids to Comet and other 'show rooms' of sorts in preparation for sale?
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone that lives in an area depicted on one of these maps, (and I'm sure more of these handkerchief maps will be popping up) should closely monitor missing person reports.
           </p>
           <p>
            If my hunch (and it's just that, a hunch) is spot on (and I'm not saying I think it is), we might be able to see lapses in abductions throughout the year. If set lists at places like Comet are discovered, and correlations exist, we're talking about having unearthed their domestic distribution system.
           </p>
           <p>
            That one in southeastern Texas probably doesn't even need to abduct kids, they need only accept deliveries over the border.

            Run a Google MAPS search on each of the locations in addition to the usual social media accounts. Quite often you'll see that the 'local guide' reviewers are actually making special pizza maps.

            I remember researching the ritualistic murders in Juarez in the early 2000's.  What NonAmerican says is true, thousands of young women disappeared or were found mutilated over 15 year time span around the city. There were witnesses who claimed to have seen George W. Bush, while Governor of Texas, participating in some kind of occult ceremony involving rape and murder in Juarez.  I never knew the connection to club Vertigo but I believe poster.

            THIS TITLE IS MISLEADING. The handkerchief in Baby Alcatraz pic is NOT pizza-related. The Baby Alcatraz may very well be linked to CPP and Satanism, hell even pedophilia and cannibalism, but it sure as heck is NOT the pizza-related handkerchief from the Podesta emails. If you are all trying to discredit the pizzagate investigation by debunking one of its strongest, most compelling and undeniable links that supports evidence of secret code words and related nefarious activities, then BRAVO, you're doing a good job at shooting yourselves in the foot. I want to know how this was flagged as a potential lead, when the title is so misleading. I'm calling on

            Wow, really. Come on, now. This has been discussed and proven before. It's the foundation of Pizzagate. If it weren't for the WikiLeaks leaked 'Podesta emails' and the coded words found in them, this whole investigation wouldn't have started in the first place and we wouldn't have found all the other evidence such as Comet Ping Pong, the creepy Tony Podesta art, JA instagram, the Hawaii connection, the Haiti connection and FBIAnon wouldn't have leaked us some info. Geez.

            Hallelujah! And I thought I was going crazy lol. People don't realise that the title is misleading. Sure they can believe that Baby Alcatraz has links to CPP and Satanism, but the HM is NOT pizza-related at all and therefore cannot be the same handkerchief. They also don't realise that if the handkerchief email is discredited, the whole PG investigation will hit a brick wall and be discredited because it's our best, strongest un-debunked piece of evidence so far and proves the theory of the coded words and nefarious activities.

             No.  There's so much other stuff besides the map.  Kill rooms, FBI pedo Symbols, baphomet murals on the wall, child porn on bedroom walls, paintings of children lined up for abuse and on and on.  Don't be stupid.  A map doesn't make or break our investigation

              All of this is very good, but the pizza-related map is one of the most incriminating pieces of evidence we have to support the code word theory. It hasn't been debunked and doubters tend to avoid it. The WL emails were the base for the investigation to start with. Of course, it would not
              <em>
               completely
              </em>
              break the pizzagate investigation, but it would chip off one hell of a good lead. Doesn't matter anymore anyway. There's new evidence that the map is blue and white, so it's obviously not the same handkerchief from the podesta emails.

            OWL - BOHEMIAN GROVE - OCCULTISM - MURDER OF SCALIA
           </p>
           <p>
            Minute i seen this my heart froze.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Bohemian Grove CHILD SACRIFICE ceremony,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cremation_of_Care">
             called “Care” is offered up at the feet of a giant owl statue
            </a>
            . The statue is a owl because it is said that the owl represents “wisdom.” For those familiar with
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Grove">
             Bohemian Grove
            </a>
            , the entire scene
            <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10443b.htm">
             just so happens to look like an idol of the biblical demon Moloch
            </a>
            to whom people would sacrifice their infants.
           </p>
           <p>
            I recognised the location, Cibolo Creek Ranch - as the location of the mysterious death of Antonin Scalia - a remote retreat for Elites and home to an occult group which is a 'feeder group' of the
            <a href="http://bohemiangroveexposed.com/">
             Bohemian Grove
            </a>
            , which is itself linked to Skull and Bones secret society. This feeder group is called the
            <a href="http://www.infowars.com/scalias-death-linked-to-bohemian-grove-illuminati/">
             International Order of St. Hubertus
            </a>
            , and Scalia was a member. Ostensibly a mens hunting club, it is an occult society much like Freemasonry and others. Further
            <a href="http://www.vocativ.com/290321/inside-scalias-very-very-weird-secret-hunting-society/">
             detailed info on the Order here
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            As can be seen, the Owl (Moloch) is the symbol of Bohemian Grove. If you don't know about Bohemian Grove, you should.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1463793">
             Moloch has come up before in this investigation.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Moloch came up in the Clinton Emails as a joke -
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14333">
             sacrificing 'chickens' to Moloch (Chicken = young boy)
            </a>
            . Since Moloch is only a human/child sacrifice, anyone knowing nough about Moloch to make a reference to another person who they know would get the in joke, must know you don't sacrifice literal chickens to Moloch.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now we also know about the
            <a href="http://archive.is/CiDXD/35bde0b4fd1c623655f7403f5270f4ef60a98c36.png">
             Alefantis / Jimmy Comet instagram image with a reference to Moloch
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Now we see a lead investigated with a handkerchief map showing an Owl at a place where Scalia - most important vote-swinging Supreme Court Judge and an enemy of many of the Elite Pedo Establishment - just happens to die. There are even Voat threads dissecting the 'wet works' email of Podesta, to the death of Scalia.
           </p>
           <p>
            But all this is just a coincidence... RIGHT?!

             It amazes me the level of research and investigation that can be done and information or possible leads uncovered by just regular citizens on VOAT and nothing comes out from DHS CIA FBI DOJ NSA on any of this. Two things are happening...cover up and people afraid of doing their jobs and speaking out.

            Blatant "girl lover" symbol on one of her event posters for a place called "The Black Cat" in DC. Check their website ---&gt;

            . This place is fucking strange. It has an "all ages" policy that they keep stressing all over the website, with pinball machines and pool etc, a creepy "private concert room", again all ages, and the main bar is covered in the black and white square masonic tile print. Need help looking into this place.

             18th St Lounge in DUPONT CIRCLE, DC is undoubtedly another place of trafficking. It is connected to the Black Cat which is at this point a place of interest also. A Yelp! review about this place reads -
            </p>
            <p>
             Essentially this is somebody's house that got taken over, probably through eminent domain, and turned into a night club slash bar slash lounge slash sex parlor. The sex parlor part is probably attributable to, again, the fact that I was winning so hardcore that night. But that's what I remember, so it must be true.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a sick
             <strong>
              outdoor back patio (children used to play there, and they still do)
             </strong>
             , and huge front windows on the top floors overlooking the
             <em>

             ."
            </p>
            <p>
             Look at this place's website and tell me this isn't dodgy as all fuck.

               Keep in mind the black cat has been around for decades and hosted countless normal rock and punk shows. It's a known fixture of the east coast club circuit for smaller touring bands, not big enough to play big theatres or 930 club and similar venues.
              </p>
              <p>
               So a logical place for a small or new band to present a new album etc.
That said it was pretty seedy when I went there quite some time ago, but did not have an "evil" vibe, although the strip joint next door sure did.... is that place still displaying drugged out naked (trafficked??) women on poles?
              </p>
              <p>
               Anyway that's my take on the black cat,  check it out since apes were there, but as a rock venue, it must get 200 bands a year and probably half of then are creepy or whatever --its  rock n roll baby.

            I found an article I think could be important. It contains quotes about child trafficking from a Border Agent in Marfa.  Sadly, immigrants and refugees are at the highest risk for being trafficked. Child iimmigration  detention centers are the most vulnerable  and possibly most horrible of places. Here is the URL

            IIRC: A "RANCH" IN MARFA TEXAS IS WHERE SCALIA WAS HEADED WHEN HE DIED.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember because I thought: Only thing I know about Marfa is the UFO nuts like to see the "Marfa Lights".  pre-pizzagate me: "Kinda weird to die with a pillow on your head going to Marfa, maybe the MIBs got him for being an alien"
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the whole pizzagate thing busts open.   And I'm thinking the "ranch" is a kiddo ranch.  Then the Hanky with "Pizza Related" Map happens to show MARFA, TEXAS?!

             It is not gelling for me, either.  But sometimes I think posters are getting an intuitive vibe, and they are right, but haven't yet found the actual evidence.  So I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of this stuff comes true, but for now, we don't have facts on this.

            Let's be clear the realtor found the handkerchief that's it.  The realtor didn't write the email describing it, they just found it and turned it over as something that someone might want.

            Read the email, that part is clear.

            search on instagram for #bandanamap and #mapkerchief .   There are several map handkerchiefs (mostly of national parks- alot of people go missing in natl parks but probably unrelated).
            <br/>
            A friend of mine just told me that some gas stations in southern u.s. border towns sell handkerchief maps of the state, to help people (illegals) that have crossed the border from mexico find their way.

             That looks like JA to me, cute Halloween costume. I'm not sure that linking JA to El Cosmico helps much. Assuming it's true that this is what the hanky looked like it seems reasonable to think that John Podesta may have gotten it from JA or Tony Podesta, and not cared about going back for it. If so the real question becomes why avoid using names in email? It seems obvious to me that JA is an expert at hiring shills and staging red herring propaganda, perhaps HRC had JA doing just that.

              oo can't tell 100% but certainly looks like JA!  also the logo for El Cosmico has a lot of swirls within it's design? (Obviously could just be the design but everything fits too damn well!)

            Oh I thought you were yelling at me, I agree I don't think this is substantial at all. There is definitely some weird shit going on in that town and with those people but I don't think it is connected to the email.

            Apparently Marfa is a hot spot for celebrities and former politicians like the Clintons. Bush settled in a town nearby. The owner of El Cosmico's name is Liz Lambert.  We need to search all angles of this and find a connection between her and hillary/podesta/alefantis

            The "coloring book" was published in 1975 by Tee Corinne. Feminist, lesbian. Its a moderately famous book according to google.

            This whole lead looks a bit crazy. I was on board at the start with the name, DC, Scalia connections, but people gotta bring it back to center before proceeding.

            Just the info from the list of code words that were released with the original podesta wikileaks. Some say also it could mean Minor Attacted Person but the idea is that the hankercheif is underneath the child and then after the abuse the mix of blood + semen etc is supposed to be some kind of 'map' of that particular ritual. I dunno someone made a post about it and a lot of that info came from Kim Noble who is an artist who was abused in this way herself.

            Found Mannequin Pussy and Kid Congo Power as related acts also playing there. As well even stranger brood of wierdo out of Austin connected to Baby Alcatraz. I also discovered Comet Pizza servers are being run out of Western Europe. Indicating to me they are more concerned with serving Rich Clientele in snatch areas like the French RIveria then they are about providing good service to DC, or its how they are keeping their Private Member Area more secure out of Country? IDK Im fnding wierd shit on my own and just joined. First post here its late sorry If Im off topic, Ill be back possibly looking for an area where im needed or can accel, until then.. Shadilay.

            The "psychedelic afrobeat collective" Golden Dawn Arkestra. I lived in Austin and saw flyers for these guys all the time. Missed their show at SXSW. Totally wild and I'm sure the costumes and imagery aren't just innocent jaded hipsters trying to be edgy. They're too well done and elaborate. Some definite occult magic happening I'm sure. But I don't know enough about them.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Golden Dawn Arkestra is an Austin psychedelic afrobeat collective. Their name is an allusion to the Sun Ra Arkestra. Being heavily influenced by Sun Ra, the band is in the same vein, stylistically, frequently introducing costumes and an aesthetic in their performance that is reminiscent of Sun Ra's eclectic music and unorthodox lifestyle and theatrics.
The group utilizes instrumentation that includes horns, percussion, synthesizers, vibraphone, and bass clarinet.

             You've got to be kidding me!
            </p>

             Ra is the sun gof of Egypt, and these people are obsessed with the Egyptian Trinity. Isis, Osiris, and Horus (eye of Horus = Illuminati eye).
            </p>
            <p>
             James Alefantis directed a short movie where a band called "Sons of Ra" plays, and not only do they play, but they flash those words over the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you haven't seen it you need to watch James Alefantis movie Chapel Perilous .
            </p>
            <p>
             Also John Podesta and the image of his hands with a 14 and a fish. Some people think it means "fishing for teens". It might mean that , but it has another meaning. In Egyptian mythology Osiris was cut up by his brother into 14 pieces. His wife ISIS went and found 13 of the pieces and put them together to try to resurrect Osiris, but there was one piece missing. His penis was missing, so Isis made him a penis out of gold. Where did his penis go? It fell into the Nile and got eaten by a fish. The 14th piece to resurrecting their God Osiris is in the fish.
            </p>
            <p>
             That story also ties into one of the reasons why gold is so important, and when you see obelisks they are symbols of Osiris penis.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also the order of the golden dawn is an occult order that Aliester Crowley was part of before the O.T.O.

             Besides Manequin Pussy Kid Congo Power, I found DJ Dangit publicly post a picture of a boy over and over again in an ablum labeled SF, just the boy and the boy his, Im new here, but it seems like this wont ever end, its like Links Disease. Split leads? Focus? Golden Dawn was Crowleys First Order before the OTO, OTO has alot of Temples in CA and a few in TX. Sweethang in that picture is using Hebrew Characters which link back to the Quabbalah used in these magicks. DJ Dangits post are all Black Men in Customes, a few naked woman and mostly boys. 
I have a son, im weary to even show his pictures and when I do they are outdatedand on private. BTW I may or may not have infiltrated OTO before, becareful with them, the public face and cells arent the same. The cells seem more concerned with leverage for extortion rackets then kids, but such covert organizations are more elusive and dangerous then then your pedos. Might be better to not go after the Dragon right away lol, ANyhow this shits always been real, I seen cops in Cali on Patrol making fun of a CSA victim saing oh hey its you didn tthat old man fuck you laughing at him in public, a 13 year old boy. Ive met millionaires and asked them about it and they say who cares.. they really don't.

              Check this out, a company called RTH California makes some articles of clothing that are used by El Cosmico (leather band) and on their site, the last 3 pictures are the same model/cult pics as Digital posted above
              <a href="http://www.rthshop.com/">
               http://www.rthshop.com/

              Here is the leather band I was referring too

              </a>
              Funny how they use the same model/actress/singer in that cult pic "The Thang" and she is used in advertising RTH California's clothing

            I'm inclined to think this is an actual coincidence. It really isn't pizza related at all and 'map' is code for semen which would explain the email. Besides a simply scrawled rough map on a bandana isn't particularly an invite to an address where there is a 'pool party' Or maybe they just like to rock gear repping Marfa because that's where they do their nasty shit. I don't think this is what the email is referencing

            Marfa Texas = HUGE for minimalist art town according to Wiki - ART in MARFA on the map AND the DC tunnels that were sponsored by ping pong that the German Ping Pong guy worked on - now used for ART ... ART is obviously how they are moving children.

               I was wondering about how many ways they can move them, I mean...it's the government. They could be anything, they have the connections. That's what honestly sent me spiraling back into almost nothing but researching and back into conspiracies, I was looking at their links from even the 70s until now with certain airlines and companies..maybe sometime next week I can publish that...it's just a really big web and a really big mess that overwhelms me and makes me feel like we can never beat this.

                Like they always say sometimes its just done right in front of us and we just didnt notice. This is a big challenge.  We are dealing with the big dogs who control this shit for the elites.  It seems almost everyone has their handa in it.  The amazing thing is 
We are aware of whats going on and 
We all have made some major impacts 
On how they are running their enterprise.  Its going to be a long battle.

               We know that art is at the very least a way to transport large sums of cash.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'll try to find the article but just recently there was some Chinese who were bustedoving large amounts of cash that they said were for art purposes. They got arrested and busted by customs but the story conviently left out what the money was actually being used for.

                Hmmm this is interesting, with how much all of our "main" people on this sub are linked to art, I'm sure there are some pieces people have submitted that would be worth going back through old posts, but I feel like maybe we need some more energy aimed at it.

            Think this is extremely important.  They have to be able to communicate with one another and this very well may be one way of doing that.  It's also important to be able to stop those communications, like making known the "codes" which forced them to remove LOGO's from businesses which identify places friendly to pedophiles.

            Some of the survivors may be able to tell us something more of these "maps" -- they seem to be used in sexual assaults.  May not be exactly the same thing as this type.

             Am I the only one who thinks this is NOT the Podesta handkerchief because Pizza is no where to be found on it? How could this map handkerchief be the Podesta email one when there is nothing related to pizza on it and the word pizza is the most damning word in it? I am being called a shill for sharing my honest opinion too... This is insane.

               I'm sorry if it offends you, but I have pointed out through out this comment section that I DO believe this is a potential lead for catching satanic perverts but I am troubled by the title because it could discredit the Pizzagate investigation. People told me to not freak out and so I'm backing off and letting all of you deal with it. I just needed to share my fears that's all.

              Well, assuming pizza is a code for something related to child-abuse, it could be a map that connects with wherever they're conducting criminal activities/sacrifices/etc.

             <p>
              Of course, I'd take it with a grain of salt considering the timing and all.

               Idk, but I'm not comfortable with things that seem to be forced. It's like trying to fit a piece of a puzzle too big to fit into a spot when it obviously doesn't belong there. Either Sanders is in the know and is making sure Podesta understands what she's talking about by writing in codes or she doesn't and the pizza is missing from the BA handkerchief and is not the Podesta one.

             I agree on that. Just like from dusk til dawn.  All the vampires come to mingle. Remember alefantis said in that pizzagate.com text- my culture. 
Its their twisted culture that pedos and the elite have co opted. They probably thought theyd always be under the radar with hillary easily winning the election and no one would know about 
This stuff. And then slowly but surely this subculture would be accepted by the mainstream.

            HAHAHAHA! This is so cute and funny. The only thing that doesn't make it stick is that nothing PIZZA- related is found on that handkerchief. How can it be pizza-related when it has no pizza on it? Nice try, though.

               I've been in a mood lately.  I apologize for being catty.  The local political forum I participate in has been overrun with blueshare David Brock shills screaming "trump is going to be impeached because Flynn talked to Russia" blah blah blah.  It's suddenly a very toxic environment.  CNN is spreading toxic lies.  I'm just frustrated and haven't been sleeping well and am spazzing kind of like David seaman has been spazzing.  It's not in my nature To be catty.  Sorry.
              </p>
              <p>
               I was mad from all the shills on the other forum where I was asking a question about the whole Flynn situation.  Rather than someone answering my question the media matters soros people starting spewing stuff at me that had nothing to do with my question. So I left and came here,  and I was still on edge and jumped to conclusions.  Rather than replying to the blushares that made me mad in the first place, I snapped at you.

               But I do think that this place in Texas and cibolo ranch are significant.  I think the bandanna is sold not as a real map but as a souvenir - knowing they use these cloths beneath their victims.  If that makes sense.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't think it's insignificant.  The satanic regerbevfes.  Their selling a bandanna with a map and owl on it, the location, and the name baby Alcatraz and the owner having lots of hotels all added up makes it worth investigating.

                Apology accepted. I have thick skin you know, but coming from you, I have to admit it was a little disappointing, since I've always respected your opinion in the past. However, I understand the stressful situation as i'm feeling the pressure as well and fighting the shills and their disinfo isn't always easy as it would seeml. I would hate to see the 'divide and conquer tactics' being played here be successful and I sincerely hope that true, caring people like us can unite against them in this fight.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have pointed out throughout this thread that I DO believe there are potential leads here, concerning the Baby Alcatraz (obviously linked to CPP and Satanism) that should be further investigated. However my only fear was in relation to the title as I have mentioned before. The handkerchief email is a very important piece of evidence (but not an essential one, I agree, as you've pointed out to me) and I would hate to see it debunked so easily, especially since we all know that the content was not meant literally, but figuratively. This supports the theory that code words were used and that's why I feel it's was so valuable and compelling.
               </p>
               <p>
                I also completely support the "handkerchief being used as a souvenir for abusers" theory and have been fighting tooth and nail to give it credit and importance. "I found a b/w handkerchief with a map on it that seems pizza-related" for me, could easily have been translated to "I have found a b/w handkerchief with semen on it that seems child rape related." Same thing popped up into my mind and immediately made the connection to SRA victims like Kim Noble and many others.

              Baby Alcatraz is a band that is part of the Sasha Lord Presents circle. They play shows with the apes and are associated with Comet Ping Pong--in fact, they are from NW DC and play shows at various establishments in the area.

              the quiet border town otherwise known for being where Scalia died attending the Cibolo Creek Ranch, a place for relaxation and "pool parties". The owl is interesting not only because they are associated with globalists and the occult, but because many businesses on that block use typographical ascenders and descenders (politics and prose, beyond borders, comet ping pong, besta pizza) to match the "owl eyes". The owl also featured in their inaugural show poster

              Do you always make it a habit of accusing people who have a different opinion from your own of being shills? Because if you are, you're not helping our cause here. Looking through profiles and comment history helps you determine who is a shill and who is not. Just sayin'.

               I know, but I fail to see the connection between this Alcatraz map, and the pizza-related map the realtor found it the Field House.  What is it about this map, that made Sandler think it was pizza-related except the fact that she knew what it was used for. The word pizza is the most damning word and yet, there is no Pizza on the Alcatraz handkerchief. No, she wrote a black/white (S&amp;M) handkerchief with a map (semen) on it that seems pizza-related (related to child/girl/CP/child rape).
              </p>
              <p>
               With no connection to pizza, the theory doesn't stick, sorry.

             Hunting parties at Cibolo Ranch.  Cathy O'Brien has said that DCheney did this at his Wyoming Ranch.  I read somewhere some names that had been to the CR and he was one of them.  If he does this at his ranch why would he not want to make a party of it in Marfa?  These people are very sick and I don't think there is a word in the English language dark enough to describe them.

             Its a playground for the DC and LA elite and the art world.  Funnily enough I first became aware of its existence when researching the guy behind the book "Secret Pizza Party" (I'm not from the US and not familiar with the geography or place names, so Marfa was entirely new to me).

             It doesn't matter if it's related to CPP or if they are Satanists or not, they obviously are. The fact that pizza is not related to this handkerchief in particular (since it's the most damning word of the handkerchief email) makes this theory hard to believe. Imho, it is just a coincidence.

            Don't forget about the owl symbolism/minerva. There was a wikileaks about HRC not mentioning owls explicitly and no mention of minerva.  Unsure of the significance, but as long as we are on about elite secret societies, its worth a mention

            I dont believe the Justice is actually dead.  He flew down there after meeting with Obama which some have suggested was Obama blackmailing him like they did Roberts on the Obamacare crap,  Scalia goes to the ranch where the Globalist Republican side of the control all the Police.  They have a couple cops show up.....they call the coroners office and they fast track the getting rid of the body.  The whole story stinks.  And all the stories about Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Scalia being ¨Camping" buddies.   Didnt they figure out in gay parlance that Camping was one way Pedophiles get to molest kids?   Bucks Fishing and Camping?  The whole thing stinks....
           </p>

            And you have to think any Justice appointed by Reagan or Bush or Clinton or Obama most likely is a Satanist.   Why would they risk the top job for someone who wasnt?  They want their bad boys and girls all the way up to the top.

            Think this is crazy?  Earl Warren was one the main men covering up the Kennedy murder.  They have the fix in from long back.

            We actually have a copy of that in the house. Lol  Pretty sure it was a white elephant thing, but it's become kind of a tradition to have people do art on a page in it.

            Could very well be. This aggravates me though. Not that it's not believable, but that I feel we'll never get a real smoking gun against these fuckers. It is enough though, glad we're getting somewhere and trying. Much appreciated sleuthing.

             Where is the most damning word (pizza) of the handkerchief email, then? It doesn't stick. To me, it's just a coincidence. The baby Alcatraz are obviously related to CPP and are Satanists, but this handkerchief is NOT the Podesta handkerchief, sorry.

              Oh I didn't think it was the actual podesta handkerchief.  I just thought it was a significant find considering who sells it Avd what's on it etc.

              To me the original email where the realtor says "pizza-related" might be "child related". Ie she knows its a map to do with CP.
             </p>
             <p>
              It doesn't have to be a literal pizza on the map, or related to a pizza place etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              Having a handkerchief map which shows where CP goes on could be interpreted as a "The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related."

               <strong>
                The realtor never mentioned pizza or a map
               </strong>
               .  Susan Sandler, the recipient of the email from the realtor, did.  The realtor just said "square cloth handkerchief (white w/ black)" or something very close to those exact words.
              </p>
              <p>
               The difference between what the realtor said to Susan Sandler and what SS then said to John Podesta is one of the biggest clues in all of PG that something is very strange in DC.

                 I did a full post (not an OP, a reply) about this somewhere on voat, maybe a month ago ish.  If I weren't lazy I'd have found it and linked to it.

                You are right the fact Sandler altered it with other odd info, is the tell, which backs up my point that its part-code... nothing to do with actual pizza or a pizza image on the 'handkerchief map'

               Well, you can't have it both ways. Either the email wasn't coded at all and each and every word were meant literally or they were coded. So, which one is it? Either way, this handkerchief doesn't fit.

                sorry that doesn't make sense. Why couldnt some of it be literal, and the important point (what she was trying to alert Podesta to) - was code (ie Pizza reference).  It can be a combination. You know these guys aren't committed to always using the same words in code. Ie they can refer to pizza in a literal sense or in a nudge-nudge sense.

                These guys use code where applicable for plausible deniability

                 Well this settles it. New found evidence it is NOT the Podesta handkerchief, because it's not even black and white. 1ew just posted the evidence.

                   It's possible, but it seemed like a bit of a stretch to me from the get-go and so that's why I was a bit resilient to the idea. In any case, peace :)

                 Ok. Let's say you're right and Sandler is in the know about what the handkerchief is used for (which is why she uses the word pizza-related). Why would she have to describe the whole thing to him (the colour, what's on it, map) if she thought it was only used for child rape. Why was it so important for her to describe it in detail? Of course she's in the know and she's using code words to make sure he understands what she's talking about. If you think she wasn't in the know, then she might have been describing the thing as she is seeing it. However there is no pizza on it. Why did she say pizza-related then? I don't know if you follow my logic. But this is how I see it.

            I've traveled this area a lot. All names are legit places in TX... Cities and tourist destinations... Seeing a lot of overly enthusiastic comments. I wouldn't say this is a huge lead.

            It's a big leap to go from the image of a commercially produced bandana with a drawing of Texas on it to saying Podesta's handkerchief "map" is a real map rather than code/euphemism.

             Didn't the original email chain say simply it was a black and white handkerchief, and then the woman who emailed Podesta about it was the one who said it "had a map that seemed pizza related"? Like, the realtor didn't mention a map at all.

              Notice how now everything is about Satanism.  It very well might be, but wallowing in how satanic everything is doesn't get people arrested, it's just another diversion to keep the real,  hard work of nailing people with the LAW from happening.  Not to mention,  these little circles of people are too fringe.  We were digging at the epicenter there for a while.  Now we're focusing on shit bands with probably 20 fans that play at shit pizza joints? You think Podesta is at those concerts?  Just bc JA knows other perverts doesn't mean they run with Podesta or any other insiders.  Get back to the big guys people.  Not freaking Marfa, TX. Or look into Marfa but look at the big guys.  Like the owner of the ranch. Not this shit band.

               They're not in the least bit fringe, there is an incredibly high correlation between satanism and the people we're investigating.  I agree that it is unhelpful, because it looks daft to the general public, but if you research the occult you'll see its had a huge surge in popularity of late, especially with the hipster/art set that move in these circles.  The New Age has been a century old project and it is far from dead and buried.

               And the idea that Marfa, TX is not big guys is laughable.  It is a playground for the elite.  It has connections to murdered people.  I class Marfa as one of the few places including Hawaii and Haiti that make me truly fearful when investigating.

But if this is even pushed by mods, then they are INCOMPETENT or do it by intention.

             Completely agree,  unless there's more to go on,  this is seriously reaching to say the least.  I'm not saying stop looking into, but totally agree about it being a huge shot in the dark.

             Agreed. Look into it if you want, but please, this should not be presented as anything more than a shot in the dark. Also, that would be more readily labeled black with white..

              so Scalia gets "killed" in West Texas and then the Podesta email surfaces about a b/w handkerchief, and a band with Comet Ping Pong ties wearing this handkerchief has nothing to do with it?

               You made that up. There is no evidence this tourist shop handkerchief is the same as the one in the Podesta email.

            My God, how do you people find this stuff? Excellent work. I don't know if this is
            <em>
             the
            </em>
            pizza-related map but it seems very plausible.

            Edit: Now that I think about it, it isn't exactly a handkerchief is it? I feel like this could be a (perhaps unintentional) misdirection.

             There are likely many. But I think it's an actual Pizza-related map.
