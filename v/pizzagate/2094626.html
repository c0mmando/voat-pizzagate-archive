            Downvoat. They say Pizzagate is fake news, the official 9/11 story is real and Sandy Hook was a real massacre. You Trump supporters are trying to erase Trumps multitude of connections to the traficking ring and his being an blatant insider. Just admit you are Trump fanboys and not part of the Truth community. You have become a burden.

            Everyone who defends Trump needs to remember certain things:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             First of all, I'm the biggest MAGA fan you will find. I wear the hats and shirts, and I'm addicted to The Donald.
            </li>
            <li>
             Donald Trump's lawyer and good friend was Roy Cohn.
            </li>
            <li>
             Roy Cohn is repeatedly reported to run child sex blackmail operations.
            </li>
            <li>
             Roy Cohn himself was famous for having "young blond boys" around him, because he was a homosexual (according to Roger Stone), and he died of AIDS.
            </li>
            <li>
             Donald Trump was friends with Jeff Epstein.
            </li>
            <li>
             At one point, Trump praises Epstein and acknowledges his fondness for younger girls.
            </li>
            <li>
             Donald Trump's name is in Epstein's book, indicating he at least had knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
             Donald Trump is a famous playboy who loves having sex with beautiful women.
            </li>
            <li>
             Donald Trump has been sued by a (then) young girl who alleges that Donald Trump had (some kind of) sex with her.
            </li>
            <li>
             George Webb says that there is a video of this act. He insinuates that it was fellatio.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            It is entirely possible that Roy Cohn and Jeff Epstein were part of CIA/Mossad blackmail operations. Cohn and Epstein are both Jewish.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, what are the chances that a young, horny, model obsessed playboy, like Donald Trump, was never tricked by a sneaky, CIA/Mossad, blackmail operation into performing a sex act with a 16 year old? For forty years straight, he resisted every temptation? And then the Illuminati lost control of America when Trump surprised everyone by winning the election, instead of having it handed it to him by the Illumunati through things like Wikileaks destroying Hillary's campaign?
           </p>
           <p>
            Sure, it's possible. Anything is possible. But it is likely?
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to believe the Trump is the second coming of Jesus, pure as snow, narrative as much as anyone else.
           </p>
           <p>
            But it is more likely that Trump was compromised, at least once, a long time ago, and has been semi-controlled by the Illuminati/CIA/Mossad/Rothschilds for decades.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why, after Trump was elected, we didn't immediately learn the truth about JFK, 9/11, or Boys Town. That's why, after Trump was elected, Hillary Clinton and the entire Clinton Foundation donor/board member list weren't arrested by Jeff Sessions.

             All of Trump's dirty laundry is right out in the open. The "p455y grab" tape is the worst they found on him after spending ridiculous amounts of money. He likes WOMEN. That's not unusual. Compared to the swamp creatures, he is pure as the driven snow.

            You can't cherry pick when to believe the mainstream media and when not to. This is the same media that says Pizzagate has been debunked. Why so quick to believe them now? Because you want to. Trump has his fair share of shady connections, allegations, quotes, etc. Why the people of this sub refuse to see that is beyond me.

             "Mainstream Media" isn't a monolithic group, despite overbearing forces within narratives. Some things they have to give in to, especially if outed.

             Seems to me that it is part of the agenda to convince us Trump is their enemy so we can look at the things he does(Funds criminal wars, gives pardons to Arapaio who is suspected of covering up child sex crimes, does not resist the FED and the bankers, etc etc) as things that are neccesary. He continues the NWO agenda and policy but gets to look like he is resisting them. So these Trump supporters are either clueless or shills.

            Donald Trump has been implicated in some pretty serious allegations with Jeffrey Epstein. I don't trust Trump, or the Clintons. They're all running with the same crowd. I'm not sure if you're aware, but there are records of court documents online with very in depth allegations by a young girl in regards to Trump raping her.

            What we need to be cautious of is picking one side of this black and white politics battle the media has infringed on the public. Trump supporters will have no problem believing the Clintons are capable of these sorts of acts, while Clinton supporters will be very accepting of any information that makes Trump look bad. When in reality, they are all scum caught up in the same game.

             That lawsuit was dismissed because it was complete bullshit. As for Epstein, Trump kicked him out of his Florida club when he came on to a towel girl. They are not and never were buddies.
