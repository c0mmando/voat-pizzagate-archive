<p>That\'s Nomochomo bragging about creating Moonmooch to &quot;infiltrate&quot; PG and GA in order to discredit Crensch, asking for upvotes in GA, in discussion with R3BIRTH. We\'ll get to the big picture about what they are up to in a minute.</p>
<p>Moonmooch posted the thread about moderation to GA at 7:47am on 3/2/20 <a href="https://archive.ph/ZMYrc">https://archive.ph/ZMYrc</a></p>
<p>But it was DanglingGoatBalls -- <a href="https://archive.ph/wip/HV3uM">the supersneaky &quot;Baiis&quot; account</a> -- who posted the exact same thread to pizzagate last night <a href="https://archive.ph/uPg5Z#selection-974.0-974.3">about fifteen minutes apart</a>. Here\'s a screencap of the pg modmail removal: <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/xfnjpf.png">https://files.catbox.moe/xfnjpf.png</a> </p>
<p>In case you missed it because you were busy investigating globalist child rapists instead of those here to derail our exposure of them, DanglingGoatBalls -- two L\'s -- <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3682006/22724946">is our old saboteur EsotericShade</a>, who showed up <a href="https://archive.ph/rgey1">with a renewed gaslighting campaign the minute I started investigating Abigail Wexner</a>.</p>
<p>You may recall that ES deployed multiple sock puppet accounts to manipulate consensus by pushing content he agreed with and trying to censor content he didn\'t like. This involved attacking, smearing, lying about, vote brigading and intimidating some users. It also involved <a href="https://archive.fo/i3NDw">posing as a victim</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/ProtectVoat/2773684/14340510">an expert</a> in order to win the trust and support of others (grooming). Some of those groomed found themselves later being attacked by his alts. Others found themselves used by him as human shields when he manipulated them into joining his brigading efforts, an operation designed to create collateral damage when Crensch and I and the rest of the mod team exposed him.</p>
<p>Voat has very few rules, but vote manipulation is absolutely unaccaptable, as CEO and admin <a href="https://voat.co/u/PuttItOut">@PuttItOut</a> notes <a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2736546/13984456">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Voat bans manipulation, and this includes vote farms/farmers, because it destroys the credibility of our platform.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subverse owners and moderators have three tools to deal with such abuses:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can expose and reprimand the behavior and ask the user to delete his account. </li>
<li>We can flair his username with a warning badge. </li>
<li>And we can ban him and his alts. </li>
</ol>
<p>We tried number one, but ES refused to take responsibility for his actions and <a href="https://archive.fo/o2MDM">tried to slip back into the community</a> as if nothing happened. We tried option two, but he made the GoatBalls account and <a href="http://archive.is/fjdQY">resumed his work</a>. That leaves option three, banning, which I have now done.</p>
<p>ES/GoatBalls takes great pride in his ability to deceive and manipulate...so much that he eventually has to brag about how smart he thinks he is. Recently, he felt <a href="https://archive.ph/rgey1#selection-3813.0-4037.293">compelled to boast</a> about he and Kevdude spamming the board with shitposts to turn Millennial_Falcon into a ban-happy deletion machine so they could &quot;put Vindicator in power.&quot; This is a lame attempt to associate yours truly with two of the biggest shills in Voat history, part of their overarching goal to convince PG and GreatAwakening contributors that Voat is compromised to discourage us from documenting globalist crimes.</p>
<p>Which brings us to their misadventures yesterday. They <a href="https://voat.co/v/ProtectVoat/3684541">are pushing the idea that Voat\'s days are numbered</a>, because the angel investor Putt announced last year &quot;must&quot; be the VPN provider that offered free trials to a few goats, PIA, despite zero evidence of that being true. </p>
<p>This is part of a long-term &quot;Voat is compromised&quot; narrative related to PIA that was <a href="https://archive.ph/wip/GCMqG">initiated nine months</a> ago by Nomochomo. You can see me pointing it out then. He doubled down and <a href="https://searchvoat.co/?t=PIA&amp;u=Nomochomo&amp;nsfw=on&amp;o=on">began insinuating Voat is now controlled by an Israeli pornographer</a> in November when PIA (the VPN provider) <a href="http://archive.is/5vY8H">merged with</a> cybersecurity company Kape. Nomo characterized this as PIA being controlled by a Jewish porn producer, despite <a href="https://archive.ph/wip/LMyxX">himself quoting the fact</a> that Kape\'s Teddy Sagi actually lost a significant amount of control in the merger. He has yet to produce any evidence any of these companies are invested in Voat. A quick look at Nomo\'s history shows <a href="https://searchvoat.co/?t=Putt%2A&amp;u=Nomochomo&amp;b=on&amp;nsfw=on">he loves to harass PuttItOut</a>.</p>
<p>Those of you OG pizzagaters will recognize this is exactly the same campaign that shitposters ran here involving &quot;Y Combinator&quot;. Y Combinator is a tech incubator -- venture capital for tech startups by the Palantir guy, Peter Thiel. Voat received a small grant from it when they first started. It was one of the first tools used at the very beginning to try to attack PG mods and sow distrust in the mod team and Voat when they booted us from Reddit. Get a load of <a href="https://archive.ph/P3UVg">those pushing it</a>. Whaddya know! EsotericShade. TrustTheTruth. Hojuruku. Nomochomo. <em>All the guys who\'ve tried to derail our work.</em> They\'re running the same old playbook, folks.</p>
<p>I have suspected Moonmooch was Nomo\'s new sockpuppet since he first appeared. It amused me quite a bit to have a shill posting legit research and help build our amazing cache of dirt on the pedovores, and he wasn\'t causing any trouble. That all changed with this latest play by the Voat is Compromised Disinformation Team, so Moon gets the boot, as well. </p>
<p>One final element: R3BIRTH fucked up yesterday afternoon and <a href="https://archive.ph/90vqV#selection-3169.0-3367.32">admitted to being Kev while swinging his dick talking to me</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[–] Vindicator 6 minutes ago</strong>  
</p>
<p>Then, Hi Kev. Must have sucked to have to kill that powerful account of yours. LMAO</p>
<p><strong>[–] R3BIRTH [S] 3.2 minutes ago</strong> </p>
<p>You really think that phased me?</p>
<p>Think of it like an onion: you peel back one layer, and maybe there\'s a stench. It stings your eyes a bit, kind of irritates. But, once you chop the fucking onion you start crying, wondering why you even attempted that.</p>
<p>This is the situation you find youself in. I allowed you to peel a little, but you\'ll soon find that the power I have simply cannot be taken without everyone in tears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He <a href="https://archive.ph/wip/C6qm6">can\'t help crowing</a> about the damage he thinks he\'s done and the power he thinks he has. (Yet <a href="https://archive.ph/tWRl1#selection-2539.35-2543.5">here</a> he is pretending not to be Kev with his PV buddies). Since Kev allowed ES and Hojuruku to maraud at will disrupting our work and claims to be behind the latest anti-Voat psyop, R3BIRTH won\'t be joining us here any longer, either. :-)</p>
<p>Last week, they tried to drown my Wexner submission with drama, and I gave them <a href="https://archive.ph/rgey1">a little history lesson</a>. This is what it\'s really all about: disrupting research.</p>
<p>Please have a look at that first thread again, folks. Read through what I\'ve presented, here. They are pushing the same Shareblue narrative that\'s been used since the beginning of this subverse: &quot;Voat is compromised&quot;. Yet none of our research has been deleted. I freely link people to it on Twitter all the time. The <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1156307202728026112.html?refreshed=yes">same research that Putt linked on the &quot;Voat is on Fire&quot; page because it was being DDoSed</a> last summer. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3402156">Wexner was also a topic in that Junkerman research</a>, just sayin\'.</p>
<p>Carry on, people. Stay frosty. I\'ll do my best to expose the fuckery. You know we are doing something right when they go to this much trouble. :-)</p>
<p>Give \'em Hell!</p>

           Last week, they tried to drown my Wexner submission with drama, and I gave them
           <a href="https://archive.ph/rgey1">
            a little history lesson
           </a>
           . This is what it's really all about: disrupting research.
          </p>
          <p>
           Please have a look at that first thread again, folks. Read through what I've presented, here. They are pushing the same Shareblue narrative that's been used since the beginning of this subverse: "Voat is compromised". Yet none of our research has been deleted. I freely link people to it on Twitter all the time. The

           </a>
           last summer.
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/3402156">
            Wexner was also a topic in that Junkerman research
           </a>
           , just sayin'.
          </p>
          <p>
           Carry on, people. Stay frosty. I'll do my best to expose the fuckery. You know we are doing something right when they go to this much trouble. :-)

             because the angel investor Putt announced last year "must" be the VPN provider that offered free trials to a few goats, PIA, despite zero evidence of that being true.

            The part about Voat shutting down or rebranding to a Jew friendly version on the other hand is admittedly still just speculation on my part. Between Putt distancing himself from Voat, cynabuns also disappearing, Voat being overrun by spambots and actual shills no longer needing ccp to post and statements from another PIA related asset such as
            <a href="https://freenode.net/news/freenode-pia-changes">
             this
            </a>
            , you have to admit something is terribly off with the state of Voat. Something that to me looks very much like by design.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could be wrong of course, let's hope I am, but if I'm right there are people here on Voat that deserve a fair chance to set up a backup plan.

             two arrows, one pointing up, one pointing down. transpose them. voat has always been associated with israel. I don't understand any of this. if trumps peace plan works out wont that kick off the apocalypse? I guess I get wanting to fulfill prophecy. but shouldn't these things kind of happen organically? i'm speaking for the average joe just punching the clock trying to fix the little emergencies all around him. whats going on here? i'm not part of anyones jihad or revolution or helter skelter or what the heck ever. i'm just a guy eager to plant potato's and tomatos and mow my lawn so people can stroll on it. but you guys with all your big ideas just complicate my life. you troublemakers stay outta my neighborhood.

             You do need ccp to post. Below 15 ccp means you can't start threads and can only comment once a day. Problem is, it completely limits free speech which is the whole point of voat. But no one cares because they don't want alternative opinion.

             I don't think it has a huge bearing on the premise of this submission, though, which is that the saboteur accounts I mentioned are running their suppress pizzagate research "Voat is compromised" narrative. Back in 2016, it was Palantir/YCombinator, and that was based on a true fact as well -- Voat did get some startup money from YCombinator. Given the fact that every time Putt rolls out new code, we get a state-level entity DDoSing us, it looks to me like they are fearmongering to disrupt whatever Putt is up to with edon.

              Oh no you are absolutely correct on that. I just wanted to point out that part isn't speculation and perhaps a bit poorly phrased in my original post and needed a bit of elaboration. I didn't find anything in my investigation that suggested Voat was turned unto a honeypot, so yeah the fear mongering seems silly to me as well.

               <a href="http://archive.ph/z5cor">
                this
               </a>
               was the topic where we stumbled upon the edon thingy. We're a bit all over the place so it might be difficult to read through. One problem we had with finding exact dates was that public access got turned off and archive.today hadn't yet set up the camfex account so there are some unknowns in there we simply couldn't find.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'll have a look at it tomorrow.

               <p>
                There is no archive at that location. I find that highly suspicious. It's also highly suspicious the submission was deleted.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, I couldn't see anything on that page that showed where on Voat one clicks to end up at /about instead of /content/about.
               </p>
               <p>
                What are the odds Putt tweaked a non-used About url just to fuck with the Gangs of Voat?  Can't help wondering if maybe this was his way of creeping out nefarious Voat abusers like Kev and EsotericShade so they'd kill their accounts.

                 was the first, that I know of, to notice something but I only found this out afterwards.

                <p>
                 Searchvoat by term: Edon /oldest indicates that I'm not the only one nor the first one, I think, to notice this.

                 The post was deleted as a lot of evidence was circumstantial at the time and I was not keen on spreading fires where there wasn't any need.

                 Putts had made comments shortly after this so kinda left it there as life got busy.

                       is correct. I stumbled across it back in November or thereabouts. I'm pretty sure I reached that About page from a link on either the FAQ or the User Agreement page because I was poking around there to see if Putt had updated anything since he had been MIA for so long. I thought it was a little weird at the time but wasn't overly concerned about it (I'm still not) and figured mentioning it publicly would only lead to 'muh Voat is comped' nonsense. There were only

                        Okay so we can pretty much rest assured that the "comped" narrative stems from Nomochomo's bullshit, which by no coincidence is linked to ES's bullshit, which by no coincidence is linked to bullshit from other sources one can expect it from, up to and including Amalek.

                  Ah, so it's everyone else who ran with it and cooked up a new "VOAT COMPROMISED!" narrative then, because they do indeed just want to see Voat burn.

                  The question is, though, how

                   Seriously a stumble upon as you read through the mumbo jumbling waffling you’ll see I added a mere line or two about it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Yes, finding it disturbed me a bit but I didn’t know enough about it to go hollering off the rooftops, I was hoping someone could fill me in more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So you noticed it in the code a long time ago?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Well when talking to several tech dudes, some plug-ins presented themselves as candidates for a potential option to the in-code Edon mentions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/u/chempergrill">
                    @chempergrill
                   </a>
                   might know more here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Secondly, an optional thought at the time, Putts could have wanted to broaden his work portfolio by adding Edon to the code work as a front for future business as the name Voat doesn’t always win interviews I would think.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Or, another idea that I recall, the funding was a venture that PIA lost interest in and it literally fizzled out as what happens often in the tech world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This could have really knocked Putts’ confidence back on top of all the drama. I genuinely hope he is doing okay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Aneeway, that’s as far as my thinking got. When Putts said he is the only one that has access to the keys of Voat. I believed him, seriously what else can one do... I still have faith in him, I hope it’s not in vain...

                    What do you mean "someone overwrote it"?  That's not how archive.fo works. It makes an additional capture. You can see them all if you put an asterisk at the end of the base url. There are some submissions on here where I have made numerous archives of the same post over time in order to document vote brigading, so I know this to be true.

                   <p>
                    Furthermore, there was no archive of that url at all.

                      Now you are giving a link that has the same url ending as the link you gave on December 30, 2019 in the SBBH post? This archive.ph link just goes to your original Edon Garden submission, not where you found the evidence you cite that led you to make it.

                      I'd like to know how you found the unused /about page mentioning "edon" if it has never been linked from Voat. Or I'd like to see evidence of it being linked from Voat and where on Voat that happened.

                       found the alternative "about" link from looking at old posts. For the sake of it, she was also then one that talked me out of dropping the doxx 2 months ago.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I suspect that she disapprove of me dropping the doxx, but she's not me and I'm not her. I'm still not sure I made the right call either.

                       Other than that I don't think I understand your question?

                        Yes. That is what I would like to know. Which old posts? The one she cites in the deleted 12/30/2019 submission is a link that goes nowhere. See the links in the comment of mine you just replied to.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        When I asked where she found the "edon" info, she linked me to that 12/30 submission, not the source material for it.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        No one has been able to say where on Voat they found a link to the unused /about page that had "edon" on it. In

                        just pops up with a SearchVoat of previous comments mentioning it. None of those explain how that page was found, or offer any actual replicatable evidence of their claims, either.

                       <p>
                        In my experience, when you have inflammatory claims made by difficult-to-vet submissions based on broken links or information presented by deleted accounts, eyebrows should go up.

                          No. I was talking about what you have waved off as a "bum link". In that submission, you gave a bad link to show how you'd come to your conclusion. Now you are saying

                         <p>
                          All this going around and around ends up in one place: No one can show when or where that unused /about page ever linked from Voat.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Sandhog said he thought it linked from the faq or User Agreement pages, but both of those pages are /content/ urls. Neither of them has links to the About information, other than the link that is on the bottom of every page of Voat, which is also a /content/ url. Nor has anyone put up any archives showing links to the About section ever in the text of thos pages.

                            No, I'm not confused at all. I asked for some kind of evidence showing those /about pages were ever linked to from anywhere on Voat. Clearly, they exist. However, there is no evidence they have ever been "in use".
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Putt said after the last DDoS that there was a mole. Someone he trusted wasn't trustworthy. If that person was someone who had the ability to edit old UI pages at some point without anyone realizing it, the unused /about page could easily have been tampered with so that it could later be cited to undermine confidence in Voat.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Therefore, if we want to get to the bottom of what is going on, whoever first found that page needs to be identified and needs to explain exactly how they found it.

                            Otherwise, this whole thing -- especially this "confusion" -- just looks like disinfo pushing. We've seen it a thousand times on

                             from May 24, 2019 shows that it definitely used to link to the 'edon About' page. I discovered it sometime in late November and found it curious so I poked around and found the edon website and not much else.

                             is from December 30, 2019 and the links have been changed to their current state.

                             Which means that the links had to have been changed sometime after I found them in November (around Thanksgiving or so) and when it was archived again on December 30.

                             I had reached out to Deshy in an attempt to try and piece together the truth in all of this 'drama' and figure out what was really going on because it is blatantly obvious that someone is working hard at running people and communities off of this site and has been for quite some time. At the time, that thread happened to be at the top of her comments so I brought it up when I reached out to her. I also reached out to

Note that the old voat.co/about page has been there since forever, up to 2019-12 (last known) and the footer has being in-use until last major update around 2019-07-13. It was already decided that the footer would be updated to use voat.co/content/about page on 2019-06-15 or earlier. So the new content was already there, without reference to Edon Garden. It does not make any sense to edit the voat.co/about page to sabotage Voat's own reputation and "expose" PIA as the "angel investor", let alone doing it in an unused page.

                              has been, using PIA as his VPN service at one point, I believe he may have switched his git repo service to fountain.edon.garden as well. So now we have another element in this connection.

                             <p>
                              So how that unused/abandoned page got changed?! I came up with a few plausible ways:
                             </p>
                             <ol>
                              <li>
                               <p>
                                The now-abandoned page was edited by another Voat user and Putt just updated it without proofreading. I remember that someone was volunteering this work sometime back, to either improve the user agreement page and/or the about page. If it was the about page, Putt would have to copy and edit the content from old page to the new one.
                               </p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                               <p>
                                Putt edited it himself. IF he did, why has it not been reflected on the new voat.co/content/about page? And why edit the old page that has not been touched with Edon Garden reference for years?? So that is not very probable.
                               </p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                               <p>
                                Given the above connections, Putt may have used Edon Garden's git repository before the update took place. At some point that old about page may have been tempered with, by someone who has access to the repository. This would imply that someone who has had contributed to Voat's codebase, someone who Putt may have trusted, may have added the Edon Garden reference at some point, or someone with admin access from fountain.edon.garden.
                               </p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                               <p>
                                The site has vulnerability and someone edited the about page. I would imagine that if someone could do that, he would inflict more damage than just editing some words.
                               </p>
                              </li>
                             </ol>
                             <p>
                              Overall, I think #3 is a more plausible cause of change to that voat.co/about page. But still, who the fuck would change an abandoned about page to sabotage its own reputation and expose its own angel investor? It makes zero sense.

                               I'm leaning towards option 2 obviously.

                               If you were a Jew that had bought the company sponsoring Voat would you:
                              </p>
                              <ol>
                               <li>
                                Continue sponsoring an expensive website whose userbase wants you dead?
                               </li>
                               <li>
                                Throw it all away?
                               </li>
                               <li>
                                Re-purpose the code for a new site without the vile userbase?
                               </li>
                              </ol>
                              <p>
                               I'd go with option number 3. Compared to Reddit there are a lot of very compelling things about Voat's design after all. If so then what we are looking at is the sourcode being scrubbed for all Voat references and then when things are ready to go the sourcecode is copypasted onto the new site and Voat is abandoned. Voat is in other words only up and running for testing purposes.
                              </p>

                               That would of course require Putt playing along, but I don't think that is as outlandish as it sounds. For one thing he hasn't been himself since the "builder/destroyer" farce. Secondly I know we probably wont agree on who the idiots of Voat are, but surely we'll agree there are many of them. I think Putt has really good reasons to be really tired of us. Of course he wouldn't really be in a position to disagree if the sponsor requested changes either. Then they would just stop paying and Voat would still be gone.

                               Also I don't think the connection was ever meant to be found. I of course can't find it now, but one of the statschecked sites had a link between Voat and edon.garden in the google cache, but on the site itself it was removed. That only happens if the siteowner actively request the removal.

                               And if it was meant to be found how come I was the only one that did? I know others were looking as well.

                               As far as the imperialfamily.com domain goes it used to be used by the royal Japanese family. I think PIA had some interest in the Asian market, so that's probably why they bought it. They paid

                               Damn. That's compelling. I guess the question is: who has keys to the kingdom aside from Putt? If it's not Putt doing it (and him doing that makes absolutely no sense to me) then who is?

                               All I know is that the link to the 'edon' welcome page was active late November because that's how I discovered it and the archives prove it. As an aside, I wonder who it was that downvoated my previous comment. Surely it was either someone I pinged or someone that has been closely monitoring this three day old thread. That's one thing that Poal has right. You should be able to see who is downvoating you.

                                 All I know is that the link to the 'edon' welcome page was active late November because that's how I discovered it and the archives prove it.

                                that archives proved that Voat.co ever linked to the "edon" edited About page. I've looked at about six dozen archives over the past 48 hours (as have

                                Furthermore, zero evidence has been presented that the FAQ and User Agreement pages ever linked to the About page. I cite these pages regularly when explaining Voat policies to new users in

                                If you look at the archives for the day that Putt made the big code update, July 13, 2019, you can see he created new pages for the FAQ and User Agreement at the same time he moved About from voat.co/about to voat.co/content/about. The FAQ and User Agreement pages moved from the voat.co/help/ url to voat.co/content/ url. Take a look:

                                 Ah, I see what you are getting at now. Looks like I am the retarded one here. I didn't notice that those archives that

                                 linked were all of the 'About' page itself instead of the FAQ/User Agreement page and simply scrolled down to the bottom and looked at the link to the 'About' page which leads to the edon mention. I guess that would explain argosciv's allegations from yesterday. I did find that page in late November or thereabouts although I don't recall archiving it or anything since I just assumed it was the regular About page at the time. If it wasn't linked from the FAQ/User Agreement pages then the only other way I could have reached it was by playing around with the voat url. Which is a distinct possibility as I was poking around the voat

                                 at some point. In any event, I found the page. I didn't say anything about it to anyone until I saw it mentioned in that deleted thread by Deshy via her comments when I was attempting to find some truth in all of this crazy stuff. I took the fact that the thread was deleted as a good sign in that they were trying to figure out what was going on with it and not broadcasting it everywhere immediately like the 'muh Voat is run by PIA jews' clowns tend to do. No clue as to how Deshy initially found it.

                                 That's the sum of my involvement and knowledge regarding the edon stuff. Well, aside from also noticing that the

                                 smear sub seems to be an obvious reference to that page. If me not remembering exactly how I got to a defunct site page four months ago, or whatever what it was, is enough evidence to convict me of being involved in some sort of conspiracy against Voat then I don't know what to tell you other than confirmation bias is a bitch because it's simply not true.

                                 may be able to confirm it, as he likes to poke around the UI frontend.

                                 When we were chatting on the previews site, he was happy when he was getting ready to push this major update to the main site. He was even very excited to create a subdomain, soon.voat.co, to test if things break. Then why all of a sudden, he stopped deploying this major update? I believe this was because he detected that Voat's source code was been sabotaged, very likely by Edon Garden's git repository service, the entity that is connected to PIA and KAPE.

                                 I have reached my own conclusion that Voat was setup by those kike owned entities. I do not believe they are Voat's angel investor, despite other shills' constant push for "Voat is compromised" narratives.

                                    In any case, I'm quite content to close this little chapter, as it has brought several subversive users into the spotlight who I no longer have to play nice with or associate with at all; huzzah for the block button.

                                    But of course, they'll keep pissing in the wind with their "the sky is falling on voat!" narratives and trying to push me out of here or otherwise censor me/turn others against me. Life goes on, Voat goes on, subversives gonna subvert.

                                         I think your account is very much marked. But I bet it is because you exposed something they do not like.

                             That doesn't make any sense to me and thus I ain't jumping into this one. You're on you're own.

                             Vindicator, putting aside fact that I don't like you &amp; you don't like me, nothing nefarious could ever come out ofthat woman. She can get weird &amp; confused but not nefarious.

                             As far as all this Edon mumbo jumbo, I just hope Voat opened doors for Putt and that he's working on his next platform or something of the sort. I seriously doubt that Imperial Family would bank roll a honeypot even though I think they have a fucked up track record between Kape &amp; PIA, trust issues in those two entities are on another level.

                              When I edited the post that next day with everyone’s new foundings, someone archived that new page, I had no idea till yesterday that one can use an archive web address plus an * to get all timestamps. I must have put a wrong archive link in thread, not sure how tbh.

                              So I thoughts it was lost, overwritten per say but had the copy on my pc which I linked in the article.

                                 I would have thought that this would be a vital piece of information to include before posting serious research about the "Edon owns Voat" theory, for anyone concerned in good faith.

                                 Surely it would be straightforward to find out what product "Edon-light" is and how it works and post an explanation?

                                   In what way was I condescending? I am making a good faith attempt to understand whether this Edon theory has any actual basis. You posted the main submission drawing attention to it, I assume because you came across evidence that made you concerned. I attempted to make sense of that submission, and ran into:

                                   looks like pretty serious research to me. You went to the trouble of documenting some of the path of how you "stumbled upon" the Edon /about page, formatting, citing and copypasting text from various posts...though strangely none of the posts you cited actually linked to the /about page or an archive.org image showing when it was linked to Voat. You left out that key piece:

                                       Indeed, thanks for helping Vin, so he knows it’s in the code, wonder why he asked me then, oh well... he probably likes you more, lol.

                                       Yeah, sadly Voat being thrashed is a favorite past time for some conspiracy theorists and is a horrible thing.

                                       As soon as I get a chunk of time to potter in the past and see how that page was linked to Voat I’ll let ya know, until then please know I did not create it and you know that Sandhog told me after my post about him finding it too.

                                             I do try to find truth in things although sometimes it is a lot more difficult than others. I'm not sure what this stuff is all about or even what it means exactly or if it's important. Mostly, I'm just confused by it. All I know is that I've not done anything wrong and I don't believe that you have either. Something, something, good intentions, I suppose.

                                             Aw, sorry to hear you have been going through a slog recently. I hope things take a turn for the better with whatever it is you have been dealing with! I nearly whacked a chunk of my thumb of chopping vegetables last week so no guitar playing for me for a while. Which is a bummer. Thank God it didn't go all the way through. I much prefer that all my parts and pieces remain intact! It was really close though.

                                               I feel ya. It's been the exact opposite for me but comfort and complacency are a motherfucker. Sneaky like a crocodile if you don't pay attention. If I had to choose between the two extremes... I' think I'd rather constantly be on watch for the tiger if that makes any sense at all. At least you are on the lookout for that fucker. Crocs are sneaky sonsuvbicthes. Live and learn...and I'm still learning! Seems like no matter what you are experiencing in life it's a struggle. It just comes in different forms.

                                               Has anyone checked the preview site? Could be that's where you jumped links and reached it. I'm still not sure why it even matters if the page had been phased out. Much like everyone else, I've criticized Putts out of frustration with all of this stuff but I do trust him. He's like the zen master of patience. Near as I can tell most everyone that gives a shit about Voat wants the same thing in all of this. Or at the very least there is common ground to be had. That charity post was pretty epic btw; I saw that. Both funny and also helped a good cause :)

                    Still doesn't really explain how you found yourself at the unused "about" page, but it doesn't really matter, because it's pretty damn clear that the whole "Voat is compromised!" narrative is, as usual, bullshit being spewn by the same kind of users one would expect it from – they've been at it for years and are still here to keep at it (contrary to their narrative and claimed distrust of where Voat is at/headed).

                      I'd say it's pretty damn safe when you look at the particulars and those pushing the "compromised" narrative.

             You do realize that Voat has been using Edon assets/tech since before PIA made any offer to Voat users, right?

            <p>
             The "Voat" compromised agenda has been running under various auspices, from the same people who continue to use this site, for years. Nothing about the claim that Voat's free speech/privacy ideals are under threat has ever held any weight. Notice that people are still free to say whatever controversial shit they want, up to an including spreading fear-mongering bs.

              I know it's easy to get tunnel vision, but I'm not part of the fear mongering narrative. There are about 10 of us that have intentionally stayed quiet about this for 2 months precisely because we knew the outcome of bringing it out into the light. Had everything been fine in Voatland it would have remained that way, but we had time against us if things really are as we suspect.
             </p>
             <p>
              As for the about link I refer to it because it was changed very recently despite not being on the main page.

               Actually, I'm referring to the fact that edon has been in the site's scripts for ages. I've delved into the site's front-end code many times out of curiosity, long before the whole PIA thing, and edon has been present since before then if I recall correctly.

                Possibly. But it didn't become a separate entity till very recently. I would never have found the link if edon.garden didn't suddenly have it's own domain. At any rate I think it's nitpicking over an irrelevant detail. There are some solid aspects of Voat's code so that would naturally be reused for a new platform. One I could fear us "vile Nazi's" might not be welcome on.
               </p>
               <p>
                So you see my concern isn't about Voat being a honeypot or not. It's about having a platform altogether in a world that clearly would like to see us deplatformed from everywhere.

                 Wrong. The page is unused. So who edited it and when is very relevant, given that it is being used as the basis for the claim about Voat being compromised over news of the PIA/KAPE merger.

                  I assume Putt is still the only one with access so it would be him. I also don't think you are getting what I'm saying perhaps? So PIA despite Jewish relations had accepted Voat as a platform to support because they believed in free speech. When Kape got involved that was no longer acceptable because of the Jews/Nazi's contradiction. However they're not going to throw away technology that could easily be repurposed into something useful. There are a lot of aspects about Voat that is arguably superior to Reddit from a tech standpoint.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Putt being offered the choice of letting Voat die as funding ran out or continue working with it under a new name for a new audience would naturally accept the latter.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It's a theory. There are other of varying degrees of plausibility. I'm still not trying to convince you of anything I could be wrong about. But I am telling you because it could be worth taking some precautions even if you never end up using them. I'm mostly a shitposter I will have no issue finding a new home. The larger majority of Voat will not have it as easy if it comes to that.

             fully archived everything a few months ago. Probably a good idea to do that again. Folks should always archive their own submissions after making them, however -- on both archive.fo and and archive.org. For a while archiving wasn't possible, 'cause Putt had the site locked down.

             We are definitely doing something right!

               Boy, they didn't like this submission, did they? Lotsa chaff ejection happening. They put hours and hours into trying to figure out who he is, too. If that doesn't prove these goons aren't casual users, I don't know what would.

            I liked some of ES research. I did. I liked some of Nomo's research. However this is fucked up. Really fucked up. To be making up bullshit the website will close down over some vendetta he has with the mods and panicking users who have been here for years. If Nomo really is an es alt and they are the same and ES is reading this what the hell man? That's messed up.

             If you look up any of them and search their submissions oldest first, you will notice a very obvious pattern of contributing good material to build account legitimacy. You'll also notice a switch to "mods are shills" "Voat is compromised".

            Racine is controlled by elite members of the 9th Circle Satanic Cult and other high level groups including the Pilgrims Society, Sphinx Head Society, Knights of Pythias, Knights of Malta, Committee of 300, Shriners, Jesters, Moose, Elks and many others.

            They will never face justice and Donald Trump made a Deal with them directly.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jeff Epstein and Seth Rich were both connected to Racine through the Knights of Pythias along with Anthony Weiner and Chuck Schumer. Neither of them died. Trump knows. Trump is also a Jesuit Freemason. What is the story of Pythias?
           </p>
           <p>
            The elite in Racine embody the real definition of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are also related to the false definition of Pizzagate, that has its roots in the Truth. Hillary is connected to Racine growing up not too far away. Who did Bill appoint to the President’s Council on Sustainable Development? Why is Racine Hillary’s model for Community Policing?
           </p>
           <p>
            James Alefantis knows Caron Butler, Mae Podesta, Eric Braverman, Huma Abedin, and knows how Racine is connected to Art in Embassies.
           </p>
           <p>
            What was Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s real name, who are the new Rothschilds and Bauers, what roles does Kristin Bauer van Straten play, how does she know the Podestas and Emanuels?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why was That 70s Show set in Racine? What fake religion dominated the cast? What is a Red Fez?

              The style sounds foreign and when I saw that it had absolutely no citations and disregarded it out of hand. It's meant to divert you. The style and intent reminds me of the Seppyr (sp?) spamming long ago about neanderthals being jews. It was constant in multiple threads for months and then suddenly stopped.

                       And you may have taken my comment out of context, I was responding to someone who thinks god is contained in words , see the quotation marks ? Those weren't my words , in re. my response " God is everything. " you can easily say god is everything or nothing at all, those Naga Babas are quite something tho.

                   You do realize that by targeting my submission with your algorithm and not all the others on the board, you are actually having the opposite effect you intend. You are supporting my case by attacking me. This is why it's clear this is a bot. A real person would be able to discern the unintended consequences.

            You are wrong about the "Voat is compromised" part. They were exposed and are trying to turn it into a joke by spamming the hell out of it. Diluting it.

            You might be right about R3BIRTH. I thought kevdude came back as that turniptruck guy though. They both showed up at the same time.

             I mean if I was making a living as a CIA blackmail specialist PizzaGate would be a high level compromise. Just saying.

            And with putt mia for 6 months now (and when he does log in, refuses to clean house)  its safe to say voat is compromised.

             I think it has been a gradual decline over time. When Atko stepped down all hell seemed to break loose. Then when changes were announced. Etc. Etc.

              Why isn't there a permanent merch section?

              T shirts, hats,  koozies, keychains, whatever people buy nowadays.. only helps bring people aboard while generating some revenue.

              Look at barstool sports as an example: founder has preached since day 1 to its audience "if you can afford it please consider helping us out and buying our shit because it's the ONLY way to ensure that we produce non-cucked content and that we don't have to worry about spinning narratives for fear of sponsors dropping us"

                TBH I'd be more than happy to get a merch section going.  Bitcoin is fine with me. Maybe even something where goats can submit for Tshirt of the month or coffee cup meme or whatever the fuck they want.  I'd just need to know where to send 90% of profits as there are people here who know better than I of who owns our echo chamber.

                Yes, the probably 1.2% Jewish heritage in me is asking 10% of shekels, cuz time.  Otherwise, would be happy to work with others if better ideas, but I think bumper stickers and coffee cups and hats are a great way to spread a message and to help support causes and ideas financially.

               The (((bank))) dropped credit card processing. I can't remember if it was during or after the merch event that they dropped Voat. No other banks or processors would touch us.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think there were only stickers, t-shirts, and hoodies. Then Voat couldn't find a company willing to produce any more stuff for us, if I recall correctly.

               It got to the point where Atko was emailing people to make sure users got their orders.
