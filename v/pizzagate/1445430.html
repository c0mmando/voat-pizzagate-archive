            The globalists just want full control over the internet to make any free speech they disagree with 'non speech.'  It's Orwellian.   Create the crisis (fake news), expect the sheeple to demand action (please ban fake news!), then consolidate power.   People are on to it and know it's bullshit.  The sheep learned.

            Obama told illegal aliens to vote (FELONY) and they'd face no consequences.    Now Trump says 3 million did and FAKE NEWS says that's b.s.

            Think of this as the Right's version of Black Lives Matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do the people paying these protestors money to get everyone out and marching because a thug tried to tackle a cop honestly BELIEVE the cops are out planning to murder black folks for the fun of it?
           </p>
           <p>
            No, but it gets people motivated to act politically and keeps the pressure on.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is like that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't take it personally.  It's politics.
