            I have seen one or two people working on that angle. Seems like they are into some bad stuff. There was a period where I wanted to try and graph the global trafficking network which the Mother Theresa orphanages play a part in but I've become sidetracked. I also am trying to work on a couple of non-pizza related projects on the side as well so I can't give my attention to everything.
