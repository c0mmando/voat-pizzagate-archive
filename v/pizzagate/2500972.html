<p><strong>If I could take you back to Mark Darling’s reference: “I remember telephoning him a number of years ago to find that he had asked to put me on hold because he was one of a few volunteers manning telephone lines for a telephone counseling service, taking calls from those acutely in danger. This wasn’t unexpected since he has from early days given extensively, voluntarily, in many areas, such as restorative justice, participating in drafting the Young Offenders Act, Chairperson of the Youth Justice Advisory Committee, as well as many other advisory, government and private, committees such as the Council of the Big Sister, Big Brother Scheme.”</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://garryburnsantidiscriminationactivist.com/2015/01/15/gun-toting-senator-leyonjhelm-suggests-i-self-harm/">A third Australian pedophile in the original thread linked to BBBS</a> was mentioned, <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2029702">but the proof of his pedophilia has since been redacted from the internet</a>, so I will repost in due course all 4 allegations against him.</p>
<p>Patrick Power and 3rd BBBS AU pedo worked together to lobby removal remove the &quot;gay panic defense&quot;. Their activism ended the get out of free card for children who violently resist homosexual child rape. Unsourced now but true and I will be exposing in forthcoming thread.

<p>Due to 10,000 character limit I can\'t cite more but <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2500972/12503033">I suggest all see the interesting Google Search Results</a> some of which highlighted in the 3rd attempt at making this post.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Big+Brothers+Big+Sisters+&quot;pedophilia&quot;&amp;oq=Big+Brothers+Big+Sisters+&quot;pedophilia&quot;">&quot;Big Brothers Big Sisters&quot; Pedophilia</a> returns BBBS Pedophilia policy <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2497273/12473684">that begins Most pedophiles rape 200 kids and don\'t get caught</a>, and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2497273/12473565">lots of news about the 2002 policy of theirs to be the first youth mentoring organization in America to demand that homosexuals must have access to other people\'s children</a> they <a href="https://freegroups.net/guide/homosexual_big_brothers/">copped a lot of flack for</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;And Big Brothers Big Sisters&quot; pedophile returns over the first 3 pages only reports of homosexuals abusing children not heterosexual. </p>
<p>This is disturbing. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/apr/7/study-sees-gays-as-17-percent-of-population/">Male Homosexuals are 1% of the population - US CDC</a>, <a href="https://bravehearts.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Facts-and-Stats_updated.pdf">That demographic is responsible for 35% of all child abuse against children (males) - Bravehearts NGO</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1556756">approximately 10% of the pedophile population - Library of Congress most cited PUBMED study on the topic - I have the full study cost $350</a>. The amount of homosexual abuse at BBBS looks very over-represented, and I ask others to investigate.</p>
<p><em>Last thoughts:</em></p>
<p><strong>Australian abused goyim (jewish racist word for non jews who are deemed human cattle) kids don\'t matter - covering up all the child rapes at jewishcare.com.au</strong> Disney &amp; BBBS <strong>is necessary. It\'s more important that the jews feel good about themselves that the goyim human cattle raped children under &quot;Jewish care&quot; get any justice or Shannon McCoole\'s activities at</strong> BBBS <strong>get investigated. That\'s why it can never be acknowledged McCoole worked for JewishCare/BBBS and any evidence of that has to be redacted from the internet and turned into a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; by means of a cover-up.</strong></p>
<p><strong>That was the view of all levels of Australian executive government, law enforcement and judiciary.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here\'s some more hate speech on that topic to show it\'s not just Australia where this happens from Vice Leftist homosexual news outfit.</strong></p>

This wasn’t unexpected since he has from early days given extensively, voluntarily, in many areas, such as restorative justice, participating in drafting the Young Offenders Act, Chairperson of the Youth Justice Advisory Committee, as well as many other advisory, government and private, committees such as the Council of the Big Sister, Big Brother Scheme.”

             Every single one of the above is trying to help you.

            <p>
             I'm not.  I don't really care about you, and I don't think you're worth the effort.  You're snubbing your nose at rules the PG community came up with on their own not too long ago.  You're saying, "The rules don't apply to me", and expecting others to agree; you're also lying about supporting your claims, as if we can't plainly see that you aren't.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're looking down at everyone trying to help you, everyone putting in effort on this subverse, and everyone here to make sure this place doesn't get overrun by disinformation, shills, spam, and subversive mods.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
             Act like a fucking adult and admit you're wrong,
             <strong>
              or
             </strong>
             keep acting like an entitled shit, and being indignant when we hold you to the (extremely easy) standards of the subverse.
            </p>
            <p>
             The former will earn respect, and the latter will probably wind up with you banned.

              I have thought hard about a solution to this clusterfuck that makes all of our lives easier:

             <p>
              ^^^ For the time being I am still on YOUR SIDE if you just listen ^^^
             </p>
             <p>
              That would make the moderators as it stands now being the problem turn be the accountable to the people and give the user-base what they want. 
Uncluttered, troll free threads without excessive censorship.

                  Me and "Donkey" go back a long way. Almost everyone knows that. As for you, as far as I can remember, I've only spoke to you one time and yes, I used a meme and that was as a regular user. Today is my first official day as a pizzagate mod. You talked crap earlier asking why a meme lord was a mod. Why you are TRYING to be on my bad side is weird. Anyone who is friends with this user, also known as

                   <p>
                    Here are some of his possible claims you could try:
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    1) DISNEY DOESN'T RUN A DATING SITE - a site where two or more people meet online for "friendship" or more, GAY MEN AREN'T ALLOWED TO USE IT,
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    2) CHILD ABUSE HASN'T HAPPENED AT BBBS USA or AU done mostly by homosexuals.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    3) BBBS Australia hasn't employed pedophiles on their own advisory council (Dr Patrick Power) etc etc.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Just say one of his claims and say that there is NOTHING TO SEE HERE YOURSELF then I'll play your games.

                    That's right all the (((DISNEY))) staff are doing corporate giving making the bosses of Disney total VIP's around Big Brothers Big Sisters. I've seen a Vietnamese company totally obsessed in forcing their employees to raise $$$ for

                    that has had a history of employing pedophiles in order to fit in in the company. I was at the company meeting when one Vietnamese guy almost caused a rebellion exposing what was going on with that charity.  Have you seen the CEO of Konica Minolta's AU CEO's projectfutures.org trip to the brothel district of Phenom Phen to hand out "mothers mlik" and contraceptives. Weird shit is going on and I've see this before. Disney and BBBS are totally inseparable now just like the OTO is totally protected by the highest judges who say they must be respected.

                    No cop can arrest an OTO pedophile without bringing down the whole system or "sandalizing the judiciary"

            I suggest that we all just take a step back from this and let the boy post his stuff. He is obviously serious in his quest, but also he has a hard time meeting the rules. He tries, he fails sometimes, but he is a serious pedo hunter. Let us take a step back, let him post his stuff, let him tell his story.
           </p>
           <p>
            Take a deep breath, lets just see what happens in the future. I hate to ban a serious pedo hunter. Let us just try to work with him.
           </p>
           <p>
            I WILL ALSO TELL HIM THAT HE NEEDS TO STOP CALLING US PEDOS, BECAUSE WE ARE NOT PEDOS.

             I'm going to sleep now, no more point feeding the trolls. The ball is in their court. I'm a better ally than an enemy and I have been very tolerant so far. If some people can't tolerate an assertive anti-pedophilia activist that wont give up trying to get his research out there and have it censored by anonymous cowards, maybe they should get a new hobby.

             His censorship request is a clear call to censor their criticism that goes unanswered and downvoted when it goes to the proper place.

             Let's be honest.... With some of the new invites to the moderation team, this place is going downhill fast.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've made very clear I want to do two posts on this and move on with it. Instead the comments get filled with bickering and interference that is unwarranted calls for censorship instead of what should be happening - people sharing links about the OP and researching it further.

               is not doing unjust censorship he will answer the simple questions he was given. The ones he quoted. It's not rocket science rather than him or his proxies keen on censorship and passing the buck for taking out my whole account playing games and use sock-puppets still pinging me.

               Look they leave this here, and I keep posting my research or it's ON. I think I have to end this fatal attraction to those who think sex with children is worng - only if the perpetrators are white males.

                I really don't understand the fatal attraction people have for that pizzagate site. With MF'er gone, it's still a cesspool. What's worse is the mods post child porn on the site and then remove the submissions to justify their heavy handed behavior. No place else on Voat has the rate of deleted posts they have, and half the subs have no moderator at all. I can't believe people continue to fall for their crap.
               </p>
               <p>
                Edit: have you noticed they have turned the "deleted submissions" site into a child porn hub? No one seems to get that! The pedophiles must laugh every time they go to that site. They are literally being enabled by the very people who claim to be all about stopping them.

            , thank you for rewriting this thread in a serious attempt to comply with our submission rules. This is a huge improvement. It's not quite to the point where I am comfortable removing the flair, but because you've been willing to work on it, it seems fair for us not to take it down just yet. Here is what I'm still stumbling over:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Please just chuck the first four paragraphs documenting your prior attempts to submit the story. That's all still Rule 4 crap that belongs in
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
              v/pizzagatemods
             </a>
             . It clutters up what you are trying to say. If you need to vent about it still at this point, please do it in the appropriate subverse.
            </li>
            <li>
             You've done a really excellent job embedding the supporting links into your very densely-packed material -- well done. It's a great improvement! However, I am still not seeing a link supporting the premise of your title: that BBBS was operating as a man-boy dating site. That is a pretty serious charge that requires evidence...in the form of screencaps of their chatroom, or a quote from a kid "groomed" there with a link to where it was reported, or evidence presented in the criminal cases. If this is your
             <em>
              opinion
             </em>
             of how the site was used, that's fine but you need to say so rather than making a definitive statement of fact.
            </li>
            <li>
             If what you are saying is that McCool used BBBS chat to take advantage of kids and BBBS did not provide sufficient safeguards to protect kids, then say that, and give some linked evidence of their negligence (even if that's just McCool or someone else talking about the lack of oversight). It's not fair or accurate to brand an entire charity because one sick fuck took advantage of the organization to hurt kids (if that's what happened). (Also, that approach also really undermines your credibility as an activist/researcher, as well, so it's not in the best interest of your piece. You want to change minds, right?)
            </li>
            <li>
             In any case, we need linked support for the "man/boy dating" claim to be able to leave this up. I looked at several of the links from the BBBS pedo search you suggested, and did not see anything that supported your headline claim. You need something directly supporting it. If there is no evidence, then you need to create a different headline.
            </li>
            <li>
             I was a bit confused about the different people you've mentioned: McCool, Hall, Power and Bowersox. It became very difficult to follow. At first I thought you were saying they were the same person, and then I thought you were saying there were numerous different pedos connected to BBBS as part of your argument that BBBS is being run as a man/boy hookup service. Who's who and why they are in your thread needs to be very clear, so that it's possible to understand what you are asserting and assess the linked support you provide for it. (ProTip: If you have a piece of research you haven't yet gotten the evidence for, drop that down into the comment section as a "P.S. I am still investigating my suspician that...." Comments are free range).
            </li>
            <li>
             Consider using a less loaded rhetorical style that hits people with
             <em>
              facts that make them think
             </em>
             what you think they should think, rather than opinions that
             <em>
              tell them
             </em>
             what you think they should think. No one likes to be told what they should think. Opinions are like assholes, right? Everyone has one. The only people who listen to them are people who agree with you. What's the point of writing for people who agree with you? If you want to change minds, set up a domino chain of facts that lead to an inevitable conclusion. For example, if you want to convince people that Jews or gays are behind the normalization of pedophilia in Australia, it's much more effective to slip in the fact this is a relevant factor -- especially if you can

              use their own words like you did here

             -- than if you engage in a bunch of namecalling. It also gives you fewer things you have to source.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Okay...that was a lot. I hope you're willing to edit this a bit more so that we can leave this up.

             </a>
             ) - and American Christians, Womens groups, child safety groups predicted the mass homosexual BBBS gay child rape epidemic could occur - even going as far as to say NAMBLA is Cheering on BBBS back in 2002.
            </p>
            <p>
             That next thread will honor kevdude by going through all the google search results linking to homosexual pedophiles at big brothers big sisters only stopping when I hit the first heterosexual child abuser - which I haven't yet (bi doesn't count). He wanted it in the OP - he will get his wish seeing it can't fit in this OP.

             A dating site is where two people meet online for FRIENDSHIP or more. Have I not proven that? Have I not proven gay men are given access to it? Haven't I proven boys use it. Journalists have had a creative license to make entirely true headlines that trigger for centuries. You want to put an end to that tradition because penis in other mans shit rubbers before it come out may be offended. Sorry - they are peverts - scatalogical and disgusting and MOST DECENT PEOPLE don't care for their feelings and hope they seek help.

              I have clearly shown gay men have given access to the website. I've clearly shown boys are using it. I've clearly shown BBBS's advisory council in Australia had a gay pedophile / BBBS boss / boy counselor patrick power.  BBBS undermine child safety by allowing a demographic that is more likely to rape kids to access their children. READ THE OP AGAIN.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             So the needs of the gay men to feel good about playing with little boys and being given access to children is more important than the benefit of less children actually being raped if a demographic that is more likely to abuse children is given access? Did you not read this that's going in the next post?

            <p>
             I counter attacked this argument by citing 2x government and 1x NGO source - and anyone knows that stats about child abuse. Let me spell it out for you? Is a boy male? Yes? Is a Man Male? Yes. Definition of a Homosexual: A person who engages in same sex sex acts. 35% of all children abused are boys  - see bravehearts fact sheet (actually 37% - I reducted it to 35% because 98% of child abusers male - so we had to account for some lesbian little girl action).  So when they are raped by gay men is not an act of homosexual pedophilia - or more medically correct term is in fact HOMOSEXUAL ANDROPHILE doing it? Now when you tie that in with the fact 1% of the population is GAY AND MALE (1.7% gay) from the point of view of keeping a child safe a homosexual is 3500% more likely to rape children. Including that minority group in the BBBS big brothers and allowing them to interface on Disney's webserver (actually Amazon's leased by Disney Pixar) and meet them - is giving more opportunities for grooming and child abuse that could have been prevented. Statistically speaking BBBS's 2002 increases child abuse.

              All their relevance was explained. Re Bowersox: I have only seen one thing more disgusting that a pedophile done for child porn saying GO EASY ON ME JUDGE I'M A GOOD GUY I VOLUNTEERED ALL MY FREE TIME TALKING TO VULNERABLE TROUBLED LITTLE BOYS AS A BBBS COUNCILOR (WHO LOVES CHILD PORN) - AND THAT WAS BOWERSOX TESTIFYING IN COURT THAT DOG ON CHILD BOY PORN ISN'T DEPRAVED (he said in court he only became depraved in 2006 after seeing a hand grenade explosion aftermath involving two children - I found he joined beastforum.com where it is believed he got the CP by tracking his email address etc exposed in the videos, and I proved he joined in 2005 - proving he testified in court as a Bakersfield PD gay cop that dog on boy anal porn isn't depraved. So we all agree bowersox played the system even more that Crown Prosecutor Patrick Power.

             6.) No! Children come first! Not the LGBTI+ Jewish Pedophile mafia feelings - that's what my threads are exposing. We don't need to be PC if PC is getting children raped. Haven't you seen what's going on yet? See my profile tag line. Deal with it. Please don't get in my way and let me move on with this thread to expose a lot more stuff about BBBS i dug up and stop running interference. I've seen whole threads hijacked with interference when we need to be sharing links and research about the true targets - not protecting the interests of the LGBTI+ Jewish Pedophile mafia.

             because i would expect this kind of shit to happen. Quit it and let me focus on my real enemy the pedophiles. If I have to make a crypto-bounty driven pedophile doxxing website hosted in Russia to steal your user-base if that's what is required to get the job done I will - but right now I prefer to be at the coal face fighting pedophilia and exposing injustice to children without having to work around your interference.

              ruled he wont offend again. The case law mentioned he worked an organization that has the same role as BBBS. That will really redpill people from a government domain. Maybe they redacted it - I've been searching for months for it. I can't find it again. I swear as god as my witness I found it but didn't properly secure it because I was tired on that day's research binge.

              The "children's guardian" case law on www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au has gay jew judges rule 17 year old boys who had sex with 15 year old 20 years ago aren't safe around children - but whenever the pedophile is gay "we believe he wont offend again".

              are taking cases about children!!) and lets make up a spreadsheet statistically proving the judges are baised towards gay pedophiles. Faggots say it's a crime to believe in ex-gays - but their judges sure believe in ex-gay-pedophiles "that won't offend again".

              - do you Agree with Australian gay jew judges there is such a thing as a "ex-gay-pedophile" - and if there can be ex gay pedophiles why is ex-gay therapy illegal in America - where doctors get 2 years jail for the crime of telling a child who was anal raped gay you don't have to be gay!

              Once the child is raped gay, like Milo was, Like George Tekei was - nobody must get in the Gay Lobby's road from that child's bum being their collective property in years to come.

              SEE WHAT THEIR REFORMS ARE DOING IN REAL LIFE. On the 3rd censored version of this thread I gave a post from a DOCTOR / PSYCHOLOGIST about BBBS but I was told to censor that - or try and fit different things in the 10,000 characters.

              quit the asshatter propedo games and just let me do my work. I'll put a lot more effort into MY OPs - and you put a lot more effort in restraining your shut it down - it's wrong to blackpill people on the truth of LGBTI+ Jewish pedophilia normalization.

              Credit to the jews they tell their own kids they better be straight etc... but with us goyim it's a game to them to corrupt and turn is into human cattle. This LGBTI, BPA Estrogen mimicking crap, cucking of our race is just to cull the heard a bit. But if you look at the videos of the blue face painted men jumping around in isreal with a gay leader ( i want to find that censored video again!!! - youtube takes too much down) you'll see maybe they are drinking too much of their own cool-aid.

                  hate is a totally appropriate emotion to feel toward the jews who do PG..you always prove my point about women when youre trying to refute me, it would be endearing if you weren't pretending you could actually help anything.  women are to be SEEN and not HEARD, and preferably not very much

              You are tagging my trolls now Vindicator.... faaak me. It's done. Agree to diagree and leave the 24h hold. Censorship gets you nowwhere. I'll only link to this when I dig up all the MSM about the homosexual child abuse (pretty much only) at BBBS in America and the warnings given in 2002 that it would happen on my next post.

               No, hojuruku. I pinged the other mods whose job it is to remove expired flairs so they would be sure to give you more time to edit. I guess that was wasted effort on my part. You seem determined to believe everyone is out to get you.

                 bruh I described exactly what they do, so don't give them the excuse.  you use some colorful language to describe a website and he'll pretend you are actually claiming it is a public site specifically advertised as connecting gay pedos to their boy victims.  this is obviously preposterous and impossible, but they will pretend it isn't and demand you prove it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 so just delete those  unnecessarily colorful references (we already know theyre all faggots and pedos and kikes) and try to keep it to one line per subject, or bullet points, and more readable format.
                </p>
                <p>
                 REGARDING THE SUB yes its obviously ridiculous for Q-tards, which is essentially a rival conspiracy theory intending to elbow out PG with the twist of never, ever Naming The Jew, to be PG moderators and put stickies about it.  but we know they are kikeshills and if we get more people to realize how much they protect Jews that's worth more than a few kike pedo names.  i'll pull up some examples later and we can compile them

                 Sorry, dude. That's not how proving something works. You made a definitive statement that Disney and BBBS facilitate child abuse. You have to prove it with linked evidence, not hypothetical statements about what might be happening. We have a subverse for that:
                 <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                  v/pizzagatewhatever
                 </a>
                 .
                </p>
                <p>
                 We also have a subverse for complaints about how the subverse is moderated and the community agreed long ago those discussions to not belong on the research board or in research posts. Your belligerent unwillingness to honor the rules and remove that material from your post will not only force us to remove this thread, but all future ones that ignore Rule 4 as well. The flair is a privelege, not an entitlement, and it won't be offered to you in the future.

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Just look at all the cases on the first 1.2 pages (13  google results) i've tried to fit in the OP but didn't have chacters. Gay men and boys on dating sites = child abuse. Look at all the MSM coverage backing up my claims.

                  So try again vindicator. Answer the questions I quoted. Quote my questions again then type your answers to them.
DO IT PLEASE. Don't be evasive by refusing to justify your abhorrent censorship actions.

                   Claiming that you failed to provide adequate sources is not the same as "refuting". Do you understand how research works? He is not saying that you are wrong. He is saying that in this sub you need to provide direct evidence. Speculation does not meet the standard. You will ignore this. Because you are a troll.

                    Go back there kikelord where you belong - stop attacking trying to shoot the anti-pedophilia messenger on the anti Jewish BBBS pedophilia thread.
There is a thread to talk about how great it is to attack people who haven't got the LGBTI memo that sex with children is good. Go back to where you started talking shit first Vinny or whoever the fuck you are.

                     What do you think you look like to people? Crying about people giving you down votes but posting everywhere about how people should give down votes to people you don't like. Crying about being "censored" but telling a user like me that I shouldn't be allowed to speak my mind.

                    <p>
                     You are baiting the mods and everyone sees it. When they ban you no one will care except your sockpuppet alts. It is strange how they only came out to support you when you were limited and then disappeared once you weren't. Did you down vote your own account so that you could play the victim and try to discredit the mod team here?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You are a troll. Every one sees it. I have to use this account because you will order your alts to down vote anyone who stands up to you.

                    use your real account vinny. I'm glad you are taking the first steps to accept you are prick by not using your real account because you (or at least your kikeshill alias) don't to be held accountable for it.

            - can you remove the 24 flag on this now. I've wrote it out again only this time more chronologically and removed the amount of screen real-estate related to housekeeping that hopefully will never come up again in future posts as I take on the homosexual pedophilia normalization mafia (Burns and his confirmed doxxed jew judges, gay police covering up pedophile links to the gay lobby etc) down-under.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll also work with more voat markdown in future to make my discuss posts more easy to read. I ask that you allow others to link to blogs instead of discuss posts where appropriate or videos if the title is absolutely correct rather than demanding discus posts  for everything. That suggestion I think kicked this all off and it still stands. I will take your criticism and advice as a moderator as long as you make truthful fair and true claims.  If your claims are refuted it's the path of least resistance to admit you were wrong. I hope the 4th edit of this is at least better in your eyes than the first. I'm glad I properly sourced your first concern - that it really is a gay dating site for gay men and boys the 2nd-4th time around. If it wasn't for your request for clarification I wouldn't' have dug up more on that angle. It's not an admission you were right - but I'm saying it helped get more intel out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'd also appreciate how far I can go on those Jewish judges with the doxxes on them and get an answer to the
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             /v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            post hidden by downvotes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also the boys are getting close re the $10-20 bet but they don't want payment which is infuriating me.  Others told me how to block in my settings so all anon subverses stop pinging me - so I'm not involved with that ass-hatery anymore no matter what they do. I suggest pizzagate mods do the same and ignore the kike shills over there.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have confirmed the surname has Jewish connections and are getting close.

               Please help your mentally ill son.
              </p>
              <p>
               Your son Luke needs your help.
              </p>
              <p>
               The material published in the link below by your son Luke confirms he is sick.
              </p>
              <p>
               As a parent of a mentally ill child you have a responsibility to get up off your fat arse and help a sick son.
              </p>

Dear Mr. Mc Kee,
I'm reliably informed by a third party a YouTube clip is going to be published in relation to you and your associates.
I hope no one accuses you or your associates or any of your family members of being child rapists as you've done with me and other innocent people in this publication.
Karma is on its way Mr. Mc Kee so fasten your seat belts belts because it's suddenly going to become a bumpy ride for you and your prevented entourage.
Order the pop corn and enjoy yourself.
Have a nice day.
Warm regards,
..........

             See how big the Shannon McCoole cover-up to protect (((Disney Big Brothers Big Sisters))) was - and I was the guy who exposed in 2015 Shannon McCoole worked there. John / William Hall at Camp Horizions VA dot com is seriously suspect and I"ve got him squirming on tape when I find out he's running the camp on a fake name, but uses his real profile account not normally linked to the camp to talk to Shannon McCoole.

             We care, including the mods.  And that includes the mods. All that I understand right now is that Disney has some pedos. We know that. We understand. Give us ammo. This Jewish Kids Org, they are definitely on the radar too. Spell it out. This type, remember that.

             We get it. There are a lot of religious fronts acting as good people. Give us ammo, but give it to us in a format we can act on. I believe you, chill, feed the mill,, we will help you.

            I believe in your work. Your presentation is so busy that I honestly cannot understand what you are telling us. Break it down into pieces, or something. I think the mods here will let you tell the story. The mods are trying to help you. Here is my suggestion:
           </p>
           <p>
            Start with the Jewish kids care org and state your case. Make it more simple. Your posts are so complicated that I cannot understand it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe you, but, I don't understand you. The mods will let you post it, just clean it up.

             We are all here for one purpose only: to spread awareness of the Jewish Problem so that no time will be wasted in assigning proper blame when shit goes down.
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever you choose to believe whatever you want about the mods,  but they are irresponsible at the least for not highlighting the particularly elevated risk of our readers involving their kids with Jewish organizations.

             !!!!!! WE know of the mods censorship here, and have spoken out many times about it. The mods here delete OUR hit post on Pedo Rob Reiner!!! Wtf???? WE have 'dark web' allies that WILL attack these mods; The mods made some "mistakes". Look for a post coming down the pipe entitled " unmasking the pedo mods at voat ".............
Their safety is not OUR concern

              I believe you as well. Just condense it. So Disney makes a dating site called Big Brothers, big sisters? Ok link that. Yet Disney does not run the site, Disney hires "jewish care" brand to run it? Ok link that. Disney is a jew owned and operated company at this point, so it makes sense, but a link is still necessary.
"Gay men and boys use it" ok thats also easy to believe. So it should be a short post.
"Disney makes a dating site called Big bro big sister"... Link
Its run by jewish care brand"... Link
"Gay men and boys use it"... Link
"The boys get abused"... Link
And yes kikes and faggots are a real obstacle for civilized humanity. Thats common sense at this point. History, facts, statistics prove it. And just look around, its obvious. To say otherwise it the result of jew brainwashing. Jews have been kicked out of 109 countries "but did nothing to deserve it" LOL
Imagine a friend gets kicked out of a bar and says "those assholes kicked me out for no reason, I didnt do anything!".... You say "thats sucks man what assholes"
Then he says "so I went to 108 other bars that night and they all kicked me out for no reason!"
Lol. hmmm, no reason? Lol. Just Bad luck and jealousy? Fucking jews. The goyim know all the shit they're up to, so jews are working on ending free speech. Its their only hope for survival. Their asses are about to get camped again.

              Start with that because I still don't understand it. It will be good news here and nobody will censor it. The 10,000 character limit on posts is not your friend. Make it more simple so that we can understand it. Your post does not need to be that long. Make your posts shorter. Hit your points. Expand later with more posts.
             </p>
             <p>
              Your posts are on topic, and, they are so long and such a blizzard that we cannot understand.

             I haven't been over there to see what's going on, hojuruku. I try to avoid drama as much as possible. From where I stand, you look like you're working a bunch of alts to cause a shitstorm. You're wearin' out your welcome. I do know that old goats don't like upvote requests and will downvote such "Reddity" behavior exuberantly. Most of them hate drama, as well. It sounds to me like you triggered the Voat immune system.

              If anyone gets proof the guy in that thread is Jewish before me - there is a bounty. $20 bucks of ETH I mined in the last couple of months, and the transaction will be done live on here. I'm good for it.

               You're welcome to ask Cheesebooger about that. I was modding from my phone during the heavy DDoS attacks we had during the fall, and Voat was very laggy. I type very fast, and the remove button is right next to the reply button. I hit it twice accidentally when I was trying to reply to
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Cheesebooger">

               's comment. I immediately DMed him and apologized and he said no hard feelings. My reply to his comment ended up in the removal reason field.

                 If I remember correctly, Vindicator did PM me, he told me it was an accident and apologized to me and told me to repost it if I wanted to. I didn't even bother. I will say this; I'm not saying all of them at Pizzagate, but I'm saying quite a few, refuse to point out the jewish pattern in all of these sexual attacks. Thanks for batting for me, though. I appreciate it.

                  said that and from the point he said that I've been mentioning he claimed it was an accident - a slip of the delete button and S-U-R-E keys. It would be nice if vindicator could post a screenshot of the mobile voat app screen from his point of view, to see if he really does have more than the "submit reply cancel / preview" buttons. I WANT TO BELIEVE him

                  It's gone from kike-shaming mod bitch-fight into a hunt the jew pedo for sport and expose the MSM coverup - which is also what I did with this thread with Shannon McCoole especially in the 1st thread. I prefer not to find the answer myself. I hope someone else can do it, because I want this story to be apart of the history and lore of a new website I am thinking of building to put crypto bounties on the arrest or forensically shaming of a pedophile who grooms kids. I'd put bounties on some VIP pedophiles who get away with it Like Garry Burns head "anti-discrimination activist" or the second most famous who got done for child porn Alex Gollan who's also 2IC of ANTIFA to have people keep a keen eye on them.

I have screenshots of his articles in my possession they were censored of my scribd and and their mossad wrote text triggered the gay pedophile scribd legal officer Jason Bently who terminated my scribd account who blogs about watching children fuck on the blog linked to his linkedin profile as exposed here:

                    's word for it but they looked like pedophiles saying the same as the cunt who lead the Sydney Mardi Grass in 2010 - a Jew Peter Tatchell who copies the claim from the Talmud that sex with 9 year old boys bring joy and how pedophilia isn't harmful just like the pedo trolls who had their comments deleted from Pizzagate said.

               Larry Nassar’s surname is listed as Arabic, though he is Catholic.
              </p>
              <p>
               One commenter pointed out that “most US based papers wouldn’t look too closely about his family background since he has an Arabic last name,” and this is probably true–especially in the xenophobic atmosphere of the Trump era.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, it should be noted that the majority of high-profile men accused of, and charged with, sexual predation on women and girls are Jews.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sandusky’s a Jew, Weinstein’s a Jew, Franken’s a Jew, etc., etc, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               The fact is that Jewish men have been getting away with so many crimes in the United States of which they’ve been hypocritically accusing their Gentile counterparts–because they can.
              </p>
              <p>
               Generally speaking, Jews have never held themselves to the same standards as Gentiles. If they are the “Chosen People of God,” why should they?
              </p>
              <p>
               U.S. based papers never dare say anything about the Jewish background of countless high-profile criminals and scoundrels–because U.S. based papers are owned and edited by Jews, in the first place.
              </p>
              <p>
               In fact, the most pervasive form of discrimination practiced in the United States today is that of Jews against Gentiles–it truly is occurring in every sector of our society today.
              </p>
              <p>
               But no one dare calls the Jews out on this discrimination, for the same reason that no one dares mention their ancestral background, when they are accused of, and charged with, crimes–he or she would automatically be labeled anti-Semitic, and shunned by our society, even if he or she is Jewish.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is time for the Jews to abandon their collective superiority complex–to abandon the ungodly belief, which is drilled into their minds from infancy, that any people has ever been the “Chosen People of God.”
              </p>
              <p>
               It is time for the Jews to hold themselves accountable for their collective transgressions and atrocities, as an ancestral group–just as every other racial, ethnic, and ancestral group has, and does.

               Scott: Part of your point was made on national television by Larry David…
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/snl-host-larry-david-roasts-harvey-weinstein-why-do-so-many-sexual-harassers-have-to-be-jews">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               and also in a specifically Jewish newspaper:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="https://www.jta.org/2017/11/21/life-religion/harvey-weinstein-and-al-franken-are-jewish-but-are-they-jewish-news">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               It would be challenging for Jewish men to be responsible for most of the complaints that American women voice. 60 percent of American women say that they have been sexually harassed (see
               <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/11/21/60-percent-of-women-have-been-sexually-harassed-poll/">
                https://nypost.com/2017/11/21/60-percent-of-women-have-been-sexually-harassed-poll/
               </a>
               ). Jews are roughly 1.8 percent of the population (
               <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/02/how-many-jews-are-there-in-the-united-states/">
                http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/02/how-many-jews-are-there-in-the-united-states/
               </a>
               ).
              </p>
              <p>
               If Jewish men are more likely than non-Jews to be involved in commercial sexual relationships with women, as you’ve suggested, and it is because of something in the Jewish religion, where are the observant Jews on the Great List of the Accused? Harvey Weinstein had a Jewish surname, but was he known for piety? For going to synagogue? For having a Jewish faith?
              </p>
              <p>
               [If you want to see how deeply religious Jews think about the concept of the “Chosen People”, see

              </p>
              <p>
               Have you considered the possibility that Jews have been disproportionately successful in Hollywood (partly due to other industries not wanting to hire Jewish employees at the time that Hollywood started up) and the public is disproportionately interested in what happens in Hollywood? If you hear that a waitress reports being sexually harassed at her job in a Denny’s in Arkansas, do you think “the manager was probably a Jew?”
              </p>
              <p>
               On the other hand, maybe an investigation of Larry Nassar’s past will prove your point! He might be Jewish. Or maybe there were Jews telling him what to do when he was in high school and college!

              I AM ASKING THESE PRICKS TO BE INVESTIGATED and you accuse me of running them. Clearly you are acting like a shill. Look at the comment of mine I replied to got nearly the 6 member downvote gang response.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only other person saying I am running the alts are the cunts you have trolling me.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have never ran an alt and it would stand out a mile a way if I did. So quit it with the false allegations or PROVIDE SOURCES AS I DID IN THE POSTS YOU DELETED.

               Hojuruku, you apparently don't understand natural consequences. You've been in here for going on two days straight filling modmail and PG mod inboxes with toxic venom accusing us of being pedos, stalkers, shills, gays, rapists and Jews. You are a fool if you expect us not to downvote your foul shit talking. Do you see how many PG mods there are in the sidebar? That about square up to the number of downvotes you are getting on your scores of repetitive insulting comments? If you don't want downvotes, don't come in here and talk shit. It's quite simple.

                Look at the clusterfuck of the 1st thread and see people downvoting me sharing news stories about pedophiles....
               </p>
               <p>
                Another strawman argument. Why were those news articles about big brothers big sisters pedophiles downvoated by the exact same number of people who downvoted the mod trolling of me eh? Who says it's wrong to share news stories about pedophiles here? Humm.....

                You are clearly not telling the full truth in your responses to me - hence why you get another response that correct / triggers the downvote x 6 sockpuppets.

            I had to repost this because it just shows what's been going on for years here. I got threads deleted about pedophiles trolling me on youtube at the exact same time someone else was doing it on here. These pedophiles thought child sex dolls were a good idea.

             I DID cite primary sources in the very beginning in the OP. That's what IWITOPTWFT links are.

            <p>
             You say I can't read. I can't click on links. I say they are not cited - there is nothing to see there that proves these claims that I with my authority say are unproven..... that are infact proven in the OP.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah did this comment trigger you? Pedophiles trolling me on youtube who say CHILD SEX DOLLS ARE GOOD MMMKAY. The shit you guys have deleted over the years is very interesting...

             WOW it got downvoted by your gang - First 2 at first, and then before the thread is archived no doubt a lot more.

            <p>
             I guess it's wrong to be against men who love child sex dolls and think they are good trolling you on youtube right?

             nb - so I gave that to vindicator tucked away in the discussion where most normal people wouldn't expand the thread to read it in the last 10 mins. And wow instantly after putting the link here two downvotes from Vindicator. That's pretty much how it went on every comment I was making on the original thread that killed my account.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then half a hour before the thread was deleted another 4x people jumped on the pedo downvoat gang taskforce to take out a shitload of CCP for fighting the mod trolls and copypasting MSM stories about BBBS that only seems to be linked to homosexual child abuse. The big sisters are being well behaved or not getting caught.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now who downvotes someone complaining about a SOB harassing my youtube channel who is putting out videos about Child sex dolls are being a good idea?
            </p>
            <p>
             It's wrong to be against child sex doll lovers trolling you - how dare you complain in the right place too - a thread about child sex dolls.

            : We are happy to accept your clearly sourced research post about Australian pro-pedo chicanery, submitted with a clear and accurate title. If you want us to leave it up, you'll need to make sure each claim is supported by an embedded link. Posts that were removed due to rule violations are not sufficient support. It's your decision to encumber the essential PG-related news you are trying to share with additional claims that also require linked support. For example, if you call a judge a "baby rapist", you need to link to evidence the judge has been convicted of sex crimes. You need to build your research thread step-by-step, without assuming everyone understands what you are saying, and you need to give support for each piece of your argument.

            As a result, I am giving you yet another edit warning. If you want this thread to remain up you need to remove the Rule 4 stuff. You need to remove the links to removed posts. To satisfy Rule 2, you need to link to an actual primary source, not a link to you posting on 8chan. You need to state your premise, state why it's important to the PG investigation, and then give the evidence, step-by-step, with links to primary sources for each claim. These are the rules the

If you are serious about the corruption that shelters gays who consume child porn and adopt kids, I urge you to accept our community research standards.

             and after 24 hours or weeks posts get no response from a mod. It's like transferring someone to a voicemail account that never gets listened to.

             They are saying because you don't like pedophilia mod censorship also all your research on jewishcare disney bbbs man boy dating site is "null and void"
            </p>
            <p>
             The thread was only about the latter until the mods hijacked it and trolled - then tactically mass downvoted. And once all the downvotes where locked in and done from all 6 faggots. boom the thread was deleted a bit early so the damage couldn't be reversed - or so you thought. I still don't know how I got from -160 to 150 ccp in the last 24 hours.

             No vindicator. Everyone see's what you did to my voat account. If I didn't have the ability to reply to friends who sent me messages without requiring high CCP my account would still be -145 and blocked over all of VOAT.

              You made an incredibly long thread, with layers of claims piled on top of each other. Not a single one of them included an embedded link to a primary source that supported them. When you were asked to edit the post to add embedded links, you refused.

              Why do you feel entitled to post to a lower standard than everyone else who posts here, hojuruku? If you cared about kids, you wouldn't be sperging out talking incessantly about how wronged you've been. If you were doing great research, folks would be cheering you on in the Comments, and upvoting you like crazy. You can keep spewing your vitriol and choose to not repost this thread properly. That is up to you. But if you want to keep posting in

               That wasn't me. So when you loose an argument you or your mates run around all of voat saying I fuck kids. That's really nice you piece of shit.

                The vote manipulation came from a group of kikes who are voting in the shadow to fit their narrative/agenda. Their voting powers can range from 5 to as much as 15 votes per comment. This isn't the first time that has happened; certainly it won't be the last. Without the admin looking into it, unfortunately, it is not possible to pinpoint the group behind it with concrete evidence.

                You shouldn't pay attention to the anon subverses. In fact, I encourage you to completely block those anon subverses. Unsurprisingly, these anon subverses are often run by this group of kikes as well. They are intended to cause conflicts and dramas among other goats. You should treat such submissions as dirt and pure garbage! Don't waste your time on anon. If you are interested to see what came out of bullshit anon drama,

                .
               </p>
               <p>
                I went through some of your submissions and they were hard to follow. You have a lot of material that weren't well organized into smaller pieces. Furthermore, you made a fuck load of comments with walls of text running around multiple submissions. This makes it very very difficult for the readers to follow through. I think you are onto something good, just need to break it down into consistent pieces. Remember, if it takes lots of comments to get the points across, it will be difficult for others to digest.
               </p>
               <p>
                Another side note, if you edit your comments a lot, it will be difficult and waste of time for users engaged with your conversation. It's counterproductive having to skim through your comments multiple times to spot your new edits. Lastly, the pings don't work with edits and you can only ping 5 users per comment.

                  Yeah these kikes in the shadow have targeted many users, especially active users. Anyways, it is good that we get them out of the way and not be deceived with in-group fight. Much of your energy can be spent doing the research. But we should also keep in mind that the massive downvoats aren't necessarily from users who are engaged with the conversation.

                  There may be a time where you do not know if a link is safe, where clicking on the link could expose your ip address and trace back to your physical location. It may be a good idea to get a VPN, or use archive.fo to archive the page. If you need to upload something, make sure to strip the metadata off the media. This is important because sometimes it contains geocoordinate that can trace back to your exact physical location. Practice caution and avoid getting doxxed.

                   on twitter who got botted off once I doxxed him breaking police policy. A senior FOI officer Linda Trost was taken off the case and my true Nemesis sister of Garry Richard Burns (they both hail from Yass) put on a homosexual FOI officer that blogs about doing public sex crimes, going to orgies with the former police minister, and teaching little Japanese boys at a remote fishing village.

                   WOW look at my posts on that thread. I triggered the downvote pedo gang FIRST by exposing Fiona Barnett was an OTO assett to discredit critisim against the OTO by making unbelievable allegations (2000km long deep underground bases, surving a trip to America on a C7 galaxy unpressurized with no oxygen etc) - build up by channel 7 and brought down by the faggots at ABC media watch.

                     Just one lead on an OTO cunt not being careful enough usually brings dividend. They are all masons and child abusers. postimage.org lost their domain in some kind of takedown and they are pissed (postimages.org now). Also videos showing OTO Gnostic Catholic mass actual fucking orgy scenes was deleted just before the latest court case came out!

                     wasn't my sock-puppet even though he didn't get a fair shake from the mods. The OTO is actively hunting shit on the internet that can be used against them. Links to Scientology could inspire an anonymous operation and he was looking for that.

                       I didn't even know she was a she. Clearly not my sockpuppet. Anyway that name means incest child of the OTO. I need to dig up jack parson's FBI file again and make a post on him. I saw it online. Maybe someone can beat me to it and tag me.

                     It would be nice off the record for me to get a PM on some of the cunts who downvoted the OTO stuff and see if they are linked to the recent attacks.

                Not sure what you're on about. I have never been to AnonTalk. I can't even keep up with your effluvium in my inbox, Hojuruku. Would you like me to post a screenshot of mountains of shit you've spewed my way over the last 48 hours? I am not the one trying to turn

                 You say I can't read. I can't click on links. I say they are not cited - there is nothing to see there that proves these claims that I with my authority say are unproven..... that are infact proven in the OP.

                   you just keep saying it's legit. THEN COPY AND PASTE ONE OF HIS CLAIMS YOU THINK IS LEGIT - and SAY THIS CLAIM IS LEGIT.

                   Dating sites do friendship. Gay men and boys are allowed to use Disney's "Ourspace" - I've proven that. Sometimes people also fuck who they met on dating sites and that's obvious it's happening here - because gay men and boys matchmaked by BBBS are getting fucked and it's coming up in the news. It's a fair call.

                   So follow the how not to be a kikeshill mod by copying and pasting vindicator's claims and how you think they are right or you accept you aren't really supporting his claims - you just support his intellectually dishonest censorship as a fellow kikeshill.
