<p>We need to look through these and see what relationships are revealed. For both the town of Mattoon and the lobbying firm of Podesta-Mattoon. </p>
<p><strong>web search results</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a lobbyist, Hastert worked on, among other specialties, technology issues. Piggybacking on that, his older son, Joshua, hit Washington soon after Denny became Speaker in 1999. Voila! The pierced-tongued owner of a record store in DeKalb called Seven Dead Arson became a lobbyist focusing on technology and defense issues. Josh started his new gig, working for mp3.com’s lobbyist who had been an aide to former House Republican Minority Leader Bob Michel, a close colleague of Josh’s father.</p>
<p>Josh then moved to a small firm, Federal Legislative Associates, that lobbied on tech issues. Moving on up, he was soon hired by lobbying firm, Podesta Mattoon, headed by two old friends of his father’s—Tony Podesta, a fellow Illinoisan, and, with Hastert, a student government leader in the 1960s, and Dan Matoon, a close friend/advisor of Hastert’s who ran his first congressional campaign. In 2006, while his father was still holding the Speaker’s gavel, Josh was hired by Google as part of a team of Podesta Matton lobbyists. </p>
<p>In a conversation with Jonathan Franzen for The New Yorker, Josh held up his father as a model—they both love small business—and, as a lobbyist, he told Franzen, he’d be helping “smaller defense contractors…who are taking on the Big Four contractors.” (Josh would later become a registered lobbyist for Lockheed Martin.) He had promised not to lobby his father but didn’t extend the promise to other congressmen. “I never introduce myself as ‘Joshua Hastert, son of the speaker,’” he told the Chicago Sun-Times’ Lynn Sweet. He didn’t have to. A website promoting his skills touted his “long-standing relationships with numerous offices on Capitol Hill and in the administration.”</p>

            I find it odd that Dr. Podesta, a dentist, was one of a few army men that were tasked with creating plastic eyeballs in WWII.  Apparently that group of men was led by another dentist:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I would think it would have been led by an eye doctor.

            EDIT: According to this article the glass used for fake eyes only came from Germany, and that stopped when the war started. Plastics were the next obvious chice, and apparently dentistry had been using plastics more than any other medical field at that point:

            I'm the OP from the original post.  I'm local to the area. You can ask me questions, but I'm not saying I'll have any answers. I just found out about  this yesterday right before I posted about it.

            Just a random thought &amp; off topic, I wonder if they use dentistry not only for access to drugs but to microchip people to.
