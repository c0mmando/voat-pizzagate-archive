             I'm from the area of where Ghost Ship was located. This type of art studio and people are common to the SF Bay Area. Art communities like these are loosely connected with the local Burning Man crowds and
             <strong>
              an industrial art school located in Oakland called the Crucible.
             </strong>
             As far as I know there was nothing nefarious going on here like human trafficking, parties like this are common for this venue. Now if some are saying that these people were witches and doing some type of blood ritual, that's not uncommon around here either. Anyone who cares to look into this please do but from what I can tell this is as how it's presented by the media, a tragedy.

            An interesting person who showed up on my trevails was fashion photographer Kenny Hoff who has a playlist of videos from the Ghost Ship on his Youtube channel:

            Seems to be very much part of the whole Burning Man thing

            Seems that the Ghost Ship could have been drawing quite an interesting crowd...

             I knew a guy that lived in GhostShip. It wasn't satanic, it was just a big dirty crash pad for crusty artists...buncha burners (people who base their identity on going to burning man, and try to re-create it the other 352 days of the year). Nothing sinister....only reason it happened is coz tech came in and housing prices/rent got so astronomical, artists have to resort to living in a shitty, structurally dangerous warehouse if they want to live in the bay.
            </p>
            <p>
             The crucible teaches interested people how to weld. It's like a MakerSpace, which the bay area is full of. These are attempts from artists to create spots for other artists, as techies continue to squeeze all the life and culture from the bay with their autistic, virtual version of life.
            </p>
            <p>
             Nothing sinister here....just very sad.

             What does a nuclear physicist at CERN and a co-founder of the Burning Man event have in common? They are both part of a community looking for the God particle and they both feel that without their work, their life would have no meaning.

             Then I found this utterly (b)anal TED Talk where the speaker marvels at people being creative without being motivated by what the prject is worth - he focused on Burning Man. I only listened to the first hew minutes where he mentioned "The Temple of Juno" created by the artist David Best.

            i lived in oakland for 5 years up until this past december. if you call 911 from a cell phone, it gets routed to the CHP, not the OPD. weve called several times and either been hung up on, told its not crucial, or just had officers arrive hours later. OPD/OFD are fucking useless and are the sole reason i took my ham radio test and got my sig p229. because when shit pops off here in the bay area and/or the big one hits, i wont be calling emergency services, ill be defending my family and the neighbors i like.

            Four Oakland police officers have been fired following a nearly year-long investigation into a sex abuse scandal, City Administrator Sabrina Landreth said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seven other officers will be suspended without pay and an additional cop will receive counseling and training, Landreth said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Accusations against the officers who were fired include attempted sexual assault, lewd conduct and assisting in prostitution, according to Landreth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Landreth made the announcement with Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf during a late Wednesday afternoon news conference to discuss the investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I am deeply sorry for the harm that this scandal has caused, particularly to community trust," Schaaf said.
           </p>
           <p>
            The mayor said the discipline "sends a loud and clear message that we will hold our officers to nothing but the highest standards of professionalism and integrity."
           </p>
           <p>
            Civil rights attorney John Burris believes further punishment is due.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I’m hopeful that there are criminal charges because they should be prosecuted," Burris said. "We’re talking about men police officers having sex with a minor."

           <p>
            The Aug. 27, 2015, fire was extinguished without injuries or property damage — but it was a close call in an area adjacent to the 1991 Oakland firestorm where 25 people died. In the year and a half since, it has become a flashpoint for growing concerns that the fire department is failing to control dangerous conditions in the Oakland hillsides — and that some employees may be covering up the inadequacies in the inspection program.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, as the Oakland Fire Department is coming under even more scrutiny in the wake of the deadly Ghost Ship fire, for the first time a firefighter is blowing the whistle and asking: Why was that property marked as compliant, and who created apparently faked documents involving inspections near that Elverton fire?
           </p>
           <p>
            But the biggest shock to firefighter Zac Unger came a week later. He filed a California Public Records Act request to his own department for 2014 and 2015 inspection records of properties on Elverton Drive. What he received led Unger to wonder whether the documents he received were created to appease his curiosity.
           </p>
           <p>
            The documents, addressed to homeowners, claimed five properties had passed inspections a month earlier. The sixth claimed a property had passed inspection in early 2014 but informed the homeowner they were cleared through the 2015 fire season, despite no annual inspection that year. Although unsigned, the forms listed the author as former Oakland fire Marshal James Williams, who had left the department two years earlier.
           </p>
           <p>
            Williams, now a Sonoma County fire marshal, declined to comment when reached by reporters, confirming only that he was not an Oakland fire department employee in 2015.
           </p>

            OAKLAND — A little more than three months after the deadly Ghost Ship fire and with the investigative report still pending, the city’s first African American female fire chief Teresa Deloach Reed filed retirement papers Tuesday, days after her city pension vested, the city administrator said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reed, a 59-year-old Oakland resident, filed retirement paperwork Tuesday with an effective date of May 5, City Administrator Sabrina Landreth confirmed. Reed is currently earning $155,772 a year in retirement from her previous 26 years of service at San Jose Fire, where she left in 2012 as an assistant chief.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reed’s city pension vested after five years, adding 15 percent of her $241,000 salary, or $36,150 a year to her overall retirement pay. Assistant Fire Chief Mark Hoffmann is acting fire chief. Reed did not return a call Tuesday evening.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reed will be remembered as the head of a fire department that dealt with the city’s deadliest fire ever. On Dec. 2, 36 people attending a concert died when a large blaze consumed the Fruitvale warehouse that was being illegally used as a residential space.

            Hmm.  Lots of nefarious happenings in the PD and FD.  Suppose there could be covering up of some really heinous happenings that fateful night?  I would not be one bit surprised.

              Article from Washington Post By Peter Hermannon -  August 16, 2016
             </p>
             <p>
              D.C. Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier announced Tuesday that she will step down next month to take over as head of security for the National Football League, leaving behind a legacy of community engagement that endeared her from the city’s crime-ridden neighborhoods to the broader national stage.
             </p>
             <p>
              Lanier is ending her 26-year career after recently turning 49, and four months short of serving a full decade heading one of the nation’s highest-profile police departments. She was the District’s first permanent female chief.
             </p>
             <p>
              “What’s more important than being responsible for public safety and security in the nation’s capital?” Lanier said. “Where do you go from here, right? When I thought about the NFL, it’s America’s favorite sport, and what’s more important than making sure America’s favorite sport is safe?”
             </p>
             <p>
              Now one of the nation’s most influential figures in law enforcement, Lanier rose from a challenging childhood, dropping out of high school at age 14 because she was pregnant and later earning a GED, a bachelor’s degree and two master’s degrees. She has had an unusually long tenure heading a major police department, persevering through political tumult to work for three mayors.
             </p>
             <p>
              “She’s built a fantastic force, professionalized the force, built a force that the community trusts, which is going to be a lasting legacy,” Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said.

            Every once in a while I think of that place and what Really Happened to those poor Victims.  Never did sit right with me.  Lot of people mixed up in questionable crimes have died in car mishaps lately.  Seems to be a habit lately.  Culkin was one.  Now this.

              It is so obvious to those of us who can see.  Without blinders.  All the right clues are right there.  Amazing people don't react when a Witness/Victim mysteriously disappears or dies right before testifying.  Really dumb if this is just swept under the rug.  Pedo Parties run by the LAPD and the LAFD are held and the Kids disappear and no on questions.  California has been covering up these trafficking crimes for decades.  No one really pays attention.  Let's hope some friends and family are still brave enough to show up in court.
