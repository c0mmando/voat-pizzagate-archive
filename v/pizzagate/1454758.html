            Hmmm. Well we know he gets donations from Hillary so I'm sure paying for something to be built underneath the building, or nearby, can be done on the down low. What you said is interesting. You should take some screen shots

             My point is that the visual pattern on the roof may be caused due to the undermining of the walls at specific points, if there is not enough support from bellow ( think shoring up timbers and support beams to span the trench/tunnel) it may well cause low points that then transfer all the way up to the roof.  I know, lots of reading and trying to connect dots can get tiring, I'm trying to find the balance between long winded too much detail and too short no info.

              Why wouldn't there already be tunnels consider when these building were built, pretty much all commercial properties within the cities had boiler tunnels under them.

               Scale matters, centralized boilers and the associated utilidors tend to part of larger institutions, like hospitals, schools and government facilities. Not 80 year old strip malls built in what at that time would have been the outskirts of town.

                Where I am, we have several similar layouts that have boiler tunnels for a "block" heat system that used to be central to these. The old large buildings have tunnels that went to a city boiler. Depending on age, they do vary but these larger buildings even as late as the 60's were still being connected to the central municipal boiler system and have many tunnels.
               </p>
               <p>
                Imagine if these business's had to each have their own coal fire furnaces just because they were and small strip.. It would be a disaster. And every unit would have to have a basement, even if they used oil heat, they would still need a basement for the furnace and the black smoke and soot would be terrible.

                 Fair enough, if that is the case (pre-existing tunnels for steam ) would they simply have penetrations for the plumbing alone or would they have mandoors to each address, I don't know. Here is my other post

                 .  It's just odd, like all the other coincidences that constantly keep popping up.

                  The tunnels I've seen vary from 2 foot diameter culvert for short runs to 8 foot by 8 foot corridors. Boiler pipes were seldom buried solid as they are a high maintenance item that needs lots of attention. Burying them can also create dangerous cocktail if pipes fail underground. Thats why boilers always used tunnels.

                   That's what I'm getting at, steam pipes almost always have tunnels as you say, but getting from the utility tunnel to the individual addresses would not require access points for a person to fit through, just enough to replace the plumbing as needed.  Fast forward to the present era and if someone were to try and capitalize on these now abandoned tunnels by retrofitting I doubt they would use the permitting process ( remember the context).  Would there be municipal records for such a network, if it exists in that locale ?

                    I found another thread that had links to photos of Comet. I just copied my post from that thread..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    These photos give us absolute proof that Comet Ping Pong has a basement..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Here is the main floor, you can see the rafter above.
                    <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/expo86/2818439733/in/faves-76789827@N03/">

                    </a>
                    Also if you look at the outside of the building you can clearly see there is no room for any upper level, not even a crawl space.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Now here is the basement where you can clearly see FLOOR JOISTS..

                    Somebody archive these photos before they take them down please.. These are proof of a basement!!

                     Regarding the "two story" listing thing, I think that comes from the change of elevation at the rear of the building, like a split level home.  Regarding this picture
                     <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/metalchris/5710493003/in/faves-76789827@N03/">

                     there are a couple of things that stick out, first is the guy standing by the speaker looks just like this guy with his arms crossed ( I was informed by another poster he is a business partner with J. A. )
                     <a href="https://i.sli.mg/2TXOhU.png">
                      https://i.sli.mg/2TXOhU.png
                     </a>
                     , in a contracting outfit called  HERECOMESYOURMAN LLC , his name and profile if it is the same person is here
                     <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-kreher-54551338">
                      https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-kreher-54551338
                     </a>
                     . I suppose that makes sense if they are business partners.  Back to the image itself - The painting hanging in the background looks like the one in the ping-pong room in the midsection of the restaurant, but the ceiling height looks too low, also note the blue lampshades hanging, they only have about 10"-12" of cord.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Looking at the next image
                     <a href="https://www.flickr.com/pho">
                      https://www.flickr.com/pho
                     </a>
                     notice the rafter layout just above the drummer, it looks just like a skylight framework, which can be seen from the exterior of the google earth imagery.  And as I was looking at that picture in that flicker account I noticed this picture
                     <a href="https://www.flickr.com/pho">
                      https://www.flickr.com/pho
                     </a>
                     , note the lady in the right hand side of the picture (with the stripped pants) there is a crack in the wall behind her that runs all way up to the ceiling, how about that, that is what I was talking about in this post to begin with.  And that is why the underpinning thing is such a potential big deal, all of the subterranean work (if there is any) will show if you cut corners.  Remember they are working in fill dirt, another poster (somewhere in this mess) provided historical maps that literally a river used to run through it.
What we need is some as-built drawings, along with permits, and of course more images inside and out.

                      I'm still evaluating, I might be inclined to agree with you about the sky light BUT is that was the roof of an addition or something, then they would be insulation at least around the plumbing if nothing else. 
The large square hole was a later construction and not very well done. Compared to the 40-50 year old construction around it and the coloration of the floor boards. Then I just realize, what I thought was a stud wall behind them is only a stud wall from the joists down to the top of a concrete wall, like a basement.
The other basement photo I posted has HUGE heavy timber floors joist, likely from the original construction but not typically used as rafter in a vaulted roof and the first photo show the truss rafters actually used for the roof. Which has been used in construction for a very long time, though modern truss rafters are metal, older ones varied in design.
But the heavy 4x16 joists(estimating) are very common in old commercial buildings where there is a probability of extreme and sustained load such as store shelves loaded with products or forklift or other heavy equipment might tread.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I think we are looking at a lower room (the back room) with a mezzanine in one photo and a basement in the other.

                       Let's change topics for a bit and look at this from a different angle.  Look at all the pics available, many of them show a ceiling shot, or doorways, or just walls.  We have missed it so far. Fire Code. Not a single sprinkler head, fire extinguisher, pull station, emergency exit signage over doorways, emergency lighting , pull station or any of that.  Fire Marshal Bill would have a holiday in this place.  How could this possibly happen?

                    Ya, usually the only access would be a man hole or a steel door at one end as well as a vent, a blind man hole with no ladder or a chimney to the top of the building in case of a burst pipe. And my thoughts exactly, who would get a permit to try to use such tunnels. It wouldn't be granted to them I'm sure. As for municipal records, that would depend on policies on record keeping as well as history, if a records hall burns down, what records would there be?! Records cost a lot to keep too so if a records hall never burned down, they might have an expire on records or sort the records according to what is still being used and destroy the rest. While some places keep all records as a matter of preservation of historical value. The only way to know if there are records is to go to the city records department in that area and look it up. If we are lucky, they updated to microfilm and still have copies of all the construction and infrastructure.

                     Even for far less nefarious reasons, if I had a tunnel like that, I wouldn't seek a permit to turn it into a cold room or something.
