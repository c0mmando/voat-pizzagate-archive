              yep, Podestas were also friends with Freud and were staying at his place roughly around the time of McCann disappearance.

               This was rumoured - has it been proven? Of course the sketches of the abductees were identical to the Podestas. And all emails were deleted from Podestas account from the date of McCann’s disappearance..... also (((Freud))) was also a confirmed paedophile

                I believe it was confirmed that the Podestas stayed at Freuds. The sketches I believe were a bizarre coincidence, as they were two drawings of one potential suspect.
               </p>
               <p>
                I dont believe Podestas were there at the time, though it was within a few months from memory. To me, it all seems to be quite a web of pedos in that one hot zone within a short time.

                 It's been postulated that it's a bizarre coincidence, but what is more likely is that those e-fits were designed that way: they look identical to the Podesta brothers because they were made to. There is way too much CSI in those e-fits for them to have arisen by chance.

            This is from the article, “Haunted by the fact that he had let Jemima down, some 20 years before, Shane says he became “obsessed” with finding the truth - and tracking down the Dark Man. “I felt I needed to do something to make amends,” he says. “Jemima became a symbol, in my own head, of all of the mistakes that I've made in my child protection career and this became my chance of redemption, so it became all-consuming.”
           </p>
           <p>
            So what exactly are all these mistakes he made during his child protection career and why did he not do anything after being threatened until 20 years later. Now he is making money off these kids by the selling of this book. People in the comments are saying he has fabricated much of it to sell the book. Who knows. We do know for fact that kids in care homes have been victimized terribly all over the world. But it’s possible this so-called Dark Man figure is adding more intrigue into the book to sell it. If the threat happened those 20 years ago when he was working as a child protection worker why did he not do something then, it makes no sense. Obviously kids would have been in grave danger and he had proof. Is this just another shitty child protection worker not doing their job, most likely. Now he’s profiting from it.
