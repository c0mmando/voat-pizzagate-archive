<p>Comments were speculating these men were connected to powerful people, so I\'ve been paying attention. That\'s when I came across this article from a week ago:
<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/02/25/judge-judy-neighbor-jumps-to-his-death/">http://nypost.com/2017/02/25/judge-judy-neighbor-jumps-to-his-death/</a></p>
<p>I didn\'t think much at first because no site will list the name of this 59/yo man who jumped from the window:
<a href="http://nypost.com/2017/02/25/judge-judy-neighbor-jumps-to-his-death/">http://nypost.com/2017/02/25/judge-judy-neighbor-jumps-to-his-death/</a></p>
<p>But its also strange that it\'s been a week and they still won\'t list the name. It says the man jumped from the fourth floor of the Sutton Place building in NYC. Searching for &quot;Sutton Place&quot; and &quot;death&quot;, I found this:
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/details-emerge-men-charged-connection-joseph-comunales-murder/story?id=43633225">http://abcnews.go.com/US/details-emerge-men-charged-connection-joseph-comunales-murder/story?id=43633225</a></p>
<p>This young man Joseph Comunale went missing after attending a party at the Sutton Place, also taking place on the 4th floor. turns out he was murdered and his body chopped up in the bath tub and then the remains buried in new jersey. Bloody sheets were found close by in a dumpster, and with other evidence they connected this to James Rackover, who lives at Sutton Place with his wealthy father Jeffrey Rackover</p>
<p><a href="https://scallywagandvagabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-17-at-12.38.39-PM-3-1024x619.png">https://scallywagandvagabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Screen-Shot-2016-11-17-at-12.38.39-PM-3-1024x619.png</a></p>
<p>The plot thickens. Turns out James is not Jeffrey Rackover\'s son, he\'s his lover. Jeffrey met him in Florida at a spa, and says he liked him so much and felt like a father figure which is why he told friends he was his son for so long. well, his &quot;son&quot; James is in a lot of trouble, he has been tied to the murder and also has a criminal record in the past.</p>
<p>So, I\'m wondering if this rich and powerful jewelry seller (Jeffrey Rackover) is the guy who recently killed himself? Jeffrey\'s middle name is steven, so according to this he might just be 59 years old...

            Bankers deaths are most likely connected to BOLI's or that they knew info they shouldn't have. Here's an older article that outlines some of the theories.

            Is it suspicious that he jumped(?) from the 4th floor?  Don't people usually go up higher than that, if they're really wanting to off themselves?  (I don't know; never thought about this before.  Thanks again, Pizzagate... the

            Yes it's suspicious I can't link to it. Why is Judge Judy included in the headline? Does the NY Post do this often? Because Judge Judy HATES pedo's with a massive passion. She is such a hero. Is this an intimidation to her? She dindu nuffin.  10 or 15 years ago she went on a rant that she wants them all rounded up and dumped in the desert away from all humanity and they can live together there. It was classic. I'll never forget it.

            i just checked and you're right, the street is off. this might be a false lead. but I wasn't suggesting these 3 were "suicided", i remember the anon said we'd start seeing legitimate suicides of the wealthy in ny when the shit is about to hit the fan.

            (sure) chances are they've stumbled across something they shouldn't have, and are whacked. Cops paid off etc. Usually drugs wars, Hedge Fund secrets blah blah. I doubt, in these cases, pedo related.

              ok you do realize that there are like, 8 MILLION people that live in NYC, and another 20 MILLION in the metro area? it's one of the densest and largest metro areas on the planet. if you want to get technical, basically from boston to springfield ma to hartford to albany to nyc to philly to baltimore to DC is basically one HUGE metro area? statistically, random suicides here and there happen in an area that large. this has nothing to do with pizzagate.

               found the one on kevin bell suicide:

               for freeling all i can find is a connection to qatar:

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               all im saying is the last suicide I listed sounds similar to these two, all that happened in the past week. the guy must be mega wealthy if he lived at the sutton house. the point im trying to make is they won't release the name, and all we know is he lived at the sutton house and was 59 years old. and im saying it will be crazy if it's Rackover, because he lives there on the 4th floor and might be 59, and as you can see he has a very questionable past...

                  No, according to his ex-gf he started going on trips to NYC in 2013 returning loaded with $$$.

                  She says she's certain he isn't gay but would probably do almost anything for the right amount.

                 <p>
                  Not murder though. She's convinced he'd never do that.

                  What I find suspicious here is the speed if not haste with which Jeffrey Rackover has turned on his lover/son,  even if the latter is vehemently denying involvement.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Dirty smelly case. Does not seem pizza-related although Rackover is a Hillary fan even going so far as to openly donate proceeds from Ivanka Trump sales to Clinton...
