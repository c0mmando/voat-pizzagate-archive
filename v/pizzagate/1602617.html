            Looks like they only got caught because Jeffery Alan Harvey, 39, of West Wyoming and David R. Parker, 38, of Saylorsburg ratted Fenske out. 
This kid could still be in danger if it wasn't for a snitch. 
I'd also like to note that Bucks County PA has been a hot bed for this shit lately....

            This is one of the first results of all of our work. He was part of the Pajama Factory/kill room story. Researchers traced it back to PA. There is more to come. Cheer your selves on. Children are being rescued!

            The names of the other 4 arrested : Jeffery Alan Harvey and David R Parker in July 2016. Then Craig M Knox and roommate Stephen Mathew Taylor of Henrico Virginia in November 2016. Just want to throw these guys' names out here in case any of them are friends with alefantis! It's not like their ring was very well-known, considering it took 9 months to arrest the 5th guy!!!!!

            The was also a scandal in Old Forge involving the police chief and a fireman (sounds like the girl was passed around the po dept as well) back in 2012.

            I hate this. Seriously, folks. This world cannot go on for much longer.
            <em>
             Psalms 37:10,11
            </em>
            .
            <strong>
             10
            </strong>
            <em>
             Just a little while longer, and the wicked will be no more; You will look at where they were, And they will not be there.
            </em>
            <strong>
             11
            </strong>
            <em>
             But the meek will possess the earth, And they will find exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            These people will be destroyed and I can't wait. I don't even know what to say anymore to all of this. The truth is just too horrible.

            The pics reminded me of the Shakespeare play:  mid summers night dream. I also found that there are paganism origins to that play. I apologize if this is not relevant, but I would rather leave no stone unturned, especially since those animal masks were used.

            I cut and paste some text below from Wikipedia.
           </p>
           <p>
            The celebration of Midsummer's Eve (St. John's Eve among Christians) was from ancient times a festival of the summer solstice. Bonfires were lit to protect against evil spirits which were believed to roam freely when the sun was turning southward again. In later years, witches were also thought to be on their way to meetings with other powerful beings.
           </p>
           <p>
            The solstice itself has remained a special moment of the annual cycle of the year since Neolithic times.[6] The concentration of the observance is not on the day as we reckon it, commencing at midnight or at dawn, as it is customary for cultures following lunar calendars to place the beginning of the day on the previous eve at dusk at the moment when the Sun has set.[clarification needed] In Sweden, Finland, Latvia and Estonia, Midsummer's Eve is the greatest festival of the year, comparable only with Walpurgis Night, Christmas Eve, and New Year's Eve.

            I have been lurking for a while, but the pedo mentioned in this article Ken Fenske strikes me as someone who needs to be examined further. I just have no idea where to start with that. He seems to be the ringleader and from some info I found about him through a quick google search he seems like he's a weak link.

            Yes! Disgusting. That boy will be traumatized forever at the sight of animals and masks. He must have been a family member for this to go on for 7 years. Poor baby.

             As a kid I was scarred and terrorized simply by an uncle running around and chasing us with a clown mask on without any child rape added in.

            I just wanted to say that if parents, and especially mothers, were more responsible by warning their children at a very young age about possible situations and how to get out of them, many of them could be spared the abuse.
I'd like to share my own personal experience here as an example. As a young girl, I was particularly pretty and my mother, being as protective and as clever as she was (an tough!), had warned me many times over about the possible dangers lurking, not only about strangers in the streets and at schools, but to also beware of family members, especially male relatives. As I grew up surrounded by 14 uncles and 2 grandpas, I was over the years, accosted by at least 5 of them. I successfully put an early stop to the advances of 4 of them by simply telling them to back off with their disgusting ways. However, one in particular, had started grooming me without me even noticing (he was the worst threat of them all), by buying me what my parents wouldn't : soft drinks and candy, and by taking my little brother and I on rides, in the countryside. He had never directly made an advance up until two to three years later, when asking me uncomfortable questions about boys and how and if I felt the urge to 'do stuff' with them. I'll never forget how vulnerable a position I was in when he made his advance for we were alone, in a car, about 2 hours away from home, in the countryside on our way to my grandparents. I asked him to stop talking about this, that I didn't like it, but he wouldn't. He kept pressing on. And I remember how afraid I had become when he said: "I don't know if I can control myself, this is too tempting, you're too tempting". And then my mother's own words came back to me and I yelled them out with growing fear: "I will tell my mother! I will tell my father! And if you touch me, they will kill you! Think about what you're saying! I'm you're niece, this is wrong! I will tell them!" And then he stopped, told me to wait for him in the car while he went out into the woods to take a 'long piss'. When he came back, he said: "Ok, lets go" and that was that. We went to my grandparents and I told my mom as soon as I arrived there, secretly, over the phone. She promised me she wouldn't tell anyone, not even my dad and told me that I was a very smart and brave girl. Of course, she found an excuse to come and fetch me and that was the last time I was left alone with that particular uncle. 
When I recall this today, I can't help but admire her and be grateful for being so protective and helping me out by giving me a weapon against such advances. She had also warned me not to believe anyone that said they would hurt my family members because it was a total bluff. To always respond that I will tell. However, there was another way to get out of dangerous situations with strangers and, that one was to scream at the top of my lungs, to fight and bite and run away. 
Today, I have 4 children of my own, including 2 daughters. I have warned each and everyone of them and am making sure that they know how to protect and defend themselves, as my mother did more than 30 years ago. 
I hope to God they never have to face this kind of danger and if they do, that they will find the courage and strength and wits to get out of it unscathed. Again, I can't emphasise enough, how important the parents' role becomes in situations such as this.
I also hope I didn't offend any abuse victim, or anyone who wasn't as lucky as I was and who had to go through some terrible experience under different circumstances. My goal here is solely to put an emphasis on how important a role parents play in their children's lives as protectors and defenders, and that by warning them from an early age about such situations can have a very positive effect.

             Thank you for sharing this. I am also a parent and have started explaining to my oldest about how to stay safe and what to watch for and avoid. I was assaulted by a family member that was also a (older) child at the time so I think it is important to make children aware that other children can also hurt them.

              Yes. This is also a problem that needs to be discussed with them. The uncle that groomed me, I found out later, had abused one of my cousins, so his other niece. The age difference however was not quite as big, as he was 18 and she was 11-12. He abused her for 4 years and then, 10 years later, started grooming me when I was 7-8. Apparently, he's attracted to girls age 10 to 15. But anyway, it's quite important to make our children also aware of that possibility.

             Thank you for sharing that. The details you provided are so important for people to understand how this stuff happens.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was abused as an adult, but there were many near misses when I was a kid. My mom came from an abusive family and was terrible in many ways, but she did tell me what to do in sexually abusive situations, starting very young. She had a drug problem and I was often hit on by her drug friends and drug dealers. When I was somewhere around 6-8 she had a drug friend who used to tell me how pretty I was and always wanted me to sit on his lap. I have a vague memory of her getting serious about that and then he was not allowed over at the house anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
             When I was around 15, I used to walk around town so I didn't have to be at home. People frequently tried to get me to get into their cars. Sometimes men WITH women. There was no mistaking their intent. I am certain that if I got into one of those cars I would have been raped and killed. Once a man drove in front of my path in a red Corvette and asked me to get in. I told him I was 15. He said, "So?" I said no thanks and kept on walking. Sometimes I had to walk into the police department to get people off my trial, or dive into a bush. I'd watch the cars drive back and forth, looking for me.
            </p>
            <p>
             My mom's drug dealer used to pull up and fan out a wad of cash the size of a brick and ask me to go places with him. I had to be polite to him because he was my mom's drug dealer. He was going to "drive me home" once and pulled into an alley and tried to assault me. I yelled and he stopped. "Oh, you don't want me to?" He asked. "No!" I said. "Oh, okay." he said and drove me home. I told this story to local police years later and they were dumbfounded. They said this particular person "owned girls and boys" and it was amazing that he didn't rape me. I believe he let me go because he thought I was funny. My righteousness amused him.
            </p>
            <p>
             At this point my mom seemed to consider me an adult. Her reaction to these near misses was that I shouldn't have been walking around. You know, in the daylight next to the supermarket and the library.

             I blame the media for not informing the public of these dangers I too now realize that pedofiles tried to victimize my family. The pedofiles rely on our naïveté of children and even adults lack of knowledge. It is true evil and satanic.

             we've disagreed, but I want to applaud your story.  and yes, this kind of frankness is absolutely necessary and mothers need to stop pretending we live in the Victorian age and speak frankly and empower their children.
PS (also the phrase is "peer pressure" not "pier pressure")

             wow.  thank you so much for sharing that story.  it can be so difficult as a parent to bring up these issues with our children, but you have illustrated beautifully why it is so important that we do.

              Yes, it is very important that we do and I'd also like to point out not to fall under peer pressure coming from relatives and friends who will constantly accuse you of being over-protective and to 'let kids be kids'. Too many times they will 'inadvertently' make you feel self-conscious or guilty of 'crossing the line' which is total BS. Being a parent is a great responsibility which doesn't come with a 'handbook' or a guide so often times we decide what's best for our children according to our instincts, to what we think is right and how we were brought up ourselves. We shouldn't have to worry about political-correctness at all.

               The "you are too overprotective" shit is real. My spouse and I will never allow any children we have to go to sleepovers, either. No fucking way are we entrusting our child to a different family for the night. There were too many stories both of us heard from friends and experiences we had ourselves at "innocent sleepovers" to ever think it would be a good idea. Ever. And anyone who thinks we are helicopter parents can eat shit. All it takes is one bad decision and our kids could lose their innocence permanently, so we couldn't care less what "society customs" say. We can't be there every second, but we sure as hell can make protective decisions.

            Probably just a 'limited hangout' by the CIA to try and satisfy some people and get them to stop investigating.  "Hey, we got em you guys, you can go back to normal life now, nothing to see here."    Plus this stinks of being fake.  It just so happens to be in "bucks" county, like "bucks" fishing and camping, like a boy-lover "buck".  They are probably just going to jail some of the clients, some of the johns, and leave the actual trafficking ring intact.

            Yes, I am!   I just read about a pedo ring that had sex with a boy while dressed like animals.  How sick does it get?  How high is a mountain?  We know that the black around the eye of the panda is indicative of the dark eyes that abused children get from too little sleep and bags as well and very little light of day.  We must never stop. Never will I rest until they are exposed for the sick vile criminals they are.

              Ugh.  This is disgusting stuff.  I hardly know how I can read it sometimes.  This is how they have been operating for this long.  They know that most people shut their minds and eyes because it is too heinous to delve into.  Not anymore.  Eyes Wide Open!  BTW where is the Shill List?  I can no longer find it on the Side Bar?  I have had one bothering me for weeks.

             What!? I didn't know y'all had figured out the meaning behind pedos having a thing for pandas - the pandas in the music videos, the giant stuffed panda in front of a shipping type of port warehouse - I think was a post from the pajama factory brother
            </p>
            <p>
             Then there was the bowl full of panda keychains I think

            <p>
             Is that really why they like pandas?

              It seems that they all have circles under their eyes and bags as well.  It is so thoroughly disgusting.  I really believe they don't care if we know or not.  The are brazenly showing off their prized abused victims.  I am so over them and their pushy and trying to normalizing attitudes.  They have used words that will no longer be the same to me.  Pizza, cheese, hot dog, panda etc.  They are just beyond disgusting. :(

               Satanic people always find the innocent and abuse it.  Even if it's just words in a language.  What a bummer.  The least we can do is is expose James Alefantis until he gives up and turns in his crew/operation or is vanished by TPTB.

            Unfortunately, I believe this goes MUCH higher and the recent rash of busting these rings are to appease the public to give the impression that authorities are addressing these issues.  It's reasonable to believe that it's the pedos who aren't in power who are being used as scapegoats to take the fall and take the heat off of the elite.   The Franklin Scandal went as high as the White House and numerous govt. agencies were involved in sweeping it under the rug just as they did in the Sanduski case, the Finders case and as they've done for decades in the UK with Saville.  We'll probably be seeing more of these small busts but don't be fooled by this researchers, these recent arrests of a pedo  here and a few pedos there  is miniscule compared to what is actually transpiring.

             Here's one of the 3 emails with a Ken Fenske - some are secret and classified.  All I can decipher is something about a plane crash in Kuwait.  It seems the 3 emails are using code maybe?

            This is as  disgusting as it gets.  This sick idiots think they have a right to our kids.  They have brainwashed themselves into believing that they are wanted by these children.  I am also sick of seeing this written up as simply using the word abuse.  They need to write it out.  Can you imagine what it must be like for the penis of a 57 yr. old man  to be inserted into a young boy?  We are sugar coating this for the reader and for the pedophile. When we speak honestly and openly about these heinous acts only then will people realize what these children endure. And only then will their be a public outcry for it to stop.

              Go to the post PSYCHIATRIST'S OPINION ON KIDS' SEXUAL FEELINGS.  I just got about the umpteenth shill reply trying to convince me that children really want the sex from the adults and that it is my job as an adult to realize this.  This is what they are up to and doing.  Read the post please.  I am ready to report this shill.  I have been pressured for a couple of weeks and fighting his every response.

                Yes, I believe that Sandusky and Hastert were part of a large pedo ring.  I wonder if Joe Paterno was suicided?  All of a sudden case of cancer. They have all been having their fun with our nation's most vulnerable.  There day will come.

            BUCKS COUNTY (CBS) — Authorities in Bucks County make an arrest in a fetish-themed child predator sex ring they say was going on for the better part of a decade.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said for the last seven years at least four men sexually abused a young boy at sex parties where the men would dress up like different animals.
           </p>
           <p>
            “This child victim was repeatedly abused by a group of criminals who cared only about their gratification, they cared nothing about this young boy,” he said. “This is a horrendous case.”
           </p>
           <p>
            On Friday police in Bucks County arrested 57-year-old Kenneth Fenske of Quakertown for taking part in the sexual abuse ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fenske was charged with multiple counts of child rape, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse and unlawful contact with a minor, all of which are first degree felonies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shapiro said they will prosecute all the suspects involved to the fullest extent of the law.
           </p>
           <p>
            “It is deeply disturbing to me, not just as your attorney general, but as a father of four young children, these predators absolutely sicken me.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Shapiro adds that this is an ongoing investigation and they believe this child abuse sex ring involves more victims and more predators, and anyone with any information should come forward.

             Attorneys generals don't make cases by themselves.  They work with what law enforcement brings them.  People on this board want to pretend that there is a massive law enforcement conspiracy to cover up these crimes rather than acknowledge that different cases are different in terms of what the evidence supports.

             I know it is so so sickening; after 47 + years of suffering I finally revealed to my family a week ago I had suffered abuse at the hands of an uncle who had forced me to keep silent by threatening to do the same to my baby sister whom I loved more than anything and who was only three at the time if I ever told anyone. I know first hand the life long consequences of sexual abuse and if I can save one child that trauma I will go to my grave with a sense of redemption. This shit must stop.

              So sorry that happened to you :(
So sorry this is happening to so many children :(

              We won't stop until something is done!  Something BIG.

              I am glad they caught this ring and rescued this child. and it sounds like they may be rescuing more soon, but I hope they aren't busting these smaller rings just to try to passify us.  I hope they realize that we want small rings busted as well as "elite" rings

              Just want to say I'm sorry, even though that's worth nothing at all. I have three beautiful children who I've stood vigilently over to keep such things from happening to them. I was never raped, but harassed, exposed to, and un welcometouched around twelve. I will murder anyone who presumes to even look at my children wrong. All these fuckers deserve to roast slowly over a fire.

                I think there are some but they're not obvious as we tend to keep fairly quiet. I feel like so many parents are worried about all the wrong things~ obsessive over things that wont ever hurt a child in the long run. But completely unaware of these types of things. Do you follow pizzagate? There was this one guy we found through the cpp connection, who was taking pictures of girl's hair and masturbating to them later. There was this one picture that he took where the mom looked like she was about to murder the guy, and he posted it and said, "That's right mom, I'm gonna jack off to your little girl's hair later and there's nothing you can do about it." God help me, if someone ever takes a picture of my kids that looks like a creep. I wont be allowing them to leave with the camera/phone/whatever. That woman should have smacked his phone out of his hand and demanded whoever was around to help her delete whatever was on it. I've also stopped posting pictures of my kids on social media even though my profile is private.
Sigh.

               Thanks, and yes it is not something any child should ever be subjected to, it robs you of your innocence and wide eyed wonderment toward the world that you were busy discovering and exploring and puts your whole existence into question.

                You are a brave soul. I cant wait till we at least see some of them fry for it. Its scary that this stuff just continues on.

              Wow, a week ago. I can't imagine what that was like, and it is far far too common. It is much more common than people realize. I read Mackenzie Phillips' book, man her dad was a whack job.

               It's not been easy man and I thank all of you who are offering your support  \(-_-)//. My now 49 year old little sister and I cried for an hour together when I revealed what had happened to me when I was 8-9 yrs old. She kept saying "Now I know why you kept telling me throughout our lives that you love me more than I would ever know". The anger, fury, despair, humiliation, fear, hopelessness, lack of confidence, alienation, self-doubt, self loathing, depression, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, sexual identification ambiguity, anxiety, fear of intimacy, resultant promiscuity, and not reaching one's full life potential are all very, very real consequences that I struggled with. Thankfully since disclosing my background anxiety level has decreased and consequently, my blood pressure has dropped a bit. I trust that my deepening sense of Spirituality as I get closer to the end of my earthly journey has led to being more forgiving, more compassionate, having more empathy for others and realizing that life is not a destination but a journey, and I want to go out with a peaceful conscience. I'm most at home and grounded when in the great outdoors where I marvel and praise Source for the beauty that still exists, regardless of the Evil that still lurks everywhere in civilization. Thank you for reading this if you made it all the way here..
