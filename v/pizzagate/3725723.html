              The entire town is also designated as a shrine of the United Methodist Church.

             On 23 December 1839, the state legislature incorporated the city of Oxford,[8] named after the alma mater of the founders of the Methodist movement, Charles and John Wesley, the University of Oxford... On 17 September 1838, two years after the college's chartering, President Ignatius Few and three faculty members welcomed fifteen freshmen and sophomores into its inaugural class

             In 1885, the Grand Masonic Lodge of Georgia erected a white marble obelisk in memory of Few in the center of the quad. Directly south of the monument is Seney Hall, a five-story Victorian Gothic-style building topped by a clock tower and bell.[19] At the end of every academic year, the bell is rung once in honor of each graduating student.

              CDC official accused of child molestation, bestiality
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Dr. Kimberly Quinlan Lindsey has been with the Centers for Disease Control for 12 years. An official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been arrested and charged with two counts of child molestation and one count of bestiality, police said.
             </p>
             <p>
              Police arrested Dr. Kimberly Quinlan Lindsey, 44, in DeKalb County, Georgia, on Sunday. Authorities also charged Lindsey's live-in boyfriend, Thomas Joseph Westerman, 42, with two counts of child molestation. The two are accused of "immoral and indecent" sexual acts involving a 6-year-old, according to information from DeKalb County Magistrate Court and an arrest warrant.
             </p>
             <p>
              The bestiality charge says Lindsey "did unlawfully perform or submit to any sexual act with an animal." The alleged incidents took place between January 1, 2010, and August 22, 2011. Westerman is out of jail on bail; Lindsey remains in jail with bail set at $20,000, said Lt. Pam Kunz of the DeKalb County Police Department.
             </p>
             <p>
              Prior to her current role, Lindsey was the senior health scientist in the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. That office
              <strong>
               oversees the allocation process for $1.5 billion in terrorism preparedness
              </strong>
              .
              <strong>
               In her 12 years at the CDC
              </strong>
              , Lindsey has received 12 awards for outstanding performance on projects and programs, according to her bio on
              <strong>
               Emory University's Biological and Biomedical Sciences website
              </strong>
              . Lindsey earned her doctorate in immunology and molecular pathogenesis from the university in 1998, a year before she began work at the CDC.

             The purpose of Part I of this book is to document how this reputation was

             Department of Defense (DOD) admits that this ancient wizard's mechanism for
            </p>
            <p>
             control is so dangerous that most information pertaining to it must remain
            </p>
            <p>
             Classified as TOP SECRET. As tbe employee of a DOD subcontractor with
            </p>
            <p>
             exposure to mind-control research, I was required to sign an oath of secrecy.

            <p>
             To this day I am restricted by law from revealing certain specific information
            </p>
            <p>
             that directly pertained to my employment as, among other "sensitive"

            <p>
             exposures, a U.S. DOD subcontractor in mind-control research.

            </p>
            <p>
             by accredited mental health physicians for what it is, absolute mind control.
            </p>
            <p>
             My first encounter with mind-control research began in the late 1960s in
            </p>
            <p>
             Atlanta, Georgia on the Emory University campus at the Yerkes Primate
            </p>
            <p>
             Center, It was there that I learned about primate behavior modification-the
            </p>
            <p>
             basis for human mind control. Part I of this book is my attempt to impart an
            </p>
            <p>
             understanding of how this and other exposures would prepare me for the
            </p>
            <p>
             Challenge of a lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>
             What I witnessed, in terms of technology, at the Yerkes Primate Center and
            </p>
            <p>
             Other government sponsored research facilities, combined with years of personal
            </p>
            <p>
             research into this science of mind manipulation, did not adequately prepare me
            </p>
            <p>
             for what I would be exposed to in 1988 through an unexpected chain of events.
            </p>
            <p>
             This exposure came in the form of personal acquaintance with the human results
            </p>
            <p>
             officially entitled by DOD as, among other cryptic file titles, MK-Ultra.1

            </p>
            <p>
             investigation of her claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was able to liberate MK-Ultra victims, Cathy O'Brien and her daughter,
            </p>
            <p>
             Kelly, from the invisible grip of this U.S. Government secret weapon of
            </p>
            <p>
             control. In the process, I also helped Cathy recover her mental and physical
            </p>
            <p>
             health. However, I have not been successful in enlisting the cooperation of my
            </p>
            <p>
             government to pursue the justice issue. There is a reason for this failure to

             obtain justice that you, the reader, NEED TO KNOW. I have been told

             innate, voluntary will for perpetuating criminal activity by many so-called

            <p>
             leaders within the U.S. Government. These "treasonous leaders" did volunteer

            <p>
             for political "service" to our country. They must be held accountable for their

             Together, Cathy and I have dedicated our lives to the pursuit of justice and

             rehabilitation for her and Kelly. All avenues for justice and rehabilitative relief

             whose security? Cathy O'Brien provides the logical answer. Perhaps after

            </p>
            <p>
             we can make a positive difference for Cathy and Kelly, our government, and
            </p>
            <p>
             humanity, by having our voices heard. In my opinion, our great United Stales

             Constitution does not need to be amended it needs to be enforced.
            </p>
            <p>
             The grim reality we must all embrace is that there is, in human terms, no
            </p>
            <p>
             justice, and no revenge adequate to equal what these two, and many other
            </p>
            <p>
             victims of this U.S. Government secret weapon experienced. The only
            </p>
            <p>
             remaining remnant of opportunity for justice for these survivors would be
            </p>
            <p>
             derived from a public forum expose of what they experienced. What these
            </p>
            <p>
             survivors need to witness is the mass dissemination of their story and a radical,
            </p>
            <p>
             positive change in their government's management of secrets. This would be an
            </p>
            <p>
             acceptable, though belated, substitute for justice. Their hope lies in the belief
            </p>
            <p>
             that-
            </p>
            <p>
             "Truth lives a wretched life,
            </p>
