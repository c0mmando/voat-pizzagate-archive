<p>What\'s got old man McCain so upset lately?  Well maybe because like the Clintons and their dirty Foundation, his day of reckoning (Inaugeration Day January 20th)  is drawing near. He seems to have been chairman of his own NGO, the  International Republican Institute (IRI) that did work in Haiti among other places.</p>
<p>From a 2008 <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/89431/a_hidden_agenda%3A_john_mccain_and_the_international_republican_institute">news article</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presidential hopeful John McCain is hiding a skeleton in his closet. Not your typical political scandal, Senator McCain\'s dirty little secret is his longtime involvement with the International Republican Institute (IRI), an organization that operates in 60 countries and is budgeted by millions of US taxpayer dollars each year. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The piece continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such donors to the IRI include UPS, AT&amp;T, Anheuser-Busch, Bell-South, Lockheed Martin, Blackwater, Chevron, ExxonMobil and BP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The year following Aristide\'s overthrow--notably by IRI-supported opposition groups--was one of the most politically tumultuous times in recent Haitian history. Violence and corruption were at a high, with <strong>FREQUENT KIDNAPPINGS</strong> [emhpasis mine] and a crooked police force crippling the justice system and Haitian society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The IRI is described as engagning in <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/International_Republican_Institute">&quot;activities previously performed by the CIA.[2] IRI is mainly funded by U.S. State Department&quot;</a> </p>

            Can you repost this as its own thread, I think its important but will get lost in the comments. Or re-comment at the top, at least. Lets start a go fund me page to send McCain back to North Vietnam so that they can beat the shit out of him, and finish the job?

            Emily Pitha, a staff member of McCain's fundraising campaign, was arrested in April for operating a meth lab in her home. Investigators also found MDMA, LSD, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, about $7,000 in loose currency, counterfeit money, a marijuana-growing room, and bomb-making materials. Two children, aged 5 and 10, were in the home, and had easy access to the drugs and bomb-making materials. This article from thefreethoughtproject.com also mentions that Cindy McCain stole drugs from a charity she directed and used them while mothering four young children.

              A few more details on Pitha:
             </p>
             <p>
              She was a preschool teacher’s assistant from 2003 to 2006. In 2006, she became an administrative assistant to U.S. Senator John Kyl. From January 2013 to March 2013, she worked for U.S. Senator Jeff Flake. She began working for LovasCo, a political consulting company owned by Corrine Lovas, in October 2013, and her name was listed as a contact for fundraisers for McCain and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey.

              The ecstasy pills that Pitha's boyfriend, Chris Hustrulid, received from the Netherlands were purple, pentagon-shaped tablets scored with a ram's head.

            Another interesting thing to note was the human trafficking ring in Ahwatukee neighborhood in Phoenix, AZ on 11/1/16. It was reported as US Postal Investigation that &gt;12 children were staying at home &amp; had set up sting operation at home acrosss street. It was reported locally, then MSM &amp; local officials began back pedaling quickly &amp; stated that DOJ was taking over...no arrests have been made &amp; no further updates.

             Interesting.  Are you suggesting that that is connected to McStain?  Because Phoenix is a BIG city, and that's not his neighborhood.

            McCain became a prisoner of war and recorded propaganda for North Vietnam, hence his nickname 'Songbird'. Well he was injured and reports say tortured.
           </p>
           <p>
            Much, much worse however: "John McCain, who has risen to political prominence on his image as a Vietnam POW war hero, has, inexplicably, worked very hard to hide from the public stunning information about American prisoners in Vietnam who, unlike him, didn’t return home. Throughout his Senate career, McCain has quietly sponsored and pushed into federal law a set of prohibitions that keep the most revealing information about these men buried as classified documents. Thus the war hero who people would logically imagine as a determined crusader for the interests of POWs and their families became instead the strange champion of hiding the evidence and closing the books."
           </p>
           <p>
            The story is North Vietnam held back some POWs expecting huge reparations from the U.S. When those reparations never happened the POWs were forgotten.

            This is worth looking into.  John McCain's wife, Cindy McCain is co-chair of the Arizona Governor’s Council on human trafficking and on The McCain Institute’s Human Trafficking Advisory Council.  There was recently an incident in Phoenix Arizona on Nov
 1 that was reported as a human trafficking bust by local media.  Local media were then told by an embarrassed Virginia DOJ to shut up about any mention of human trafficking.  One month later I read that Phoenix Police might be reassigning all police on the vice squad, including those covering human trafficking.  Is this all related?  I not sure--I'm still researching it, but I can tell something isn't right.
           </p>

            Also, the McCain's have a daughter they got from an orphanage in Bangladesh.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the article on possible reassigning of vice squad members:

            Imo, McCain is a puppet for Kissinger and the Anglo-American establishment.  Look at the name of the person who was the middle man, Sir Andrew Wood.  He reminds me of the type of people in Lord Milners group and the Clivenden Set in the early 1900s that work to maintain the status quo.  They started WW1 and WW2 to destabilize Germany and Russia and have heard theories they are behind the mass migrations from Asia and Africa that is mainly aimed at Germany.

             This is why the Sanders contingent and other Dems who disliked Hillary must support Trump.  He may not be the greatest guy ever, and he certainly has his flaws, but he is the only thing standing between us and a war with Russia that all the neo-cons/neo-libs want so badly.
            </p>
            <p>
             The narrative during the election is that Trump is a hot head that would get us into WWIII.  My opinion is that if that's what the MSM/CIA is telling you, then you should assume the exact opposite to be true.  He in fact, is likely the ONLY thing that can prevent a war with Russia.
            </p>
            <p>
             Any time Obama, Bush/Cheney, McCain and the Clintons agree on something, you KNOW it's bad.

              You're getting close. Sanders and Trump are better than Clinton and the Bushes.

              ...but they're all compromised in significant ways. The system is horrifically corrupt, and can't be fixed just by voting the bums out. The intelligence communities run a deep state that would never allow it.

                 It's become more and more obvious there is an internal war going on within the deep state. The majority of people within these institutions are good guys. Just like in life, there are groups within the group that are the criminals. The amount of leaking that's gone on throughout the election is a huge dog whistle. It's become obvious that the white hats are feeling more comfortable getting info out. It will be interesting to see what wikileaks drops. 
I'd recommend watching this video of former CIA officer Kevin Shipp. It explains why people don't whistleblow or leak and will help connect for you why it's a much bigger deal that there has clearly been info leaked by the "good guys".

            McCain's story has never passed the smell test for me and I've long suspected he and Lindsey Graham has some serious skeletons in their closet.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that McCain (Graham too) continually beat the drum for war against Russia, almost to the point where he/they seem blood thirsty.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's so fanatical about going to war (Syria, Iraq, Russia, etc) that he must be doing the bidding for someone else.
           </p>
           <p>
            Normally I would think someone like McCain who has (allegedly) seen the horrors of war, would not be so quick to use military force at every turn.

             Why would a person who has been through war and being confined in a POW camp be pushing for war with Russia. Makes no sense. And to be honest most people who have heard his story would think he is on the right side of right!

             The skeletons are well-speculated on in this article..Paul Ryan, John McCain, and Lindsay Graham...Clinton Foundation money.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              This email was dated days before Speaker of the House Paul Ryan withdrew the invitation to Donald Trump to speak at an event in Wisconsin. Even though we do not have the ‘smoking gun’ to say it was him, no other logical conclusion can be assumed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Other emails hint at the money being moved to Republican elected officials in the House and Senate. For instance FEC reports shows that two large donations from PACS and private sources ln early October went to John McCain right after he attacked Trump publicly criticized Trump. That happened shortly after a slew of emails concerning moving money to support one candidate and move support from another.
             </p>
             <p>
              Shortly thereafter, his challenger in this tight race, Kirkpatrick, lost several key donors and money and support lessened from the DNC and the DSCC in the last few weeks of the race. The thing to note is that McCain is one of the lead sponsors of a committee to investigate any Russian influence into the election.
             </p>
             <p>
              Senator Lindsay Graham, another outspoken critic of Donald Trump and briefly candidate for President from July to December also it seems received help from the Clintons. An email that simply states, “Cleared the road for him in 2020,” could mean that there will be no strong or supported Democrat in the South Carolina Senate race when Graham is up for re-election.
             </p>
             <p>
              As with McCain, Graham has publicly called for a look into the Russian influence in the election.

             </code>
             . 
My theory is that whether or not he has direct PG involvement,   it's clear that  the PG community discovers money links to arms, oil, children, drugs which further tie into  the never ending  wars and the global  bedfellow associations.   These money makers (children being one of them)  are all part of the larger whole.
            </p>
            <p>
             When  fleshed out details aren't   being deleted from this forum the links usually end up heading to these areas.   It's like pulling a stray thread in a sweater and unraveling the whole thing - all connected as one.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's long been a speculative theory that McCain and a few others were in charge of developing ISIS war in Syria after the Al Qaida  war had run into a brick wall.  [damned conspiracy theorists just wouldn't believe AlQuaida or let it go. lol.]   If these ties are continued to be investigated via  pizzagate leads, then  PGate would be the weak link to their ongoing legacy of lies and corruption.  It doesn't mean that  McCain has a direct tie in PGate but it could expose the deeper connections.   That's why the Saudi threads here are a real threat to these tie connections.

              If the evidence is clear and compelling and presented to the public, I think Americans would want justice for Haiti, especially if Obama springs some kind of preemptive pardon.

             The extradition of Gus Phillipe is a good sign. We need 200 citizen journalists in Haiti doing live feed interviews of people and families who've been exploited and kidnapped/enslaved.

                 Lots of bad dudes down there. My hopeful thoughts are he's now been arrested, not bc of the senate issue, but bc he no longer falls under the protection of CGI. Which could signal them shutting down in Haiti.

                  There is a current thread saying that CGI is shutting down, the loss of corruption funding will shake things up, hopefully for the better.

             It is hard for Haiti to get on their feet when they have the UN and US (Dyncorp) taking over.  Check out this and many other articles.

              I saw a man suspected pickpocket, in the Iron Market in Port Au Prince, grabbed by dozens of women, biting him, scratching him, drawing blood, dragging him down screaming. What would they do to the Bushes and Clintons?

              Can we all visualize the Clintons sentenced to life in a Haitian prison? Please!  I don't believe in Satanism, but lets give a shot to the power of manifesting the collective will through visualization. McCain too, and all the other fuck rats.

               soros and the one world order globalists will convince Haitians to topple their government.  Then their economy will fail then the US and others will start "charitable organizations" and steal all the money and they'll make "save the children" places and well you know the rest.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's what happened in Romania, Albania, Libya, Iraq, Haiti and now Syria.  I'm surprised they aren't more obviously present in Venezuela. Next up is Cuba.
              </p>
              <p>
               When they don't think they can can convince a people to topple their own government, they just send in refugees or illegal aliens to tank the economy for them.  They truly are trying to take over the world.
