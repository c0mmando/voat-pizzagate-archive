<p>Gristina was arrested in February to much fanfare, with prosecutors claiming she ran the big-bucks hooker ring out of an Upper East Side apartment.</p>
<p>They claimed that a five-year probe by the DA’s public corruption unit turned up hundreds of hours of wiretaps and that the well-connected Gristina laundered millions of dollars while boasting of her ties to top officials and law enforcement. They said she also had minors involved in her operation.</p>

<p>As many people might recall, there was reports in the media a few years back about Charlie Sheen and his wife allegedly having used New York City prostitutes. Sheen allegedly refused to use condoms despite his HIV+ status and wanted prostitutes who were &quot;pre-op transsexuals.&quot; The madam who provided the prostitutes to Sheen was Gristina. </p>
