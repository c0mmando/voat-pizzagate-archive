<p>So let\'s begin.</p>
<p>Think of all the major cities circuses visit. Think of all the tractor trailers involved. Think of the major interstates that intersect the cities they stop off in for the weekend. </p>
<p><em>The circus owners aimed their severe (and regular) beatings at the childrens’ hips and buttocks, so that the bruises couldn’t be seen by circus-goers. By the age of 14, Saraswati – the star of the circus – had been married off to the circus owner’s son; within 12 months, she had given birth to twin sons. Two years later, aged 17, she gave birth to a third son. By 20, she was a widow.</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/15/circus-kathmandu-child-trafficking-survivors-unimagined-heights-nepal-india">https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/15/circus-kathmandu-child-trafficking-survivors-unimagined-heights-nepal-india</a></p>
<p><em>A local NGO on child-rights had complained to the police about the rape of a minor girl. During the second raid on Saturday, the police also rescued 14 minor boys and girls and four major persons, mostly from north East and some from Bangladesh. The circus owner has been charged for trafficking minor children as well as others and exploiting them in different manners in the name of circus, Superintendent of Police Karthik Kashyap of Crime Branch told The Hindu on Saturday.</em> <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/circus-owner-arrested-on-rape-child-trafficking-charges-in-goa/article5740120.ece">http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/circus-owner-arrested-on-rape-child-trafficking-charges-in-goa/article5740120.ece</a></p>
<p><em>Once in the circuses, these children often live in squalor and are never allowed to leave the circus compound. They are routinely beaten in order to teach them the difficult and dangerous tricks, and sexual abuse is commonplace.</em> <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2011/09/201196121411147219.html">https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2011/09/201196121411147219.html</a></p>
<p><em>She was sexually abused and was not allowed to leave the close confines of the circus premises for 10 yrs and when her father came to take her back home, he was beaten and thrown out of the circus and was told that he cannot take back his child for 7 yrs, as he has signed a contract.

<p>While not sex trafficking related, Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus has history of abducting children for the circus. <em>They were easy pickings for a traveling circus. The brothers were African-American albinos with watery blue eyes and blond hair, and their vision was poor, the result of an oscillating eye condition routinely misinterpreted as a mental deficiency.</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/10/16/truevine-albino-african-american-brothers-circus-performers/">https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/10/16/truevine-albino-african-american-brothers-circus-performers/</a></p>
<p>The Freemasons are historically attached to the circus. <em>August Ringling and his sons - The 7 Ringling Brothers &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; From 10,000 Famous Freemasons</em> <a href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/circus_masonic_fdcs.htm">http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/masonicmuseum/circus_masonic_fdcs.htm</a></p>
<p>And it continues today with the Shriner\'s circuses, and the proceeds do not go to their children\'s hospitals, but their frat parties, er, I mean temple gathering refreshments and games. *Unable to copy pasta, please see this article about where the proceeds from the Shrine Circus actually go to: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/19/us/19shrine.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/19/us/19shrine.html</a></p>
<p>Not only do the Shriners have a special interest in children, their circuses give them special access to children with disabilities who may not be able to communicate nor understand what abuse and molestation is. <em>Ultimate Medical Academy (UMA) announced its sponsorship of the Egypt Shrine Circus which ran April 18 through April 21 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. UMA was a “Ringmaster Gold Level” sponsor for this event. UMA’s sponsorship meant that 44 local special needs children were able to attend the circus at no cost.  This included transportation to the event and chaperones to escort and provide necessary assistance. Many of these 44 children were given their first opportunity to attend an event like this because of UMA’s sponsorship. “Who doesn’t like the circus,” said Linda Weldon, SVP of Academics and Community Relations. “All children should have this experience and UMA was happy to help make it possible for these children.”</em> <a href="https://www.ultimatemedical.edu/newsroom/ultimate-medical-academy-sponsors-egypt-shrine-circus-support-local-special-needs-children/">https://www.ultimatemedical.edu/newsroom/ultimate-medical-academy-sponsors-egypt-shrine-circus-support-local-special-needs-children/</a></p>
<p>Notice the dates of the sponsorship. <em>April 19-May 1 – Blood sacrifice to the Beast.  Fire sacrifice required on April 19.</em> <a href="https://youthtruthusa.com/satans-calendar/">https://youthtruthusa.com/satans-calendar/</a> </p>
<p>While they may not be using these children for sacrifices, displaying such activities in front of these children would be very traumatizing to the children and fun for the sickos. </p>
<p>Now that the history of the circus and what they\'re capable of has been established, let\'s examine related crimes.</p>
<p><em>FOUR people charged with the alleged rape and torture of three boys at a New South Wales circus school claim “we didn’t do it” and have vowed to fight the charges.</em></p>
<p><em>Three women and a man will face 69 charges relating to the alleged ongoing abuse of the boys, who were all under eight years old and connected to the school, between 2014 and 2016.</em></p>
<p><em>Police will allege the abuse by some members of the group included “rituals”, The Daily Telegraph reports.</em></p>
<p><em>The circus training school offers all ages classes in juggling, aerial skills, acrobatics and unicycle riding and describes itself online as “a family friendly environment”.</em> <a href="http://www.news.com.au/national/crime/seven-charged-with-127-offences-on-three-young-boys-which-involved-blood-rituals/news-story/ba7f492c0db4f34bd71932587033bc16">http://www.news.com.au/national/crime/seven-charged-with-127-offences-on-three-young-boys-which-involved-blood-rituals/news-story/ba7f492c0db4f34bd71932587033bc16</a></p>
<p>Gee, a family friendly environment. Where have we heard that before? <em>cough</em> Alefantis</p>
<p>Other circuses have been charged with sexual abuse of minors and activities that scream Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA):</p>
<p><em>Seven members of the Arcade Circus in Western Australia face a total of 127 charges, including kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault of a child and making child pornography.</em></p>
<p><em>The prosecution also alleges the close-knit family took part in sadistic sex acts including a &quot;blood ritual&quot; during one child abuse session.</em> <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/arcade-circus-child-abuse-ring-127-charges-against-burlesque-star-her-family-1659905">https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/arcade-circus-child-abuse-ring-127-charges-against-burlesque-star-her-family-1659905</a></p>
<p>And here we have gender blurring in addition to child pornography: </p>
<p><em>Grandma the Clown, long a mainstay performer at the Big Apple Circus, has stepped down after an acrobat said he pressured her into taking pornographic photos when she was 16, according to a report.</em> <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/01/23/famed-big-apple-circus-clown-accused-of-coercing-teen-into-taking-sexual-photos/">https://nypost.com/2018/01/23/famed-big-apple-circus-clown-accused-of-coercing-teen-into-taking-sexual-photos/</a></p>
<p>Although I haven\'t found any evidence of such, it would help if someone could find out if children go missing in higher numbers when the circus is in town. </p>
<p>(This is Pizzagate related because it involves kidnapping, trafficking, sexual abuse of children, and SRA, including high level masonic organizations that have members in important political positions.)</p>',

           Although I haven't found any evidence of such, it would help if someone could find out if children go missing in higher numbers when the circus is in town.

              Worst part of this is my wife used to work at a restaurant that all the old town crowd goes to in Baraboo, WI. One of the Ringling family, as an old man was purposely left with a kid so the mom could sue if anything happened. She knew the history and set her own kid up to get paid. (It did and she did indeed get paid.) But the rumors in the area are all the Ringling's fly that way. Small town charm.

            been downgraded to basic network TV recently - late at night they run these "LOVESHRINERS.ORG" commercials over and over again, they are a huge bummer to say the least...
           </p>
           <p>
            ignoring the creepiness of the term "Love Shriners," I've noticed the kids they choose to feature in these commercials seem to be exceptionally sick often with very prominent physical deformities - seems more "graphic" (I am sorry to have to use that word) than the type of kids a typical charity would cast for their TV spots .. they just give me a bad vibe

             Good observation and I've never seen those commercials before. The fact that only disabled kids are shown is not a surprise. After all, this is the Shriners' claim to fame as they constantly promote that they help these children. Sadly and strangely, not one cent of their circus proceeds helps children. How nice of the Shriners to do something to entertain children when all of the attending families' money goes to the Shriners' lodge/temple/frat entertainment such as their liquor cabinet. What a fucking joke!

             also notable, the abundance of pedobear symbolism used in the commercials - one ad I noticed contained a teddy bear either physically or sewn into a blanket in every single shot featuring one of these children

            I did a search for carnival workers charged with molestation and rape, and here's a fairly recent article. It's a very sad story, and it's interesting that the article mentions nothing about him being a carnival worker except in the title. He abducted the boy from a bowling alley, and at least the boy is still alive. I pray he's healing.

             Jerry Lewis was not a nobody...In my opinion, he was genuinely one of the most feared/powerful men in show business...(if not the Joker himself....and I'm dead serious...)

             This "clown" shit is no joke....and the fact that no one has jumped all over your exquisite post reveals to me how little the folks around here now OR care about what's REALLY going on...

              Great information, and I've always wondered about Lewis myself. That photo of him pulling on Spielberg's beard is strange. Everyone looks so serious. I can hear Heath Leger's Joker now saying, "Why so sserioussss?"
             </p>
             <p>
              It's also bizarre that this movie is referenced in so many others, including 'Cannibal Holocaust', Scooby Doo, The Shining, and others

             </p>
             <p>
              'Cannibal Holocaust' is deemed as one of the top ten most disturbing films
              <a href="http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/08/the-50-most-disturbing-movies/cannibal-holocaust">

             </p>
             <p>
              Spielberg also included the clown lamp and doll in 'Poltergeist'
             </p>
             <p>
              <em>
               During the scene where Robbie (Oliver Robins) is being strangled, the clown's arms became extremely tight and Robins started to choke. When he screamed out, "I can't breathe!" director Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper thought that the boy was ad-libbing and just instructed him to look at the camera. When Spielberg saw Robbins's face turning purple, he ran over and removed the clown's arms from Robbins' neck.
              </em>
              <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084516/trivia">

             <p>
              From the same source as above:
              <em>
               (At 34 minutes into the film) There is a "jump cut" from the scene where Diane is explaining to Steven about the feeling you get when the spirit pulls you across the floor. The scene jumps mid sentence to the scene where they are both on their neighbor's doorstep, again in mid sentence. The reason for the cut was because in the original scene, director Steven Spielberg says how he hates Pizza Hut. The scene was edited (rather crudely) after Pizza Hut took offence.
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              Also from the same source:
             </p>
             <p>
              <em>
               Both of the terrors that plague Robbie came from director Steven Spielberg's own fears as a child: a fear of clowns and a tree outside his window.
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, same source:
             </p>
             <p>
              <em>
               Heather O'Rourke was chosen for the film when she was eating lunch with her mother and sister at an MGM commissary. Director Steven Spielberg came up to them and wanted O'Rourke for the part of Carol Anne. She initially failed the screentest because she kept laughing her way through the audition, even when she was supposed to be afraid. Spielberg thought she was too young to take the part seriously, but he still recognized something special in her, so he asked her to come back for another audition, and this time, bring a scary storybook with her. He also asked her to scream, so she screamed and screamed until she started crying. This audition got her cast as Carol Anne.
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              You have found a serious connection here between Lewis and Spielberg I hadn't identified before and I believe you're correct about Lewis' power in Hellywood. He was a feared person, and It's interesting that he gave the movie to the Library of Congress with one exception:
              <em>
               Despite claims the film will never be screened, Lewis reportedly donated a copy of the film to the Library of Congress in 2015, under the stipulation that it wouldn't be screened before June 2024.
              </em>
              <strong>
               Why this particular date?
              </strong>
              The only thing of significance I've found is that 2024 is a leap year, which means it has 366 days instead of 365.
             </p>
             <p>
              As an aside, American Horror Story linked terrifying clowns with the election:

               READ ENTIRE PROFILE AND LOOK WHO HIS FATHER IS...I never even got close to being able to watch 'Green Inferno', which appears to be a damn-near remake of 'Cannibal Holocaust'...and as an artist look at his personal works (directed/produce/written)...his past work/ life experience, his undeniable intellect, his cinematic knowledge, and his screenplay plots point to one conclusion...this is a genuine mass murdering, homicidal artist...

            Speaking of, one of the people I've posted about before has frequented a renaissance festival around the country. I imagine between that, Uber / Lyft and AirBnB, human traffickers have a lot of tools at their disposal to stay off the radar if they want to. And with AirBnB they can target the homes of vulnerable people with kids renting out rooms for extra money.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess any public event is a great place to scope out kids.

            I've also noticed that nearly universally, children hate the circus. I hated it as a child.

            This is some good original research and you deserve credit for your contribution. Rare when I don't have something gruff to say in this sub anymore. I was not aware of some of this stuff, although I have a low opinion of the circus in general.

            I think you're onto something OP.  Here's another instance.  "Zig" aka Jack Perry, one half of Melbourne's famous television clown duo Zig and Zag, was eventually revealed to be a convicted paedophile.  Don't carnivals and circuses also have a long association with the occult and the satanic?

            I've heard at least a few horror stories involving circuses and abuse/trafficking - I'm currently way too busy with something else, but, I'll put this aside for later reading :)

            Wow great post excellent research it must have been much worse in the old days think about all the poor kids in the 1920's to 1950's who were taken in by circus folk and forced to be sex slaves.

             " On February 22, 2006, Nealon contributed a story to the New York Times about being wiretapped by
             <strong>
              Hollywood private investigator Anthony Pellicano,
             </strong>
             who has been indicted on racketeering and conspiracy charges. It was also revealed in a separate court case on February 27, 2006, that investigators working for
             <strong>
              the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus
             </strong>
             may also have targeted Nealon for wiretapping. "

              From the looks/sounds of it, Mr. Subliminal might be explicitly laying it on a little thick...huh?
             </strong>
             P.S. if you folks aren't familiar with Anthony Pellicano spend an entire afternoon on nothing but this individual and his plot lines/connections/ Hollywood involvement....astoundingly he's still alive but currently incarcerated in Texas (go figure, huh?...)

              WTF?!?! That is some of the strangest info I've read in a long time. Why would Ringling be wire tapping him? I do need to refresh my memory about Pelicano. Thanks for the fascinating info!

               Nealon is an animal rights activist.  The circus is a target of animal rights activists.  Ringling plays hardball.

                Rotten POSs. They have no respect for anyone let alone animals. It seems to me that they are not above causing pain to any living being as long as they get they're money. At least Ringling is gone, but the smaller circuses are still clinging to life, and they need to go out of business, too.

               Hey, my comment earlier just reminded me of all the underage gymnasts who were molested by the doctor. I wonder how many Olympians in C de S were also molested and now have become abusers...

                Who knows, probably all of them or most anyway. This is what's so tough about this subject, when the victim becomes the abuser. Let's say there are 264834 victims living pizzagate victims who are now pizzagate perpetrators. How could we ever really get to the bottom of this if there are so many? And then how do we deal with it even if we do? Do we hang them from a tree even though they themselves were once abused and now do the abusing? I probably would personally to break the circle but I could also respect someone's opinion who wants to go the other way and give some of them a chance because of their childhood circumstances..most probably didn't have a choice then or now.

                 Exactly, and it's quite the conundrum. This is the reason that I don't advocate for death. It's too quick for those who are truly evil and the ones who were abused and have become the abusers deserve to be behind bars, but may have a chance to somewhat heal and help us learn how to identify others and learn from their living nightmares.

                  I can't really argue with you about that. They'd need to be kept out of society at least since there's no cure for that sickness.

                   Yes, there is no cure. There would have to be some way of making sure they never got out. Maybe turn Little St. James into a penal colony. After all, it already has cameras all over the island, so this would save the tax payers money. We'd just need to have guards on boats surrounding it, so if they did attempt an escape, it would be shoot to kill.

               Oh, OK! Now I know who you're talking about. Yes, he could be involved on a particular level, but as far as I know, all of their performers are adults. But, and there's always a 'but', the performers are usually those who have been in the Olympics, which is very attractive for children, so is this circus just another angle for them to lure kids? Cirque de Soleil recently left Disney right around the time Pizzagate started gaining traction.

                Indiana blogger tells about taking children to the circus in 2007:
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Cirque de Satan…I mean Soleil
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                "He walked around the outside of the ring…a foot in front of the audience holding the snake. He then picked a young boy from the audience and had him come to the center of the ring and hold his arms out from his side like a cross, then he placed the snake on the boys arms. The snake probably weighed as much as the boy. I was pretty horrified."
               </p>
               <p>
                and...
               </p>
               <p>
                "When the ringmaster announced the next act, they turned the lights way down and 2 men dressed as grim reapers came out pushing a cross. They men were completely creepy. They just stood by the cross after they pushed it into the ring. Then a girl came out in a hooded robe holding a candle and chanting. It was like being part of some Satanic ritual. We were totally freaked out. Next a man came out dressed in an old Roman centurion costume. He had the shinguards and breastplate and he had a bow and extremely sharp arrows. He shot them at the center of the cross and then the creepy chanting woman in the robe blindfolded him and spun him around. He was pointing the arrow at various people in the crowd before he finally shot it at the target. There were a lot of scary things like this for the rest of the circus. At one point when the woman in the robe was chanting and doing a strange dance, I was thinking I really don’t want the girls to see this. I don’t want them to think this is normal."

                 Awesome find! I'd be feeling the same way as that author. I had no idea that Cirque de Soleil was like that. I've never been, but I've seen their mini acts on TV and they were always so cheerful and classy. No wonder they have to conceal these types of acts, which certainly seem as though they're occult rituals.

             Shriner circus - allegations of CSA and mind control, in Brice Taylor's book:

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              There were many other Shriner meetings; lots of them disguised "under the big top," at Shriner circuses. Circuses were a place of trauma over the years and I usually ended up getting hurt.

              Voat has many users who have difficulty discerning between shitposting and real, useful information or good light hearted humour. I see people nearly every day take what is an obvious joke and crank it into some deep existential human crisis mode when it was meant to be funny and light hearted.

               was able to zero in on the target I was mainly dancing around, but don't get me wrong, all of the circuses worldwide need scrutinizing, then shut down. I just don't have the evidence to out right accuse the Shriners of molestation and trafficking. I'm glad you enjoyed the thread and I appreciate your comment!

                Im ignorant on the Shriners by the sounds of it. It seemed like he was just calling them carnys or something lol completely missing the whole post, I guess that's not the case at all.

                   <p>
                    As for Savile’s relationship with the Queen, he suggested it was somewhat lighthearted. “She thinks I’m odd because odd things always seem to happen when I’m at BP,” he said last year, referring to Buckingham Palace. “One time I was at a party there and the Queen said: ‘I do not recognise this person, I bear no responsibility if anything should happen’ – the Queen likes a joke. The next minute I bump into a lady who turns out to be Barbara Bush.

                 A short description:  All Shriners are Masons, but not all Masons are Shriners. Shriners International is a spin-off from Freemasonry, the oldest, largest and most widely known fraternity in the world. Freemasonry dates back hundreds of years to when stonemasons and other craftsmen gathered after work in shelter houses, or lodges.
