<p>Lydia Cacho\'s courage was in the end supported by a few other courageous members of the Supreme Court
and 40,000 brave Mexicans who came out to support her work against pedophilia in Mexico.</p>
<p>Can\'t say that I read every word of every chapter, but this is a story we need to know and understand
if we are to fight the crime of trafficking of children.</p>
<p>We also begin to see in this struggle the deep connection between drug trafficking and child trafficking/

            Feminist? She's fighting the pedo elite, so she's not the average Hillary voting, women's marching, hijab wearing feminist. But young boys get raped and trafficked as well. I wouldn't associate the pedo elite with patriarchy. The former is definitely a real danger but the latter is imaginary.

             Lydia Cacho is a feminist ... why does that upset you?
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm a feminist and I certainly didn't vote for Hillary.  Gloria Steinem who was CIA supported Hillary.

            <p>
             Young boys are also trafficked and are often raped -- especially in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, as I recall.
            </p>
            <p>
             And there are quite a few countries notorious for "Child prostitution" --
and Rush Limbaugh seems to be a frequent traveler to those places.

             True ... and as she says, "Men are the same the world over."
            </p>
            <p>
             Our planet and humanity seriously suffer for male violence and male sexual abuse of children.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, clearly, that has a lot to do also with the continuing "War on women" by Elite patriarchy
as they have reached the higher levels of government across the nation.

            I read the 4th Chapter and must say that this woman has an amazing amount of courage.  I feel that some divine power was assisting her in her crusade against this horrible rapist.  Also I must say that it is almost unbelievable that she was not killed for I have a connection to Mexico with friends that I have made there and I have known for years of all the journalists that have been murdered, taking their life in their own hands to print the truth about such cases and the cartel.  That is why I say that she had help and blessing to push her onward.  But she also had her own strength that helped her to pull these girls out of the horrible situations they had gone through and still had to face for the rest of their lives.  She is one courageous woman.

              I am strong, but that woman has gone beyond what many others have not.  She has shown us though that there is winning against those kind of people.  The people that do the evil works against those that have less or are weak.

              She is definitely one of our Angels.  I believe in Angels.  People think I am nuts, but that is one of my qwerky things. Some people where sent to accomplish great wonderful things for humankind, and others at some points in their lives were given the power when needed.  For someone like her to have the strength she did, I think she came here to do something really special no one else could achieve.  To fight someone that is like what we know as the devil.

               we all have a divine purpose, like an indestructible pearl nestled in the depth of the soul. some people's purpose is more grand or more visible (which comes with a price, like Lydia bravely took on) but each is equally valuable. some people don't take full advantage of their purpose in certain lifetimes because we have free will, but God is always there waiting to show us who we truly are if we seek his help. we

                will
               </em>
               untangle this knot, though we do need divine help. our enemies are using "divine" help through demons and dark forces; it's foolish to believe we can't use our own divine forces in defense. i am glad you believe in angels; ignoring the reality of the divine and our birthright to access it puts us at a disadvantage to the black magicians. obviously "God" won't solve this for us, but he

                will
               </em>
               help, through people like Lydia, people like us, and through what people consider "angels." if anyone reading this believes in a higher consciousness, try reaching out and establishing communication with the true God of Love and asking him to show you how you can help combat this evil.

                I have always believed there is someone or something greater than us.  I have always worried that I would not achieve something great while alive that is why I am so determined to help make a difference with the children, besides having a love for them.  I just recently realized that I was already sent something to achieve and have not realized it for I guess I just took it in stride not thinking it was that phenomenal.  But in actuality it was and still is ongoing.  So now I have been given a chance and a choice to make a difference with the children of the world and not just I but everyone on here that is sincere about their safety.  I am so glad to be a part of this on here and really admire and respect so many that have not given up..Thank you you know who you are.
