<p>James Gunn never &quot;apologized&quot; specifically for the BABY RAPE tweets, just other raunchy jokes.</p>

<p>USE SOCIAL MEDIA MOBBING: TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO BOYCOT ANY FILMS THEY ARE IN!</p>
<p>Don\'t forget what was in Gunn\'s tweets....NOT JOKES. DESCRIBES SICK CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR: Raping babies! Calling this depraved, PEDOVILE, behavior a &quot;joke&quot; is an attempt to undermine the HORROR of this act!</p>
<p>LET\'S BREAK DOWN THEIR TAVISTOCK APOLOGY/PLEA LETTER ONE PARAGRAPH AT A TIME!</p>
<p>FIRST, the new NEURO- LINGUISTIC  PROGRAMMING WORDS ARE &quot;Social Media Mobbing&quot; (You will notice that I specifically used their own words ON THEM, to counteract their brainwash attempt.)  Use of this phrase in SHAPIRO\'S article title (and aimed at researchers like us) is a DEAD GIVEAWAY at WHO HE SHILLS FOR. Left, Right is meaningless.</p>
<p>NO MORE TIN-FOIL HATS/ CONSPIRACY THEORISTS: Those phrases have lost their magic power, so now on to label those who speak TRUTH as members of a SOCIAL MEDIA MOB. Of course, Rules for Radicals says to accuse your targets of what you yourself are doing. Who sponsors VIOLENT ANTIFA MOBS? SOROS? Certainly not parents who desire to protect babies and children from MOLESTATION AND RAPE!</p>
<p>Thanks to the power of Twitter and free speech forums, MANY CITIZENS READ THOSE AWFUL TWEETS FOR THEMSELVES. They know they were NOT JOKES. THEY HAVE SEEN THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. The goal of the letter is to use neuro-linguistic programming to make you think YOU REALLY DIDN\'T SEE IT! The GUNN\'S TWEETS are referred to as:</p>
<p>&quot;Inappropriate jokes from years ago&quot; (A girl was murdered 5 years ago; today, murder is OK)
&quot;His jokes of many years ago&quot;
THAT\'S IT.  They continue to call the act of raping a baby a &quot;JOKE&quot;</p>
<p>OH, TAVISTOCK! PLEASE HELP US! MILLIONS$$$$$ ARE AT STAKE!
They have answered......&quot;GET RELIGION!  Use RELIGIOUS WORD neuro-linguistic programming, DUMMIES.&quot;
&quot;GUILT THEM INTO THINKING IT IS WRONG TO DEFEND BABIES AND CHILDREN FROM RAPE AND MOLESTATION.
James Gunn is the (unrepentant) PRODIGAL SON!&quot; Here are your NEW &quot;special words&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;Support,  shocked, think, pray, listen, discuss, encouraged, support, discouraged, duped into believing, reinstated, honor, love, support, gratitude, defend, share our experience, BELIEVE, from the heart, trust, LUV,  THEME OF REDEMPTION, our friend, good person, hope, responsibility, learn from this experience, help and heal, thank you</p>
<p>What faux Christian could resist?????  They will be buying up blocks of tickets for MOVIE 3 so they can take the entire church youth group! After all, the theme of the movie is &quot;THE MISFITS WHO FIND REDEMPTION.&quot;
LORD TAVISTOCK HAS SPOKEN!
THIS CALLS FOR A PRAISE SONG!

               If I am not mistaken Troma is a sleaze/ B movie/cult film outfit. Geared towards youth, Jewish run, they produced such classics as Toxic Avenger. "I've never corn holed a blind chick" is a memorable quote from the series. There was also the game that the teenagers played running over people, and getting extra points for cripples and baby strollers, or some nonsense. Worth looking into in my opinion.

            Yes, I totally agree with you. I was reading tweets this morning. If someone was sitting on the fence and was not a critical thinker, they could easily be duped into comparing apples to oranges.  Let's not forget that this douchebag laughed about hurting innocent children.

            They will ignore it for a paycheck. This is a re-occurring theme. Tavistock has nothing to do with this and its negligible if they have any effect on anything at all. You should not work for disney after this maybe make movies for universal or something but Disney does not want their hands in this. You could make the argument Disney tapped James Gunn because of his pedophile tendencies. If that was the case then they will not bring him back for the same reason.

             "Tavistock has nothing to do with this and its negligible if they have any effect on anything at all."
You are quite mistaken. Tavistock - Fritz Perls and Gestalt Therapy - Bandler and Grindler - Neurolinguistic programming
            </p>
            <p>
             "NLP was created in the late 1960’s and early 70’s by Richard Bandler, a computer scientist and John Grindler, a linguist. Together they studied the work of Fritz Perls, a Gestalt therapist, Virginia Satire, a family therapist and Milton Erickson, a Hypnotherapist, all of whom succeeded in helping their clients make dramatic changes in their lives. By drawing upon and Utilising the various skills and successes of these therapists, NLP was born."

              This is a great peer review on neurolinguistic programming. Anyone reading it, will need to use some mental gymnastics to understand some of the word play, such as saying "otherness". Like so many peer reviews, they are not just written with college level grammar, but are written with double means.

               "Although a common understanding of reframing derives from the pioneering formalization by John Grinder and Richard Bandler (Reframing: Neurolinguistic programming and the transformation of meaning, 1983), no specific appeal to the methods of neuro-linguistic programming is intended here. Of greater relevance are insights into framing emerging from the work of George Lakoff and Mark Johnson (Metaphors We Live By, 1980; Philosophy In The Flesh: the Embodied Mind and its Challenge to Western Thought, 1999)."

              Ok I am sorry I just felt that way because I have seen people say "dont mention T@vis0ck" and try and not directly spell it. The implication was if you type the word tavistock you are fucked. That was a little bit of hysteria but this makes sense with the Neuro Linguistic Programming.

               As a young man, I went reading into many topics. When I got into Aleister Crowley, MKULTRA, and an assortment of related subjects, I started having random strangers on the city bus tell me things like, "Stay out of McGregor's Garden." Mind you, this was the late 90s, the internet was young and most homes didn't have a computer yet. Most of what I read was from public library's and books I'd bought. What was on the internet back then, was mostly college archives. It was the time of AOL, no google or youtube yet. But even then, big brother knew what people would research.

               If you look into the Church Commission reports from the 1970's, you will find many names of people connected to unethical human experimentation. Those people were never punished. Most went on to hold esteemed positions in their fields of study. Bush senior was part of the CIA during the 70s. He went on to be president.

               MKULTRA never ended.

               Thanks for your comment. Now people will be curious about this topic. That's a good thing. These methods lose their power when the targeted individual is aware of how they work. Kind of like knowing the technique behind a magic trick - it's no longer magic. LOL!

             These people are deranged with their strange tweets.  They are using this medium to get attention with the most bazaar statements.  Narcissists is what they all are.  Bleeping Narcissists.

               None of this is funny when you are talking about those kind of jokes, but really did they think we would think they were funny just because they were presented as jokes?  That's the whole thing in a nutshell.  They thought we would because they did.  So they really do think those things are funny.  It's a real joke to rape children, at least to them.  Why?  Because we know how much they really hate them.  That is the really Hidden Story.  How they could even dress them up as jokes when they are not.  But to them, they are.  They are Beyond
Repair.  They Need T Be Totally Institutionalized Til Death.  They are a Danger to All Children.

                Nothing is funny about it, of course. No way they are 'jokes', that's why I call them 'tweets'.  How many times can anyone laugh at the SAME JOKE over and over, especially one that is not funny.
               </p>
               <p>
                There is also a lot of 'normalization' going on here, much like the repetitive nature of the Elsa and Spiderman videos. Keep beating the drum and people will begin to march in a line. The sheer number of tweets on the subject is staggering.

                 I agree.  They are part of the plan.  Along with the art we have been discussing.  So really the arts are playing a very large part in the normalization of our people.  They no longer even call it sexual abuse.  They are coming out with the real word.  Rape.  And people are accepting it.  That is the sad part.  Who really has challenged them on twitter?  I did not see memes from the community.  Very sad indeed.   We must not back down.
