            On the one hand, that logo was extremely suspicious and this could very well indicate "oh shit they're onto us". On the other hand, if you were an innocent small business owner and started getting attention for the fact your logo bore a striking resemblance to a pedo pride symbol, you'd change it.

             I've thought the exact same thing. I think that one thing we have to keep in mind is that none of the evidence we've amassed is conclusive; I mean that nothing (as far as I know) is a smoking gun which will send someone to prison. However, I do think it's important to bring all of this to light so that investigators and citizens alike can form a complete picture of what's going on. Changing a logo given that it's a pedo symbol means nothing by itself, but taken in context of everything else, it's highly suspicious. It's something that a detective would not overlook. And I think that's our task here: to make sure that none of these little "coincidences" disappear down the memory hole and to make sure all the facts are brought to light and into public awareness.
