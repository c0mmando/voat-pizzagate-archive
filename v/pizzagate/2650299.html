            The guy who plays the pedo is comedian Theo Von
He seems like a good genuine guy but has been a working comic around Hollywood for 20 years and a common theme he talks about
in his shows/podcasts is "the dark arts". I doubt he's part of it but definitely knows or has seen supporting evidence of the open secret.

            Blatant.  Check out her last video for Gucci Flip Flops and you’ll see David Spade make a cameo saying something like “isn’t she adorable” all this girl does is rap about designer brands whose founders / creative directors are all occultic multi sexual pedophiles.

             And wow just watched this video.  Her friend on the swing who lures him is BELLA THORNE.  sorry for not providing links but there was a post about her here recently.  Obviously an abused girl propelled to fame through modeling / music.  For both of these stars it seems their abuse was their shortcut to fame, and here they seem to seek revenge on people with sick tendencies and fantasies.
