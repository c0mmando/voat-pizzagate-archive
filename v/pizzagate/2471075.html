</p>
<p>Back in the 1990\'s, Raniere was run out of Arkansas when Bill Clinton was governor as a result of his involvement of several states investigating the Raniere-run Consumer Byline, Inc., a marketing firm in which members paid commissions for recruiting new members - the classic pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Raniere pumped thousands into Hillary\'s presidential run.  Executives  and top associates of the NXIVM group, along with family members, donated $29,900 according to federal records.  Most were from first time political donors, each giving the $2,300 maximum.</p>
<p>Three of the Clinton pledges came from Raniere\'s most high-profile followers - Seagram heiresses Clare and Sara Bronfman and Clare Cafritz, daughter of DC A-listers Buffy and Bill Cafritz.  The Clinton campaign downplayed the significance of the NXIVM-related contibution. </p>
<p>Additionally, at least 3 of the officials at NXIVM are members of the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) - president Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters.  Membership to CGI is by invitation only and requires at least a $15,000 donation per person for one year.

<p>On March 27, 2018, the FBI raided the Albany home of Nancy Salzman, 63, a registered nurse abd hypnotist, who is president of NXIVM.  It was also reported that the Albany Attorney General\'s office is probing a nonprofit organization linked to NXIVM that allegedly conducted brain activity and other human behavioral studies without oversight.</p>
<p>The nonprofit Ethical Science Foundation was formed in 2007 by Clare Bronfman.  In October 2017 a Vancouver woman, Jennifer Kobelt, 28, said Nancy Salzman recruited her for brain studies.  Kobelt said she was hooked up to an EEG machine to monitor her brain activity while being shown horrifying images abd videos of murder, rape, and mutilation.</p>
<p>Senator Kristen Gillibrand also received money from Bronfman, who reportedly gave $2,400 to the New York Democrat\'s 2010 special-election campaign.  Gillibrand\'s father, Doug Rutnik, worked as an attorney for NXIVM for 4 months in 2004 at a rate of $25,000 per month.  When Rutnik tried to quit, he was sued and reportedly paid back $100,000.

<p>Nancy Salzman\'s name appears on the paperwork for many of the numerous shell companies that launder money for Raniere.  Raniere keeps his name off of the paperwork for all the companies he controls so that if authorities ever press charges for tax evasion, he will not be implicated.</p>
<p>It is alleged that &quot;Weinsteinesque&quot; intimidation tactics have been used to silence reporters digging too deep into NXIVM.  It is further alleged that Richard Mays (an Arkansas lawyer, money raiser  and good friend of Bill Clinton when he was governor) and Republican operative Roger Stone were on the NXIVM payroll.

<p>A little history is in order on Keith Raniere.  He was born in Brooklyn in 1950.  Two of his &quot;operating&quot; businesses before NXIVM were the pyramid scheme, Consumer\'s Byline, as previously mentioned, and the later Executive Success Programs (ESP) with Nancy Salzman.  ESP attendees were reportedly required to recite a 12-step mission statement penned by Raniere each day- one point was that followers &quot;pledge to ethically control as much of the money, wealth, and resources of the world as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>One anonymous woman told the Times-Union that Raniere sexually assaulted her in 1990 when she was 12, after he had offered to tutor her in Algebra and Latin.  Another woman, Gina Hutchinson, died by suicide at 33 after saying she had a sexual relationship with Raniere as a teen.

            How else is Gillibrand's dad involved.  I think there is more to that story.  How did she get picked to run and do they have blackmail on her?  Does he have a past?  A pedo past maybe.
