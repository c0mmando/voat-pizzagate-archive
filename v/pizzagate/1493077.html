            Hi guys, this could be an important part of this world wide paedophile ring. Just noticed this sign near my home, with the international paedophiles symbol (like a triangle) YWCA Jesmond House, in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England (Clayton Road, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 1UJ ) 
This building is in an affluent part of the city, and is a hostel that caters for vulnerable single people and recently released prisoners. Check out the symbol at the top of their web site
            <a href="http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php">
             http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php
            </a>
            Interestingly this place was opened by H.R.H. Princess Alexandrea on 27 sept 1984.
 This is the sign I seen from the street

            I Pray and Hope someone with more know-how then me be able to dig some more, little children could be at risk now.Thank you. 
I would also like to thank Victurus Libertas VL, for recently making this video about this matter

            Can someone make a meme, or whatever you want to call it, of this so we can spread it on Twitter? There is a popular hashtag people are using #littlelivesmatter We should spread this. We need to open the eyes of the public about how sick these bastards are.

            Set up or not, this is not the first time they have been caught abusing their power and harming children all over the world. CP is abuse whether you use it, make it, save it, or sell it.

            Right. We should compile a list of all these examples of a massive issue/ring where there was almost no repercussion. It was swept under the rug. I have observed that most stories, if any, break about an arrest...but it is rare to see a story that shows the perpetrators were successfully prosecuted and sent away for long prison terms. Most times, you can't find a story about the outcome. If it is someone more prominent, they usually get a slap on the wrist. And the 100s/1000s found in the initial ring do not produce those numbers in charges. Usually only a few get prosecuted. Their plea deals may actually involve an agreement to stay silent about the rest of the ring.

             Soros is Jewish.  Epstein is Jewish.  Roman Polanski is Jewish.  Jimmy Seville is Jewish.  Corey Feldman is Jewish.  The Hollywood paedophile rings are Jewish.  And many many more.

             Here's the first Satanic band called Coven.
            </p>

            <p>
             They're also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.

             Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.

            <p>
             Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.
            </p>
            <p>
             "The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")."

             So now I've just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn't surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what's up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.
            </p>
            <p>
             " You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."
            </p>

              http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.

            <p>
             Now here's a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/">
              http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it's common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's take a look at their lyrics now.
            </p>
            <p>
             " Infants' flesh they did offer For the prince to devour. Covens join, all combine, Powers strong, thoughts align. "
            </p>
            <p>
             " The cheif of the circle, Known as Malchius drank the blood of a young baby Offered unto him. "
            </p>
            <p>
             Malchus is a servant to a Jewish high priest.

              Well it's no secret that jews throughout history did these kind of rituals, it was called blood libel, but at that time not just jews did child sacrifice in ancient times it was common.

              ok classic trap you just fell into.
Yes, the global elite, the billionairs, the senior members of governing bodies have an unequivocal over-representation in the paedophile mafia

             <p>
              and even if there is a 'cultural inclination' that means shit from the perspective of a criminal court.
keep yer investigators hat on, not your 'clash of civilizations' hat. Please. We have an uphill battle with the media as it is

            5,197 pentagon employees whos families dont know. Blackmail much ?
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            The bit that gets me here is which is more likely a.) People with jobs in the pentagon who are highly experienced and vetted decide that its a great idea to buy cp on work computers. - computers they know are monitored or b.) keyloggers on computers used against employees who bought gifts for friends and family and gave away their CC info were then registered on cp sites.   hmmmm....

              Brilliant so well put, there NO way that many people would stay quiet. Oh wait 1 in 4 pentagon employees are one slip away from being strung up by their own families. Note that the investigation is technically still ongoing though dormant. #pwned

               All the suspicions I'd been carrying for over a decade were confirmed when Pgate broke.  Blackmail is the mortar in the wall around this cabal of evil.

                Its rather curious alright that despite the actions of so many, over the past 50+ years, it took some tongue in cheek pizza related comments to tie everything together. Its a pretty simple system which means Occam's razor probably applies here. No going back back now.
