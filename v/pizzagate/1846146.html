            I loathe the Clinton's so I don't want to appear that I am defending them. Haiti was on everybody's radar screen in the 1970s as was all of Latin America and Cuba. Haiti was deemed as an island bulwark against communism and as a counterweight to Castro's Cuba. The problem however especially for liberals was the violent Papa Doc and Baby Doc regimes,  two gruesome rightwing dictatorships. How to rid Haiti of the Duvaliers without leaving  a vacuum for another communist leader like Castro was the challenge. All agreed that economic and social development would assist in this regard.
           </p>
           <p>
            So young idealist liberals like the Clinton's took a keen interest in Haiti back then. Thus it is no surprise to me that these honeymooners who were in their mid 20s  developed a fond attachment that would take on many facets  thru the decades. On the same trip the Clintons participated in the half Christian/ half voodoo  ceremony they also attended church in a renowned cathedral. They simply submerged themselves in the culture of this exotic place which had to be an extraordinary experience for a poor boy from Arkansas and a middle class girl from the Chicago suburbs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did a little voodoo intrigue enter Hillary's open mind? Sure. Do the Clintons maintain contact with anybody and everybody in Haiti and elsewhere  who might further their designs? You betcha...they have to have the world's largest Rolodex. Was their Haitian activities after the earthquake illfated? Yeah, because these two are so utterly devoid of morals and principles, everything they touch turns to rot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of more concern to me than Haiti's voodoo is the ease in which the Clintons and especially Hillary can embrace the concepts put forward by Marina Abramovic. That's way to close to home for my comfort.

            Clinton wrote about it in the book, openly admitting he was into voodoo. Also, there was a voat post two months ago about the Clinton's involvment in yet another children's charity in Ghana - where around Lake Volta voodoo practitioners engage in blood rituals. And of course Clinton Foundation pulled out just days before child slavery scandal broke. It was a chilling post. Basically wherever dark magic or child trafficking is involved anywhere in the world - Clintons are there (and their pedo partners in crime - Ben Garisson depicted Podesta as an octopus snatchig up kids in his cartoon drawing) And looks like Hillary is back with a new bag of tricks. Drain the swamp? We are waiting Donald!
