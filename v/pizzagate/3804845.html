<p>I helped do a little digging on a post by <a href="https://voat.co/u/Kofiannan">@Kofiannan</a> regarding suspect images for DAZED magazine : </p>
<p>&quot;Dazed Digital who I covered extensively in the Rachel Chandler\'s Friends series have a post currently online with a nude child who is dressed up and wearing make up (pizzagate)&quot; <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3801687">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3801687</a> </p>
<p>... that <a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> asked I make a separate post on ...</p>
<p>...and ended up finding a few artists and images that need archiving and digging. Now the above original post did not include the mentioned nude child in makeup, for obvious understandable reasons, (nor will that image or any blatant CP be found here) but I am warning you, the below are disturbing and suggestive nonetheless. Armor up. </p>
<p>DAZED DIGITAL</p>
<p>Dazed Magazine from Rachel Chandler renown, has been mentioned many times, and is almost surely aligned with these predators and their agenda. We know the art and fashion worlds have been used to create a safe zone for their disgusting fantasies, industries, rituals AND create plausible deniability, via the &quot;its only creative expression&quot; angle. We see you. Your \'art\' is repugnant and evil and we will not tolerate your hiding in the shadows any longer. Your DAZE are numbered...</p>
<p>For this post I will focus primarily on ONE of Dazed Digital\'s recent photo essays, and ONE of their \'artists\' featured therein. -as this was how we also found Rachel Chandler involved. That said, the whole magazine is likely involved, and everything and everyone found and presented below are all X\'s marked: \'dig deeper\'. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HELP DOING SO. </p>
<hr />
<p>Here is the photo essay / article that originally caught my eye. It will send shivers down your spine. </p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="md-how-to-survive-a-plague">‘How To Survive A Plague’</h1>
<p>is a project by Sean Monahan and Jordan Richman, a <strong>celebration of their creative community and a glimpse into the future</strong> at what comes next</p>
<p>“We were already living in a <strong>Zombie World Order</strong>, it just took a pandemic for us to realise it”. This is one of the lines from Sean Monahan’s (formerly of <strong>K-Hole</strong> (<em>memory wiping drug reference</em> )) and Jordan Richman’s essay and photo project “How We Survive A Plague”, published on Dazed.</p>
<p>The longread essay is an exploration of a broken society, the <strong>effects that coronavirus has had on friendships and sex</strong>, a look back at the Aids crisis, and theories about where we go from here.</p>
<p>It\'s accompanied by a gallery of surreal images, with contributions coming from Grimes/War Nymph, Caroline Polachek, Bjarne Melgaard, and more.</p>
<p>“This report was born out of <strong>friends coming together, checking in with each other and sharing our inspirations, nightmares, thirst traps, and humour</strong> to get through this very challenging time,” says Richman. The ‘We’ in “How We Survive A Plague” is our creative community that collaborated with us on <strong>these images representing our surreal realities, fantasies, and isolation.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many disturbing images featured in this DAZED Plague set, none as blatant as this scary image of a child on the street outside at night in their PJS, accompanied by a man with a large knife: <a href="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1344/azure/dazed-prod/1290/1/1291247.jpg">https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1344/azure/dazed-prod/1290/1/1291247.jpg</a> (not the artist below but definitely needs further scrutiny)</p>
<p>another image in this gallery is a nude self portrait of a woman in a plastic suit (bunny suit /cleanroom suit?)</p>

<p>Enter our suspect/ artist </p>
<p><strong>Talia Chetrit</strong>  
</p>
<p>CHETRIT naked in a bunny suit is bad enough, but she also creates images like these (NSFW) : </p>

             The Dilated pupils? (I think the piece is named 'RED EYES') I'd say most if not all of these 'high fashion' 'high art' people have that strung out look. Must be an influence on the whole culture, much like this American Apparel / Terry Richardson voyeur look for the photography. They are sick. Its no surprise they would 'medicate' to perpetuate this unhealthy culture, and make it easier to subject themselves and these poor children, to the abuse.

              A LOOK AT FASHION'S LONG-STANDING LOVE/HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH DRUGS
             </h1>
             <p>
              Last month, Nordstrom made the call to pull Jeremy Scott’s pill-centric Moschino capsule collection (get it? Capsule collection?) after shoppers complained that it glamorizes opioid addiction. The decision felt like an acquiescence to a more conservative segment of America, or a return to the Reagan-era "Just Say No" environment, as Scott’s "Valley of the Dolls"-inspired designs were only the latest in a long history of designers taking inspiration from drug culture.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1999, for instance, Andrew Groves really went for it with his runway show entitled "Cocaine Nights," in which he covered the runway with a white powder and put models in dresses constructed of stainless-steel razor blades. Then there was the popular "heroin chic" look of the '90s — hollowed-out cheeks, smudged eyeliner and fearsomely skinny models — best exemplified by a young Kate Moss. And, now, it seems that designers are turning to drugs for artistic inspiration more than ever: Vetements’s lighter heels, Hood by Air’s BIC lighter earrings, Marc Jacobs’s raver-inspired Spring 2017 show and Alexander Wang's fall 2016 collection with profuse marijuana leaf motifs are leading the trend.
             </p>
             <p>
              Which raises the question: What exactly is behind fashion's addiction to drugs, both on and off the runway?

             . It Was! Look at the connections between DAZED and Serpentine Gallery! Its a star studded constellation . Milo Jovich, Bjork and Kendall Jenner. Damien Hirst and Terry Richardson. Sounds like a networking platform in need of a crash.

              After a cursory look at his body of work, The 'art direction' from the above mentioned Mirko Borsche (A BAVARIAN?) looks very 'inverted' , creepy, and contains imagery like what you would imagine finding in MK Ultra programming. Mirko himself claims not to be an artist but more of a creator of visual campaigns meant to play with psychological triggers.
             </p>

              And yet he works with HUGE brands like BMW and Nike , even hired by Italian Venetian Gov for their city. Sounds to me this guy is in the club.
