<p>So after Robert put money in it, built it up, Nicole sold her share, founders left behind built it up to what is it known for </p>
<p>So they hook up with this guy</p>
<p>Riccardo Silva</p>
<p>Riccardo Silva was born in 1970 in Milan, the grandson of the founder of Italsilva – Gruppo Desa, one of Italy’s largest chemical groups. His maternal family, Fabbri, is known for its publishing company, Fabbri Editori, which is now part of the RCS Media Group. </p>
<p>1998 Riccardo Silva launched MP Web, an internet start-up of the Milan-based Media Partners Group (now Infront Media), managing sports rights and content for mobile and Internet platforms, which first came to prominence in the 1990s. In 2001 Riccardo Silva became CEO of Milan Channel, the official TV channel of AC Milan football club, and guided the international development of the channel.</p>
<p>Another tidbit..</p>
<p>The company also owns MP Management, Europe’s second largest modelling and talent network with agencies in Milan, Miami, Paris, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Silva">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Silva</a></p>
<p>Following its sale in 2001, she invested in newly-founded Infront Sports and Media. Along with another major shareholder, Nicole helped develop Infront into one of the world’s leading sports media rights businesses, </p>
<p><a href="https://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com/author_bio/nicole-junkermann">https://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com/author_bio/nicole-junkermann</a></p>
<p>Junkermann would go on to invest in a recently created media rights company called “Infront Sports and Media AG,” where she would soon serve as the Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The company was best known at this time for its president and chief executive, Philippe Blatter, the nephew of Sepp Blatter, the then president of FIFA. This overt nepotistic corruption left Junkermann’s Infront Sports and Media as the company to market the TV rights to major FIFA tournaments. It went on to acquire the rights to all of FIFA’s World Cups, and even though this deal was watered down in 2006, in 2011 FIFA again gave Infront permission to sell the TV rights, in the Asian markets, for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.</p>
<p>During her time at Infront Sports and Media, Junkermann would be caught flying on Jeffrey Epstein’s “Lolita Express” on three occasions. The first flight recorded, on 22nd March 2002, she would share with Epstein, Sean Koo, and one other passenger, but it’s her second trip which really stands out. On Saturday 31st August 2002, Jeffrey Epstein and Nicole Junkermann would fly from Paris Le Bourget Airport to Birmingham Airport, in the UK, alone. They would return to Paris, via the same route, on Monday 2nd September 2002. For Jeffrey Epstein to fly without any of his normally present entourage is very unusual. So </p>
<p>what was happening that weekend? I’ve done a lot of research on these dates, but as of yet, I do not have any answers.</p>

<p>And Dreyfus....</p>
<p>October 2015 the German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that the bidding committee for the FIFA World Cup 2006 had set-up a slush fund that Louis-Dreyfus, at the time CEO of Adidas, filled with 10.3 million Swiss francs in 2000. Allegedly these funds were used to bribe FIFA officials and secure Germany\'s bid to host the 2006 World Cup, whilst a FIFA report had strongly criticised England\'s \'unprofessional\' bid presentation. According to internal FIFA documents, Louis-Dreyfus demanded a repayment of the funds in 2004, which were transferred as €6.7 million via a FIFA account in Geneva to an account held by Louis-Dreyfus.</p>
<p>was involved in the creation of Infront Sports &amp; Media in 2002 (transition from the former KirchSport completed in February 2003) acting as the company\'s chairman of the board. The Swiss-based sports marketing agency was handling the media rights distribution of the FIFA World Cup in 2002 and 2006. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis-Dreyfus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Louis-Dreyfus</a></p>
<p>Infront Sports &amp; Media was founded in October 2002 in order to create the television and radio broadcasts for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. The company originated from a merger of two existing Swiss-based marketing companies, CWL and Prisma Sports &amp; Media. CWL was founded by Cesar Lüthi, who sold the business to the Kirch Group. Infront\'s origins are in the football business, but in 2005 the company lost a majority of its FIFA business and subsequently diversified.</p>

<p>In 2005 Junkermann founded a private equity fund, United in Sports, focused on media and sports investments in Asia and Europe. United in Sports raised €242.2 million in 2007.</p>

<p>This company is a tricky one to find</p>
<p>Found this through Dreyfus</p>
<p>The former, former majority shareholder of Olympique de Marseille, was allegedly co-shareholder, with some of his relatives, of two entities domiciled in the British Virgin Islands (tax haven). These are United in Sports Parallel GP Limited, created on November 6, 2007, and UIS RLD 2 Limited, created one month before his death on June 12, 2009. The two companies were dissolved in 2013.</p>

<p>Shanghai Really Sports</p>
<p>With the financial support of United in Sports (Luxembourg), in 2006, together with three other sports retailers and the support of Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the most important sports retailer with 3600 branches in China was to be formed. The management initially consisted of members of the Chinese founding families, Sandrine Zerbib (former Chief Executive Officer of Adidas Greater China) and Dan Loeb (former Chief Executive Officer Nike Greater China). After 2008, when all necessary contracts were negotiated and approved by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), business development through the 2008 Beijing Olympics was on the decline deteriorated, the alliance broke into discussions about investment levels and the financial contribution of investors.</p>

<p>Another shell</p>
<p>Insport had alot of subsidiaries I havent looked into</p>
<p>Am sure there are a few shells in there </p>
<p>In 2011 Insport went up for sale </p>
<p>The Qatar Investment Authority is among a handful of bidders for Infront Sports &amp; Media, the Swiss agency that sells media rights for seven national football federations and the skiing world cup events.</p>
<p>The Qatar sovereign wealth fund has entered the latest round in the sales process for the company that is led by Philippe Blatter, nephew of Fifa president Sepp Blatter who is fighting off claims that Qatar had “bought” the World Cup in 2022.</p>
<p>The remaining bidders include UK private equity group Bridgepoint and another sovereign wealth fund from Abu Dhabi, people close to the situation said.</p>

           With the financial support of United in Sports (Luxembourg), in 2006, together with three other sports retailers and the support of Robert Louis-Dreyfus, the most important sports retailer with 3600 branches in China was to be formed. The management initially consisted of members of the Chinese founding families, Sandrine Zerbib (former Chief Executive Officer of Adidas Greater China) and Dan Loeb (former Chief Executive Officer Nike Greater China). After 2008, when all necessary contracts were negotiated and approved by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), business development through the 2008 Beijing Olympics was on the decline deteriorated, the alliance broke into discussions about investment levels and the financial contribution of investors.

           The Qatar Investment Authority is among a handful of bidders for Infront Sports &amp; Media, the Swiss agency that sells media rights for seven national football federations and the skiing world cup events.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Qatar sovereign wealth fund has entered the latest round in the sales process for the company that is led by Philippe Blatter, nephew of Fifa president Sepp Blatter who is fighting off claims that Qatar had “bought” the World Cup in 2022.
          </p>
          <p>
           The remaining bidders include UK private equity group Bridgepoint and another sovereign wealth fund from Abu Dhabi, people close to the situation said.

                  Try as we might.......all of this is public relations. We're good to take down Epstein, but I honestly think there will always be a two tiered legal system on earth. The kings, queens, etc.............the mass majority of those knowingly involved will die of old age, living lives we only see in magazines and movies. ALL of the Panama Papers and Pizzagate is social stress testing. TPTB are allowing so much to go on, just to learn a new control method in the age of information.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I do not want ANYONE to give up trying. I would so love to see these psycho, sickos go down for the crimes they commit. The hard work and valuable personal time each one of you and I put into learning what we have is keeping these people on their toes. Many such as Hillary look like walking zombies now, due to the stress they are living under because of the fire we have lit under their asses.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Change did happen and will continue to happen. At the end of the day, TPTB operate generationally and know most of us "laymen" do not.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Us laymen have to keep the fire lit and stoked, so TPTB know we will no longer be hypnotized by mass media, into ignoring reality.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The "just us" system will slowly find a new balance, but it will take decades, upon decades of all of us not giving in, not giving up, trying to keep our lives together, while at the same time keeping hellfire on these peoples heels, so that the LEO that do try and are trying do not become burned out and complacent.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The people that act out in society, such as the comet pingpong idiot shooter hurt our case, but Epstein has awoken many many more to the reality all of us "conspiracy nuts" have been right about.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We must act within the legal systems. So much as I hate the two tiered, "just us" masonic design.............acting within the legal system and playing by their own rules is the only way to do this and show the future generations, we tried. We refused to give up. We didn't buy into the self absorbed social media generation. We paid attention and did all we could.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Many of you, thorough, great investigators here, I hope write books and make yourselves decent livings from the time you've invested into this. Take what you make and build a better world within their rules.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is a pivotal moment in humanity's evolution. I'm honestly glad to have helped in any small way, I might have. Even just to encourage people to self educate into all of this. I'm glad to have met all of you and proud of what Voat has done and become.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'd rather die a goat, than be subjugated into a sheep. None of TPTB are worthy to be my shepherd.

                   When I did, I took it very personal, a friend mentioned Voat, I came, joined and lurked lol

                   I voted for Bush's 3 times, Father and Son

                  <p>
                   I was duped and I'm mad lol
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Right now Timing is everything

                   She was suppose to win
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So much so, that they got sloppy and made mistakes big mistakes
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   They wont go down for everything, they probaly wont go down for what they did to children, but they will go down, at least on this side of the pond
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   They used the web against us

                  <p>
                   Spying and doing their business, while upfront or in hiding
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Makes me smile, because we are now using it to join up and use it against them
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   When Trump ran, I knew he had to win, it was our last chance

                  <p>
                   We have been on one hell of a rollercoaster

                  <p>
                   Just looking the stuff up, gives me bad dreams and nightmares
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It was much worse then I thought
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Like I said, they will never pay for what they did to children in life
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But I ok with that as long as they die in prison or hang by the traitors rope

                  <p>
                   It has to stop

                  <p>
                   We must teach future generations what and how they did it

                   Push comes to shove, I have other weapons

                   This is about ALL children, their future must be secured
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I will fight to my death, to see the evil exposed, to see it prosecuted, to see everything decision our Goverment makes, is best for our Children
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Burn it down, rebuild

                  <p>
                   May our Children and their Children always be on guard, To protect those who have no one, to work Together always, to fight this evil
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We have to stop the division for the sake of the Children

                   I'm preaching to the choir lol
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Keep up the fight, and know when you die, you did what you could to open eyes of the masses
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Our work here is used everywhere, even if some plagerize, it's getting out there
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I have a few places I hit, to share our words
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It too is a rollercoaster, two steps forward, one step back
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   By my count, I still moving forward, it's just taking longer, but eyes, ears are opening, mouths are going

                    I think 9/11 will be their downfall.  There are legal actions in motion now in the US to sort out the facts, which = demolition.  Once that blows up, the rest will follow.

                    I'm 40 years old now. I "woke up" when I was about 12-14. I fully woke up in my mid 20s and blindly watched and waited. When Hillary ran for president, I did everything I could to mock her. I was making memes about her eating babies at Bohemian Grove, weeks before Wikileaks released those emails.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I'm just saying............I've spent most of my life on the outside and got use to being called nuts, conspiracy freak, etc...........long, long ago.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I can die happy, now knowing this ripple will only grow and grow. I likely didn't cause the ripple, but I knew the moment I seen that release, to stoke the fires any and everywhere I could find relevant articles at online. I've been doing so whenever I got free time, until I joined Voat about three years ago. I was a lurker, "blindlywatching". I got logged out of Voat in 2017 during the Comet Pingpong crap and DDOS attacks here. So I made maurice. Same crap happened this time with Junkermann..........so I made this account.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Anyway, I calmed down on other sites, due to time issues and try to lend whatever I can here now.

                    I've no children for many reasons. The future is in the hands of the mothers and fathers. Be sheep or become wolves.

                              I listen to stuff from the 30s to modern music. Can't dig pop country or mumble rap though. Stopped liking most RnB when Aaliyah died.

                             <p>
                              I love damn near any style though. Country, to classical, to rock, rap, blues, jazz, whatever. Dubstep, house. Name a style. I love music. No real favorites though.

                          Exactly. I'm mostly self taught. I dropped out at 17 to earn money to help my family.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          My love of learning was never nurtured in schools anyhow.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I walked many miles, like many others and took a hard look in the mirror when I was 20. Decided to become more than a Joker, a smoker, a midnight toker..........you know. Seen how to become a little monster, so to speak. decided to seed minds, live right, my code of honor will not bend for much of this NWO crap. I may not have my own kids, but it really does take a village to raise a child. I got sick and damn tired of hearing Hillary chanting that, knowing the ideologies and philosophies these fucks adhere to. Fuck the village they want to build.

                          I couldn't resist going full force, trolling any relevant articles about her and encouraging others to self educate about the medically kidnapped issue. I'm not a Trump guy either, idc much for politics at all, but I've been paying attention most my life. Just blending in as best I could and waiting.

             Corrupt FIFA Has Clinton Foundation Ties; World Cup Host Qatar Gave Millions
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Several top FIFA executives were arrested Wednesday in Zurich and face corruption charges stretching back two decades...
            </p>
            <p>
             Fmr. President Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of the bid committee put together to promote the United States as a possible host nation for the 2018 or 2022 World Cup.
            </p>
            <p>
             When the U.S. lost the 2022 bid to Qatar, Clinton was rumored to be so upset
             <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/soccer-dirty-tackle/bill-clinton-was-so-angry-when-qatar-was-awarded-the-2022-world-cup-that-he-broke-a-mirror-230144974.html">
              he shattered a mirror.
             </a>

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <em>
               newspaper investigations into the vote and other murky FIFA dealings have implicated former FIFA vice president and Qatar's most senior football official at the time, Mohamed Bin Hammam, in allegedly handing out bribes to African officials in an attempt to influence votes. He was banned by FIFA in 2011 after being caught bribing Caribbean officials in his bid to become FIFA president.
              </em>
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The Guardian reported in 2013 about “appalling labor abuses,” including possible forced labor and worker death on Qatar’s World Cup infrastructure projects. It is also considered to be too hot to play soccer in Qatar in the summer.
            </p>
            <p>
             No Qatari officials have been arrested, but Swiss authorities announced Wednesday that they had opened criminal proceedings into the allocation of the Qatari and Russian World Cups. They have also seized documents from FIFA’s headquarters and gained access to the Swiss bank accounts of executives they suspect of “unjust enrichment” and money laundering.

            <p>
             I’m involved with a number of charities and projects in Europe, Africa and the U.S., particularly in South Florida. I strongly believe in giving back to the community and doing our part help. Some of the organizations I’m involved with include Play for Change, amfAR, Mount Sinai Medical Center and the New World Symphony, to name a few.
