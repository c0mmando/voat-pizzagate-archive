            I was watching the old BBC spy show Spooks recently. In one episode they revealed that the royal family have a secret underground bunker when there may be a threat of attack. The bunker is called PEGASUS. Is that what Alefantis was doing in that warehouse? Digging  a bunker.

            In REALITY......to finance ~push and control KEY people whatever the (cost) of enemy...isnt that a fairly simple solution?
           </p>
           <p>
            USA builds the biggest F weapons on the earth...and the enemy just subvert/finance/blackmails and controls the fuckers who controls them.

           <p>
            And both fuckers are so low in the (game)....so funny.

            Very obvious why Alefantis was fuming/anxious with Ryan O'Neal when he started investigating Pegasus. Clearly a very important area to Alefantis &amp; his consort of weirdos. Think about all the verified connections surrounding the place (and the park opposite) we've collectively unearthed:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Pegasus Musuem is yet another shady established owned by Alefantis (hidden away &amp; clearly not public or a museum of any kind) Where does he get all the $$$ for his many enterprises? Fair to assume it's backed by a lot of covert, criminal money.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Around an underground tunnel network if I remember correctly.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Previously owned by Joseph T. Scheve &amp; Nellie Hubbard who worked for the New Hope Academy with an access point to Haitan children. Organisation also linked to the Moonies Cult - who are involved in ritualistic abuse &amp; mind control experimentation.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Pegasus has a mysterious 'watchtower' that directly overlooks the playground opposite - the 'Trolley Park' as it's known.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Trolley Park's commissioner/owner is Richard Dubeshter, a real estate agent for Evers&amp;Co. Evers&amp;Co is run by Donna Evers - whose daughte Andrea Evers sits on the board of directors for Alefantis's Transformer Gallery.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              For an obscure area there have been a weird amount of events aimed at children in this park such as UNICEF.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The FB page for Trolley Park has weird, unprofessional written material with a great amount of odd typos/syntax errors. Seemed like coded messaging &amp; researchers on this very platform seemed to show it was paedophilia related. Once that thread gained traction here, the coded message was deleted.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              One coded message included the picture &amp; account of Wylita Bell  - a US Consulate Officer who has visited the White House over 10 times.

            Well, I've done more digging and found a loose thread connected to Pegasus. I noticed that the window blinds on the top floor of Pegasus were customized so they are open at the top. This typically is so one can look out the window without being fully seen in the window.
            <a href="https://www.google.pl/maps/@38.9331712,-77.0291098,3a,37.5y,58.3h,116.87t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1spmPTeoKnqCh-kxDKZE_X_g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en">
             https://www.google.pl/maps/@38.9331712,-77.0291098,3a,37.5y,58.3h,116.87t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1spmPTeoKnqCh-kxDKZE_X_g!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?hl=en
            </a>
            I then looked across the alley to check out the neighbors place. And coincidentally enough, the neighbors have their blinds the same exact way. Interesting as no other surrounding homes have their blinds in such a way. Being they are adjacent, it seemed possible there is a connected.
           </p>
           <p>
            I learned that both Pegasus and this neighbor are properties sold by the same realtor; Rebecca Love, who works for Redfin Real Estate. Now maybe it's just a coincidence that their management team look like demons, but I'll just leave this link here anyways:
            <a href="http://press.redfin.com/spokespeople">
             http://press.redfin.com/spokespeople
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            So I figured out who owns the top level apartment across from Pegasus, with the similarly drawn blinds, and it's Laura Itzkowitz &amp; Catherine Rivkin. Laura Itzkowitz works for USAID, where she specializes in maternal &amp; child nutrition in third world countries, and is on the board of DC non-profit that serves homeless children, New Endeavors by Women. One of New Endeavors financial contributors is none other than Amy Weiss, who is the wife of Peter Kadzik, a very close associate to JOHN PODESTA.

             https://twitter.com/New_Endeavors/status/1238165581368623104
            </a>
            Amy is on the left:

             https://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2016/10/16/podesta%20kadjik_0.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Catherine Rivkin, a.k.a Katie Rivkin Visser, who works for the Department of Defense, is married to Tim Visser, a trial attorney for the US Department of Justice. Here they are together:
            <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/27/fashion/weddings/27RIVKIN/27RIVKIN-facebookJumbo.jpg">

            </a>
            . Tim Visser does missionary work in Haiti with Hope On A String. Now why Laura Itzkowitz &amp; Katie Visser both own an apartment together, who knows. I guess the best connection made in all this is that Laura Itzkowitz works on the board of an organization that 'helps' homeless DC children and which is funded in part by close associate to John Podesta, Amy Weiss, ,the wife of former DOJ official Peter Kadzik, who appears through the Podesta e-mails and was invited to one of Podesta's "pizza extravaganzas".

             I'll lend some credence to the theory that real estate agent/cies are likely in on these operations. In my digging into
             <strong>
              the Finders
             </strong>
             known CP CT / CA locations, we had a few known addresses that never changed ownership companies, are AS WE SPEAK listed/managed by small real estate agencies that looked very much like fronts.

             Epstein would hire those architects seemingly in the club to build his island, and  created a development company himself to hire as the builders of the New Mexico compound. This would be an excellent way to keep eyes off the property, build other than what is permitted, but still appear legitimate (and remain protected by real estate buisness/ property privacy rights.

             Yeah, this is looks like another deep state neighborhood.  There are pockets of them all over DC/MD/VA (DMV).  It's not just concentrated libs, is all the bad people who watch out for each other.
            </p>
            <p>
             Homeless children. That BOD - lots of creeps.  Very Hebrew too, LOL.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wouldn't be surprised if lots of the homes are owned/occupied by various creeps in the infrastructure of the Cabal.  This is middle/upper-middle class DC.  Largely white, mixed, but definitely not ghetto.  They may keep places through trusts like a "weekend house".  Small condo unit across the alley from PM.

                 Creepy art.  Especially the last painting
                 <em>
                  The Time Has Come
                 </em>
                 and one of the figures is holding a sacrificial dagger.  Armstrong is another homosexual as well.  Not that it really matters in these circles - they are all phreaks.

                   Eames self-identifies (can't believe I'm typing that "word") as "genderqueer".  I had to look it up: Genderqueer
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Non-binary, or genderqueer, is a spectrum of gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminineâ€â€”â€Œidentities that are outside the gender binary. Non-binary identities can fall under the transgender umbrella, since many non-binary people identify with a gender that is different from their assigned sex.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In other words, it's Pat:

                   Re the window: It definitely looks like the window has been removed and blocked out.  That's an exterior door and the dimensions look to put it right where the window was in the Goo streetview image.  Almost definitely to keep people from looking in.  The window looked new, like the rest of the windows.  Why would you put in a new window if you knew you were going to remove and block it?  Did something happen?

                    That window had bars on it in the original post.  They took the time to reshoot the image in Google, that is how afraid they were.  How many alleyways get new mapping every couple of years?

                     I didn't realize you had made the connection.  I'd never seen that artist before.  Her work looks like she put a happy NPC face on Kim Noble's art.

                     The bars - forgot about them.  Regarding the streetview: I checked the area and most of the neighborhood has been updated and that is a street, not an alley.  The cars just follow the directions as interpreted from the city's GIS databases.

            Thanks for keeping the candle lit while everyone gets high on the Q hopium and sits back trusting the plan. Friendly reminder that pre 2010 there are many references to JA in publications like Washington life with his second name spelled without the e as in Alfantis.

              Not that I am aware of I just found it odd that the same spelling error would occur multiple times over multiple years and find no reference to him with the E in his name during the same period. It could totally be a dead end but it does bring up some older history in publications for him so it allowed me to trace back a little further.

               It appears as mispelling/ clerical error when investigated, but doesnt let you appear in search databases or meta data, almost as if it is a separate entity. I'd say its clear why shady people would often misspell their name and essentially create clerical strawmen.

              Trump is not a moderator here, but moderators have multiple accounts and are part of a network to silence The Truth and serve as a honeypot. They stage fake arguments and fights and occasionally post commonly shared partial truth to gain credibility.

              Nothing about Racine is a psyop, and anyone who “keeps digging into Racine” can easily verify what you have already. There is much more. Racine is The “Root” and model for Agenda 21 and 2030 that leads to Eternal Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast enforced by 5G+ AI, Smart Cities, Resilient Communities and Community Policing. What is the logo for Monster energy drink and how do they ‘Unleash the Beast”?

              Did Trump and his advisors not know he made The Deal with a family of Luciferian pedophiles? Did Trump not know who he appointed to the Council of Advisors on Science and Technology? What are STEM programs? How are they connected to “Common Core”? Is Trump dumb, or is it an act? What is the secret of pro wrestling? Are you not entertained? Are you “enjoying the show”?

              <p>
               They have now obscured the fact that all of the TTT accounts were the only accounts banned for months? They realized people could look at the banned users list and instantly see that they were trying to cover something up, so they need to obscure and slide the banned users' list? Is this a new trend that is basically going to go on forever?
