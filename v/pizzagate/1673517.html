   Searching through Alefantis old posts, lead me to artist who takes inappropriate photos of men spanking young girls, half naked children, and has pedo symbols. Very Disturbing.

<p>I was searching through Alefantis old posts before his account went private - <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/146343979@N02/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/146343979@N02/</a> and happened to come across this post where jimmycomet posted a pic of a local photographer. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/146343979@N02/32251424912/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/146343979@N02/32251424912/</a> </p>
<p>The photographer, johncedmonds, commented back and mentioned he was wearing his favorite shirt in the pic, which to me...looked like pedo swirls, so I decided to look further into him. Johncedmonds posted a pic from an artist that just didn\'t sit right with me. <a href="http://archive.is/RXsx3">http://archive.is/RXsx3</a></p>
<p>He hash-tagged the artist, Angela Strassheim, and she seems to be a former pathologist photographer as under her works, she has photos of murder scenes and evidence, which is quite disturbing. What is also disturbing is that she also takes photos of children and some of her photos are just downright inappropriate and should be concerning to any parent. Here are some of the photos from Angela Strassheim:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/kWycp">http://archive.is/kWycp</a>  (man spanking young teen with no pants)  I was able to confirm the girl in the pic is 18 according to an article that posted an interview with her about her art. <a href="http://archive.is/9sVwV">http://archive.is/9sVwV</a>  However, I wouldn\'t be surprised if she was younger.
<a href="http://archive.is/WzE0F/image">http://archive.is/WzE0F/image</a> - (another man spanking a different young teen)  -  this teen looks like she has to be younger than 18 but cannot confirm.</p>

<p>There are quite a few other disturbing pics and it makes you wonder...how is this even art? I can\'t imagine parents allowing this &quot;Artist&quot; to take pics of their kids given the kind of artist she is. It\'s also very disturbing that this photographer who takes naked pics of adults, also takes provocative photos of young children. I just hope that her art doesn\'t go any further than what she puts out publicly.</p>

           The picture with Sir Elton, was with a girl named Sam Taylor Wood, another artist.

           The event that held some of Angelas inappropriate pics was a personal collection of Elton John and the event was hosted by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation.

            She reminds me of an MKultra artist. A lot of the women artist we have profiled do as well. These are shit pics and nowhere near "art". These are code. And that's exactly why these dirty sub humans love them so much. The child's leg with the heart in heart paper, it's actually her foot pointing to the hearts.

            Almost every one of those photographs a child's crotch is shown... but it's just art... nothing to see here. That, and the black/white cube business and most of the articles the coincidence detector is off the charts.

            Half way through, and I had to stop. THIS IS A POOR EXCUSE FOR ART. 
I worked for a women's boudoir photographer as a pose assistant. Every image is clearly provocative and soliciting children for pleasure. 
I'm literally sick. Society is being groomed as we speak. WHAT THE FLYING F*.

            I have young children and am even more alert than ever when it comes to their safety. 
I want to strangle these people.
This is not art.
This is obsession with children in a sexually way showing them in poses that are not innocent.

            I searched for Angela Strassheim a bit, and came upon this site, which is full of disturbing images of kids, as well as a very pro-pedo philosophy.  It's hard for me to tell if these people really believe what they're doing is OK, or if they know that they're evil and are just using this as some kind of cover. Not sure which of those explanations is more disgusting.

             I was able to get on and holy crap man. This website is putting up child porn. Literally. They are posting naked kids and have pictures of kids fondling each other. This is not ok at all. The FBI needs to shut this site down. Whats insane is that they try to justify themselves and what they are posting by saying its art and that if we see it as child pornography than we are basically the bad guys here. Fuckin nuts dude.

            Is that boy model in the teenage boy and girl shot (which I find pretty innocent tbh, sorry) Jacob Sartorious? Not sure if I'm spelling his name right. He's this annoying snapchat/instagram kid who made dumb vines and Music.ly shit and now he's touring like he's a shittier Justin Bieber. He started out pretty young, I would say 10? He always makes these winks and faces trying to be sexy like biting his lip, etc. A lot of young kids are doing that trying to follow him now and it's quite revolting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's an example pic. I can't find a shot of his side profile but if you see any of his videos you'll get a general feel for his face. Also, those ears.

            I always thought his weird messages/tweets/captions (whether by him or a marketing team) and flirty faces were just his parents trying to milk him for money, or his own insecurity issues, but what if he is part of some pedo ring?

            I couldn't finish viewing the rest of the photos they made me sick from the start, but I got the gist of it. Great work exposing this. These "artists" need to be called out, this shit is disgusting.

Not pink or red “Happy Valentine’s Day” hearts, but organs, removed from the body and photographed against black velvet. They are beautiful, printed to scale and, according to Strassheim, have never been exhibited."

I took it from this pic I believe was taken the same day

            They seem to like to hide behind the art...I've been hawkin twitter for the past couple of days searching heinous shit. My search history looks foul but, voyeur and creepshots were good leads. I had so many windows open after looking there.

           <p>
            Also, piggies (a term for men who like to be dom'd I guess?) hit some big ones There's also DDLB (dominant daddy little boy) DDLG (dominant daddy little girl)
           </p>
           <p>
            If I can get these links organized, the archived ones, I'll try and share. There were so many it was just...unreal

            I'm glad you found this. But I won't open any of the links. I want to remind people that we are making people angry by looking into Pizzagate. The last thing you need is for someone to accuse you of viewing child porn by looking at some things.

             I went to art school with a very talented girl (she was kinda nuts) who killed her parents for money. The book is Cold Kill but I don't like saying that publicly really. She would draw/paint all kinds of crazy stuff. I think her dad abused her. Twin book is Daddy's Girl, the Campbell Murder Case.

              I hate that this is most likely the truth.  I LOVE both of their music.  I think George Michael had one of the most beautiful voices ever.

                Interesting.  I know he was a sexaholic but I couldn't dig anything up on him and children.  I dug around after he died just to see if there was anything shady about his death.  I couldn't find anything.  I thought maybe he was victim, but still found nothing

            Some of the pics are artsy, some are obvious pedo targeted. It's a shame that this person seems to actually have talent and uses it in a bad way. Still not as disgusting as a lot of the stuff surrounding pizzagate. Anyone who has an "interest" in this artist is an obvious pedo. At least these particular prints.

             Supposedly the art is for money laundering etc. so it's a big tie-in.

              I had drawn this conclusion too, cuz I'll see some of these artists i've looked into while researching pedogate and think...how in the hell does that piece of crap sell for thousands and thousands of dollars. Either people have extremely bad taste and at the same time have a complete disregard for their finances or there could be laundering money.

               Yes, it's been discussed here on voat several times, maybe someone will chime in w/ further info. As we know, art can be very arbitrarily priced, it's subjective.

            Great find! Now connecting the dots! An old VOAT post about Victor Pinchuk, major Clinton donor, who's foundation funded that art based on the Elton John photo.

            Sam Taylor-Wood also is really important - she did work in Tony Podesta's house -

            but she's also tied to the White Cube gallery which is also suspicious because it hosts pedo art.

             Funny you mention the White Cube Gallery. I just came across that right before you mentioned it. The pic I posted with Sam Taylor Wood and Tony Podesta has a pic of another man named Jay Jopling. I went to his private instagram account, and under his name he has the whitecube website address. Wonder if maybe he runs WhiteCube.

             I came across Victor Pinchuk's name on the pic with Elton John, but didn't think anything of it. But wow...here's an article showing he has given up to $25 million to the Clinton Foundation!

             Anyone giving that amount of cash to the Clinton Foundation, definitely has something up their sleeves.

            It seems like a lot of his friends are twisted artists.  Please note the "teen boy with girl" photo.  I once had some insane guy tell me he lived on a sheep farm as a boy and he and his brother would put on rubber boots and go out and "do" the sheep.  He said they would put the ewe's back legs inside of his rain boots so as not to "get away."  I don't know if that is what this pic is suppose to be portraying, but rain boots on a sunny day with  sheep makes me wonder if that is not how it is "done."

             I freaked out when I saw that too, but as I thought about it more...I came to the conclusion the commenter was referring to the artist. As if she wanted to meet the artist. Not that it makes it better, someone fascinated by an artist who does borderline CP, but yeah...i'm thinking they were referring to the artist...I hope anyway.

               Not sure if you noticed, but the sir elton john pic was an event hosted by Victor Pinchuk. Someone posted earlier your voat submission

               and I recognized your name. Wanted to mention the connection since you had been doing some digging on him previously and wasn't sure if you had noticed.

                Thanks for the post.  I had seen that they were hobnobbing.  While Elton John definitely took the fast track to a Ukrainian baby when he wanted to adopt I'm not so sure that Pinchuk is in the surrogacy game.  While I think that post I made had some important info at the time I knew nothing about how prevalent organ harvesting was in Ukraine and how mothers were paid money to deliver early so they can traffick the organs, bones and tissue.  Killing newborns at hospitals to take stem cells from their bone marrow has actually been caught in Ukraine. Here is my topic on

                Don't get me wrong I think that there is rampant child trafficking abroad using surrogates and Ukraine is a hotspot but I don't think I was right about it in Pinchuk's case.  The picture does further show that his art world associates are goddam

            Has anyone really looked at, Marina the spirit  cooker closely? Look at her ring finger length,  her Adam's apple then look at her face. Really look at all of the pictures. I think this is something we've all overlooked and it's an important piece of the puzzle.

             Finger length is not 100% so is not a litmus test.  In fact, in my cases it is a red herring.

                he keeps his videos short, and explains pretty well how he's come to his conclusions, people share their commentary, he looks into those and reports on it. I watch him on the daily, and worry when he hasn't put out a video in awhile. He is on twitter too, truthleaks I believe

                 Webb is great but he stays away from MkUltra or Monarch sex slaves and programming through ritual abuse. For me, this could be the biggest secret that they really don't want people to find out about. Don't get me wrong, harvesting children's organs is evil as well, but the ritual abuse, seems they fall over themselves willing to do anything to hide this. Not saying all pedophilia involved this. Brownstone operations are another one they use, where they use children and say put a child in bed with a drugged up politician and take photos or video to bribe them.

              True. But think about it, these authorities/officials are so worried about their lives that they disregard the lives of these kids.
