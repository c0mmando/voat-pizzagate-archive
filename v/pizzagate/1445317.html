            would this not be construed as linking to CP? if in fact you did directly or indirectly pass a nude photo of a child on this site?
           </p>
           <p>
            I have always found this SRA witch hunt a conundrum, because if anybody actually found the smoking gun technically it would be illegal to see the evidence or share, ... its quite a paradox that the system has created.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anybody ever actually found a smoking gun, snuff photo, rape, .. and then posted for other investigators then this site would get shutdown in a nanosecond for CP violations,... What's a mother to do?
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll address the second item it comes from the video, its called a 'door' the kind of door you press on before it can open outward, the restaurant is small so they have door ( push/release latch)  that don't take up much space, but as the video ( two guys periscope the place YT ) shows, nobody can every find the head, ... is this a crime? NO
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
           </p>
           <p>
            The first item is a NADA anybody that clicks on a link of suggest CP could &amp; would expect an entrapment knock on the door, confiscation of all your assets and a free room and lodge with the FBI for a long time.

             Naked pictures of children are not illegal otherwise most parents would be criminals. Naked pictures of children in suggestive sexual poses are illegal.
            </p>
            <p>
             You have a point that it would be technically impossible to prove pizzagate here because the rules say you can't link to images of the child abuse being insinuated.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have built websites for retail operations and I would never link to a naked child under any circumstances. For a "child friendly" restaurant to do this is sick, even in the context of "its just a band". James Alefantis is clearly a deviant.

              Wow if that's not a honeypot of an argument. Let me guess send people to a site where they can view naked kids, and then get arrested and go before a judge and argue, "But judge parents view their naked children all the time"
             </p>
             <p>
              In the video James Alifantis had the same argument one that little girl, when interviewed outside comet-pizza ... the one with her hands tied on the table and the man standing behind her with a large erection in his pants ... "Oh her that was my god-daughter we were just playing games"
             </p>
             <p>
              ..
             </p>
             <p>
              I know that voat, twitter, reddit, 4chan all have a long history of CP, but really is this actually an argument that you give ppl? That so long as its not suggestive its all good? Sounds like more #Pizzagate urban myth insanity to me.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Last time I studied this stuff say for instance you had a photo developed the shop sees a naked child, there supposed to report, they knock on your door, its your kid, you have a damn good valid reason. Are you suggesting that its all good to possess photo's of other peoples naked children? I wonder how well that argument would hold up at a local cub scout meeting or girl scout fund-raising before 1,000 parents.
             </p>
             <p>
              "We have a new program for raising funds here at the girl scouts, we ask that your supply us with non-suggestive naked photos of your children and we'll sell them to perverts to hang on their walls, the GSA will make a fortune, even HRC has endorsed the PRGM", ... yep right.

               is correct.
              </p>
              <p>
               FEDERAL LAW states that simple pictures of children with no clothes on, as sick as it can be is not illegal or considered child pornography. There are a ton of nudist websites with pictures of underage kids on them as well as youtube videos, catalogs, photo books, etc.  If the picture is of a kid in a sexually suggestive pose or engaged in a sex act, it's child pornography.  I'm not making an educated guess on this. This is FACT.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you don't want to be believe me or SChalice, that's totally fine.  Better be safe than sorry but I do know for a fact that it's verifiable if you spend a few minutes to research.  In fact for a quick test, go to google images and simply search for "baby in bath" which is a very common picture that parents take.  If those pictures which show the full monty are there, chances are it's not child pornography.  But again, better be safe than sorry.

               Its a legal argument but one that is clearly subject to opinion just like the definition of pornography itself. I remember a case once of a photo developer that called the cops because parents had taken innocent pictures of their children in the bathtub. They were arrested and accused of bad things but won their case in the long run as they should have.

               "Are you suggesting that its all good to possess photo's of other peoples naked children?"
              </p>
              <p>
               I am not suggesting anything. Just stating the law in order to help you learn.
