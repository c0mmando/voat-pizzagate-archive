<p>NYC, New Jersey, &amp; Pennsylvania are the states one of the victims says Sandusky\'s pedo ring operated in.
It was a tristate ring.  So were any other pedos busted after Sandusky\'s arrest???</p>
<p>I didn\'t follow the Sandusky case closely.  I recall his son\'s recent arrest but that\'s all.  Oh and I recall the recent news of Paterno knowing Sandusky was a pedo yet keeping quiet all those years. ðŸ˜¡</p>
<p>Some say Sandusky RAN the ring with some of his Penn State boosters??</p>
<p>The victim saying he was prostituted as a child in a tri state ring says he was intended to be abused by Sandusky one night but Sandusky had a time restraint so he was introduced to Ed Savitz, a Philadelphia businessman, Democratic political booster and advocate for at-risk children.  He talks of Foglietta, a coach at a prep school in New York being involved too.</p>
<p>So I\'m wondering if these boosters and this Savitz with political ties goes deeper than just coaches?  Savitz was let off multiple times before his arrest.  Why?  We\'re the police told to let him off so the big kahunas wouldn\'t be exposed??</p>
<p>Here\'s some clips of old articles on Savitz and how he was let off a couple of times.  His being let off allowed him to abuse children for 12 more years!ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¡
Oh and he kept boys\' poop in pizza boxes!  Gross!

<p>From Wikipedia:
Edward Isadore &quot;Ed&quot; Savitz (also known as Uncle Eddie, Fast Eddie and Dr. Feel Good) (February 22, 1942 â€“ March 27, 1993) was an American businessman, largely an actuary who was arrested for paying thousands of young men for either engaging in anal and oral sex or for giving him dirty underwear and feces, which he kept in <strong>pizza boxes</strong> in his apartment.</p>',

            The victim Greg Bucceroni describes himself as a "pedophile hustler" and later became a child porn distributor for the Philly Mob. He is a well known liar.   Although he definitely knew Savitz and I don't doubt that he was abused by him.  But all of his other stories don't add up except maybe one, Ed Rendell.  He accused the ex-DA (and later Gov of PA) Ed Rendell of abuse, who recently headed Hillary's DNC convention in Philly.  He was sued over the claim and is no longer allowed to speak about it anymore.   Hmmmm.
           </p>
           <p>
            But now anytime a pedo-ring is exposed, there is Bucceroni claiming he was somehow abused too. He changed his story 3 times about Sandusky when he found out he couldn't get any money from his original stories.  His original stories didn't involve Sandusky touching him but then later changed it because the "pedophile hustler" finally realized that Sandusky abused him when he fondled his penis.   He also claimed he was abused by Larry King from the Franklin scandal.  You can hear all these claims from Bucceroni himself in these videos below.  Just remember, the Savitz stories are real and the rest... well you can decide for yourself.

           <p>
            EDIT: If you want to know the real pedo-ring in PA then look who gave biggest money donations to Sandusky's second mile:
           </p>
           <p>
            1.) Chief executive of U.S. Steel:
            <a href="http://cdn3.sportngin.com/attachments/photo/6982/4883/John_P._Surma_large.jpg">
             John P. Surma
            </a>
            Biggest donor. Forced himself into the head position of the PSU Board of Trustees(BOT) immediately following the Sandusky scandal being printed in the newspaper.  He would keep Paterno from speaking to the press while PSU had an "investigation".
           </p>
           <p>
            2.) CEO of Merck:
            <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Kenneth_C._Frazier.jpg">
             Ken Frazier
            </a>
            2nd biggest donor.  Demanded that only he lead the Sandusky investigation for the PSU Board of Trustees and paid Louis Freeh $7+ Million to write a report clearing all PSU BOT members.  (Later the "Freeh Report" was thoroughly debunked.)

            <p>
             I don't know how but somehow my research today lead me to Cohn and his pedo blackmail rings.  It's all there for everyone to see.  It's maddening that for years - decades, really - people have been knowing about these pedo blackmail rings and the farm etc yet nothing has been done :(

             I remember  reading  something about "lobster sex" or something like that when looking up about JP and it was really disgusting.  Those people are must beyond words.  The stuff they think up and find enticing boggles the mind.  Sick Vermin.

            I read about Savitz before and he is about as disgusting as it gets.  Lying was rampant and we know Paterno always knew what was going on and he died because they were afraid he would spill the beans.  Hillary and family is deeply involved with Penn State.  Her father went there and so did her brother.  She still watches the games and makes large donations.  You can bet she knows the whole story, because she is somehow involved.  Money to be made, you know.   I believe that it is a huge operation and that Jared Fogel may also be part of it.  That may never come out, but would it not be a hot mess if it did?

              Could Merke be complicit in supplying the drugs that are used to medicate these kids during the raping by the pedo elites and Sandusky's pedo ring?  They do use drugs to make these children compliant and to keep them from remembering the horrific acts.

               I agree with that speculation.  It's clear that Merke could tap into a steady supply of test subjects, as well.  What was going on with Sandusky and the Penn State ring is still occurring. How could the CEO of Merke have enough time to lead the investigation?  Frazier is a cleaner and a cover upper.

              I have not seen a write up on his ties, but have read on here that people have intimated he had connections that the fact that the heads of Subway tried to keep it quiet and knew about his involvement.  Are they maybe involved, like some pizza chains are too?  Idk, but there are rat lines in the pedo world just like the drug world.

              Who knows what they are threatening them with to keep them quiet.  Maybe he will try to appeal and will be given a shorter sentence.  These people are valuable to the elites.
