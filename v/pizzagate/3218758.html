            <p>
             What I finally figured out ... or interpreted ... is he was driving a car and turned where he shouldn't have been able to go. So he "forced" the car through traffic to get to the bride.

              He was on the phone to a friend when he heard a loud bang. He told the person he thought his tire blew out. His friend kept him on the phone for more than a hour. He told that person that he'd done something to turn his financial situation around but it turned out being something he regretted.  Perhaps they knew his vulnerability and easy access point was money, and they used it to bribe him with something he then regretted.

               Well, it had to be pretty bad. I mean, he had lots of baggage to begin with that his fans/followers forgave. So if he sold drugs ... or was dropped them off ... can't see being that upset. If it were taped, he might be sent to prison, but out in La La Land, that's doubtful. And he did say he was trapped by someone he trusted so, yeah, this person set him up and he took the bait.

               You know, the only thing the cabal hates is squealers. It's about the only thing that'll get an elite cabal member killed. So did he talk ... for money ... ?!!!

              I don't follow media personalities so truth be told, I had not heard of him until today.  From what little I heard in that periscope he sounds like a cult member or former cult member or a druggie, a lot of talk, but not saying much to the broad audience.  Maybe drugs used to 'stay in the moment'. Maybe someone convinced him to take a bank shot at being reincarnated.

               And he said he wasn't being blackmailed. But if he just did it, maybe he was blackmailed?

               Yeah, I don't know. I don't. He always seemed a complete scammy person, but I guess I don't like seeing people on going underwater.

             Like, what the actual fuck?
I never saw him as disinfo, but I did see plenty of poor arguments against him. He didn't always reveal info to my liking, but he was a fucking good &amp; honest guy, that much was clear. Didn't watch everything he streamed, much of it was off-topic or indirect conversations, but his chat with Fiona Barnett was some of the best stuff I've seen.

             This is crazy. He talked about this happening, he even said he'd never off himself. Obviously he had read &amp; seen all the stories already, he knew he could be targeted. Typically, this will just get pushed to the side, and very few outlets will point out how he was the guy who started naming everyone, and that his death now doesn't seem so quash those accusations.

             I didn't think things would go well, though. Just had that feeling.
