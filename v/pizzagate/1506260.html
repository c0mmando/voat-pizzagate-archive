<p>Well I used the software/tool to track shipping container boats across the Atlantic, and started noticing something after about an initial 20 minute browsing of different shipping container barges coming to America. I noticed a disproportionate number of Turkish shipping barges more so than anything else, so that is what led me into this rabbit hole. I saw that they were coming into two major ports, in fact two of the bigger major ports of America, NYC and Charleston, SC. There were some going to Miami and the Caribbean but not like they were with the two aforementioned cities. So I checked where they were coming out of, Istanbul and Izmir, Turkey. Now Izmir, I thought ok, this is a coastal city so that makes perfect sense, but Istanbul? Something did not sit well with me, so I started searching via Duck Duck Go about Turkish Human Trafficking, when I found this little nugget:</p>

I saw this and started thinking about other major ports within the Mediterranean and so I started going along Google Maps to check out short destinations from Turkey to other ports in that part of the world, and found lo and behold that Benghazi to Izmir Turkey via shipping container is only 2 days away if you stop off in Crete as a halfway point.

             But Greek taverns are filled with terrible rumors. Drunken fishermen pounding their fists on the wooden tables and swear:
Yes Yes! We saw! With my own eyes! Children and adults with sewn bellies! They disemboweled organs there, in Turkey, and then traffickers dumped the bodies in international waters, hoping the fish and salt finish the dirty work.

              I would not be surprised. Since Alefantis is then it would definitely be easy to prove. There must be sex trafficking news from Turkey. I wonder if the killing of the Russian Amb. was connected. Did he know something and was about to spill the beans?  No proof just wondering.

              I personally think that now, Podesta and Alefantis go over to Turkey and are meeting with Daesh/ISIS, to procure the victims, then they are transported via trucks to Turkey, shipped in a shipping container. My dad was actually able to find that you could rent out a whole shipping container barge from Turkey to America for 500 dollars. They are then moved over to here, where they are shipped to these slave auctions in the South, in New York City and then migrated all over the United States. The top choice and best looking ones could be made into Presidential Models, and the babies that survived are being sacrificed unfortunately. I do know that Green and Blue eyes really go for top dollar in the ISIS human slave market, I believe either Breitbart or Huff Po wrote a piece on that a while back.

              I also listen to this guy about the Deep Web, Takedownman, who yes is a very controversial and suspect person, but he's put out some really good videos about red rooms. Now I'm not sure how the dots are connected, but I think somehow these Red rooms, or actual killing experiments that are streamed on the Dark Web, are somehow tied into this as well. I've been noticing for weeks that some major puzzle pieces are all connected.

              As a Jew, this makes me extremely angry that my own people are a part of this, as I have a ton of family in Israel, in the Tel Aviv/Ashkelon/Golan Heights area.

            IIRC a lot of Mediterranean countries have significant shipping, so that probably isn't a concern. The other stuff, though...

             Well at least the point in time when I was using that boat tracker, I counted no less than 5 Turkish shipping barges to every 1 of Greece. It was just very strange and stood out to me at least.
