            Oh, they're absolutely scrubbing stories! So glad you posted this. I personally found this out a few times. The last one was when I did some digging on Proposition K, the failed 2008 amendment that would legalize prostitution. Almost all the links that showed were negative and urged voters to vote no. They gave particulars on why. I had to dig deep to find Pelosi's name and her Dem group attached to the writing of this proposition. I posted the story. Well, a couple of weeks later, the dems did legalize child prostitution. I went to grab one of the stories that came up so generously before so I could show people all the horrendous negatives and found the negative stories were scrubbed! All that came up were thank you for the sex worker coalition that advanced the agenda for so many people voting for the failed attempt. I was shocked so I'm glad you're posting this. Someone is taking note of what we're doing so please archive everything. I should have saved every one of those blogs, but didn't. There were so many ... hundreds ... and poof! They were gone and didn't come up in the search. I found the same thing happening with Podesta's cousin. It's very difficult to find anything about her because the info is hidden. You have to do these wild searches, and when you do see something, the link won't open. After fiddling around with one link, i found that extra letters had been added. Once you delete the letters, the link does open. Never saw this happen before.

            Nothing was deleted or "scrubbed" from Google. Your link on the David Icke forum is simply broken, most likely because the text was copy-pasted from some other forum that truncates URLs.

            There needs to be some kind of study or research into this kind of activity on Wikipedia. There is a lot of research going on at the moment into how information is propagated on the internet, and how people decide which information is truthful, which sources are authoritative etc. I know some people who work in that area and will try to get them interested in this whole phenomenon - academic studies are often a good way of getting solid sources and also getting news articles. I genuinely don't think its the case that all the journalists working for these major news organisations are trying to cover this up deliberately, I think the vast majority of them are in the bubble/echo chamber and genuinely believe that it's all just a nonsense conspiracy theory, and are too afraid of being mocked or losing social credibility among their peers or with their boss etc to even consider taking it seriously and looking into it. So I think if there is a way of getting some journalists to actually take it seriously then there is a chance that, even if their editors won't let them publish about it, that they would write about it in their personal blogs etc, which would be good if they have somewhat of a following.

            The reason for WikiPedia and Facebook / Twitter / Google liberal globalist domination is to force accumulated knowledge out of print form or open source into intellectual gulags and discussion into ghettoes. People become accustomed to them, totally invested in them, and they become ubiquitous by destroying or buying up competitors.  Once a control grid is set up you then have a situation where Globalist Billionaires control the most powerful 'resource' in the world: information - its dissemination (think FakeNews), discussion and debate, and accumulated knowledge.

             Also, amazon is in that group.  Very soon you will only be able to buy books through them and then books will be obsolete.   Unilever, another one...they own so much it's unbelievable.  I avoid both.

            In the UK I had found if you use the P word you won't get as much with the exception of the daily mail who turn their hate to include these people.  However I have found if you use the phrase 'abuse scandal' this got me more hits. For example the Rotherham case is labeled as 'Rotherham Abuse Scandal' I got many more hits by altering my search language.  I have some links to Rotherham archived and also Norway if you want them?

             One explanation may be that pedophilia doesn't imply abuse (just desire), whereas the horrors happen at the point of abuse.

             Hmm that's interesting. I wonder why they are doing that. Is it to not use triggering/offensive language, or they don't want to be sued for liebel? Because if they are going to bring it up, they probably want people to see it, and a keyword like "pedophile" would be the best way to get clicks.

              I think because its still considered a taboo word and most people still refer to this act as kiddy fiddling, or sexual perverts, the p word is rarely used in face to face exchanges.  Also, the UK is one of the most watched nations, with CCTV everywhere that also listen in. People are guarded talking about such things outside and I've heard the term 'he's a file' meaning a pedophile to speak about such things.

               I overheard a convesation once where some street involved person was trying to explain to a Christian homeless worker why "goof" is not a word you want to be using...

            I'm pulling this out of my memory bank, and can't remember how old the story is. I remember reading about how Google CEO (Alphabet CEO now) Eric Schmidt was in an "open relationship" with his wife or girlfriend, and that he had a sound-proofed apartment where he'd take his mistresses to have sex.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll try to research this more tomorrow. It may have been in a magazine that I read it, I can't remember. It was definitely at least a couple years before he became CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet I think. I doubt you'll be able to find it using Google.
