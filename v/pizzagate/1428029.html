            It would be great to get some comments from a former worker at Comet Ping Pong.
           </p>
           <p>
            One question would be did you notice anything that my suggest child abuse involving the people there?  What did you make of the art work?  Did you see any of the internet sites and pictures with children in provocative poses?  Are there any secret rooms, etc.?
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess this could be all case very bad or strange tastes in art but I tend to think its more.  Getting an insider to talk would be interesting.

            On Comet's homepage it says 'bathrooms hidden behind secret panels'. What is that supposed to mean?

            He was probably hired because he was willing to take a cock or rape a child. No need to talk to that criminal.
