<p>RELEVANCE: Kent is a county in the UK with a number of shipyards.  A recent article highlights the issues with sex trafficking: <a href="http://www.bromleytimes.co.uk/news/sex-trafficker-jailed-after-forcing-lithuanian-women-to-work-as-prostitutes-in-north-kent-1-5128912">Sex trafficker jailed after forcing Lithuanian women to work as prostitutes in north Kent</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Romas Drulia fled the country in 2015 after trafficking two Lithuanian women into the country and forcing them to become prostitutes.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old forced them to pay rent on the brothel they worked in and took a substantial cut on their earnings, while working as part of a gang which offered jobs luring women into joining the sex trade.</p>
<p>While on the run, officers continued their investigation, gathering phone evidence and witness testimony to prove his guilt of running <strong>brothels in Rochester</strong>, Gillingham, Chatham and Maidstone.</p>

            The NCH later changed it’s name to Action for Children, presumably because NCH had become notorious.
