            The reviews on this childcare rating site are mostly 5 star, promotional,  and frankly look fake ("they even potty train!!!") - except for this one :

            “The owner, Carla Faith was not arrested.” I hope to Hod they are holding her for questioning. This gives me a sick feeling.  Something just isn’t right here. Possible LE involvement? Idk but it stinks.

            Looked up the business and it said permanently closed. Wondering if they moved or not, because if not, this could be a really big story to wake some of the retards up. Most lefties seem to think pedos just like teenagers, which is bad obviously, but most don’t know about the baby rape. Or if they do, they don’t realize how bad things really are.

            Wow.  And things like this are why my kids were never in a daycare setting.  NEVER.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that the owner is not saying anything leads me to think there is something more going on.  As for the employees, I don't know why THEY didn't alert anyone if they weren't involved with anything nefarious!  So, I'm thinking they were comped to not spill the beans.  There was something going on there.  Unless, some of the complaints really were from the employees???

            Colorado Springs Police are reporting they were executing a welfare check at a Colorado Springs day care, leading them to the owner's house where they found a "false wall" and 26 children in the basement. All of the kids found were younger than three.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was at  Play Mountain Place on Wednesday. They had received multiple complaints that the facility was housing more children in their care than their license permitted. When officers arrived  there were no children inside. Officers tried to contact
           </p>
           <p>
            the owner at her residence.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The owner, identified as 58-year-old Carla Faith, refused to cooperate with officers; however, officers could hear the noises of children coming from her home," Lt. James Sokolik with the Colorado Springs Police Department wrote in a release. "During their investigation, officers found a false wall that led to the home’s basement. When officers walked down the stairs, they located two adults and 26 kids inside a finished basement, all of who were under the age of three-years-old. Officers immediately began working with [The Colorado Department of Human Services] to release the children back to their parents."
           </p>
           <p>
            The owner, Carla Faith, was not arrested. Police are reporting detective plan to pursue "appropriate" charges. It isn't clear if the other two employees found in the basement will face charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            Police worked alongside the Colorado Depart of Human Services in this investigation. The Crimes Against Children Unit for the Colorado Springs Police Depart took over the criminal part of the investigation while licensing matters are being handled by the state DHS. A spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Human Services said  a legal team supressed all records for the day care off their website. The department is suspending the facility's licensing status.
           </p>
           <p>
            News spoke to multiple parents who now have to search for a new caretaker. Several people heard the news through friends.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I just have this horrible feeling in my stomach,  "I’m really hoping nothing more nefarious has been going on and that in fact,
           </p>
           <p>
            it is an overcrowding issue which is bad enough as it is. I wouldn’t have brought him there knowing that."
           </p>
           <p>
            Others are hoping the licensing issue is a quick fix for the owner. denial
           </p>
           <p>
            why is the owner refusing to cooperate if nothing he did was wrong???
           </p>
           <p>
            love those folks in denial, waitng fir it to reopen!
           </p>
           <p>
            At 26 kids they were not being watched thats for sure
           </p>
           <p>
            What was he doing hiding kids in the basement? Making movies, molesting?
           </p>
           <p>
