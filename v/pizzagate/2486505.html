            Any investigating of King should include W Bu$$et.  King was involved in the Franklin Credit Union debacle.  He was mentored by  Susan Bu$$et.

           <p>
            Larry King (not THAT one), the founder of Nebraska's notorious Franklin Credit Union. King was, in the mid-'80s, Nebraska's most prominent Black Republican. He sang the national anthem at the 1984 and 1988 Republican National Conventions, was a pal of George HW Bush (who was recognized at a number of King's "parties"), laundered Iran/Contra money, ran a pedophile ring which catered to elites (he flew young boys and girls all over the country, including many times to Washington), and subjected children to satanic ritual abuse. He's behind bars now, and recently lost a million dollar lawsuit by one of "his" boys for years of torture and exploitation.
           </p>
           <p>
            From The Franklin Cover-Up by former Nebraska State Senator John DeCamp:
           </p>
           <p>
            "One of King's earliest boosters was the wife of a man with an unrivaled reputation for shrewed investments - Warren Buffett.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Backing from Buffett's socialite wife, Susie, came early in the rise of Larry King. Susie Buffett was a volunteer at the credit union in the early days. According to the Lincoln Journal-Star of March 19, 1989, King 'liked to tell the story of a woman coming to the credit union to see him and being told to return at 7:00 the next morning because he was so busy. The woman was Susie Buffett, wife of billionaire Warren Buffett, and she did come back to offer her help at the credit union.' For years, it has been part of Larry King lore in Omaha, that the Buffett's hosted a tenth wedding anniversary party for him and Alice."
           </p>
           <p>
            Warren Buffett lives with a woman named Astrid Menks. The Wall Street Journal reported that he met her in 1977 when Susie brought her home from the nightclub where Menks was a waitress, called The French Cafe. The French Cafe, a number of King's "children" testified, was also the scene of a number of "parties" at which they were assaulted and raped by wealthy and prominent citizens of Omaha.
           </p>
           <p>
            King's wife was an early supporter of the credit union; Warren was on the board of FirsTier Financial, which laundered $50 million of Franklin's funds; the Buffett's hosted the Kings' 10th wedding anniversary; King hosted a fundraiser for Buffett's son Howard when he ran for county commissioner; Buffett's companion was a waitress at nightclub used as a site for King's orgies; a former Omaha city employee reported that when King was crowed "Queen" at the club The Max, Buffett was his escort.
Here's a transcription from The Franklin Cover-Up, page 176:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Nelly first brought up Bush in 1986, when she told Julie Walters about the sex parties she was flown to in Washington and Chicago. She saw Bush at two of these parties, she said, one in each city.   "Nelly also told Walters that one frequent party-goer with King was a boy named 'Brent,' the one who was "flown to another city somewhere" after a falling out with King. Walters did not have the time to cross-check this information with the life of Brandt Thomas, the Boys Town resident who had moved in with Larry King. Franklin credit union files contained a letter signed by King, in his capacity as Youth Affairs Committee advisor for the National Black Republican Council, listing Thomas as one of two national contact people for NBRC campus chapters.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Three years later, with an investigation of abuse by King and the Webbs finally underway, Nelly was interviewed again. Speaking to Franklin committee detective Jerry Lowe, she repeated her account of the Chicago party, and said that Bush and the two men he arrived with appeared to have left the affair with a young black man she called 'Bandit.'
           </p>
           <p>
            "Bush's name surfaced again in Lowe's May 1989 review of reports by Thomas Vlahoulis from the state attorney general's office: "both Kimberly and Nelly brought up the name of George Bush and indicated that they had both met him." There is a psychologist in Omaha who used to work for the CIA. In response to a direct question by an Omaha psychiatrist regarding George Bush's private life, this psychologist reported hearing rumors when Bush was head of the CIA, that correspond directly with the inferences made by Nelly Webb, and commented to the psychiatrist, 'But how do you investigate your boss?'"
           </p>
           <p>
            Craig Spence, a conservative lobbyist and associate of King's who also pimped young boys in Washington and organized the midnight tours of the White House through the VP's office, was found suicided shortly after the story broke. Such as it did.
           </p>
           <p>
            Susan Buffett was actively involved in charities and causes such as civil rights, abortion rights and population control.   That baton has now been passed to Warren and daughter Susan.
