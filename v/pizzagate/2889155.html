             Carl Beech was abused by his father and
a paedophile ring from the age of 7 until 15.
During his adult life, he has worked for 25 years
in the National Health Service in the UK and
more recently as a volunteer with ChildLine.
Mr. Beech has presented at national and
international conferences. Now that he has
come to terms with his own past, he would
like to share his experiences to raise the profile
for male survivors and encourage others who
have yet to start their recovery journey.

            This is a poem that Carl Beech wrote:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The boy I use to be: I was a frightened, lonely boy, no one cared.  A sweet in a bag to be handed out and shared. They came in the night and they came in the day. Myself and my friend were always their prey. We were broken, isolated, we were their property. Used and abused, just a shared commodity. I endured the humiliation and the pain. The hurt, the guilt, the fear and the shame. I was hit a lot, it broke my body. Then the kissing, touching, to them I was nobody. The hurt me and broke me each time I was raped. But in my mind I was elsewhere, trying to escape. My bruises and injuries were there for all to see. My teachers, doctors, even my mum did not help me. Years of hell I had to survive. But somehow I made it, I'm her and I'm alive. It's been years since the last assault. Hiding the secret, thinking it was my fault. I was small and helpless, there was nothing I could have done. I had to do as I was told whilst they had their fun. But they had the power, the power over me. I was trapped, locked in and they held the key. It's now time to use the H word, a powerful word HATE. I would like to say it to their face, but it's now too late. I HATE what they did to me, I HATE what they made me do. I HATE the remembering, reliving but I HATE the secrets too. I HATE the flashbacks, the nightmares after all these years. I HATE the pain, the guilt, the shame and the tears. It's a long, bumpy and painful road to drive. But I have to do it if I want to thrive. Thinking about it all burns in my heart. But writing it down for me is a start. The abuse has left me with issues to resolve. But I will persevere until the problems solved.
            </p>

            I read much about this case when ‘Nick’ stepped forward.  I believed him, and indeed his testimony pretty much mirrors that of other witnesses/victims which leads me to think he was telling the truth and that they got to him somehow.  I wonder exactly what they did to undermine his evidence and deem him non credible.

            Edward Heath fixed it for Jimmy Savile to receive OBE and attended Paedophile Information Exchange meetings
           </p>
           <p>
            Edward Heath backed ­paedophile Jimmy Savile for a royal honour – two years after the previous Prime Minister warned the Queen against it, reports the Sunday People.
           </p>
           <p>
            Savile was passed over for an MBE a month before the former Conservative leader moved into No10, the Sunday People can reveal.
           </p>
           <p>
            But less than two years after Heath took office, the TV presenter – exposed after his death as a serial child-sex abuser – was awarded the HIGHER honour of an OBE.
           </p>
           <p>
            Heath later appeared on Savile’s BBC TV show Jim’ll Fix It when it was one of the nation’s favourites.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can also reveal that Heath, under investigation by seven police forces over child abuse claims, was present at more than half a dozen Westminster meetings of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange.
