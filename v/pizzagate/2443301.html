            Why don't we MARCH FOR THEIR LIES?
           </p>
           <p>
            INVESTIGATE MARCH "FOR OUR LIVES FOUNDATION!"
 This guy should be researched. He has connections all over. Foreign connections? In my opinion, he's using his son and some other teens from the high school to front a new GUN CONTROL FOUNDATION. Shades of the Clinton Foundation which was started off of charity donations after the Haiti earthquake:
"Parkland Students Have Raised $3.5M for Gun Control"
"To help fund a national gun-control movement, a small group of South Florida students who survived the worst high school shooting in U.S. history set up a modest website Sunday and created a GoFundMe account to pursue an ambitious goal: raise $1 million."
"The money has poured in from all over the country, escalating to seven figures before the young organizers could even set up a foundation to fund.
By Tuesday, the pot was nearing $1.5 million. And then four celebrities committed a half-million dollars each.
With $3.5 million suddenly at their disposal, this core group of roughly 20 teenagers — still grieving the loss of 17 classmates and school mentors — has enough money to fund a national march and a revolution. They’re now beginning to consider the long game: a lasting movement to keep the pressure on pro-gun politicians and the National Rifle Association."
"Teenagers like Cameron Kasky, Emma Gonzalez, Alex Wind and David Hogg — all of whom have received enormous media attention since the shooting — seized a moment when the country was mesmerized in horror and called for action."
“That’s where the money is going,” Jeff Kasky said. “They’re being directed by people with knowledge of how to responsibly spend this money and it’s going to be very transparent. Every penny is going to be accounted for.”
"With the help of a celebrity, Kasky said the group has brought in some attorneys, some administrative help and a public relations firm, 42 West. This week, they expect to establish the March for Our Lives Foundation in order to deposit all donations to the cause."

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Cameron Kasky's GOfundme: "Half of the funds raised on this GoFundMe will go toward the March For Our Lives Action Fund, a 501c4 that will cover expenses associated with the march taking place in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, March 24th."
"The other half of the funding raised on this GoFundMe will provide relief and financial support to the victims and families of the horrific shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School via the Broward Education Foundation ."

             https://www.gofundme.com/8psm8-march-for-our-lives
            </a>
            MY COMMENT: The victims were teens. What kind of "relief" will this money buy? Were the victims financially supporting their families? What kind of "financial support" is needed? The state of Florida is paying for the victim's funerals. WHY ARE THEY MONETIZING THIS TRAGEDY? SICK SICK SICK!
"With the emergence of celebrity benefactors, the march has suddenly developed Hollywood ties. But despite conspiracy theories fostered by far-right blogs and pundits that liberal gun control groups are using Parkland survivors as pawns for their cause, the #NeverEnough movement has so far been an organic, loosely organized phenomenon."

            More info on Parkland shooting:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Of the 17 confirmed deaths, the rabbis believe that at least six were Jewish, including an adult security guard. Several of those killed were participants at the Chabad centers in Parkland or nearby Coral Springs. Biston says that Chabad rabbis have been working closely with Broward County SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL (emphasis mine), who is a congregant at Chabad, to ensure that the bodies of the Jewish dead are released for burial as soon as possible in accordance with Jewish tradition.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chabad has also enlisted the help of several therapists who have volunteered to counsel students. Observant Jews, they are uniquely positioned to provide both clinical and religious support."
           </p>
           <p>
            "This morning, several teens who had survived the massacre came to Chabad to recite the Hagomel blessing of thanksgiving at the Torah. One of them had filmed the shooting."

            I believe that there must be a connection between Kasky and the drama teacher at the high school.
           </p>
           <p>
            the drama teacher owns a dodgy pre-school with some pretty telling 1-star/5-star ratings.

            "Kasky's FBI dad to a dodgy Foster Child Agency "
Be careful. He ran a private ADOPTION agency(ies). Nancy's main focus before her death was DFCS, the state foster care agency. The defunct One World Adoption Agency located in Sugar Hill, Georgia was not in her senate district. I do not say it is impossible that she was somehow involved with this, but you need connecting evidence. Thanks for bringing Nancy's work to the attention of many. I think the video was finally made public, but I don't have the link.

             cheers dude. Im a bit sloppy with the evidence these days, i figure fuck it theres already enough evidence available for it to be taken off our hands and handled by the officials if they were decent people

              Lawyer, policeman, private adoption in Georgia. He was trying to look like a local in the photo I saw, but he looked more like a common clayeater. The woman in the passenger seat was trying to shield her face. You are right in that there is something there. Trust your instincts on that one.

CWS CHECKS BOXES OF ON A FORM WELFARE &amp; INSTITUTIONS CODES : A,B,C,D,E, F REMEMBER YOU ARE THE ALEDGED ABUSER SO THEY CANT TELL YOU WHERE YOUR OWN CHILD IS TAKEN. THEY LIKE TO DO THIS ON FRIDAYS BE
CAUSE THAT GIVES THESE CRIMINALS FRIDAY ,SATURDAY ,SUNDAY ,THEN THE 72 HOUR CLOCK STARTS ON MONDAY UNTIL THEY MUST GIVE A SECRET CIVIL DETENTION HEARING IN JUVENILE COURT . YOU ARE DENIED ALL CONTACT EVEN IF YOUR CHILD IS A INFANT . PARENT IS NOT ALLOWED TO SPEAK AT ALL. THEY PUT THE CWS LIAR ON THE STAND TO LIE FABRICATE EVIDENCE OF ABUSE TO REMOVE TERMINATE PARENTAL RIGHTS AND CHILD TRAFFICK OUR STOLEN CHILDREN. ALL LEVELS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EVERY LEVEL OF JUDICIARY ARE INVOLVED IN THE COVER-UP OF THESE HORRIFIC CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN.
