            You have a lot to learn. You are basically on par with an ignorant simpleton. Your mind is certainly "fertile" ground. Perhaps you had better learn the truth about your own people's history first. I assume you are a Black American who entered the Prince Hall Lodge? I even sense that you may be a Muslim. Not too far off I presume?

            Okay, the first thing you say is that they aren't Negroes now you show this video which states they are? Make up your mind.

            He is talking about the Zealot cult who left Judea after the destruction of the second Temple in 70AD. That is where we get the term religious Zealot from, because the Romans had so many problems controlling them. While other tribes would yield and become Roman the Zealots revolted. The Romans retaliated and destroyed the Temple casting them out of Judea. Those who left went many places. Some went to Europe. Most went to Persia to be with other Jews who had been expelled in the destruction of the first Temple by the Greeks. So a tiny percentage went to Africa with the Arabs and this guy is talking about their descendants. There were large Jewish tribes in Arabia at the time of Muhammad (7th century) because of this. They would later go down the East coast of Africa with the Arabs trading slaves.
           </p>
           <p>
            You need to focus man. You are all over the place. Don't start with what you want to be true. Let the evidence take you to the truth. This guy in the first part of the video can't be trusted. He wants Black Americans to help the Jews against White America. He is a manipulator. His talk is complete Bullshit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those people in South Africa have Jewish Y chromosome from the line of Aaron are more likely due to Jews who helped the Arabs in the slave trade. The Arabs controlled the Black slave trade for the last 4000 years. Europeans only got into the African slave trade for less than 100 years ending in 1865. In the 1700's, it was forbidden for a Muslim to trade on equal terms with a non-Muslim who not a Dhimmi (a semi-slave subject of an Islamic nation). Therefore, It was forbidden by Allah (Haraam) for Muslims to sell anything to a free Christian. Therefore, Dhimmi Jews were used as middle men in the trade. South Africa was a major port for the Atlantic Slave Trade since most slaves were from the Eastern coast of Africa brought by Arab Muslims to Jewish slave traders in South Africa. Those Jews had sex with their slave women leading to the transmission of the Aaronic Y chromosome.

            From your own source; All the languages are Arab in origin. Those languages are all Arab/Jewish.
           </p>
           <p>
            Afro-Asiatic has nothing to do with Sub-Saharan African people. In ancient times (before 400AD) all of North Africa was Indo-European and became heavily Arab only after the Islamic Conquests in the 7th Century. However, Arabs and Indo-Europeans have been mixing for millennia in the region. Europeans themselves are Persian in origin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sub-Saharan Africans were cut off from the rest of the world by the Sahara desert. That is why they have a distinct gene pool while Arabs, Asians and Europeans are all mixed together.
           </p>
           <p>
            The population of Sub-Saharan Africa was only a few million before the Colonization period of the 1800's. The population of Black Africans only increased after colonization for obvious reasons.

            So you say you have "truth" but then state that it isn't convincing enough for me to take it seriously. That is literally the same as having no proof whatsoever and therefore no "truth". The fact you are so sensitive to being criticized further calls into question your position. Weak. I think I will just hang out here and shit talk you a while longer because it pleases me. If you actually had anything worth saying you would have said it.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             the real Semite is the Asiatic Black Man
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            That is the most ridiculous statement I have ever heard. The Old Testament (OT), the Torah, the Talmud, and Cabala all have disparaging accounts for black skinned people as the "sons of Ham" who's descendants were cursed by God because of Ham's sin against his father Noah. In one account Noah being drunk on wine is raped by Ham which gives light to the other verses. According to all Semitic texts, Shem is the father of the Semites; all Arabs and Jews come from his line which never intersects with Ham's because Ham was banished. The curse follows them and their descendants forever. All throughout Semitic text you can find time and again disparaging remarks about Blacks. If these text are actually "Holy or Divine" then that shows God himself has a deeply held hatred for Black Africans. I didn't write it. It's your "Holy" book.
           </p>
           <p>
            Further, there has never been a skeletal remains of an African found in the Near East. Never. You would think that if the ancient Semites were Black the would have left some evidence. Even a non-scientist can easily see the differences between African skeletons and Asian/European skeletons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tell you what; one more try. Give me what you got and we'll see if you actually have any "truth".

            That is stupid. Solomon was Indo-European. Even the Queen of Sheba was likely Arab however she could have been  Indo-European too. Literally none of the people in the OT were Black African. You are 100% wrong. Even Jesus was described by the Romans as having dirty blond hair and grey blue eyes in non-biblical references and letters. Most people in Judea at that time were Indo-European. They weren't even the Arabs you see there today. The Arab Conquest would not occur for another 700 years. Orient literally means the east; the place of the rising sun. The Grand Orient is a reference to the sun. Were you sleeping though all those rituals. They all have to do with the sun!

             What Roman texts are you referring to? There's no real historical evidence of Christ existing in the first place, so I would like to see sources.

              That isn't true. There are a number of letters, but the church doesn't want them to be focused on because they basically prove he was just a man among many different so called "prophets". The
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_of_Lentulus">
               Letters of Lentulus
              </a>
              are one set, but they are considered apocryphal. The Letters between the Flavians
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavian_dynasty">
               a powerful Roman Dynasty which later ruled Rome
              </a>
              and Judean government officials like Pontius Pilate. Plus describe him similarly too, War of the Jews by Josephus (a Roman historian who lived at the time of Christ in Judea) has a description of Christ which is almost the same.
             </p>
             <p>
              In almost every account they describe him as being a nuisance like every other leader of the many sects in Judea. Further, there is some question as to their authenticity too.

            Yes, he knows! It's why he decided to take this abuse dumped on him. How many people would have done that? I admire and respect him for doing it, knowing what he was in for, and doing it anyway!

            In trumps speech to the CIA he refers to Column’s… that CIA needs a bigger room, a good architect, and a design WITHOUT Columns, and then says you know what I mean…
Cued up to the Colum’s part

            Trump is a master at sending out covert messages ;-)
A 5th Column is any group of people who undermine a larger group see the Wikipedia page
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column
            </a>
            so think Deep state, shadow government ect…
So basically he let the rank and file know that he’s coming in to clean up the CIA, the CIA will work for the people again and not a shadowy group of elites ;-)

            I don't want to circlejerk to trump, but his voter fraud maneuver was sick.  I'm certain he has allied organizations that already have all the proof and he trolled the media into forcing him to bring it up.

             This however is pure speculation and is most likely complete bullshit.

              if you research Kuru it makes total sense based on her symptoms. You can get it from drinking blood and eating human tissue. There are several good videos on Youtube comparing her symptoms and kuru.  I pray she has it...

             Trump needs our support, any attorney knows the more public support generated the easier the to force the government to take action on a case. The public has more power than they realize, the corrupt judges and police and politiicians rely on us being distracted to do their work. We literally need to attend court hearings and write letters and show up so they know we are watching and willing to take action.

             Why would you do that? So you can reveal to the perpetrators his plans? Let him work and set things up. He will nominate a Supreme Court judge, he needs to eliminate certain people out of their positions of authority that are embedded in the government.

               Faith can move mountains and right now trump is all we have. Got to have some faith and support. When he messes up we scream it from the roof tops. For now though it's important not to let the globalists pedofiles divide and conquer us.

             I am hoping he is for real and will take down the elite and their minions.  But, yes I agree the executive orders will ruin the country.  Our air quality will only get worse and I am afraid that corporations may even acquire eminent domain. I keep saying over and over .........the children the children, it is for the children.

              I think the people he is putting in office could go on vacation for the next four years and be as effective as the ones they are replacing...and maybe end the child trafficking.

               We may be surprised at what will happen while the child trafficking ends (and I hope with all my heart that it does).  I heard today that some states are in the process of trying to put an end to protesting.  That will only be the beginning.  We must fight all these other infractions and executive orders while we fight the child trafficking as well.

             I believe Trump is anti-establishment based on the establishment's rabid, hysterical reactions to him and desperate attempts to stop him. They tried to torpedo him numerous times with tricks that always worked for them in the past, calling him racist, sexist, violent, a Hitler. Almost all their "conservative" publications (like National Review) and "conservative" talk radio hosts (like Glenn Beck and Mark Levin) came out against him and most didn't support him even after he was the Republican nominee. When all their 16 Republican candidates couldn't defeat him, they even tried sending Mitt Romney out to viciously attack him. He is not one of them.

            Yeah based on on the level of efficiency he &amp; his admin are on it would appear we are in the optimal timeline. Comey still there is a bit worrying but we will see very soon. I mean shit lads it's just barely a week (plus a weekend!) and he's on pace to have the space elevator before the years out. Breakaway space colonies by end of year two. And then.....who even knows anymore when the sky ceases to be the limit! We just make sure he holds true to his word and help watch out for any shit apples (the kid fucker/globalist kind) and this could very well be the alphaomegagod tier timeline! FOR THE LITTLE ONES LADS! SHADILAY!

            There is also the you tube where he says something about politician's being bribed with 'money and other things' and the other things are going to stop. Some words to that effect. And, the post about how he is not a member of the secret societies. A Newt Gingrich thing? So...this is at least three hopeful pieces of information pointing to President Trump being legit!

            OMGGGG. I replayed that clip over and over, trying to see if it meant anything else. Nope, it sounds like he's talking about human sacrifice and the new world order.

             He is talking in codes, FOR SURE. Just like he did at the CIA with the columns. Remove the columns. Fifth column is code for a faction inside an organisation that works against, or tricks, the rest of the organasation. And he even say: Do you understand that? I mean for sure. Im starting to truly believe Trump is protected by some sort of divine intervention of some sorts. Please be true :D

             That's absurd, there  is  nothing in  this speech  that makes any reference  to  Pizzagate/child sacrifice, ludicrous
however the Youtube does  clearly  show that  Trump is  in  bed with the  same ELITE,  pushing the  bullshit  war  on  terror, claiming Muslim radicals did 9/11, pushing a  Police  State, pushing  for  more  expansion of intelligience  etc,  truly  chilling

              OK, so your latter statement is fine, however your former claim shows simply that you do not have a good 'conspiracy vocabulary' (This is not an insult) -- there are a great many things that the 'conspiracy community' have followed for generations, which become a part of the language, history and contextual-base-knowledge... allowing puns and references with minimal words... think of it as meta-dot-connecting...

              I think that is the whole plan. I am convinced Trump MUST have known in detail of the satanic ongoing. I can not imagine he did not. To beat that, you need longtime, good organised plan. You can not catch a global maffia that is at least 50 years in play in just a week. Also you are not gonna fight that machine (like he has done last 2 years) without a plan.

              I would be not surprised if Wikileaks is or became part of that plan. There is still some 100gb insurance files from wikileaks spread around the world and that could be in "waitingroom" for if Trump does not come true to his promise to fight this mafia clan or there Happens something to Trump.

              Also still waiting for a follow-up from Milo's "Yet" but he is banned from twitter from what i could find out. Maybe someone else knows a way to contact him and can ask if he now can speak, later will or never will.

                I just got new clue that supports my thinking that Assange is in Trump team. It can of course just be coincidence, but Assange was on Sean Hannity when it seemed absolutely necessary during findingassange clock was running. And then yesterday Trump does a 45 minutes interview

               <p>
                Saw a time ago a documentary about how a dog reacts on his owners/boss mind even from 150 miles away. At moment owner is told "he can go home" the dog reacts within a second while being just observed and 150 miles away.
