<h1 id="md-us-judge-approves-of-settlement-between-victims-of-convicted-pedophile-and-those-tied-to-the-school-where-he-abused">US judge approves of settlement between victims of convicted pedophile and those tied to the school where he abused</h1>
<p>HARTFORD, Conn. (ChurchMilitant.com) - A U.S. judge has approved a $60 million settlement for more than 100 victims of sexual abuse at the hands of a Catholic charity worker in Haiti.</p>
<p>Last week, Senior U.S. District Judge Robert N. Chatigny approved of the multi-million-dollar settlement for victims of convicted pedophile Douglas Perlitz, who sexually abused as many as 170 minors at Project Pierre Toussaint, a school for orphaned boys that he founded in the city of Cap-Haitien.</p>
<p>The settlement came as the result of a class-action lawsuit. Chatigny ordered that the settlement will take effect Aug. 27, unless there is a successful challenge in court.</p>
<p>Among those liable for the $60 million settlement are <strong>Jesuit-run Fairfield University in Connecticut</strong>, the <strong>Society of Jesus of New England</strong> and <strong>the U.S. branch of the Order of Malta</strong>. Also liable in the settlement are <strong>donor Hope E. Carter</strong> and <strong>Jesuit priest Fr. Paul E. Carrier</strong> — a mentor to Perlitz who helped him with the charity work.</p>
<p>So far, the court has approved of 150 claims. Twenty additional claims are pending.</p>
<p>Perlitz pleaded guilty in 2010 to federal charges of sexual abuse, admitting to illegal sexual contact with eight boys during repeated trips to Haiti in 2001-2008. He was sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Attorneys Paul J. Hanly Jr. and Mitchell Garabedian represented the plaintiffs in the class-action suit. Hanly commented to the press, &quot;We are grateful that this process is in its final stages and will provide closure for these brave young men.&quot;</p>
<p>He continued, &quot;The settlement will allow the survivors to move beyond these horrors, enable them to receive whatever counseling and aid they require, and move on with their lives, as best as they can.&quot;</p>
<p>The plaintiffs argued that Haiti Fund, Inc. and the Jesuit order both failed to take measures that could have prevented the abuse.</p>
<p>Authorities have said that Perlitz may have abused Haitian boys as young as 11 and may have begun abusing in 1998, before the school even opened.</p>
<p>A man who shared an apartment with Perlitz in Haiti in 1998 told investigators that he noticed Perlitz bringing children into his bedroom.</p>
<p>This was the second settlement related to Perlitz\'s abuse of minors in Haiti. In 2013, a $12 million settlement was paid out to 24 males who claimed they were victimized by Perlitz.</p>
<p>Project Pierre Toussaint was primarily funded through the Haiti Fund Inc., a Connecticut-based charity tied to the Jesuits and to Fairfield University. </p>
<p>Perlitz graduated from Fairfield University in 1992 and gave the commencement address in 2002. Many students, faculty and alumni were donors to the charity.</p>
<p>When word of Perlitz\'s abuse started spreading in 2008, donation money ran dry. This led to the collapse of the school, putting a number of Haitian orphans back out on the streets.</p>
<p>Federal law enforcement officials have used the case against Perlitz to highlight their efforts to track down U.S. citizens who commit crimes overseas.</p>
<p>Among the evidence presented by investigators was child pornography found on Perlitz\'s computer.</p>
<p>According to federal prosecutors, Perlitz sometimes bribed his victims at the orphanage with gifts and money. In other cases, they say, he used threats to pressure them into accepting his sexual demands.</p>
<p>A major player in bringing the abuse allegations against Perlitz to light was Haitian journalist Cyrus Sibert. Sibert claims he faced bribes and threats as he worked to expose the alleged abuse at Perlitz\'s charity.</p>
<p>The case against Perlitz resembles scandals that have rocked U.K.-based charity Oxfam. In February 2018, news broke that Oxfam employees and volunteers were accused of sexual misconduct in Chad and Haiti, such as soliciting prostitutes. Similar revelations came out about other aid organizations as well. Oxfam suffered an immediate loss in donations due to the scandals.</p>

            The churches are doing the human sacrificing. It probably will never be proven. I saw it almost 40 years ago. The sacrificing of children and adults in the churches (all churches, Protestant and Catholic) is much larger than the abortions. Voat Goat is part of it, aren’t you?

            regarding funding and Perlitz claims about SJ Carrier
            <a href="https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2011/04/28/a-serial-offender/">
             https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2011/04/28/a-serial-offender/
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Order of Malta, a lay Catholic humanitarian order with a historic commitment to serving the poor and sick, provided the start-up money to create Perlitz’s program in 1997, and its members provided strong support to it for years, even after some of the accusations of sexual abuse surfaced.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to the Church donations, $97,500 in undeclared payments came from restricted campus ministry accounts to Father Paul Carrier, SJ, who served for 18 years as the school’s campus ministry director. Father Carrier chaired the university’s Haiti Fund—a non-profit organization he created in 2001 to help raise money for Project Pierre Toussaint and other Haitian social service programs.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "no organization had been more supportive of Perlitz’s Project Pierre Toussaint than Fairfield University itself."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The Connecticut Post concluded that $775,500 might have gone to Project Pierre Toussaint between 1997-2008 from university accounts and from donations made through the university’s institutions. That total would amount to about 22 percent of the total funds that the Haiti Fund reportedly raised from 2001 to 2008. But, due to recordkeeping problems, there is some uncertainty about exactly how much money went to the project. In 2009, Stanley A. Twardy, a former federal prosecutor, supervised an internal audit of contributions raised by Fairfield University and concluded that how Father Carrier spent more than $120,500 of that money could not be determined.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Perlitz defense attorneys claim about SJ Carrier: "a priest who began a long-term “physical and spiritual” relationship with Perlitz soon after his first days as an undergraduate at Fairfield University. The document also claimed that this same priest played a key role in all of Perlitz’s work in Haiti. "
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             According to the Fairfield Mirror, the defense stated that this unnamed priest accompanied Perlitz on his first trip to Haiti as part of a campus ministry group trip and remained an authority figure in Project Pierre Toussaint. The defense document also stated that the relationship with the priest “ultimately took on a dark aspect, both physically and spiritually, that had a significant and long-lasting impact on him…eventually leading him to cross the line and engage in sexual misconduct.”
            </p>
            <p>
             In the defense filing, Perlitz claims to have become involved in this relationship with the priest shortly after arriving on campus as a freshman, when he was “struggling with his sexual identity.” According to the defense, Perlitz was struggling with same-sex attraction and confided in a Fairfield University priest, who exploited him emotionally and sexually: “In many ways the abuse of power and trust that manifested itself in Doug’s own painful relationship with the priest recurred in his own conduct with some of the young adults of Project Pierre Toussaint.”
            </p>
            <p>
             The claims of the defense plea have not been established. Still, the Jesuit order has suspended Father Carrier as it investigates his relationships with students while serving at Fairfield University. Father Carrier spent more than 20 years at Fairfield University, first as an instructor and later as chaplain and director of campus ministry.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Connecticut Post reported that “[Carrier] was transferred from the school in 2008 at the same time federal investigators began digging into allegations of sexual abuse at the Haitian school operated by Douglas Perlitz.”

            Dig into the Order Of Malta and you will find a lot of evil. Like most "orders" you will find some innocents at the bottom and tons of evil at the top of the hierarchy.

            We've been writing about them since 2017.  Try doing a search in the voat database and going through the old posts.  Sometimes putting a number of posts together will give a clearer picture.  Or we can just wait for 8chan to do that and have someone provide a link to that.

            The Podesta brothers share a Jesuit education - John also went to Georgetown University (Jesuit School) and at one point he also trained for a time to become a Jesuit priest. This explains a lot, actually.

              it's either a bs disinfo claim spread by Johnny carucci and ES, or the original source was memoryholed.
             </p>
             <p>
              earliest source over found is the keywiki, but it isn't sourced.

             <p>
              I lean towards it being potential disinfo to distance Podesta from the Jesuits, once its disproven.

             Jesuit order has suspended the Rev. Paul Carrier from performing any religious duties while it investigates his relationships with students while serving at Fairfield University. The Society of Jesus New England Province, Carrier's order, is not the only group investigating his actions at Fairfield University.

             The annoucement of her gift was made Wednesday by the Rev. Jeffrey P. von Arx, president of Fairfield University. The gift will fund scholarships to enable young people to pursue an education at Fairfield, and will permanently endow Fairfield’s Center for Ignatian Spirituality.
            </p>
            <p>
             Barry, a strong advocate of Jesuit education, said she made the gift to express gratitude to von Arx for all he accomplished during his 12 years as president. Von Arx will be leaving Fairfield at the end of 2016 to become Superior of the Jesuit community at Lafarge House in Cambridge, Mass.
            </p>
            <p>
             “I am sad for this loss to Fairfield,” Barry said in a release from the university, “and pray for the continuation of the Jesuit mission and the Jesuit identity, which Father von Arx has not only preserved, but has so successfully championed over these 12 years.

Most valuable resource and key to life = water.  As in Lake Michigan, part of the Great Lakes, which is 84% of North America's surface fresh water.  Racine former mayor deeply involved via Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative. What else?

                 Pizzagate is the name for the Podesta scandal. Ritual child abuse/sacrifice is a known JEWISH practice, so Muslims and Nazis have been on it long before y'all.

                 Women are too empathetic to ever assign blame collectively, so they go in circles postulating ever more convoluted "cabals" etc.

              Jesuit order has suspended the Rev. Paul Carrier from performing any religious duties while it investigates his relationships with students while serving at Fairfield University. The Society of Jesus New England Province, Carrier's order, is not the only group investigating his actions at Fairfield University.

              Federal investigators continue to sift through the tangled finances of Perlitz's program. The Congregation Oblates of Mary Immaculate in Cap-Haitien, which rented its house to Perlitz, is owed at least $25,000, the order said.
             </p>
             <p>
              At Fairfield University, Stanley A. Twardy Jr., a Stamford lawyer and Connecticut's former U.S. attorney, has been hired to conduct an investigation into the school's financial relationship with Perlitz.
             </p>
             <p>
              The results of that review are expected Feb. 17.
             </p>
             <p>
              Reopening the Cap-Haitien program "is entirely up to the current Board of the Haiti Fund Inc.," President Jeffrey von Arx said in a statement last week.
             </p>
             <p>
              The university "is committed to help support such an effort and we have reached out to non-profit organizations that we hope will be interested in the program to help facilitate a conversation with the Haiti Fund board."
