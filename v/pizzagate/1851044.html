<p>&quot;As you know, Mr. McCabe is under investigation by the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General. That investigation is examining whether the political and financial connections between his wife’s Democratic political campaign and Clinton associates warranted his recusal in the FBI’s Clinton email investigation. On March 7, 2015, just five days after the New York Times broke the story about Secretary Clinton’s use of private email for official business, Mr. McCabe met with Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a longtime, close associate of the Clintons—along with his wife, Dr. McCabe. Mr. McAuliffe recruited Dr. McCabe, who had not previously run for any political office, to be the Democratic candidate for a Virginia state senate seat. Dr. McCabe agreed, and Governor McAuliffe’s political action committee subsequently gave nearly $500,000 to her campaign while the FBI’s investigation of Secretary Clinton was ongoing. The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, also donated over $200,000 to Dr. McCabe’s campaign. While Mr. McCabe recused himself from public corruption cases in Virginia—presumably including the reportedly ongoing investigation of Mr. McAuliffe regarding illegal campaign contributions—he failed to recuse himself from the Clinton email investigation, despite the appearance of a conflict created by his wife’s campaign accepting $700,000 from a close Clinton associate during the investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Committee requires additional information to fully understand this situation. Please provide the following information and respond to these questions by April 11, 2017:
1. Has Mr. McCabe been involved in any capacity in the investigation of alleged collusion between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia? If so, in what capacity has he been involved? When did this involvement begin?
2. Has Mr. McCabe been involved in any requests or approvals for physical surveillance, consensual monitoring, searches, or national security letters relating to the investigation? If so, please provide all related documents.
3. In the course of the investigation, has Mr. McCabe been involved in any requests or approvals relating to the acquisition of the contents of stored communications from electronic communication service providers pursuant to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act? If so, please provide all related documents.
4. Has Mr. McCabe been involved in any FISA warrant applications relating to the investigation? If so, in what capacity? Please provide all related documents.
5. In the course of the investigation, has Mr. McCabe, or anyone under his supervision, made any representations to prosecutors or judges regarding the reliability of information in the FBI’s possession as part of seeking judicial authorization for investigative tools? Has he or anyone under his supervision made any such representations about the political opposition research dossier compiled by Mr. Steele and Fusion GPS? If so, please explain and provide copies of all relevant documents.
6. Was Mr. McCabe involved in any FBI interactions with Mr. Steele? If so, please explain.
7. Did Mr. McCabe brief or otherwise communicate with anyone in the Obama administration regarding the investigation? If so, who did he brief, and when? Please provide all related documents.
8. Has Mr. McCabe been authorized by the FBI to speak to the media, whether as an anonymous source or otherwise, regarding the investigation? If so, please provide copies of such authorizations. If he was so authorized, to whom did he speak, and when? If he was not authorized to do so, does the FBI have any indication that he nonetheless spoke to the media?
9. To the best of your knowledge, has anyone within the FBI raised concerns within the Bureau that Mr. McCabe appears to have a conflict of interest in the investigation of Trump associates? If so, who raised such concerns, when did they do so, and how did FBI respond?
To the best of your knowledge, has anyone within the FBI filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General regarding Mr. McCabe’s involvement in the investigation?
11. Have personnel from the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General spoken with you yet as part of that Office’s investigation into Mr. McCabe’s alleged conflict of interest in the Clinton investigation? If so, did they also raise concerns as to whether Mr. McCabe’s alleged partisan conflict would also apply to the investigation of Mr. Trump’s associates?
12. Has anyone at FBI, the Department of Justice, or the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General recommended or requested that Mr. McCabe recuse himself from the investigation of Mr. Trump’s associates or from any ongoing investigations of the Clinton Foundation? If so, what action was taken in response?&quot;</p>',

            "Comey was an obstructionist"
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe the word you're looking for is Traitor. James Comey is guilty of Misprision of Treason. Unfortunately for James Comey the punishment is identical to that of Treason.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's that James?
            <a href="https://youtu.be/dX7iazMj7kY?t=9">
             We're stuck with you for another six and a half years?
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Shut the fuck up James. There's a new Sheriff in town bitch.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where was I? Ah right Treason. Those guilty of treason "shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years". Given the Seals killed in cold blood on Extortion 17 does anybody really think Comey's getting a 5+ year prison term?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yeah, I didn't think so. James Comey is going to be hung by the neck until dead along with all his other play-mates.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope it was worth it James. You can't take it with you aaaaaaaaaaand it would have burned to a crisp anyway.

             Comey has been around way too long.  He goes all the way back to Whitewater.  Whenever Comey was involved with the Clintons they ended up landing on their feet, like a cat with 9 Lives.

              I read a comment on one of Webb's videos that it will be easier to get rid of McCabe if he is the acting director of the FBI. I don't see any reason why he can't just fire him now.

              I am hoping that the DOJ starts bringing it up.  But any coverage is good.  If some of the internet sites would do an article on McCabe and the Awan Bros.  maybe RT or someone would pick it up.  I know that is wishful thinking, but you can't blame a girl for hoping.

               I think something big is comming and white hat agents are gaining the upper hand. If someone knew how much I want that Ping Pong American Psycho to testify in court - just to see Alex Jones' mug, the dawning of horror - that he had become an enabler of child murderers (and possibly even cannibals) with his apology to that freak. I want to see that day come. No wat will we let this get away. Let's honor Ted Gunderson's ghost that is guiding us to victory over the greatest evil that has plagued our 'civillization' for centuries!

                I think there is something big June 10th.  I believe you are right, I too believe it.  There are many Psycho Characters that we would like to see get theirs.  I believe if all of it came out, and I mean all as we know it, that there would be lynch mobs in the streets rabid for their necks. As we know,  there is plenty of blame in the global network as well.   There are major players in the sex trafficking and organ harvesting in India, China, Australia, UK, etc.  I believe people in those countries will be ready to string up their own elites too.

                  I don't know, really.  I know there is something going down and it will be very interesting to be sure.  I believe there is plenty of down and dirty crime going on in Racine. I have marked of yesterday and today on my calendar. (Yes I still use a real calendar)  I am in the understanding that maybe not much can be revealed.

                 Sad part is that some fringe groups will be demonized like no tomorrow - Homosexual men will be lynched - entire male gay community will be identified with Alifantis (partially true). It will be nasty! That group will be hit the hardest. They have no idea what's comming!

                  That will be one of the saddest parts.  They and others have worked so very hard to get them where they finally are.  The elites certainly don't care who they might take with them.  I for one and I know many others will be proud to speak up in their defense.

                   Better red pill them now and tell them speak out and expose PG. Explain to the gay community how they are being used by the pedo-elite. It's sad! Psychopaths could not care less about gay comminity as long as they get they kicks out of torturing children and mocking the public while doing it.

                    Yes and they are using the LGBTQ Label to try to normalize the nation.  We must try to feature as many articles on our site as possible regarding this subject and ask all the members on here that are gay to reach out as quickly as they can.  There are many groups and gay clubs that a member can speak at with literature to help red pill their community.OK People Get Going.  We can also mention it as much as possible in our comments and to those in our friends and families that are gay.  About their trying to add the P and making it LBGTQP.   How many more letters are there?  Well there are 20 left and I had a horrible thought yesterday, will the sickos try to add another B at the end for beasteality?  This stuff makes me so sick.

            Looks like McCabe shouldn't be allowed to stay as acting-Director if he is under investigation. So he'll be fired next? Trump can just keep slicing layers off the top to clear some of the shit off of the swamp.
