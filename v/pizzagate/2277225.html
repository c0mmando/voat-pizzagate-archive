            <p>
             As expected, President Trump on Wednesday recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announced plans to relocate the U.S. embassy there, a decision that is certain to inflame tensions in the region and throw a wrench in potential peace negotiations, paradoxically uniting the fractured middle east world against Israel and the U.S.
            </p>
            <p>
             "I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel," Trump said shortly after 1pm in the White House.

              <p>
               Modern Israel has little or nothing to do with th Bible or prophecy imho. To quote some Bible literature:
The modern State of Israel to this day bases its claim to statehood on a UN resolution and what it calls the natural and historic right of the Jewish people. Is it reasonable to expect that the God of the Bible would perform the greatest prophetic miracle in the 20th century in behalf of a people who refuse to give him credit?
              </p>
              <p>
               How Does the Modern Claim to Statehood Compare? 
Modern Israel’s secular attitude contrasts sharply with the situation in 537 B.C.E. Back then, the nation of Israel was indeed ‘reborn’ as if in a day after being devastated and depopulated by the Babylonians 70 years earlier. At that time, Isaiah 66:8 was strikingly fulfilled when the Persian conqueror of Babylon, Cyrus the Great, authorized the return of the Jews to their homeland.—Ezra 1:2.
The Persian King Cyrus recognized almighty God’s hand in the matter in 537 B.C.E., and those who returned to Jerusalem did so for the express purpose of restoring the worship of YHWH God and rebuilding His temple. The modern State of Israel has never officially declared any such desire or intention.
Still God’s Chosen Nation?
In the year 33 C.E., the fleshly nation of Israel lost its claim to be God’s chosen nation when it rejected God’s the Messiah. The Messiah himself put it this way: “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the killer of the prophets and stoner of those sent forth to her . . . Look! Your house is abandoned to you.” (Matthew 23:37, 38) Jesus’ statement came true when in 70 C.E., Roman legions destroyed Jerusalem along with its temple and priesthood. But what was to become of God’s purpose to have a “special property out of all other peoples, . . . a kingdom of priests and a holy nation”?—Exodus 19:5, 6.
The apostle Peter, himself a fleshly Jew, answered that question in a letter written to Christians—both Gentile and Jewish. He wrote: “You are ‘a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for special possession,’ . . . for you were once not a people, but are now God’s people; you were those who had not been shown mercy, but are now those who have been shown mercy.”—1 Peter 2:7-10..
Christians who were selected by holy spirit thus belong to a spiritual nation, their membership not being determined by birth or geographic location. The apostle Paul described the matter this way: “Neither is circumcision anything nor is uncircumcision, but a new creation is something. And all those who will walk orderly by this rule of conduct, upon them be peace and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.”—Galatians 6:15, 16.
Whereas the modern nation of Israel offers to confer citizenship upon any natural or converted Jew, citizenship in what the Bible calls “the Israel of God” is given only to those who are “obedient and sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ.” (1 Peter 1:1, 2) Speaking of these members of the Israel of God, or spiritual Jews, Paul wrote: “He is not a Jew who is one on the outside, nor is circumcision that which is on the outside upon the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one on the inside, and his circumcision is that of the heart by spirit, and not by a written code. The praise of that one comes, not from men, but from God.”—Romans 2:28, 29.

               I am not an more concerned about future or EXTRA violence in the region than I was before. Also, it seems like many of the terrorists financial backers are under house arrest in Saudi Arabia...

                Since this happened posts about pedophilia get a yawn 15 up votes and a post about Al Franken pretending to grab a woman's boobs can get 50 up votes. What does that say about what is happening to pizzagate?
               </p>
               <p>
                What does it mean when a post about some unknown question asker from 4chan gets more up votes and participation than a pedophilia thread?

                It says that you are derailing pizzagate, and its says nothing else.

                    Trump is obviously better than Hillary but I see no need to trust him to carry the message that pizzagate is "supposed" to focus on.

                    So now Israel is lying on the Palestenians saying their poor defenseless selves are firing rockets at the giant that enslaves them. This is what Zionists do. They kill people and steal their land. We pay for that with our tax dollars because our government is a Zionist organization. Which is why I hardly trust them to take down a pedophile network that they manage and run themselves.

                      Can't make it much plainer. You are equating Jerusalem being given to Zionist butchers as perhaps equal to fulfilling Bible prophecy because Jesus and Jews. Its blasphemy, not fulfillment of Biblical prophecy. You refuse to recognize that today's Zionist/Nazis are not Jesus's jews from 2000 years ago and I find it disturbing for someone as intelligent as yourself.

                You trying to convince me that those bloodthirsty savages in Israel qualify as the same people? These are Zionist in Israel. If you truly believe that giving Jerusalem to people that despise Jesus worse than battery acid then I just don't know what to say.

                 I do know that Jesus submitted himself to the corrupt and hypocritical Jewish authorities of his day when he could have deposed them. They despised him far more than any modern Jew.

                  I'm more than qualified to make that decision and so are you. A Zionist is not a jew anyway. A Zionist is a murdering asshole that went into Palestine and started murdering people and now runs the largest open air prison in the world. Not to mention they just destroyed the Middle East. Not to mention they blew up the World Trade Center and are still in our government, and not to mention that Trump bows to AIPAC like a good shabbos goy, and not mention that Kushner is the Arch Zionist Czar from a Zionist crime family, and not to mention..........

                  Not hardly. These Talmudic Zionists in Isaell literally write that Jesus is in hell boiling in hot excrement and I think you know that because you are too smart not to know. Not sure why you are rolling this one on me. Rothschild funded Israel and is still their hero. Even if you believe the line that the Rothschilds are on the verge of going down you won't take the hate out of those Talmudic child rapers in Israel away because they were depraved long before the Rothschilds.

                  Not sure how much you understand about Jesus but watch this because there have been many identical Jesus archetypes over the last few thousand years. Same story. Born a virgin, died and rose in three days. This short video only covers a few of them because there are more. Its the story of the Sun.

Jesus rose from the dead in Jerusalem. The soil of Jerusalem remains bathed in the Blood of the Lamb.
Jerusalem will ever belong to the Lord God Almighty.  imho
