<p><a href="[http://educate-yourself.org/cn/tedgundersonpasses01aug11.shtml">Ted L. Gunderson, Former FBI Bureau Chief, Passed Away on Sunday, July 31, 2011 at Age 82 (Aug. 1, 2011) <br />
</a>http://educate-yourself.org/cn/tedgundersonpasses01aug11.shtml](http://educate-yourself.org/cn/tedgundersonpasses01aug11.shtml)http://educate-yourself.org/cn/tedgundersonpasses01aug11.shtml)</p>
<p>In November of 1999, I acquired an enormous amount of paperwork from retired FBI Senior Special-Agent-In-Charge Ted L. Gunderson who had compiled box loads of research and had assembled a number of reports in recent years which described unimaginable &quot;operations&quot; of treachery, sadistic savagery, degradation, abuse, and murder caused by intelligence agents of the United States government against its own citizens, especially children. <a href=""></a></p>
<p>The Finders<br />
The kidnapping of children for purposes of prostitution, pornography, high tech weaponry experimental abuse, mind control abuse, child slave labor for underground alien-controlled facilities, white sex slavery, and the <em>satanic ritual murder</em> of untold <strong>thousands of American children</strong> snatched from the streets and playgrounds of America by agents working for the CIA is the principle reason for the existence of a covert CIA operation called &quot;<a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/ciadrugsabusemurder.shtml">The Finders</a>&quot;. The Finders is one of the most alarming and despicable covert operations against America\'s children that Gunderson\'s investigations helped to uncover, but it\'s only one of many covert Gestapo-like acts committed against American citizens by government agents under directives issued, not by Congress or the President, but rather by international satanists collectively known as the <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/mc/mcsvaliinterviewpt1.shtml">Illuminati</a>, who control the Secret or Inner government of the United States as well as every other major government in the world. The &quot;Finders&quot; operation began in the 1960\'s and continues kidnapping children to this very day. </p>
<p>Dr. Jeffrey R. MacDonald<br />
Soon after after retiring from the FBI in March of 1979 , Ted began looking more deeply into cases of satanic murder activity after becoming convinced of the innocence of a young Army medical doctor, **Dr. Jeffrey R. MacDonald, **who was falsely convicted in August, 1979 of the murder of his wife and two young daughters (5 year old Kimberly, and 2 year old Kristen MacDonald) in a bloody and grisly satanic style murder scene that took place in their home in the early morning hours of Feb. 17, 1970 on Ft. Bragg Army base in North Carolina. The murders were in fact committed by a local satanic group of drug users (referred to as &quot;hippies&quot; in the newspapers at the time) which included five active duty army men who had targeted the MacDonald family because Dr. MacDonald was perceived by this group of GI drug users as a &quot;snitch&quot;; as MacDonald and other army doctors were adhering to the base commander\'s new policy (at the time) of reporting the names of Army personnel who were being admitted to the base Emergency Room for overdosing on heroin and other serious drugs .</p>
<p>What happened next to Jeffrey MacDonald is nothing short of the greatest case of malicious prosecution and injustice in modern history.</p>

<p>The Franklin Cover-Up<br />
The <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/products/index.shtml#cos">participation of persons of high position in satanic rituals and child prostitution in the Omaha, Nebraska</a> was revealed in the 1992 book, <em><a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/franklincoverupexcerpt.shtml">The Franklin Cover-Up</a>,</em> by former state senator and attorney, <strong>John DeCamp</strong>. Ted Gunderson provided a substantial amount of investigative assistance to John DeCamp in uncovering the story._ The Franklin Cover-Up_ describes the role played by the CIA\'s &quot;Finders&quot; in the drugging,  mind control, and forced coercion of kidnapped children into silent compliance to serve the pedophilic and sadistic appetites of some of the most prominent and well known people in Omaha, Nebraska and Washington, DC.</p>
<p><strong>Conspiracy of Silence</strong> was a one hour video describing the Franklin Cover-Up originally due to be aired on the Discovery Channel in 1994. The documentary was pulled and the UK producers paid off to obtain all copies by unknown political figures in congress. John DeCamp had obtained an in-house copy which he gave to Ted Gunderson in the late 1990s. which Ted made available from his web site and at his talks. The Conspiracy of Silence is the greatest testament to the victory of corruption and murder over innocence and justice ever seen in a modern times. This version was posted to Youtube on May 1, 2012. Paul Bonner was killed with a drug overdose shortly after being filmed for this documentary.</p>
