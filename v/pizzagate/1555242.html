As it has been said before <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1448069">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1448069</a> and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1464747">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1464747</a>, he is a successfull children author who wrote Secret Pizza party, Dragons love tacos, Robot sauce...</p>
<p>Despite parents on amazon reviews are saying that &quot;they loved the other books but not secret pizza party&quot;, I wanted to look more inside the other books :</p>
<p>Dragon loves tacos.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyM-eNg2Zlc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyM-eNg2Zlc</a></p>
<p>If you take again the tacos as &quot;children&quot; and the dragons as &quot;pedophiles&quot;, all that &quot;cute absurdity&quot; makes suddenly sense in a terrible way :</p>
<p>&quot;they love big gigantic tacos and tiny little baby tacos as well&quot;, &quot;if you want to make friend with dragons, tacos are key&quot;, \'dragon love parties,like costume parties (satanists) and pool parties (hollywood)&quot;, &quot;get a boat and fill it full of tacos&quot; (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1478968">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1478968)</a>) with mentions of burying in the garden, burning a house (happened in the Dutroux case, a girl found in a burned old factory names Christine Van hees, and the survivor called witness X1 said it was common to hide proofs buy burning places where snuff movies or sacrifices happened)...</p>
<p>Robot Sauce.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr1DrZsHzpg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr1DrZsHzpg</a></p>
<p>If you compare the Monarch program to that &quot;funny&quot; book, you have it all described. Controlling the world is the purpose. The books describes really well what their doing to children : they abuse them and make them think that it\'s really cool to be better than other people. So they encourage them to abuse small animals, then other children. This the all process of dissiociation, which drives to &quot;not feel anything&quot; (like a robot), have fantasies of grandiosity, and great vulnerability on suggestion.</p>
<p>You doubt ? Read the 2nd ingredient of Robot Andidoto at 3:38. Monarch Butterfly chrysalis.</p>
<p>The robot recipe : Kookamonga is a reference to the battle of kookamonga, a song about kids that want to rape girls in a scout camp, with their counselor advises : &quot;Well our counselor said we could take them by surprise&quot;</p>
<p>Same old thing : &quot;Top secret formula&quot; 1:08</p>
<p>Big gang-bang with robots : 4:54</p>
<p>In that book, what is very odd, is that it seems that the narrator is a real person talking to the child. (1:15). Weirder when the kid has to swallow sauce again and again, and because it doesn\'t work, he has to &quot;pour it all over his body to get it to work&quot; and the narrator says : &quot;I\'m really sorry about this&quot;.</p>
<p>Every parents that love these books of Adam Rubin agree on the fact that it is really absurd and weird and funny (because of absurdity), but once you get the code to decrypt them...</p>
<p>So, I went on with researchs on him, and here is what I found :</p>
<p>1) He used to be an actor in X-rated show : <a href="http://digiday.com/etc/creative-director-writes-kids-books-about-dragons-and-squirrels/">http://digiday.com/etc/creative-director-writes-kids-books-about-dragons-and-squirrels/</a> and says &quot;So, despite my mantle as a children’s author, my sensibilities are not exactly G-rated.&quot;</p>
<p>2) He said : “Dragons Love Tacos” is really a meditation on man’s struggle for emotional intimacy in a digital age. Very few children pick up on this, however.&quot; Emotional intimacy of an adult in a digital age&quot; in a children\'s book ? WTF! <a href="http://digiday.com/etc/creative-director-writes-kids-books-about-dragons-and-squirrels/">http://digiday.com/etc/creative-director-writes-kids-books-about-dragons-and-squirrels/</a></p>
<p>3) From 2001 to 2005, he belonged to the fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu in Washington university (Saint Louis) <a href="http://archive.is/POP6g">http://archive.is/POP6g</a>. Here we can see that in 2009, the fraternity is trying to re-form after being kicked off 15 years before <a href="http://www.gwhatchet.com/2009/04/06/sigma-alpha-mu-hopes-to-return/">http://www.gwhatchet.com/2009/04/06/sigma-alpha-mu-hopes-to-return/</a>. Wait. 2009 - 15= 1994. So how did Adam Rubin to belong to a non-existing fraternity. The article explains : in 2002, 25 brave guys are restarting it but not officialy. (So in 2001, in was maybe restarting it all by himself, hazing himself, forcing himself to drink pig blood in a crane, or smoking 35 packets of cigarettes in a row)</p>
<p>Ok. What did Sigma Alpha Mu to be booted out ? Well, it was due to a risk management and alcohol violation. Really ?</p>
<p>No.It was because of serious hazing cases and drug violation. I don\'t believe that Police department would do an investigation for few cocaine strokes in parties. <a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2012/07/10/fat-drunk-and-stupid-sigma-alpha-mu-frat-kicked-out-of-wash-u">http://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2012/07/10/fat-drunk-and-stupid-sigma-alpha-mu-frat-kicked-out-of-wash-u</a></p>
<p>Apparently, this fraternity is well known to use hard drugs and dealing it in the campus. <a href="http://www.studlife.com/news/2012/07/18/hazing-and-drug-abuse-allegations-against-sigma-alpha-mu-remain-undisclosed-to-public-fraternity-members/#comment-1552132482">http://www.studlife.com/news/2012/07/18/hazing-and-drug-abuse-allegations-against-sigma-alpha-mu-remain-undisclosed-to-public-fraternity-members/#comment-1552132482</a></p>
<p>And the first fraternity dead guy, alling from a balcony:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/with-washington-university-student-s-death-still-a-mystery-family/article_02aefac3-136d-5075-bee8-f614fe0b95fe.html">http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/with-washington-university-student-s-death-still-a-mystery-family/article_02aefac3-136d-5075-bee8-f614fe0b95fe.html</a></p>
<p>And the second, a 19 year old woman, falling from a 8 feet building :</p>
<p>&quot;on December 1, a 19-year-old woman fell eight feet from the Sigma Alpha Mu house at Penn State.&quot; <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/03/the-dark-power-of-fraternities/357580/">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/03/the-dark-power-of-fraternities/357580/</a></p>
<p>3) He had an article in NYtimes. How did that guy managed to have a free advertising in the most prestigious newspaper in USA ? Well he might have some connections with the writer : Michael Ian Black.</p>
<p>So I kept going on the road of NY pedophile connection :</p>
<p>Guess what Michael Ian Black do ? Creating children books ! Yeah. He has not always been in the business. Before he was</p>
<p>Not to mention the guy looks like he absolutely despises children when he talks, and that he also looks like a pervert in a chicken costume who smiles like he was having a broom stucked in his butt.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qCQLCOeOu0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qCQLCOeOu0</a></p>
<p>An other video of him (much more disdain and fake smiles in it) and a 9 month old comment : &quot;You look like a pedo&quot;, which I immediately thumbed up.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZv2UsA_q9Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZv2UsA_q9Q</a></p>
<p>Oh, another taco party (extravaganza, with swimming, sparkler fuck and dead people) :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGij1j9MyH8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGij1j9MyH8</a></p>
<p>I wish I could more investigate on connections of Adam Rubin and Michael Ian Black, but I have not so much time lately. So, if you can help.</p>',

           , he is a successfull children author who wrote Secret Pizza party, Dragons love tacos, Robot sauce...
          </p>
          <p>
           Despite parents on amazon reviews are saying that "they loved the other books but not secret pizza party", I wanted to look more inside the other books :
          </p>
          <p>
           Dragon loves tacos.

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           If you take again the tacos as "children" and the dragons as "pedophiles", all that "cute absurdity" makes suddenly sense in a terrible way :
          </p>
          <p>
           "they love big gigantic tacos and tiny little baby tacos as well", "if you want to make friend with dragons, tacos are key", 'dragon love parties,like costume parties (satanists) and pool parties (hollywood)", "get a boat and fill it full of tacos" (

           and says "So, despite my mantle as a children’s author, my sensibilities are not exactly G-rated."
          </p>
          <p>
           2) He said : “Dragons Love Tacos” is really a meditation on man’s struggle for emotional intimacy in a digital age. Very few children pick up on this, however." Emotional intimacy of an adult in a digital age" in a children's book ? WTF!

          <p>
           3) From 2001 to 2005, he belonged to the fraternity Sigma Alpha Mu in Washington university (Saint Louis)
           <a href="http://archive.is/POP6g">
            http://archive.is/POP6g
           </a>
           . Here we can see that in 2009, the fraternity is trying to re-form after being kicked off 15 years before
           <a href="http://www.gwhatchet.com/2009/04/06/sigma-alpha-mu-hopes-to-return/">
            http://www.gwhatchet.com/2009/04/06/sigma-alpha-mu-hopes-to-return/
           </a>
           . Wait. 2009 - 15= 1994. So how did Adam Rubin to belong to a non-existing fraternity. The article explains : in 2002, 25 brave guys are restarting it but not officialy. (So in 2001, in was maybe restarting it all by himself, hazing himself, forcing himself to drink pig blood in a crane, or smoking 35 packets of cigarettes in a row)
          </p>
          <p>
           Ok. What did Sigma Alpha Mu to be booted out ? Well, it was due to a risk management and alcohol violation. Really ?
          </p>
          <p>
           No.It was because of serious hazing cases and drug violation. I don't believe that Police department would do an investigation for few cocaine strokes in parties.
           <a href="http://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2012/07/10/fat-drunk-and-stupid-sigma-alpha-mu-frat-kicked-out-of-wash-u">

          <p>
           3) He had an article in NYtimes. How did that guy managed to have a free advertising in the most prestigious newspaper in USA ? Well he might have some connections with the writer : Michael Ian Black.

            OK,I felt really off about this book the other day. So I was doing a little research of my own. Not sure where I was but I clicked the buy now link and it took me to none other than Politics and Prose. Now I know that's a bookstore but what's the likelihood of linking to that bookstore before say Amazon or books a million or some other bookstore I frequent. And I had not been researching politics the prose. Although I had seen it mentioned on various threads.

             Had you been using Google maps to look at the area around Comet Pizza? Your device probably thinks you are in that area.
