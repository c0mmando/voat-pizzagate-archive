            Every time I see one of these "george webb" threads, I'm skeptical. The reason is because all these threads seem to be promoting the name GEORGE WEBB more than any info that might be in them. Why can't you just post the info instead of promoting the name GEORGE WEBB every single time? It's like you're trying to promote this guy as some kind of new "hero" like Alex Jones aka Bill Hicks. Some of this info is valid, but I'm very skeptical as to why this guy is constantly trying to promote his own name instead of any valid info he might have. Personally I haven't even looked at any of these GEORGE WEBB threads. It's clear that Bill "alex jones" Hicks is a fraud and staged opposition from the Talmudic mafia, and I have to wonder why there is this promotion of the name GEORGE WEBB all the time here, I think this guy is being pushed as some kind of new "hero" or something. For what do I need this clown GEORGE WEBB that he's always promoting his own name? All this can be and has been done with any involvement at all from GEORGE WEBB.

            Might want to include day 109 or is it 108 where George 'best guesses' Comet Pizza is used for grinding up the bodies when the med center in DC is finished harvesting.  Ask yourself, if public attention is on implied satanic abuse of babies and little children, and that said abuse has gone on for centuries, in controlling opposition what would be the best possible outcome?  Perhaps to shift attention from the satanic aspect/redirect it to organ harvesting and portray the satanic part as a CIA distraction.  Throw some ppl under the bus that were too brazen, in the hierarchy being that stupid brings its own consequences.  The sheeple can easily accept the validity of corrupt corps/govts/pedos/organ harvesting but the darker side of satanic worship is eventually forgotten.  The goal of course is to protect that knowledge from the general population.  Geo keeps saying the picture on Podesta's wall is an ad for heart organ harvesting and it is clearly cannibalism.  He says the same for Spirit Cooking/all advertisements for organ harvesting.  If someone's are indeed involved in cannibalism that is most certainly not something that you want the public to latch on to.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't figure out (yet) if George is just kinda stupid/naive...or controlled opposition.  For someone who has supposedly been on the 'screw totally with your life' list (fbi, jtts) for several years he manages to have a lot of free time to do vids and interviews/financially independent?
           </p>
           <p>
            What I do know about controlled opposition/limited hangouts are great percentage of the information is legit wherein false info is inserted to steer mass thought processes.  All I see in the Webb series is diverting attention from the darker side of child 'harvesting' to something more palatable idea wise in the general thinking stream.  Give the population a villain, pedos, organ harvesting and um, skip the rest, move along, nothing to see here.

             Cool, someone gave a point/not that points matter (but thanks
             <em>
              smile
             </em>
             ) bc I almost never post/just good to know at least someone is reading this.  Somewhere the dots do not connect and I'm not sure the reason but they DON'T CONNECT.  If you ck out 109 part 5, listen to his explanation of going undercover/doing research with brownstones via craigslist/Geo picked dominatrix (would never do children he emphatically states).  I'm finding so many red flags in his description of events.  I'll hold off on those for the time being and see if anyone sees the same inconsistencies.

             thank you! i've been downloading 360p version with youtube-dl and apparently the length of every video has been doubled, with everything after the content freezing into a still frame.. so not the most ideal set of backups, however, if everything gets nuked then it still works. i'll add your link.

            Gosh I didn't know that. But it makes sense once you read about it. So if they go to the dark side, and do the implants or some requested CIA procedure, they can make extra money.

            Dang!
It is also worth noting that Epstein has a dentist's chair in the Palm Beach home.[12] While there is no definitive reason why, one could speculate that it allowed Epstein or others to install in his victims audio recording devices in their molars before they were presented to high profile targets. The existence of such audio devices has been known to the public since at least 2002.

            George Webb is getting warmer. He is connecting dots at a rapid pace, and beginning to unravel some of the secrets and patterns involved. There is much more and it is threatening to destroy our communities, our nation and the world. Look at Racine, Wisconsin - it has all of the elements involved from community policing to racketeering to child trafficking and beyond.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look into connections to Racine, Wisconsin - it is a cesspool of corruption among Freemasons, Knights of Pythias, Pilgrims Society, Rotary and other secret and closed clubs and societies, with direct links to the Clinton Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, Agenda 21 and sustainability, and many other foundations and funnels of corruption and abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many people think this does not connect to them or affect them directly, but it is connected to everything.

             Hey, since you're from Wisconsin, do you now anything about Penzey's spices? I made a comment on a article on FB on one of the WaPo debunkings (I think I said they need to put more effort into these debunkings since the real isn't so easy to prove anymore) and I got a funny, winking reply from some lady that had the Penzey's  spices profile pic. I know that all heart within hearts or spirals doesn't mean pedo involvement, but their logo is both the heart within heart and as well as Disney font and raised my suspicions. The penzey's are also connected to the military (the pop served in Vietnam) and they are known for traveling the world for the best spices, which would make for a good cover story. Anyway might want to look into it.

            i think what's needed now are skilled writers to take what's being uncovered and to write concise summaries of what's goin gon. or to flesh out particularly complex aspects of the operation. right now there is a ton of good information floating around, but unfortunately it is all in the somewhat impenetrable format of a huge series of youtube videos. having nice concise summarized articles would do wonders for the accessibility of these ideas.

            i'll start hosting articles on this site as well.

            i compiled an archive of all of the most pertinent information related to this investigation, including backups of the all of the videos/interviews i've been able to find. i'm still missing several of the original 52 days of vanished videos, so if anyone happens to have those please let me know.

              it is, under Resources, somewhat. i'll be rearranging the site to try to make it more friendly for new users accessing it with no prior context for what's going on, but right now there aren't many good summaries. day 109 is okay, but it's still somewhat daunting. i think a concise summary would do wonders for it. i'm going to try to write something up soon.

               No, George stated that YouTube took down his videos 1-20 and a few others early on and he never put them back up but simply went forward from there. I am sure all the original files are backed up in multiple secure locations in case the DOJ has need of it.
