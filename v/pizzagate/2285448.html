<p>Corey Feldman shared excerpts of a lost 1993 audio recording he said was made during an interview with California law enforcement in which he divulged the name of a man who sexually abused him as a minor.</p>
<p>The audio played on &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot; Monday, which Feldman said he only recently discovered in his car, revealed Feldman naming actor Jon Grissom as his sexual molester when he was interviewed by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. Feldman was 15 years old at the time of the alleged abuse that he contends lasted for more than a year and a half.</p>
<p>Feldman thought the police were investigating Grissom at the time, but realized later they were investigating child molestation claims against his friend, pop superstar Michael Jackson.  
</p>
<p>&quot;They weren\'t interested in Jon Grissom,&quot; Feldman told host Dr. Mehmet Oz.</p>

<p>No, no, no, no, NO!!! Let me stop right here, you f*cking shill-brained SHILL!!!! THEY weren\'t trying to FRAME Michael Pedo Jackson, they were actually trying to follow up on a case! </p>

<p>Shocking charges Michael Jackson hushed up a decade ago with a big-bucks settlement were revealed yesterday in never-before-seen court papers detailing the entertainer\'s alleged sexual assaults on a young boy.</p>
<p>The four-page declaration sworn by the then-13-year-old boy in 1993 portrays the self-proclaimed King of Pop as a pedophile pervert who performed a sex act on the boy and cried like a baby when he didn\'t get his way.</p>
<p>The accuser, now 23, said Jackson cozied up to him and his family with shopping sprees, invites to his Southern California ranch and exotic trips. He claimed that he and Jackson innocently slept in the same bed before their relationship went from hugs to depravity.</p>
<p>&quot;He then started kissing me on the lips, first brief then for a longer period of time,&quot; reads the boy\'s statement, obtained by thesmokinggun.com Web site. &quot;He would kiss me while we were in bed together.&quot; </p>
<p>..... </p>
<p>In 1994, Jackson paid the boy\'s family a settlement reported to be $15 million to end a civil lawsuit.</p>
<p>No criminal charges were brought against Jackson, but Santa Barbara District Attorney Thomas Sneddon has said Jackson was &quot;never exonerated.&quot;</p>
<p>Jackson\'s spokeswoman, Marleah Leslie, did not return a call for comment last night. But the bombshell court papers accuse Jackson of being anything but innocent.</p>
<p>&quot;The next step was when Michael Jackson put his tongue in my mouth,&quot; the child said. &quot;I told him I did not like that. Michael Jackson started crying. He said there was nothing wrong with it.&quot;</p>
<p>The accuser, whose name is being withheld by the Daily News, claimed that Jackson told him how he kissed other young boys &quot;with an open mouth.&quot;</p>
<p>In May 1993, while the boy and his mother were on a trip with Jackson in Monaco, the Gloved One allegedly took his act a step further.</p>
<p>&quot;We took a bath together. This was the first time that we had seen each other naked,&quot; the boy said. He claimed Jackson told him about young friends who fondled themselves in front of him, and &quot;Michael Jackson then [fondled himself] in front of me,&quot; the boy said.</p>
<p>The boy said Jackson then performed a sex act on him. </p>

<p>This is the child\'s statement! This is what FELDMAN THE SHILL alllegedly helped HIDE!!!! </p>
<p>How many times is this idiot going to fool people into him saying anything? He has the money, he has the platform and he names JON GRISSOM?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah! JON GRISSOM is running Hollywood! I keep forgetting. And this goes out to Liz Crokin also. if you want to have any validity, stop lauding this shill!!!</p>',

            What people need to understand is that a majority of his fan base are Michael Jackson fans. Corey Feldman understands this and realizes they are the ones who pay any attention to him and pay the bills. I recently posted on my site www.mjvictims.com a twitter exchange between CF and another twitter user. This exchange was sent to me by that individual. I understand that Corey Feldman idolized MJ however he is now an advocate for Hollywood Child Exploitation and his personal feelings need to be put aside when discussing others who claim abuse. He could easily say although I do not believe that Michael Jackson was capable of raping a child I also respect these individuals who have come forward and if they were abused than they also deserve to be heard and treated with dignity. However he is incapable in my opinion because his motives may be skewed.

             Thanks for the very reasoned response.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're absolutely right that that is his fan base. And now that I think of it, it's yet another example of Feldman derivng power and authority from a DEAD friend. He's some sort of vampire. First, he drew power from being Haim's friend, and now MJ.
            </p>
            <p>
             He's a very very sick man. He's incapable telling the truth because he IS pizzagate. He's up to his eyeballs in it and that's why he can't even admit it exists. There'd be no reason for an actual victim to deny that this sort of thing COULD be true. Again, he could say, "I don't know anything about what's happening in DC or whether it's connected to the pedophile ring I know runs Hollywood." Nice, clean, concise, but NO! Pizzagate is a lie used to deceive.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unbelievable. Yup, he's a shill and a pedo protector.
            </p>
            <p>
             One last thing. I did see an article about why he was so loyal to MJ. He said something like, MJ protected him from the pedo predators giving him a hard time. So think of it that way. MJ was a pedo with massive power and influence. If Feldman took orders from one pedo, then it cut down the list of who he took orders from and who got to abuse him.

            Nothingburger as you call it probably didn't feel like a nothingburger to Corey. Maybe Corey should apologize to you for not getting molested by someone more famous. (hint: that's sarcasm)

            For the record,  I believe Cory is a hustler
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not deny early in his life he was a victim
           </p>
           <p>
            I've made many posts and comments
           </p>
           <p>
            I won't bash anyone on how they feel on a matter
           </p>
           <p>
            But I have seen nothing to change my mind about him
           </p>
           <p>
            If anything, I see Corey as hitting a cash cow and working it
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone has his back,  how or why, I don't know
           </p>
           <p>
            But his threats of exposure, is not be taken as such, that those involved high up in the Hollywood Pedo ring for some reason
           </p>
           <p>
            His ties to Hefner can not be fluffed off
           </p>
           <p>
            He seems to embrace being a victim, but the life he leads, his Angels come to mind, he's pulling The same shit
           </p>
           <p>
            He talks a lot of being a Father, but yet why did he spent so much time at the Playboy Mansion?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would Hugh have him there all the time
           </p>
           <p>
            After his fallout with Michael Jackson, ( just before his book came out, MJ no longer trusted him, left him high and dry at some concert in N.Y. during 9-11)
           </p>
           <p>
            Then started changing his story about Michael
           </p>
           <p>
            He has a habit of talking a lot about someone after they die
           </p>
           <p>
            Not sure what game he is playing, but he will never talk about people High up in Hollywood
           </p>
           <p>
            If you just would look at all the news on him,  how he has made money, his interviews, the people who have gone to his parties, great cash under the table, you would see what I see
           </p>
           <p>
            A Hustler,  I've seen so many of them
           </p>
           <p>
            Has he changed and wants to put it all out there?
           </p>
           <p>
            I've yet to see it
           </p>
           <p>
            But if you want to have faith in him to do the right thing, I give you that, as I expect to be given the same
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS is a no win situation,  he will never talk the big talk
           </p>
           <p>
            I not taking sides, I asked awhile ago if Corey was a shill,  I have done my own research
           </p>
           <p>
            This will be last comment on him, cause frankly I done with seeing him stringing everyone along while he's making money off it

             Yes, 9/11. I have a link on that. I didn't put it in the two-part posts on Brando/MJ/Feldman because of the stupid limit on how many characters you can have. I was just over the limit. So here it is. The story of MJ, Brando, and Elizabeth Taylor iin NYC together on 9/11. What are the chances?
            </p>
            <blockquote>

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              The three legends — who never spoke publicly about their 9/11 experience before their deaths, fueling the ­urban legend that was first printed in Vanity Fair — were in New York to participate in Jacko’s two concerts at Madison Square Garden on Friday, Sept. 7, and Monday, Sept. 10.
             </p>
             <p>
              On Tuesday, Sept. 11, they awoke at their Plaza hotel suites to find chaos. Jackson had been up early, about 4:30 a.m., searching newspapers and scouring the television for the first reviews of his shows.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             I should add that MJ's relationship with Taylor was kyboshed to hell by an expose written by employees of MJ. They never spoke when she stayed at the ranch. Never. So why was she there? Have a feeling it had to do with charities and money. Then there's giving MJ PR. I mean, Taylor was telling people he was all right in being friends with him and quashing growing rumors about him molesting little boys. Anyway, the story the employee told has been purged. I can't find it and it  used to be right there in any search I performed.
            </p>
            <p>
             And I'm with you about Feldman. I said what I said and it's important to communicate info. Some will get what's going on and some won't.

              Read that Feldman was suppose to have a back stage pass  waiting for him
             </p>
             <p>
              But was denied, and also his ride was taken away

             <p>
              Something about Corey's book coming out
             </p>
             <p>
              With what you wrote about a book, I can see MJ paranoia over it
             </p>
             <p>
              After that Feldmans story was changing
             </p>
             <p>
              Never came out and said MJ was a molester, but in vague way, was bringing stuff up.that would lead the reader to thing there was more

              I've read just too many stories on this guy

              Looked back to see when I asked if Feldman was a shill and realize it was marked a month ago

              <p>
               I distinctly remember when I flipped my opinion of Feldman. Somebody here redpilled me. Don't remember their name. I was 100% backing Feldman, thinking him a victim. Then a member posted the link to Feldman's tweets supporting Killary and calling pizzagate a big lie meant to deceive. They also posted a lnk to Corey's Angels, a video on YouTube. Was it taken on his birthday?  nearly fell over. Looked like something JA would host.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yup, I was redpilled and I thank the member for taking the time out to shove the proof in my face. That's why I don't give up on people. My mind and opinion changes as  learn and as we dig.

            Feldman is now a con man he needs money his acting career ended long ago so he decided to set up a Go Fund Me for his stupid "exposing the showbiz pedos" documentary and he wants to raise $10 Million if people are stupid enough to give him money he will keep $9 Million and spend one million on his bullshit movie.

            you do understand that the people who framed michael jackson, PAID people to make up stories about him, right?? you do understand that these people will stop at nothing to slander and discredit a target, right? MJ settled out of court to try and damage control a scary situation that he realized was getting out of control! some judge never exonerated MJ? CUZ HE'S IN ON IT! get it now? get how these things work?

            Feldman named Jon Grissom &amp; others because those were the individuals that were molesting him. however, he has stated that he KNOWS about others, many others. hence his plan to make a documentary film to try and expose the SYSTEM that is in place in Hollywood preying on children. he can't accuse people that didn't actually abuse him, but if he plays it right he can expose the system as a whole and bring this depravity into the light for the general public, which will THEN lead to more arrests.

             Nobody would sitribute such a film that exposes the entire system. He knows this. Feldman could have said anytime, including now, who is responsible for Haim and who the big predators are. He is an occultist and the symbolism in his fashion and other things have been pointed out online. They don't expose themselves, they distract and send you in the wrong direction. Hence these phony sexual perversion stories.

             You do understand that is NOT NORMAL for a grown man to SLEEP WITH CHILDREN, don't you? You do understand that it is NOT NORMAL for a grown man that is not a pedophile to associate with pedophiles, don't you? You do understand that it is ABNORMAL to use cosmetic surgery to change your face so you can resemble Peter Pan, don't you? You do understand that it is HIGHLY INCRIMINATING to keep paying off children that have alleged abuse, so much so that your own mother makes jokes about it, don't you? You do understand that it NOT NORMAL for an adult man to be obsessed with children, spend all their time with children, and, oh, yes, spend time COREY FELDMAN! Yes, it is HIGHLY SUSPECT that COREY FELDMAN, the man who has orgies, LOVES Killary, discredits PIZZAGATE (why are you here again if you think it's all blatant lies) and hangs with Corey's Angels, is asked and gives MJ SPERM so MJ can use it to inseminate a surrogate mother. He also asked Marlon Brando, Macaulay Culkin and others in his inner crcle. Oh, and Culkin was sixteen? And Culkin formed a band called PIZZA UNDERGROUND? But there's no pizzagate? And Feldman denies and shields Charlie Sheen saying that self-proclaimed warlock had nothing to do with molesting Haim. But, oh! Guess what? Corey Haim tells producer Ed Meyer that SHEEN AND MICHAEL JACKSON were responsible for the abuse! Yes, so Haim is in on this framing, huh?  And Feldman is too busy playing domnos on pasta to hear this?

              i don't know what the fuck amphetamine drug you are on, but YOU are a newcomer. you don't know everything! obviously MJ had psychological issues from his dad. he lost his childhood because of it and tried to relive it by idolizing children. but that DOES NOT, and i repeat DOES NOT prove he is a pedophile. he OUTED Tony Motolla of Sony records and took control of his career away from the power elite. that right there made him a target! they killed him for it! i personally think he paid certain people just to keep a lid on the slander that was happening around his name, image &amp; life. i just don't believe he is a pedo. i don't. not for one minute!
             </p>
             <p>
              i KNOW personally how these people operate because i am a target of them myself. that is something you have to go through or you just cannot understand it. they were trying to wreck MJ, and when that didn't work they offed him. period.
             </p>
             <p>
              as for Corey, i don't really know for sure what his motives are, but again, i come at it from a different perspective than you can EVER know. and for that you ought to be thankful. i am going to keep an open mind about Corey. he may not be perfect, but i think he could possibly add something valuable to this issue. you don't understand what he is going through, let me tell you it's a living hell. i'm giving him a break for now &amp; i will continue to follow his story.

                but you have to consider where this "wealth of evidence" comes from! you do not understand how these pedo scum work. they will stop at NOTHING to discredit someone who they perceive as a threat to their system. the depths of their depravity knows no bounds. they will lie, steal, misrepresent, frame &amp; slander someone and finally - they will kill the person. look what happened to prince. look what happened to chris cornell &amp; chester bennington. look what happened to dave chappell. (they killed him &amp; replaced him with a look-a-like - research it) look what they did to kurt cobain! (he shot himself with a long shot gun/rifle? really? NO - he was murdered for outing Geffen in the song "Rape Me.")

                they were determined to destroy michael jackson, and they did. first they destroyed his public image, then they destroyed HIM. i'm telling you straight up, if you haven't actually been through it, you have NO IDEA how far they will go to protect their system of sickness, a cancer on earth. they are pure psychopathy. michael was innocent. he was framed by the same people who we are railing against. you better wake up. everybody better wake up soon.

                 I don't know who you're trying to convince.

                 Parts are true. The Cannibal Elite will stop at nothing. On that we can agree. But who's a part of it? That's where we part company.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let me tell you this ... the Mafia? It's a lot like the Cannibal Elite, and you know what? The harshest punishment is dealt to those that are members of the Mafia. That's how you can tell who was actually in the mafia and who got in their way. The same holds true for the Cannibal Elite. If you're a member, NEVER try to hold out on them ... never ... you'll end up dead. But dead doesn't make that person innocent.

               Yes, t's hard for them to believe. I get the syndrome but it''s important to say. I've had my mind spun around by those emails. Now? If I'm presented substantial evidence, I believe the evidence, and not in some fantasy that was created to hide crimes.

            Feldman has always supported MJ.  It's possible MJ never molested him.  MJ was 100% a pedosexual.  The likelihood of him crossing the line into pedophile seems very high if he's allowed to sleep alone with various young boys. Just a natural progression.

            I think it's fucking hilarious how all the shills are coming out of the woodwork trying to discredit him, - especially with his support of Hillary last year. - Look, anybody who knows me on this board knows that I'm as skeptical of Feldman as anyone else. - But dude?!? - He was locked in that insane Hollywood bubble for fucking years. - He wears Micheal Jackson styled clothes. - ??? This guy ?? Of course he'd have supported Hillary?- He didn't fucking know any better. - I mean just because this guy got abused by some Hollywood bastards doesn't mean he has a fucking clue exactly how deep all this shit goes. - Look, - I'm as disappointed by the pin pointing of Jon Grissom as anybody, - because he's a fucking no body. But perhaps there is more to this entire story than meets the eye. - It just feels like the attack on him has been WAY too coordinated. - And there's no way for us to know if this was not a big fucking PsyOP - in which Fedlman is himself STILL a fucking victim? - How about his family? - How about his wife? - I'm sure those sick PedoWood Fucks have been all over him. The perfect way to weaken the whole pizzagate investigation is to just throw out a fucking red herring like Grissom. - Those fuckers are in full on damage control, and you know those fires over near the Getty and Santa Barbara. - Definitely fucking related. CD&amp;N was ahead of it, and those fuckers got wind of it. - This shit isn't over by a long shot.

            But, as ridiculous as this may sound to many,. when Santa Barbara caught on fire
           </p>
           <p>
            it occurred to me that maybe  evil powers set that city on fire in retribution to the Santa Barbara
           </p>
           <p>
            Sheriff's Department disclosing that they found and had working copies from the 1990s regarding
           </p>
           <p>
            Cory's  accusations.  I realize many cities in addition to Santa Barbara were/are on fire also.

             <p>
              Have no idea why the mods are deleting things. And why was all the hype about the interview allowed then? Remember the posts about Feldman about to leak the names? They were all over the place -- no problem! But the aftermath of that interview? Oh, no!!! Can't post that?

             You're not the only person to be suspicious of the fires. They seem contained to certain areas.

             Have no idea what purpose it would serve to burn everything down. I just don't.

            MJ was not a pedophile. The elite scumbags created all these lies and ultimately destroyed this man because they were not able to control him. I've read enough about him and his life to be 100% convinced he was innocent. RIP MJ.

            Here is an interview with his 3 body guards. They only have great words for him. They thought he was an awesome father and a kind person.

             Bodyguards? Miko Brando was a bodyguard for MJ. Miko Brando was Marlon Brando's son and Marlon Brando -- PEDOPHILE!
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is it that Marlon &amp; MJ clicked enough for Marlon to stay at Neverland?

             There is no arguing with someone. People still think Killary is a feminist who cares about justice for the poor.

            <p>
             Here's the thread I did about Brando and the part where he and MJ become bff's.

             <p>
              You think you're so knowledgeable but you don't know shit. You're asleep if you STILL think that MJ was a pedophile. The whole establishment spent an enormous amount of energy trying to destroy him, and they ultimately succeeded. The only thing he had was his FANS. The same BS fake news media we do have now such as CNN, MSNBC, ABC, Fox were attacking him like vultures... while actual pedophiles and child abusers were free to do business as usual. I've watch enough interviews of MJ and about MJ to know he was not the monster the media claimed he was.

              But having read several of your comments I know you're probably just a shill and I should not even be discussing with you.

            Feldman a shill?  I don't know.  At least he helps to spread the word  - and so maybe other victims will be taking the courage to come forward  and talk about
            <em>
             their
            </em>
            molesters, which maybe include bigger names. I don't know if Feldman knows more than he's telling. Maybe he just doesn't. Sometimes I think he maybe also has some...
            <em>
             erm
            </em>
            ...   "mental problems"...   when I see his ALL-CAPS-Twitter- posts....  but don't know, maybe he just likes writing like that or his Caps Lock-key is locked.
           </p>
           <p>
            We cannot expect him to tell the whole story...    but he can help to set off an avalanche...   "#metoo"  and the "Savile Effect" show  us, that "it" works.  Just if  he would get caught by spreading wrong accusations,  it would damage the whole anti-pedo-movement.

            If Feldman is a self-promotibg douche, so be it, but the guy has been trying to expose Hollywood pedophilia for at least 2 decades. Meanwhile, you are going after Feldman like it's your fucking job. Or you have a vested interest in discrediting him.

             Trying? He has been hinting. No names. All this dancing around. Needs 20 million to tell us. Never mentions Satanism. Never mentions DC elites or CIA control of Hollywood. Feldman is a limp wristed limited hangout. And he intentionaly makes himself a joke so nobody takes him serious. He has revealed nothing and is constantly invited on the propaganda network shows. It isn't because he is exposing them. Wake up already.

             He hasn't been trying. He's described both his and Corey Haim's abusers as being an elite Hollywood pedophile ring some of whom still run studios. Then when asked, he gives the name JON GRISSOM? Really? And all he's done is make money off a friend that he betrayed and who committed suicide. All you have to do is read one of Feldman's tweets:

            <p>
             Anyone that was a victim of pedophile like he's claimed would NEVER dismiss #PIZZAGATE as blatant lies used 2 DECEIVE. Would not! End of story! So you can rant on all you like, but Feldman has taken up enough of the world stage. And the only reason people have listened to him was because he was friends with Haim!

            Feldman delivered. He said he told the police who abused him and the tape reveals that he did. He has done more to red pill the public than anybody in Hollywood. Sorry his abuser does not meet your standards.

             The audio played on "The Dr. Oz Show" Monday, which Feldman said he only recently discovered in his car, revealed Feldman naming actor Jon Grissom as his sexual molester when he was interviewed by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office. Feldman was 15 years old at the time of the alleged abuse that he contends lasted for more than a year and a half.

            CNN is preparing a blizzard of slide material about "sexual impropriety" to bury pizzagate though. At 40 CNN stories, and 5 slide posts a piece from you, you should be able to get about 200 slide posts out of it.

             Feldman is an occultist, a perpetual liar and a joke. He needs 20 million to tell us who is responsible because he can only tell us by....making a movie. If the guy had anything meaningful to reveal, he wouldn't be on Dr OZ.

             MY OWN OPINION IS that Corey was doing
             <em>
              a lot
             </em>
             to red pill people before 95℅ of us here had been red pilled ourselves - before PizzaGate broke! The work he was doing whilst getting verbal abuse from that Barbara Walters hag seems very counterproductive for someone with the conflict of interest being suggested here. I just think that the way he's allowed to release the information is controlled in some way.
            </p>

             I mean no disrespect to anyone who disagrees, though. It just makes too little sense to start so early.

I believe his parents and legal guardians fucked this child actor because he has the right enemies.

               There are so many variables to consider, though. It is not unlikely that Corey was brainwashed and forgot that Michael was a pedo (that is, if he was one). Every aspect of Corey's narrative seems plausible to me, and if you haven't already, watching his truth campaign videos show a genuine man with his first chance to be heard after being shut down for so long. It just all seems to add up.

             Feldman is part of the problem; not the solution. He's containing things right. Can you imagine how many kids that have been abused must call him for advice? And what do you think he tells them? That he tried to tell what he knew and look what happened to him! But he never tried. He named Jon Grissom ... oh, I just had a thought! He did say that the police was working on a case for Jackson, right? He was probably sent in there to divert attention onto Grissom, but it didn't work.

             I can't believe how many people he's stringing along!  I mean, come on! He probably owed Grissom money or something. That's why he wanted the police after him, the stupid putz! Grissom is not the power elite and doesn't run Hollywood!!!

              Grissom is not in danger. They can accuse anybody they want to distract. Nobody goes to jail. They control head of police districts. This is old news. DC cops are occult pedo protectors. You guys keep ligitimizing the subvertyed system. How is the PG investigation going?

               Perhaps, - or perhaps he's being forced into leading everyone down this false path. - Blackmailed into some kind of false testimony operation. - And why the fuck is that tape just now coming out? - Too fucking convenient right?! Feels like I'm taking crazy pills. Why the fuck would they just let it out now? - Doesn't make any sense? - And Grissom!?!? Nobody gives a fuck about him!&gt;?  - I think they threatened him, and then forced him to play along under some kind of threat. - Can't know for sure. - I'm also... I mean why the fuck does he still worship MJ. Sometimes I wonder if MJ was being abused and blackmailed. - The pedo shit was their way to control him and his decisions. - And he was always talking about how the record execs and bigwigs were trying to steal from him and fuck him over. - And then days after he died, you've got what most investigators would call and orgy of evidence at his estate after he passed away. - It seals the story shut. Got to understand more about the relationship between MJ and Feldman. - McCaulkin too. - The things they have in common go further than just being big in Hollywood around the same time. - People have got to start looking at the connections between those three as in producers, directors, studio execs. - Then go from there. - This Feldman shit is now getting creepier, and more suspicious than it has EVER been.

                Imo, Feldman and Culkin were both abused.  Culkin is still protecting MJ because he is also either being payed off or that is what victims do for their abusers sometimes.  There are many reasons they do not tell.  Embarrassment, Shame Adoration of their Abuser, and I believe Feldman could be either blackmailed or after being abused so many times by many he decided to play the same game.  He can't make money with that band, so he gets paid to be quiet.  There are many who are rich enough to shut him up until they die.  Sheen is one and Geffen is another.  I opt for Geffen.  He pretty much owns LA.

                 Feldman has built his career on the back of Jacko. He has also defended him countless times. If he turns around now and calls Jacko out, he will be labeled a shill and the boy who cried wolf and will never be believed about anything again. 
I mean, if he calls him out and has definitive PROOF Jacko abused him, McCauley etc, then maybe folk may be more forgiving.
Hmmm. Not sure what to think.

                 It's one thing to destroy a stranger, but when  you see someone that cares about you spiraling down and so unhappy as to commit suicide, well, that takes a special kind of evil.

                  Yes, I think they get roped in and then make their decision to proceed or not.  He evidently took the low road instead of the high road.  That speaks volumes of Feldman.  My heart is so very sad for Haims with even his Mother throwing him under the bus by lying.  Still.

                    Yes, getting over the rape is one thing but your mother throwing you under the bus and indifferent?  Wonder how she makes her money now that he's gone?  Parroting whatever Feldman says?  Polly wants a Cracker.
