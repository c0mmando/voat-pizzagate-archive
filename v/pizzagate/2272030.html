            Both Bill and Hillary have skated too long
           </p>
           <p>
            The info has always been there
           </p>
           <p>
            Did Bills real Father help with connections so he and Hillary never got busted for Anything?
           </p>
           <p>
            Loved the comparison of the Clinton brothers and the Podestas
           </p>
           <p>
            There is also a connection to Stephen Paddock here in Little Rock through Marilou
           </p>
           <p>
            Her ex husband Danley has and does live in Little Rock
           </p>
           <p>
            Both moved to Reno,  she worked at Atlantis Casino which is Saudi owned
           </p>
           <p>
            Her and Danley split up and Marilou started seeing Paddock
           </p>
           <p>
            It's all connected somehow

             Wow.  Yes, I believe Paddock was connected through what was going on in Mena.  Connected through Barry Seal.  He either worked with him and took his place or both.  Running arms down to Columbia and bring drugs back on the return flight. They killed Seals because he was becoming to Hot. Things were probably getting too hot for Paddock, so Bang Bang.  Or they gave him a New Face and Life.  I go for the Bang Bang.

              Damn Carmencita, you're so right!! You know how when you just know that what you read or heard someone say is the real deal?  Cause what you just stated is more on the $$ than anything so far. Yes, it goes all the way back to Mena!!!

               Yeah, I believe it does.  But Hill and Bill go even further back through their parents and other relatives.  As I just wrote in the comments, that I believe reading on here, that Hill's dad had contact with Capone or his outfit in some way.  Things were already in place. Also, Mena is not too far from Texas either.  Bush Country.

               I am going to read more this evening.  Does it not amaze you how much there is on here all day. There is so much to learn and yes, there are surprising reveals like you just mentioned.  Bill and Hillary and their families go further back than many believe.  People think it all started with Hill and Bill, but no, I think I remember reading something about Hillary's grandfather and father involved with the Mafia.  They have connections and rat lines all over the country, and going way back. The rat lines were already in place in Chicago, because of Capone. So how hard can that be to set up their kind of operation. Just join in on the fun. Remember she was raised in Park Ridge, but She Was Born in Chicago.

                Capone loved Hot Springs
               </p>
               <p>
                All kinds of vices with little interference from the law
               </p>
               <p>
                I think Clinton's drug and pedo parties were the beginnings of his politic run
               </p>
               <p>
                Blackmail can be a beautiful thing for people with no conscience
               </p>
               <p>
                I just can figure out if it was mob connections with blackmail that got them in white house, or if maybe Bills true father and CIA got him there
               </p>
               <p>
                I thinking maybe both
               </p>
               <p>
                Also like you said, ties to Chicago come up a lot
               </p>
               <p>
                But I read it was the Mafia of New Orleans, where mama Clinton went to college,  that ran gambling operations in Hot Springs
               </p>
               <p>
                Guy named Marcello
               </p>
               <p>
                Mama Clinton loved to drink, gamble and party
               </p>
               <p>
                You'll also find Clinton's ties to Indonesia and China there
               </p>
               <p>
                Also didnt realize Bills maternal Grandma was a  morphine addict
               </p>
               <p>
                Also Mama Clinton had some lawsuits, her nurses record wasnt that great
               </p>
               <p>
                Lol sry,  I finding so much stuff,  would take a lot of time to put all this in numerous posts
               </p>
               <p>
                My Christmas wish is for something huge and solid to come out on the Clinton's, with an arrest for the New Year.
               </p>
               <p>
                Couldnt stand them in the White House, and now, SMH, these people need to be hung out to dry,  prison without amenities,  only so much in account

                 Guantanamo would be a Perfect Place.  It must be quite Nice and Balmy there. Peace and Quiet.  No one to bother them. Far away from The Maddening Crowd.  PS.  Thanks for all the Juicy Tidbits.   Hmm.  Clinton in Indonesia/BO in Indonesia, what could be more interesting.

                  Did you know they were selling blood from Arkansas prisons to a Canadian broker and elsewhere overseas in 1983/84 until Aids hit?

                   Blood Drinking Parties for the European Royals?  Already doing Transfusions?  I am sure they had many uses for it that we did not even know existed.
