            who cares about hurting the feelings of dirtbag celebrities ? the same ones who benefit from hurting these kids. fuck them.  target enemies of the movement. make Megan (I'm not spelling it with a y you corporate shill ) Kelly would make a great mouthpiece. if she goes on air more than twice to defend this she starts looking crazy

            you might be right with Mcaulley,, but Corey Feldman seemed sincere. I think if he came out w names now [or at least after jan] knowing he had the support of the pizzagate movement he might feel safe.... could just be being hopeful but it couldn't hurt to tweet the guy on mass :) . #pizzagate still has plenty of steam and doesn't look like it's going anywhere despite all the efforts of msm

            has anyone tried to hit up that Corey lad,, the one who openly said that hollywood's biggest problem was pedo's but he was scared to name names... seems he really wants to do something about it,, no better time than now!  or even Mcaully,, that lad and his pizzaunderground band surely want to tell us something!!

            Do a variety of random famous people of all kinds. Suggestions:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Elon Musk (genius that everyone listens to).

            <li>
             <p>
              Nancy Grace (crime media broadcaster).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Chris Hansen (from Dateline NBC's "To Catch a Predator").
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Azaeilia Banks (outspoken politically-incorrect chick; double-check the spelling on her name).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Leah Remini (actress who is speaking out against, and exposing the cult of Scientology).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              John Walsh (host of criminal catcher shows "America's Most Wanted" and "The Hunt", and father of a kidnapped/murdered child).
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            These are just a few suggestions. These would be believable people who would talk about a subject like pizzagate.

            It is ultimately harmful. When all of those people realize they were trolled, they are not going to care that they were trolled for a good cause in the eyes of some. They are only to care that someone trolled them and made them look foolish. People who are reached in this way will be lost just as quickly, and many will then view the entire pizzagate awareness effort as trollish nonsense over a very serious topic. We need to uphold integrity. We can't control everybody who pops up online claiming to champion pizzagate research/awareness, but we can at least control our own quality of character.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is already too much working against this investigation and efforts to raise awareness.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              People deliberately posting disinfo / things taken out of context for the typical histrionic edgelord troll reasons.

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              People deliberately posting disinfo / things taken out of context because to them it is just a tool to push a partisan narrative and nothing more.

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              People deliberately posting disinfo / things taken out of context in the hopes of getting people to fall for it and then mocking them, in order to smear the entire investigation in the process.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The mainstream media mocking it and cherry picking bad evidence to 'debunk' the whole thing in the eyes of the masses.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Government members trying to use the whole thing to push for more censorship / the death of free speech.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Actual pedophiles coming out of the woodwork to act like persecuted victims and then try to normalize pedophilia once they have guilt tripped people.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Actual serious child predators hoping to intimidate those speaking up about pizzagate with threats of violence and more.

            Seriously this investigation doesn't need anything else working against it, like people providing examples of investigators deliberately trolling and tricking others.

             they have no rules. why limit ourselves? your commitment to moralistic principles is admirable. however in a fight for survival does one not do whatever is necessary?  it would at least force the cloned accounts to address the issue publicly if a large enough response it attained.   CNN is a great example of this principle in action.  as long as you hit the public with enough media hard enough long enough the 97% tend to believe it.

              is there not a critical point in any social system where everyone's secret becomes no one's secret. what is our real goal here? I would say groundswell to act as leverage against elected officials.  if pizzagate is every American's dinner conversation the groundswell has been attained.  this must happen before either A: some 9/11 type event. or B: the war they want so bad starts

              the average American needs to know who to point the finger at when it all goes sideways.

            could be me but is impersonating / identity theft really a good way to get PG out? It seems like this is ammunition for the Russian Hack team.
