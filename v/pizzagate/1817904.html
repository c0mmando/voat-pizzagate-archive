An Australian television series, <em>Sunday Night</em> on Channel 7, aired a documentary which included fascinating testimony from the original lead investigator on the case, Goncalo Amaral. To date, the disappearance of Madeleine McCann remains &quot;the most heavily reported missing-person case in modern history&quot;.</p>
<p>Goncalo Amaral, a Portuguese detective who led the case for six months, said he believed that British secret agents \'for sure had an involvement\' when Maddie went missing at the age of 3 in 2007. He claimed MI5 helped to hide her body and that even former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was involved in the cover up. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Goncalo Amaral was previously sued by the McCanns after his resignation from the case. Amaral wrote a book using police files with the theory that Madeleine had died in her family\'s apartment. The McCanns took legal action, saying there was no evidence and his work was defamatory. Amaral would actually win this case, however.</p>
<p>The documentary itself is available on YouTube:</p>

            God, sitting here reading that, it sure did take on a weird vibe around ALL of the money that has been spent on this case over the years. Was it this way in the Jon Benet Ramsey 'debacle'?

             I'd think they are pretty close cost-wise. Jon Benet, however, didn't have intelligence agencies involved if I am remembering correctly. It's not every day James Bond and MI5 help find your kid.

           <p>
            Here is one such story quoting him from March.

            This was all revealed in Amaral's book, "The Truth of the Liie," published in July 2008.
There was nothing new in that (tabloid) broadcast.
