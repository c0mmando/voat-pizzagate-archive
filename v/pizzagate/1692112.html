<p>Many investigators have grown suspicious of the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( ICMEC ) and <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1678736">information</a> has been provided that appears to connect John Podesta to the Brian Podesta at the ICMEC. <a href="https://voat.co/user/DonaldWashington">@DonaldWashington</a> \'s excellent <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1688672">submission</a> breaks down the network of the ICMEC. Included in the post is a <a href="http://archive.is/afltL">group photo</a> of the Board of Directors from 2014 with name tags attached to all but <strong>one person</strong>. Hmmm, who could it be? Well, it\'s none other than Patty Wetterling. Besides being a board member of the ICMEC,  Patty is also the Chairperson of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) that has been connected to none other than <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1431715">James Alefantis and Laura Silsby.</a>  Her biography is remarkable and replete with an incredible number of coincidences that have placed her at the center of the child abduction and exploitation advocacy world for nearly three decades. 
Patty was born in Omaha, Nebraska, home of the now uncovered Franklin Cover Up, and grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota, raising 4 kids. She was thrust into the national spotlight in October of 1989 when her 11 year old son Jacob was abducted. Four months later, she and her husband set up a foundation in his name and Patty became the leading advocate for legislation that would produce the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Wetterling_Crimes_Against_Children_and_Sexually_Violent_Offender_Registration_Act"> National Sex Offender Registry in 1994.  </a> </p>
<p>Jacob\'s disappearance and the subsequent actions and statements by his parents are both problematic. Accompanied by his brother and a friend, Jacob was traveling by bicycle to the local convenience store to rent a video when a man drove up, got out of his vehicle and stopped them at gunpoint. He asked the ages of all three boys and when Jacob answered \'11\', he was taken. The other two boys were told to run and not look back or they would be shot. You can get all the details <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Wetterling">here</a>, but two items are huge red flags. Jacob was specifically targeted and the age question by the abductor clearly indicates that. And if he was targeted, the abductor was tipped off that he would find 3 boys on bikes on the road to the video store and he was to take the 11 year old. Who were the only persons who knew the boys were on that road and who told the kidnapper Jacob\'s age?<br />
The show \'A Current Affair\' interviewed Patty and her husband Jerry and that interview contained many signs of deception and I found both of them entirely <a href="https://youtu.be/DCOn-vDVP-U?t=92">unconvincing</a>. Shades of Sandy Hook parents are glaring: no tears, head shaking, eye contact avoidance, etc. Additionally, the framing of Jacob\'s abduction by the MSM mirrored the concepts of hope, forgiveness and community also borne out of Sandy Hook. Another huge part of the case ( since ignored ) involves the discovery a large volume of child porn later found in the possession of a local sex offender. What did it contain that relates to the case? Nothing other than naked pictures of Jacob Wetterling taken <strong>prior</strong> to his abduction. Let that sink in for a moment. I suspect I know who the photographers were, do you? </p>
<p>Jacob remained missing for 27 years with no hard leads or suspects. That was until last September when police arrested Danny Heinrich on child pornography charges, also an original suspect in Jacob\'s abduction. Out of the blue and without coercion, he confessed to Jacob\'s murder and led police to a body. The timing of the confession and the deal made with police in avoiding all prosecution for Jacob\'s kidnapping and murder are extremely dubious and suspicious. Why would he choose that moment after nearly 30 years of silence, to clear his conscience? </p>
<p>Youtuber and ritualistic child abuse survivor David Shurter, by random chance was asked about Jacob Wetterling on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BieiPoWV4k&amp;t=713s">radio show</a> two months prior Heinrich\'s confession. Shurter is certain that his own father is actually responsible for Jacob\'s abduction and spells out his case in convincing detail. He is adamant that his statements about Jacob and the timing of Heinrich\'s confession are directly <a href="https://youtu.be/0QyScbarpp4?t=283">connected</a>. He feels strongly that the remarkable timing of Heinrich\'s confession was tied to the election, and so do I. But the election was not the only factor. The confession was desperately need to bury the relationship between the Podesta emails, the NCMEC and Patty Wetterling.</p>',

            The Wetterling bros. both had brown hair while their friend was a toe-head blonde. The theory is intact, because the Blonde would have been excluded with a simple tip from the person who triggered the abduction ( the Wetterlings ). Take a swing at Patty's perch atop the increasingly suspicious NCMEC and go through the very shady interviews they gave after Jacob's abduction.  When you finish with that, try and explain how Jacob was in child porn videos PRIOR to his abduction and why the Wetterlings were NEVER questioned about nor mention that disturbing fact.

            Thank you for this post. The 'story' sounds as fake as the Adam Walsh and Natalee Holloway 'abductions'. There's a lot of money to be had for parents who are willing to sell their own children.

            Wow this is super interesting. Good work, OP. I looked on the Jacob Wetterling Wiki page and this certainly jumped out at me:
           </p>
           <p>
            "In early 2009, the Milwaukee Police Department discovered child pornography and an alleged video of Wetterling taken before the abduction in the home of Vernon Seitz, 62, of the St. Francis, Wisconsin, area. Seitz had died in his house, but officers asked for additional assistance after the pornography was discovered. Along with the child pornography,
            <strong>
             articles involving missing children and maps of the cities from which children had disappeared were found in Seitz's home
            </strong>
            .
            <strong>
             Seitz claimed that he had been abducted, sexually assaulted, beaten, and forced to kill a 14-year-old boy in 1959
            </strong>
            , but family members and local police doubt that this had occurred."
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Yeah you guys definitely should read the source of that paragraph and tell me there isn't some weirdly familiar stuff happening in there (hint:
            <em>
             collected artwork of tortured children
            </em>
            , had books on cannibalism).

             Wow he was kidnapped from the zoo in Racine-maybe that guy on here is right about the pedo corruption in Racine. It's heartbreaking to know what being sodomized and raped as a young boy does to them, they are truly traumatized for life and more then likely will repeat the abuse. I know what it does to girls from experience but I've always thought it has to be so much worse for a boy. Sad

             There are many 'abductions' that should be questioned... For one... Beth Holloway has gutted her Facebook... as has Joyce Kesse (mother of Jennifer Kesse)... Natalee's brother Matt's attempt at extorting another $85,000 on GoFundme was thwarted right before Pizzagate started to break... Etan Patz's parents... where are the tears??? There are more cases where I do not believe the official story, but I'll leave it at that for now and wait for input from others.
