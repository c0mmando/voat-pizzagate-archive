<p>My goal is not to reassure you, but to tell the truth ! Bishops are neither unscathed nor untouchable: they are all just as much sinners as are others !!! let it be said once and for all… they do not enjoy papal infallibility…! But of course as soon as one tries to tell the truth, you have your head cut off, or you “have a bad spirit”…. it’s been over twenty years since I said what I had to say…. now believe what you want, but I can tell you as being the direct witness that Vigano is telling the truth:** I was the direct witness ! these may be the last lines I write… if I am found chopped up by a chainsaw and my body sunk in concrete, the police and the hacks will say that we have to consider the hypothesis of suicide **!!!</p>

            This so stood out to me in the article you linked.  The conversation of Msgr. to the blogger.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the Monsignor's answer freezes the blood: "Because those cracks mentioned by Paul VI, from which Satan's smoke would have slipped into the house of God, have become chasms. The devil is working great. And not to admit it, or turn your face to the other side, it would be our greatest sin ".
           </p>
           <p>
            The devil is in the House of God.

             The Catholic Church needs to be turned upside down and inside out and fumigated. The guilty clergy should go to prison and be executed if they've committed capital crimes, and the rest of the clergy should put on sackcloth and ashes for their silence, weakness and cowardice.The blind, willfully ignorant Catholic sheeple also deserve excoriation for their refusal to face facts and demand answers. The devils could not have succeeded without the aid or indifference of many others.
            </p>
            <p>
             I keep thinking of a former friend who demanded I stop "gossiping" about our pastor who allegedly groomed a young altar boy and was living with him when he turned 18, among other allegations. The same pastor also brought a suspended fugitive priest into the parish to manage the altar boys, but my devout Catholic friend would not allow me to tell her about it. She ran away with her hands over her ears.

              I have a friend like that too.  Actually two of them.  They both quickly changed the subject when I brought up the grand jury report and the 301 priests.  They did not want to hear about it, even though I tried to squeeze it in two more times.  They were both devout Catholics and both Irish.  I am dumb founded.  I even inserted the news of Tuam.  Shocked.  They do not attend Church and one defends priests to some extent, saying the abuses are horrible yadayadayada.  Maybe I should put my hands over MY hears when they speak.  LIVID.

             <p>
              YES!  Those Holy Roller Catholics that defend no matter what, they need to be called out.  They need to be countered at every turn.  No more ignoring their excuses and covering for those that quietly have been allowing these abuses to continue and supporting this Villain-ous Pope.  Jorge has got to go!

                These are good friends of mine.  I am ready to cross them off.  At least cut down my meetings with them.  I don't need this.  I never thought either one of them were sheeple. Ugh.  It's ugly but God, don't you want to know rather than not.  I just don't get it.

                 I understand the crossing them off completely, except if they are good friends, you'd think that they would ask questions and want to discuss it.  The "friend" factor is dwindling in my world.  I can't imagine hanging out with people anymore who can't stomach the truth, even family members.  Pride is a powerful force and a lot of people cannot face the truth, even if they know it might be.  They don't want to be embarrassed or emotionally upset.

                  I feel the same way.  A family member can believe the truth about 911 but not about Hillary and Bill being involved in child sex trafficking.  Probably because the word is out that Bush was involved.  She is a diehard dem.  I was too but one with an open mind.  Brain washing has really taken hold.

I am heartened to hear that there is another High Level of the RCC that is courageous enough to put his life on the line and Stand Up for Vigano and the Victims.  I am going to forward this post and link to Our Victim/Survivor

             Archbishop Chaput (of Philadelphia) supported Vigano, as well as Cardinal Burke, and some other bishops in the U.S. It's a train wreck for FrancisChurch, and we know it's just the tip of the iceberg. I don't believe there would be
