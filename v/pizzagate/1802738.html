<p>Monarch Programming is a method of mind control used by numerous organizations for covert purposes. It is a continuation of project MK-ULTRA, a mind-control program developed by the CIA, <a href="https://s23.postimg.org/x7buxcl3f/image.png">NASA</a>, and tested on the military and civilians. The methods are astonishingly sadistic (its entire purpose is to traumatize the victim)  and  the expected results are horrifying: The creation of a mind-controlled <a href="https://s18.postimg.org/8swg0rwuh/2ultra1.jpg">slave</a> who can be triggered at anytime to perform any action required by the handler.  
</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Origins</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the course of history, several accounts have been recorded describing rituals and practices resembling mind control. One of the earliest writings giving reference to the use of occultism to manipulate the mind can be found in the <a href="http://www.maxspiers.com/?p=236">Egyptian Book of the Dead</a>. It is a compilation of rituals, heavily studied by today’s secret societies, which describes methods of torture and intimidation (to create trauma), the use of potions (drugs) and the casting of spells (hypnotism), ultimately resulting in the total enslavement of the initiate. Other events ascribed to black magic, sorcery and demon possession (where the victim is animated by an outside force) are also ancestors of Monarch programming.</p>
<p>It is, however, during the 20th century that mind control became a science in the modern sense of the term, where thousands of subjects have been systematically observed, documented and experimented on.</p>
<p>When a lot of this horrific information came out in 1977, the project was supposedly scrapped. But a growing number of people believe that the project continued underground, and began focusing on the only people who could truly influence the mass population: Celebrities. In fact, any time a tangentially famous person begins to act slightly odd, MK Ultra truthers come out of the woodwork claim that the breakdown is evidence of their MK Ultra programming failing. Today we’re taking a closer look at one of those celebrities who just might be under MK Ultra mind control....</p>

            My post on Joan Baez , victim of MKUltra, was taken down by Millennial Falcon almost immediately, citing rule #2.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet it was well sourced, including a great book full of high impact information. Apparently, he does not count books as a source.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her "folk song" with a description of child rape and murder in a Satanic ceremony is interesting in light of her background as a victim of MKUltra, through her father's employment with the CIA.

            You have to wonder what kind of mods are operating here.

              I have made anew post on Joan Baez: "Joan Baez lyrics in light of pizzagate: "folk song" describes SRA and child sacrifice. Her father was on the faculty of MIT in 1958, and worked for the CIA".

            I'm very interested in this school of thought, but to clarify, because those who have said similar things have not spelled this out, are you saying that aliens do not exist? Or that they may/may not exist but they do not abduct humans?

             Take it from me and I should know... "IAMDeMolay"..... Everything you believe to be true is false. Take NASA's founder for example "Wernher von Braun's" ~ He left a little clue on his tombstone for the very thing I'm subtly referring to. Go find it and the truth shall set you free....Peace out.

            See this just makes sense. I've always thought alien abductions were really rapes. They run in families, mm hm, and they typically result in penetration and soreness, mm hm... I think the people who claim to have been abducted are honest, they've just been lied to very effectively by their abusers.

            Excellent post. I've come across many crazy theories, and it usually always fits in together in the end. Unfortunately it is not the end..

            Isn't the first claim a little out of order.  Monarch was the original Nazi program that became MK-Ultra in the states.

             Your kinda right in the sense it has only been in the realm of science until the 1930’s when a physician by the name of Josef Mengele brought it into full practice within Nazi concentration camps....However....

             Monarch mind control is named after the Monarch butterfly and refers to the Monarch it self ( Egyptian Royalty Who Still Rule) – The "Monarch butterfly" an insect who begins its life as a worm (representing undeveloped potential) and, after a period of cocooning (programming) is reborn as a beautiful butterflies (the Monarch slave).
            </p>
            <p>
             Mind control techniques have been noted throughout history and you kind trace it's origins back to Egypt, hope i helped.

            fiona has mentioned molly meldrum as an australian celebrity being involved in these circles and he worships anything egyption. i think the egyption culture is highly revered by the celebrities and their handlers. i can remember growing up with a lot of egyption references coming from disney movies. and the covert kidnapping of citizens under the guise of alien abductions is no surprise to me but what is with all the raping ? for gods sake they are f*cking obsessed with raping people. i wish i could get all the naughty men in the world spank them all soundly and send them to bed and when they get up in the morning make them behave themselves because they are all out of control... i have a theory about robin williams too. he had advancing dementia and i think his wife may have been his handler. i think they were worried he was going to start spitting things out in public so they got rid of him. he was nothing to them but the rest of the world was horrified to lose him. if they have been concentrating their efforts on celebrities that would explain why so many famous people that the public loved have been dying mysteriously. its such bullshit isnt it.

            You're forgetting the biggest 'redpill' of them all is what you are describing is a condensed version while similar, more subtle programs of the same nature are going on all around you daily throughout your lifetime. Combine the Rockefeller/Carnegie funded Frankfurt model schooling platform, (that culls, sorts, and classifies while others are trained only so far as to be satisfied sitting behind a machine for 8-10 hours a day. "Others" usually systematic dickheads and bullies are wrangled and compromised through their greek letter affiliations to become the ruling and governing class) along with a systematic takeover of every industry, religion, entertainment (books, movies, print), science (spaceflight and academia) and government, along with the DAILY SHOCKS OF SURVIVAL AND THE DAILY BOMBARDMENT OF PROPAGANDA YOUR ENTIRE LIVES...
           </p>
           <p>
            You will soon understand that your entire lives are an illusion.

             Of course our lives are an illusion, created by man, until that is.... one realizes the good lord wrote about all of this in the bible to show us a path to salvation.  It is all so much more clear to me now than as a child, and I admit I need to read the whole bible not the bits and pieces that I have.  If you look up the words of Jesus and read through what he has to say he comments directly on the topic of children.  Over and over again, literally it seems to be one of his most focused concerns, is that of children.  He says multiple times (paraphrasing) that look to children as your way to emulate the almighty.  Jesus also refers to Lucifer as the God of this earth and at one point translations reveal mind control (2 Corinthians 4:4).  This is profound when you consider what is happening.  A dark force, one that opposes good (for me this is satan vs. God) can corrupt and destroy humanity by hitting us as infants.  Its not a pedo conspiracy, it is the frontline of the battle of good vs. evil as Craig the sawman Sawyer put it.  An age old conspiracy.  This is Biblical.  In the end of times evil will be accepted and commonplace.  Rape us as infants because its normal within society or accepted in the future world and I believe we can start to understand glutinous carnage.  Pray, it is one thing that we all should be doing regularly.

             The mind is a powerful force. It can enslave us or empower us. It can plunge us into the depths of misery or take us to the heights of freedom. Learn to use the power wisely.

            The Joan Baez post was just taken down.  Too bad.  It had the words to her SRA song she wrote.  Also, it mentioned that Cornell U. is where all the MK Ultra stems from.  This is the first I heard of Cornell.  Will have to research it.  Thanks for the Post.  Upvoat for you.

              It should have qualified because of the SRA which we have been posting and commenting on here for some time.  Plus the connection to the CIA.  You should try to do it again.  It should be very strategically worded.

             Racine, Wisconsin has deep ties to Cornell University. Look at who the colleges are named after. Then connect that to Pizzagate and pedo crimes in Racine where extreme levels of corruption and trafficking are taking place and being covering up. Racine has a history of corruption tied to the mafia and secret societies, and is linked to every aspect and major hub - DC, Pennsylvania, Arizona, New York, Denver, Haiti, Ghana, Norway, UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Brazil, and including major ties to Clinton, Bush, Soros, Anthony Weiner, Chuck Schumer, Robert Byrd, John McCain, Ashton (Chris) Kutcher, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
             Racine, Wisconsin is Paul Ryan's district, and is an epicenter for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. We need help to pressure Trump and Sessions to begin indictments in Racine immediately, and are growing concerned that the rumors of heinous crimes involving Donald Trump and children may be true. Either Trump is compromised and we need to hold him accountable for those crimes, or he needs to restore law and order and open the flood gates of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption starting with Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus' back yard of Racine, Wisconsin - a massive swamp that is covering up extreme criminal activity and an underworld of bribery, blackmail, trafficking, torture, gang stalking, extortion, racketeering, bid rigging, fraud, embezzlement, records tampering, abuse of power, misconduct in office, illegal campaigns, censorship, pedo crimes, satanic ritual abuse, collusion, fake news, corruption and a rigged system. Racine is a testing ground for "sustainability", vaccines, viruses, community policing, community surveillance, election rigging, trafficking, and other crimes against humanity.

             The last mayor of Racine was arrested for pedo crimes, and the new corrupt mayor and city administrator, and an unusual number of other officials including the corrupt District Attorney, have all resigned very recently amidst allegations of extreme criminal corruption. We believe Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe and Loretta Lynch among others responsible for investigating these abuses are corrupt and need to be held accountable for their involvement in the crimes and cover up.

             How do you think Paul Ryan and Reince Priebus became so powerful? It is because of what they are covering up in their back yard.

                i think he's part of the elite circles. you cant be a billionaire and not move in those circles with the top strata that is ruling the planet. there was an unprecedented outpouring of love for trump after the election and now ww3 has begun. its just what they wanted. i personally feel dazed and confused

                It is very likely they have control over him through either a video tape or threats to his family. They would not release anything they could leverage against him. They would rather he be in power to break up the opposition.

                Either Trump is lying or Robert David Steele is lying, or more likely both are. This is why Racine, Wisconsin is a litmus test for Trump - it is a sure thing. It is a corrupt cesspool linked to the global elites. If Trump does nothing about Racine, we all know he is compromised.

              Well you have really bowled me over.  I did not vote for Trump but am willing to give him a chance.  But as of late I am wondering if what we have been waiting for will ever happen.  Yes, I agree if he is guilty of some heinous crime we must demand punishment.  I agree that something must be organized to pressure Trump to move quickly and bring these criminals to justice.Yes, Racine sounds like a cesspool.

               There's no reason for Trump to be compromised.  The man has beautiful women falling all over him &amp; if there was a video out there it would have been shown already.  The Access Hollywood video was supposed to take him down, so were the 2 women who were paid to say that they were raped.  He's the Teflon Don.  I also believe that he's disgusted with this pedophilia in the govt but he's treading lightly.  When he promised to drain the swamp, I don't believe he realized that the swamp was an ocean.  His top 2 FBI are compromised, the CIA is completely corrupt, he's got Senators and Reps that are in fear of their careers when exposed, I'm sure there's a bounty on his head and Obama is working VERY hard in the shadows to ruin him.  His election changed the course of how our govt was planned for 70 yrs. &amp; he's in real danger.  He has to be very systematic on how he dismantles the corruption or it won't work.

                  I just hope it is true.  I am afraid to believe in almost anyone anymore after what we have discovered.  The worst part is that we have no way to really find out until it happens.It seems like we are flying by the seat of our pants.

              It was removed by "Millennial Falcon".
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason he gave was rule #2.

              Lame, and also completely wrong. My post had sources of all information given.
             </p>
             <p>
              Apparently, he is unable to count a book as a source.
             </p>
             <p>
              The post was well sourced, as those who saw it know.
             </p>
             <p>
              He has also deleted some of my well sourced comments on other posts.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet, somehow, crap stories about stuff that's been re-posted 20 times, and opinions about irrelevant shills get stuck on the Hot page for days on end.

              I know.  I made a comment so I could capture it.  The words are painful.  But it must have been good for her to write it all down.  Cathartic so to speak.  But still painful and sad.  I wonder what Bob Dylan knows.

            Is there anything new you have added to these others research or are you literally just copy and pasting information?

            What do you mean by "(A work in progress)" since this is all 100% copy paste information right now.

               The mods love shills on VOAT. They post old, leftover stuff and keep it on the Hot list for days, while they delete original posts, like the one I made on Joan Baez as MKUltra victim who wrote about child torture and murder in one of her "folk songs".
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know why I bother. It looks like VOAT is turning into another Reddit.

               Ruffled a few feathers have i......perhaps you don't like my hypothesis, because it reveals, the exact depravity what pizzagate is... How sad!! and why toss the term shill?? It only validates who YOU really are.

                Your post is compiled to make it look like you did some kind of research, when in reality it is just copy/paste and then on top of that you are denying copy/pasting from vigilantcitizen, you can try to distract however you want. Good luck :)
