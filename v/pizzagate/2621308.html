<p>A (former A- list mostly television actress) was chosen by a guy named M. M is one of those guys who has a ton of money and throws enough in the air until women close their eyes and shut out all thought until the sexual act is over. A always seems to need money and has openly admitted in the past to exchanging sex for money. Meanwhile M has kind of collection of one type of woman he wants to sleep with and keeps a running total of them. He has told friends he is up to almost 100. It is a special kind of celebrity.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first choice was kind of unusual. The first choice was B. The reason they wanted B is because she spends a great deal of time in the country where she was needed and famous enough, but not too famous where it would work. Finally, she too is known to accept money for arrangements, but here was the sticking point. Usually, even though she is a permanent A list singer in that country, she is the one bearding for lesser known people and never actually has sex with them. They pay to be seen with her and she will live with them, but there is no sex. According to the demands of the ultimate employer, he wanted to be able to have sex with the woman chosen.</p>
<p>The second choice was an interesting choice. We will call her C. She is an interesting choice. She lives in the country where she was needed. C also fit the bill of famous, but not too famous. She was perfectly willing to have sex when needed and had done that frequently to land many of her reality jobs/singing gigs. What ultimately disqualified her was N. Apparently N had been instructed by his employers that C was being claimed, yes that was the word used, by someone who she had yachted with in the past and he wanted her available to him when needed. N and M are best buddies.</p>
<p>So, in the end, A was chosen and has been doing it for several years at this point. She has made over $1M for her work. Will she end up going to jail? I think it is more likely she will end up killed rather than jailed.</p>
<p><strong>A: Pamela Anderson
B: Kylie Minogue
C: Nicole Scherzinger
M: George Soros

            The problem with "blind reveals"... Assange is rumored to be in the US under the protection of patriots and preparing to testify with extreme predjudice against powerful individuals. Anyone surprised the long knives are out?

            MAYBE! Willing to consider...For a while been wondering if JA is limited hangout / double agent. I generally "like" him so to speak &amp; want to believe in some magical hacker network...but couple things catch my attention beyond what's already been mentioned like : raised by a sex cult, Amal Clooney one of JA's first Lawyers &amp;  Benedict Cumbersnatch chosen to play JA in the movie...Cumbersnatch is  an awful choice but a POPULAR one.  JA is broken wristed, flat affect genius  &amp; should've been played by a cartoon character. He might be made of 1s &amp; 0s...but he definitely isn't made of Cumbersnatch. Casting seemed like narrative manipulation, imo.
           </p>
           <p>
            New ? : Who is JA's boss that wouldn't let Soros have Schlesinger.
           </p>
           <p>
            (odd experience for those of us w/ high sensitivities...watch Nicole Schlesinger sing Ave Maria on G. Lopez show...I immediately wept. The difference between that small clip and barf "Pussy Cat Dolls " brand of feminism... w/o words explaining you know something's not right.

            Soros is crazy evil. Chaotic evil. He has ven stated many times that he enacted a his ebil schemes simply because he can, not because he has a plan. It’s irrational. In that sense, we can see how the guy would contribute so much to Hillary’s campaign and also support the journalist that exposed her.
           </p>
           <p>
            The news interview that exposes his past as a Nazi collaborator is still floating around. Everyone should watch it. It seems that he got rich but collecting all the stuff left behind by the families that he sent to the camps.

            Really been believing lately that this WHOLE thing is a long con with a ton of players, but even my mind could not conceive of those two being in business together. But, it could also make sense...if everything is a complete set up. It’s getting fun out there

             Bingo. The long con. Perhaps this is just a game to them with rules that we don't understand.

            If Assange and Soros are "best buddies", why is Assange still stuck in the embassy in the UK? Why isn't he running around at will? That makes no sense at all.

            when Pamela got involved I wondered what was going on

           <p>
            we don't even know where he is, maybe Pamela goes to have sex with Soros at the embassy

            wiki seems to have been taken over, so not sure

           <p>
            will have to watch CDAN for other blinds on Assange, need to get past ones too
           </p>
           <p>
            maybe C

              enty sure caught our attention, this first place I saw it, and we know we being watched here, the likes on CDAN posts usually good
             </p>
             <p>
              its a possible, those kind of threats work wonders, we've seen 180's and 360's since this site started
             </p>
             <p>
              think wiki leaks and predominate people
             </p>
             <p>
              mention a certain name, you will have my attention, whether it holds is another thing

             His source is the one who's full of shit.  Enty simply posts what juicy gossip he gets.  JA is not the nicest guy on the block, but he destroyed HRC, so it's pretty much impossible for him to be working with Soros who would have given up a liver to get HRC elected.  His denial of 9-11 is troubling, but remember he's not "the one who knows everything".  It could be that he's never received any concrete evidence on a 9-11 conspiracy or he's saving that for a rainy day and asking us to look deeply into other shit because he's already got all the 9-11 info he needs.

            I suspect entylawyer of being a fraud and here it is. Let's see wrong on the Don Henley being exposed during primaries prediction, really wrong on Soros and Assange being buddies, and so wrong that Henry Winkler is a nice guy and not into any type of creepy acts involving minors that Avenatti is about to cry #basta!

            Les Visible called Assange out (even before his detention) due to Assange's 9/11 Truth denial. VINDICATION!   Assange is interesting not as a truth teller (as he is not one) but as a confirmation of pedogate/MK Ultra.  Assange grew up in a weird Australian cult where the children had to have their hair died MK Ultra slave blond.  Assange is a celebrity, like Snowden, each even had a Hollywood movie about him. Celebrities are pedogate/MK Ultra, like the evil robot in Metropolis, Judas goats to mislead the masses. At a minimum, there are now 3 celebrity PMs who are MK Ultra, Trudeau, Ardern, and Macron. Child actors posing as "leaders," what a joke.

            What is real, what is just for show?  I believe the Q(s) are patriots.  Are the Q(s) using DJT as a reality TV star distracting front man so they can covertly restore the nation to liberty and justice?  Or is DJT a stronger and even more ambitious man than we imagine, using the Q(s) to crush his political enemies?  Who will define the future, Chabad Trump or the secret Q(s)?
           </p>
           <p>
            Not that I believe it, but the best case scenario is the Q/patriot rebels will roll up the Cabal, and then cut the strings to Israel. Why saved for last? Because to do that you have to take out (blackmail into resignations) both Chabad Trump and Pedo Pence. The 2019 Speaker of the House - hopefully a clean patriot by then - becomes President. This is how Gerald Ford became President, a legal Coup. A nice fantasy, but the only way it could be done.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am not kidding. Chabad is to Talmudists as the KKK was to white supremacists or La Raza is to Hispanic supremacists. Do your own research on Chabad, the truth is very ugly. Their ideology is that Gentiles are subhumans to be used as slaves, sex toys, or even meat. (((Kushner))) has a security clearance. Why??? He is a dodgy businessman and zealot with ties to George Soros. There is no place for Chabad in the government of what is supposed to be a Gentile country. But Trump put him there! There is a reason Israel is saved for last

              ISIS got literally destroyed within 1-2 months.  We didn't even send any troops.  The public has no idea how ISIS got destroyed.  We know it's due to cutting off their flow of money.  We got that from Q.

               Isis is still very strong as a local mercenary force protecting the occupied Golan Heights.  Prominent Israelis have admitted as much.  They are still getting paid by Israel and when wounded are treated in Israeli hospitals.  The US used helicopters to evacuate the Isis commanders from territories recently lost.  The same players will pop up again wherever the deep state wants them to be.

                Isis is getting organs for Israel.  They end up there in their hospitals for a reason.  Yeah, they still exist, for a good reason, at least for Israel.

               I guess that makes sense. I really do hope so. We need white hats and people on our side to help us fight this war. Humanity is still sleeping.
