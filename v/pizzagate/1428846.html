            Atko and PuttItOut disappeared for awhile. They were originally pretty visible. And then for awhile(I don't remember exactly how long it was) a month, maybe two they disappeared. When they returned some claimed his commenting style had changed. And Atko definitely post less. PuttItOut comments every so often like today. But I haven't seen Atko in forever.
Their story is that they took a holiday and now have fulltime jobs and can not spend as much time. And voat was always a hobby. But that wasn't the story when it started. It was a hobby, but one they were serious about. And then there the question of funding. Some ask where the funding comes from, and doubt the ads and donations and a single T-shirt sale can run voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that canary did disappeare for awhile. I don't know what to think. And there's no real evidence other than what I just laid out. Like I said, make of all that what you will

              and anyone else reading, pim is solid on this in the first part, but the rest meh.
             </p>
             <ol>
              <li>
               <p>
                it used to be (and you can go back through post history of atko and putt and see) that they were transparent about voat, always friendly, and talkative, always making little jokes....
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                but since their disappearances (same day, for a month, atko came back first, then putt another near month after that), they've been dicks.  total fucking dicks.  there's no better way to put it.  they're aloof, they never answer questions straight about voat anymore (no more transparency at all, they make major voat changes without telling ANYONE no, and have admitted voat is no longer open source at any given time), and when you ask serious questions about serious issues, you will get downvoat brigaded, shitposted for HUNDREDS of hours, and have a cabal of sjws attempt to assassinate your character on voat.  i was amazed when this shitstorm hit me in the face for what i thought was doing the right thing by voat.  i hadn't been treated that poorly since the last time i ventured outside my house!  hahaha anway, back to the facts
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                the "story is" they went on holiday, but the fact remains they won't give us proof that [name redacted on admin's request} and [name redacted on admin's request] are the people still behind atko and puttitout and that they are both healthy well, not under duress nor under gag.  they badged a user for shittalking me for trying to ask them questions on behalf of the userbase.  atko called me names instead of just answering simple questions like where were you, why is there no canary, etc.
               </p>
              </li>
              <li>
               <p>
                on to the point at hand.  the canary. i've always felt voat needed a standing solid warrant and honeypot/trap canary.  after much kevetching they put up the canary literally on my behal, ONCE. and then intended to never put it up again.  got that changed.  it's now a permanent thing.  they were going to have a BOT click it every minute or so.  no good.  not a living canary.  so now SUPPOSEDLY puttitout presses it every now and then (which is perfect!)
               </p>
              </li>
             </ol>
             <p>
              if they hadn't lied to my face about the fact that the phrase "voat is neither a trap of any kind nor a honeypot" was taken out because 'trap/honeypot are not legally sound words to use in a canary,'
             </p>
             <p>
              i would have been all good, but now, i don't believe that canary says anything other than "voat's a trap" for a fucking second.
             </p>
             <p>
              conclusion: voat's a trap.  either it always was, or it has been since the "great divide" when the admins disappeared and left voat unattended for a month and then came back different people.
             </p>
             <p>
              this is not even to mention the fact that an sjw cabal has taken over major subs, and has divided the admins away from the community and is directly coding voat with the admins WITHOUT TELLING US what they're doing nor that this new arrangement has taken place.
             </p>
             <p>
              i do not know about the canary disappearing.  since we got putt to solidify the canary they took out half the words, ok.  they removed the trap statement - not ok. but i didn't see it really disappear.  clue me in?

            Many don't believe that canary anymore. Some even believe Atko was replaced or otherwise compromised. I have no idea what's true. But that canary means nothing, it disappeared for a while. So make of all that what you will. There's a long history of that canary.
