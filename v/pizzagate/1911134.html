<p><strong>Haiti and Petersen\'s Investigation into the Caracol Industrial Complex and the Morne Bossa/VCS Mining Facility[edit]</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On August 15, 2015, Petersen announced her plan to visit Haiti to conduct research on human trafficking.[8] Based on her Facebook page, she seemed to have lived there since that day.[9] </p>
<p>On January 3rd, 2016, Petersen shared with Robinson some of her findings based on her field work in Haiti up to that point. By this time she had already become aware of corruption by the Clintons in Haiti or as she put it, &quot;start[ed] to connect the dots on what I already suspected&quot;. In fact, she was getting ready to dive in full time: 
Ms. Clinton has corrupt &amp; dirty business to finish in Haiti ... This is the theory my master\'s thesis puts forth... this is modern structural slavery.</p>
<p>Robinson re-shared this post by Petersen to a Facebook group to which she belonged.[10] </p>
<p>In that same post, Petersen also links to a blog post discussing similar claims. The blog is written by Haitian native, Chantal Laurent, and the specific post Petersen provided is called Hillary Clinton\'s Scandalous Conduct in Haiti: Charity Begins at Home.[11][Archived Version] The day after, on January 4th, 2016, Petersen again shared with Robinson some more of her findings: 
But the real significance of this scandal for me, I know you feel me Bella, is the link to contemporary slavery and trafficking. <strong>I can\'t say to what extent, but there is human trafficking happening through the Clinton\'s Caracol Complex.</strong>&gt;</p>
<p>Source: [12][Archived Version] </p>
<p>Also in that same post, Petersen expresses interest in investigating the Morne Bossa mining facility, which is owned by VCS Mining, a company which Hillary\'s brother, Tony Rodham, sits on the board of. [13]) The Facebook post includes the link to another post that is on the blog, Mining Awareness, entitled Haiti Morne Bossa Gold Missing!?.[14][Archived Version] That blog would repost information from this investigation when they became aware of Petersen\'s death and, thus, seemingly support the ongoing work researchers are doing here.[15][Archived Version] Also, one of the Podesta emails discusses <strong>Tony Rodham &quot;hustling gold mining deals&quot; which is likely related to this mining facility</strong>.[16] </p>

<p>PLEASE also note additional comments about Hillary\'s brother, Tony Rodham, and his activities, including assisting VCS.</p>
<p>This is also a brief and interesting video about the natives and the history of this area based on a NY Times article called ...
<strong>Earthquake Relief Where Haiti Wasn\'t Broken</strong>

<p>If there\'s still anyone who doesn\'t understand the evils of Capitalism and that it is suicidal I think
this video makes it clearer than ever that Capitalism serves only Elite interests and is based 
entirely in exploitation of Nature and Human Life -- and Animal-life, of course.</p>
<p>Btw, George Webb also made some extended comments about this area and his suspicions that 
it was connected to child trafficking.</p>',

            For a good background on the Caracol Industrial complex and how HIllary Clinton and her brother were involved in the whole thing, i recommend watching the ground-breaking documentary Clinton Cash, based on the book by the same name.

             You think a system which has brought us Global Warming and 
destruction of so many species of animal life is wonderful?

             How about 43 million Americans living in poverty since the New Deal regulations on capitalism have
been overturned -- and we have the highest rates of children living in poverty.

              Was Capitalism to blame for global warming 20,000 years ago? "The Laurentian Great Lakes were formed nearly 20,000 years ago when the earth's climate warmed and the last glacial continental ice sheet retreated."

               The melting of the glaciers are also changing the pressure on the tectonic plates which

                JH: Almost all scientists in the Environmental Protection Agency say that they cannot say what they believe if it goes against the [Bush] administration’s preference. In NASA it was the same (if policy-relevance was involved) until the administrator gave a green light. My impression is that things have improved, but they are still not good. My information is based on hearsay from a small number of scientists, but also on broader studies such as the last one conducted by the Union of Concerned Scientists. This attitude of the administration is idiotic, not just because it violates basic principles of democracy, but because it leads to lousy policymaking. Why do you need advice of scientists, if you know that you are only going to accept results that fit predetermined policy decisions?

               Today's global Warming is based in burning of fossil fuels and pollution
and destruction of the environment due to human activity and populations --

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Of course, modern global warming stems from a clear cause—rising levels of CO2 (and other greenhouse gases) from fossil fuel burning, cutting down forests and other human activities. And, in the past rising CO2 levels at the very least magnified global warming, ushering in the relatively balmy, stable climate sometimes called the "long summer" that has allowed human civilization to flourish. Humanity has now raised global CO2 levels by more than the rise from roughly 180 to 260 ppm at the end of the last ice age, albeit in a few hundred years rather than over more than a few thousand years. "The end of an ice age, you have a sense in your bones what that means: a big, significant change for the planet," Shakun says. "It's a tangible example of what rising CO2 can mean for the planet over the long-term."

           </p>
           <p>
            You won’t hear about it in sound bites of coverage on the evening news, but every American should understand these seven facts about the 63,000+ kids that “showed up in the backyard” and need their plight acknowledged.
           </p>
           <p>
            1
Illicit markets thrive where licit markets have been destroyed. Despite the façade of “free-trade” in Central America (or anywhere, for that matter), international trade is far from free flowing. Economic development policies between countries of the global North and South have favored Northern profits and the United States for decades. This has resulted in massive inequality of worldwide wealth and acute global poverty. Many Latin American economies attest to this. Where “free-trade” policies have collapsed the legal and formal markets of local economies, illicit and informal markets will fill the economic void as a necessity of human survival. Weapons, narcotics, endangered plants and wildlife, humans, and other illicitly traded commodities are advantageous to developing economies because regulated, domestic exports (such as auto parts, factory garments or agricultural crops) have been devalued to the point they are no longer competitive on the global market. Illicit markets are the natural comparative advantage for sustaining local livelihoods, and this is apparent in the homelands of border youth and children.
           </p>
           <p>
            2
Criminal gangs often establish the supply niches for these illicit markets. Some are highly organized and violent cartels but most are loosely based. Minors in Central American conflict zones are at a higher risk for various types of child trafficking. Youth and children trafficked for gang soldiering and/or drug mules are an increased concern in the present context. Returning minors at the border to their homelands subjects them to these risks of human trafficking. Individuals caught in repeated cycles of fleeing and trafficking are common when violence and poverty occur together, making repatriation to these regions an unsustainable solution.
           </p>
           <p>
            3
Hasty deportations of unaccompanied Central American minors violate international children’s rights.The United Nation’s Convention on the Rights of the Child outlines these child-specific rights and legal protections for anyone under the age of eighteen. Further, the current position of Congress and the Obama administration – to overhaul the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and deny fair trials that recognize refugee, asylee and trafficking victim statuses – is unacceptable for a nation claiming to lead the global fight against trafficking in persons.
           </p>
           <p>
            4
The international principle of non-refoulment is being disregarded by the United States government. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees defines “non-refoulment” as the obligation of states to allow territorial access to refugees and asylees seeking safety from life threatening risks in their countries of origin. Returning border youth to documented violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador is another significant U.S. violation of international law. In the modern era, “forced” and “willing migration” are almost never clearly defined categories, but U.S. immigration policies typically insist upon the later. This undermines the human rights of fleeing children – who are still owed due legal process regardless of whether they are undocumented.
           </p>
           <p>
            5
The U.S. has a sixty-year history of provoking regional instability in Central America. The complexity of this has included crippling Cold War policies, CIA backed coups, civil wars instigated and funded by the U.S. government, and the infamously chaotic War on Drugs. Gangs have flourished as a result of the illicit market niches created by sixty years of political-economic strife, and present levels of violence in these countries are deeply rooted in this historic trauma. Still, the U.S. continues to ignore the realities Central American youth and children are faced with as a result of its aggravating (often illegal) involvement there.
           </p>
           <p>
            6
Research overwhelmingly shows increased border militarization is an ineffective, inhumane solution for stopping migrant flows everywhere in the world. The current solution to quell youth flooding the border is a request for emergency funds from Congress. The funding would provide badly needed health and human resources for fleeing Central American youth. However, more than half of the requested $3.7 billion will fund an impressive boost in U.S. border patrols, surveillance, expedited immigration courts and anti-immigration campaigns – all proven to be inadequate controls in the long term. Completely open borders would not be sustainable without addressing root causes either. Nevertheless, two billion dollars toward creating fair-trade markets and formal employment opportunities in Central America (rather than creating more U.S. border military jobs) would be more likely to have a lasting effect on stabilizing the region.

“Border Children” is a one-dimensional label. Perhaps necessary for categorical references, it is critical to remember that each one of these migrant youth is an individual human being. They represent diverse identities, experiences, resistances and courage in their individual life journeys. Their futures need to be considered valuable to our world and they must be supported as whole people with equal human rights.

            The United States has yet to develop an immigration strategy that will appropriately address the interdependent forces behind what is now a worldwide phenomenon – the largest, global displacement of human beings in all of history. That’s a big statement for U.S. leadership to continue neglecting. Awareness of the tremendous underpinnings of the current border crisis is a vital first step for the American public to take. Without citizen demands for policy reforms – of both a broken immigration system and flawed model of international development – it is unlikely the entrenched roots of Central American oppression will shift within U.S. bureaucracy. The youth at the border are merely one casualty of this.

George Webb Sweigert, is a Mossad / CIA disinfo agent, he  gives himself away here:

            "i am a berniecrat, and jewish and always rooting for mossad"
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice, he doesn't say he's an American and he is rooting for the USA.. NO, first and foremost 
and he JEWISH and he is "ALWAYS ROOTING For MOSSAD" Do you think a hardcore zionist socialist jew like George Webb Sweigert, is going to say anything bad about Israel and their involvement in the US government??

             As a matter of fact, one of the biggest markets for women and organ trafficking is Israel!!!

            All of his "research" is carefully constructed to divert attention from AIPAC / Israel's involvement in the corrupt US government.

             Thank you for the Monica Peterson archived post -- 
and agree in the overall perspective of the US as totally corrupt, criminal and evil.
And for much longer than 60 years.

             True - economies are created by citizens of nations -- but they are then manipulated by
Banks and Financial Institutions for the benefit of Elites.
            </p>
            <p>
             And if we understand the past, we also understand that all of this evil is coming for us.

                 You're just incapable of hearing what is being said to you -
Again, I am opposed to Israel's warmongering and attacks on Palestine -
I am opposed to Mossad and every other intelligence agency working in secret and spying on citizens.
I am opposed to AIPAC in their efforts to buy control of the US government.
And I certainly not anti-Semitic.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Most of those who used to take criticism of Israel as ant-Semitism have pretty much 
been forced to understand that it is not -- and have matured in their thinking.
                </p>

                  I have roomed in the jewish household.
I have worked with jews and had jewish managers.
I have probably met and befriended more jews that you ever will (unless you, yourself are a jew LOL)
I have never met a jew, that wasn't rooting for Israel and their own tribe.
Jews consider themselves jewish, first and foremost, above being American, they have been raised to see themselves as the victims
and to me that is a problem. 
This has nothing to do with maturity, this is REALITY.
The fact the AIPAC is the one of the biggest if not the biggest and most poweful political PAC in the US, is not a coiincidence.
All Jews are united behind their cause.

                  <p>
                   True, all sympathy and support went to Israel after WWII -- and most Jews do support Israel....
but they are learning about AIPAC . . .  and they certainly don't support New World Order or fascism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   They know what fascism is and the consequences of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   And, it's not just about Jewish people as victims -- this will take ALL of us.

                    Why are you so Pro-Jewish and Jewish-obsessed?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    True, all sympathy and support went to Israel after WWII --
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    and most Jews do support Israel.... of course they do..
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    and who do you think funds AIPAC? The gentiles?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    and who are the biggest neocon warmongers?
Do you want me to name them one by one?
They are all jewish.. it is all a coincidence?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And who runs Hollywood? and who runs all MSM companies?
Is it a coincidence?
I am not making up the facts.. the truth is the truth..
If you don't want people to be obssesed with the Jews, please tell them to stop manipulating our politicians, to stop manipulating our media and to stop manipulating our culture with their multiculturalist garbage.

                    They know what fascism is and the consequences of it... 
of course they do.. the Israeli Apartheid state is basically a fascist operation, they learned very well

                     America has crossed the threshold into fascism --
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     are you suggesting that's what the people want?

                    <p>
                     Or that the people of Israel want a fascist government?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Each time Israel has had a government supporting peace the leadership has been assassinated.
And, Rabin likely assassinated by Netanyahu and his fascist supporters which is very much suspected in Israel.

                     <p>
                      They wanted more of the same fascist, baby-killing, extreme right government, and they got more of it.

                     <p>
                      And yet, they complain as to why the rest of the world hates them.
I don't care what the Israelis do in their own land, and what kind of fascist government they have.. what people hate is their meddling with America's government via AIPAC, the bribing of our politicians, etc etc

                       You are given the candidates that Elites/wealthy right-wing choose who will do their bidding
and dirty work.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Notice that Netanyahu and his gang had to assassinate Rabin in order to defeat the
peace effort --
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       And before Rabin, there were others killed who were involved in an attempt to bring peace
to the area.

                      <p>
                       There is only one way the right wing can rise and that is by violence -- that has always
been true and it is still true today.

                        The "Elites/wealthy" that have been running the US into the ground for the last 8 years, are definitely not "right-wing" quite the opposite..
All Hollywood millionaire snowflakes and the zionist american media are ALL crying about how evil Trump is, and to me, that is a very good sign.

                       <p>
                        So i'd give Trump the benefit of time.. i seriously doubt he is going to be as bad as serial liar, war criminal, whistle-blower  enemy and bankster-sell out Obumma.

                         You're very badly misinformed.  Elite Patriarchy is of the right wing.  They are our exploiters of nature and humans.
As is our system of capitalism as most Americans now understand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Obama was not a liberal and neither is the Democratic Party liberal -- and hasn't been since the coup on JFK which
also took our people's government.  Obama is a corporate/fascist who immediately abandoned the voters who had 
put him in office.  It's also like that Obama is closely linked to the CIA and has been since childhood via his family.
The CIA is right wing/fascist.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Nor is our MSM liberal ... it's better described as corporate/CIA and if you bothered to read something 
about Operation Mockingbird you would understand that.
Corporations own and control ALL of our media today -- with few exceptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I agree that Obama is a war criminal and has worked simply for his own enrichment at the expense of the public.
And he has very much set back the rights of "Whistleblowers" and journalists covering these US wars of aggression.
Again -- he is a right wing corporatist/fascist.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Again -- don't get confused by labels.  There is no liberal party -- there are only two right wing/fascist parties.

                         Only the right-wing has been in power since the coup on JFK and our people's government.

                         Obama was a right wing corporatist and the Democratic Party hasn't been anything but right wing
for three decades now -- since it was bought by Koch Bros./John Birch Society and other large corporations.
Like the Clintons, Obama seems to have his own ties to the CIA.

                          Yes, In reality, there is no such thing as right wing or left wing, they are all pretty much the same, as both parties are lobbied to death and run on donations by the same groups of companies and people, such as the Military Industrial complex, Big Pharma, Big Oil, IT, Wall Street and AIPAC.

                          The funny thing is that the liberals still think Obumma was a "great" president and believe that Hillary is a liberal looking out for the welfare of the American worker, and that is complete insanity. People and specially liberals in America are completely delusional.
                         </p>

                          Even if Trump tuirns out the be a total liar, at least he had the nerve to say he was looking out for the American worker, said he was going to stop the never-ending wars, and the crazy invasion of Mexican illegal inmigrant thugs.. . Hillary didn't even make any claims of stopping the insanity that has been going for the last two neocon presidencies..

                           There is always a left and a right -- even if both parties are corporate/fascist -- because the public will be divided to some degree representing both the left and the right.  Although this is a majority liberal nation, there are still many who hold right wing beliefs -- usually the wealthy among us who profit under capitalism.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Both Obama and the Democratic Party immediately reversed promises made in the campaign -- especially for universal health care for all -- and betrayed the Democratic voters who had put him in office.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Anyone who knows anything about Hillary doesn't consider her a liberal, though I agree that she has managed to fool many voters -- and a surprising number of female voters which I find  mystifying.

                           Trump would say anything he felt he had to say to get elected, but his primary interest is his own wealth and increasing it.
Our government has been looking the other way on illegal workers -- and bringing in workers from other countries legally for the benefit of the wealthy who profit from cheap labor.  Over decades, our Congress has betrayed the American worker by bringing in foreign workers -- including professionals to work in the US.  In one case, Congress first contrived to increase the numbers of US citizens training as engineers.  When they had a surplus of engineers, salaries were then lowered and many left the profession.  That then gave Congress cause to IMPORT more foreign engineers.  And that pattern has been followed with many other professions.  Hillary has been very involved in creating the wars and violence in the ME which has resulted in the greatest number of refugees ever seen fleeing these wars.

                            We agree on almost everything.

                            The right and the left is basically a puppet show, done to keep the illusion of democracy, while a few players (MIC, Big Pharma, AIPAC, Big OIl, IT) control both parties.
                           </p>

                            What we don't agree on is Trump. Trump got his MBA from Wharton.He the highest IQ since Bill Clinton, way higher than the last two morons we had for presidents. I once had a Wharton MBA as one of our directors.. and he was one of the most sensible and intelligent persons i have worked for.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The fact the Trump won in such a short period of time, shows how incompetent, hypocritical and phony our politicians are.
People are fed up with them, and most of us harbor some hope of having an somewhat honest president.
I think the MSM are in shock to find out that at least half this country, are not as stupid as they think we are.
I don't think Trump is in for the money (like Obummer)..... his intelligence and ego go beyond that.. The guy is 70, his family's future is assured.. what can he possibly want more money for?
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            As he said many times in the campaign trail, he doesn't need to be president.. doesn't need the headache..  and i am sure he is right.
He put his money where his mouth was..  he paid for most of his campaign... most people who do such a thing, do it for ego reasons.. not for monetary ones.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I think he wants to make history and be in the history books as the president that turned this country around.. and i don't think there is anything wrong with that. 
I still have hope that he may get some good things done.

                              One more time.. to find out who the oligarchy really is, find out who you are not allowed to criticize.

                              Yesterday my 100% legit thread, based on historical facts about how the US government covered the Israeli attack on the USS liberty exactly 50 years ago, was pulled by a moderator here, because it had no link to "pizzagate" while hundreds of completely ridiculous threads that have no connection whatsoever to pizzagate remain.

                              This is no coincidence.. the fact that you refuse the name the (((oligarchy))) means you are a part of the problem, not the solution.

             Basically, CGI, Bill/Hillary claimed they were helping Haitians with jobs to work and make money (opposite what they do in USA, give out govt money-same results- oppression) so they built with foundation money to "help" after natural disasters, Caracol Industries. It's a garment and textile mill for their rich buddies of Walmart (which HRC was a board member) target, gap, kohls. But in reality, it truly is a a SLAVE LABOR SWEATSHOP. They make roughly $3.25/day...even under Haiti's minimal wage laws. These people have to take a bus to get to work which costs them $15.00/week.

             Some were swindled out of their rice farms that really made them decent money and say now, GMO rice is shipped in and they make zero money for that.

             And yes, GW admitted in his vid he's "Old Guard Mossad". Also troubling, same vid he mentions being some type of courier of info to Wikileaks back in the day. So, I was already cautious of Wiki and now even more so. Never really trusted GW from the jump

             Did you actually look at the video based on NY Times article which was very definitely 
connected to the evils of capitalism?
            </p>
            <p>
             From Hawaii to Haiti and everywhere around the world we see the proof that capitalism
exists as a criminal enterprise.

            <p>
             And that Capitalism is suicidal for humans, animal-life and the planet.

                Is the environment destroyed? Or do loggers clearing forest actually result in more trees, as we have more now than the planet ever has.
               </p>
               <p>
                Btw jews have dominated the slave trade for over 2000 years even before theyd parasitically follow roman armies to snatch captives.
               </p>
               <p>
                Women making more than men and having less children is a death blow to a society, which has always been the jews' plan.
               </p>
               <p>
                You fell for it like most, enticed by consumer goods and fake "independence".  So you are correct i fear for the choices women make because its demonstrably terrible.

            It would not surprise me at all that Hillary had Monica killed, but it seems that it would have to do with the blowjob scandal back in the 90s then with investigating human trafficking rings.

             His actions in Cambodia are notable in his meeting in 1998 with Hun Sen though publicly not a whole lot came of it.

             "We came to see what fits here in Cambodia, and there are many fits," he told reporters—speaking at a hotel, the Associated Press dryly noted, that was owned by a Cambodian businessman banned from doing business in the United States because of his alleged involvement in the drug trade.

             The Cambodia connection isn't completely damning but Hun Sen is a bit of a shady dictator running a country with a serious human trafficking problem. 2015 article:

             From our Friends at the WaPo, "I write to you from Svay Pak, a village outside Phnom Penh where our rescue team has worked with the Cambodian police for the past year and found a very different story: The big business of selling prepubescent girls to foreign pedophiles for thousands of dollars still exists, though it looks very different than it did a decade ago." Maybe its best to look at Haiti and the CF's dealings there with a broader scope than just child trafficking. I just wanted to look at something today that wasn't Comet/Tunnel related for a change, and the makings of simple exploitation possible or confirmed in Haiti by deals brought into place by the Rodhams/Clintons are there. Monica Petersen may not have been directly investigating CF but may have been stopped in examining one or several of there interests, and of course she was there investigating HT.
