<h2>Hi all! We suggest several clarifications, amendments and changes to the submission rules. These changes would include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A: Language from the community-developed definition of Pizzagate will be included directly in the wording of Rule 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B: A link with examples of posts that do or do not pass Rule 1 is already available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>C: Rule 2 will include what was formerly a part of Rule 4 (all posts need at least one link)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>D: We suggest disabling of &quot;share a link&quot; posts (you would still be able to post a link as a discussion post). The reason for suggesting to delete this option is to encourage good descriptions (i.e. attention to Rule 3), which often are not possible with the character limit for titles. <strong>(We asked our developer to re-install the \'share a link\' buttons until the community has decided)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E: Clarification of Rule 3 to state that a good title must establish direct relevance to Pizzagate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>F: Amendment of Rule 3 to require descriptions of unembedded links in posts. (It is much easier for users to make sense of a post if you tell us the significance of your links.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G: Rule 4 will be much more clear. (It isn\'t really a rule, so much as it is directing where to post certain posts that don\'t pass Rule 1). It will also specify that memes and sourced activism/publicity posts are now allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H: Rule 5 (no standalone memes) will be axed, and rule 6 (NSFW posts must be labeled) will take its place. Standalone memes will be allowed, so long as they support the investigation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            I liked when we found shit about Alefantis and his connections w/ Rothschilds and the podestas and royal elites. These researchers had links and sources for everything. Most of them were banned or randomly deleted their accounts and bots and ctr now voat brigade the shit out of these posts.

            Do you fucking understand that the majority hates this micromanaging shit. Fuck off, Half the mods have contributed nothing except to control the narrative. FUCK OFF you stupid cunts. I wouldn't doubt that some of the mods are pedo sympathizers. We built this place, not you!

             Exactly, the mods micromanage the good posts, while lettung shitty copy pasted posts and copycat posts get to the top. It's what reddit conspiracy is now doing.

             Have to disagree - the long lingering anti-protest sticky was such an odious low it gave the Devil a fear of heights, all in the name of "care" for "everyone's safety" and quivering, ass-covering cowardice, sabotage or worse.

            <p>
             No matter if fences have supposedly been superficialy "mended", the sheer betrayal of those long two weeks will absolutely never be able to be compensated for or changed, and the fact that an apology was never forthcoming for smearing the good people connected with just the first protest is one of the ugiest abuse chapters in the history of this often abusive forum, hands down.  Not even going to bring up all the rest of the mendacious atrocities relating to the second protest, and everything in between and afterwards as well.

             You've been amazing HoneyBee.  Please don't let a few ignorant people affect how you feel about yourself and the work you've done.
            </p>
            <p>
             You only answer to yourself and your higher power at the end of the day.  Do what you feel is right.
            </p>
            <p>
             You have amazing insight and intuition.  You understand things on a level that a lot of people can't.  Like your gut feelings about Sawyer.  I was right with you, and I was annoyed that people weren't letting you express your opinion.  You were dead on when it came to him.
            </p>
            <p>
             Trust yourself girl, and follow your instincts.  You've been an amazing asset to this community, and are one of the most trustworthy people here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Big hugs to you.

              refered to the mods in her comment - you can understand that when "a few ignorant people" are the ones that are moderating, and they are viciously cutting the protest effort off at the hips like an extended terror porn movie, and with no remorse whatsoever, it remains significant, right?

            I very much appreciate it when comments with downvoats are hidden.

            We know how to police ourselves honestly.  We just need good tools like that one to protect our brains from some of the evil shits around here.
           </p>

            Ignoring is what we should be doing to shills, and that makes it easier.  Thank you

             Honestly,  the rule revisions don't so much affect me but I agree with Honeybee's comment above.  With all due respect for all researchers -- I believe  there comes a point when we simply MUST show up at demonstrations/events IN PERSON to spread awareness and hopefully compel
             <em>
              the masses
             </em>
             to demand change.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, the internet has been critical in spreading the word about Pedogate/ Pizzagate and many other issues revealing the depth of depravity and corruption in our government(s),  BUT we most always remember that the word, *virtual * means "almost or nearly as described, but not completely.."
            </p>
            <p>
             In my  view, we can research and post and discuss and Tweet and You Tube 24/7 365, but if we want to gain more people in the anti-pedophile movement,  we need A LOT more boots on the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
             We must SHOW UP IN PERSON AT AND/OR SUPPORT REAL LIFE ANTI PEDO ANTI TRAFFICKING EVENTS if we are to spur the movement from virtual reality to actual reality.
            </p>
            <p>
             In this way, VOAT could support both virtual AND actual warriors.  Salute, Honeybee!   FUCK FEAR!!!

              I personally believe FE can be tied to PizzaGate because of the mind control and brainwashing.  The globe is a spinning ball similar to hypnosis, and it's used ALL the time, in movies, tv shows, the news, everywhere.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wish people realized the deception of it and how it's tied to the elites and the way they control us through lies.

               Yikes., I had not meant to reply to your post.  I thought I was replying to the general thread.  But thank you for telling me.  Yes, we are indeed living in some "interesting" times. Brave New World, 1984, and Animal Farm now all seem non-fiction.

               If people dont believe pizzagate they sure are not going to believe flat earth.  Their whole trust in the media and history has to be shattered.

             The fact that this broken place dares to ask for thousands of dollars per month when it can't even keep a search engine running on a INVESTIGATION forum, then comes back with this kind of backpeddling bs sticky because they have no traffic anymore is pure farce - makes me laugh, but not with the genuine joy that I get from reading your in the face comment mi amigo.

             he/she spits fire. No way criticising anything without swearing. Maybe should work on your technique in criticising people. Yesterday cou called me a cunt in a discussion because I wasn't the same opinion as you were. Here you do it again. Maybe give yourself a rest? Do you think it could be helpful to devide all of us?

              Sometimes you've got to light some fires to keep cold complacency from settling in permanently.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you don't think this place has been scorched and abused and divided long ago by the people who run it, you just don't know the history of this place well enough.  At the very beginning, I was attacked by moderators and drained of comment points so that I was silenced for a couple of weeks, just for bringing in an influx of almost 500 new subscribers.  Many other commenters were drained of points in the same couple of days, because the mods needed to control and groom the forum - their twisted version of "free speech".  I was attacked by mods and accused of trying to build voting brigades or some such nonsense - I didn't even know what they were talking about.
             </p>
             <p>
              And that was just the begining.  So don't worry too much about

               I told you once, back when, about powermods.
              </p>
              <p>
               Darling, you err on the side of powermod culture.  Be careful.
              </p>
              <p>
               The mods at a place like this doubt people like you more than people like me.  That's a trained behavior from nonsense you probably didn't experience.  I guess what I'm saying is:
              </p>
              <p>
               I always see you fighting imperfect moderation.  But perfection isn't possible.  And you blame people who have been trained, steeped, and taught to fight the people who preach the things you preach.  You're playing the line between virtue signaling and earnest progress.
              </p>
              <p>
               But you're missing a very important fact.  This place.  Us.  You included, now.  We're this generations niggers.  And you smell like a dogooder who doesn't fully grasp our plight.
              </p>
              <p>
               Not that there are no shill mods and no fuckery.  But do you really believe the solution is different mods or yourself in control?  I believe that this culture is built on a belief in basically no moderation.  And the actual solution is minimal janitorial moderation.  And preaching righteous, unassailable moderation decisions might be missing the point entirely.
              </p>
              <p>
               Doesn't matter much.  Shits progressing beautifully in the world.

                thanks but I'm not here enough anymore to "be careful".  I scan through posts once in awhile and comment very infrequently.  Once in awhile interesting tidbits surface here despite the mods. Couldn't resist getting in some history on this thread for future readers who are studying what went wrong here.

                No group with a serious aim should have to put up with the unending volleys of bullshit that are regularly launched around here from the top down - it is like an abusive family unto itself with all the ugly power dynamics and victimization which that brings.  MOST FORUMS ARE NOT LIKE THIS ONE.   "Don't post your protest info here" is just one line of grafitti on the giant black  iceburg of cautionary tales that should be passed along here, not "be careful" or a toxic mod culture might yet again sabotage the effort.  What a joke.

                This place is absolutely NOT me.  And yes a place like this (I wouldn't work on the same continent as some of the bigot mods here so not this place) would most definitely be run much better if I was in charge, or any of a handful of respected commentors including you. Actually anyone with the integrity of a loan shark would be an improvement.

                Just in case you didn't realise, your deleted submissions live, but in the "removed submissions" link in the moderation logs on the RHS column.  They also remain in your submission history, I believe.  Whether they would show up in the "search" when it is up and running again, that I don't know.  I didn't realize you only get ten hits on searchvoat.co

            Here we go - process before progress - and I'm getting sucked in.  Always so much more interesting than researching pedo stuff.  After a few days, submissions flow under the bridge.  Anything important is likely to resurface and people have their hobbyhorses.

            Nobody takes any notice of the rules and everybody gets annoyed when they get their submissions removed or otherwise modded.  Just butt out with the rules and restrictions.  Use your time to curate the best information into knockout posts.   Sure, sure, you've got ideas, I've got ideas and so has everyone else.

               only to have a Mod delete my thread because of rule number 1. No elites connected to the story.

              Well may not be but it's a huge story all over the internet. Parents are outraged about this, and will there be anyone punished for subjecting young children to this perverted performance? I do see a pattern, if heads of schools, libraries and such, wherever children are, think they can get away with this, what is next?

            I like these rules, but I feel that other important information slightly orthogonal to Pizzagate should be allowed to flow on these forums:

              My understanding was that it takes up too much juice.  Quite how searchvoat manages it, I don't know - unless it is a data mining freebie so someone can see what we're all looking for - and be ahead of the info wave.
