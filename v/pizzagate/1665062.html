            So more on this Brotherhood of the Ram... they were around until mid-1990's, shortly after the case was closed (time for a new name with all that publicity)

            </a>
            from 1997: 
"Among those which seem to have ceased their activity after a few years we find: Church of Satanic Brotherhood, Brotherhood of the Ram, Our Lady of Endor Coven, The Satanic Orthodox Church of Nethilum Rite, The Satanic Church."

            Clear proof that the two cases, the one that the prosector was called "crazy" for going after, and Martensville were connected

            "I used to live on the edge of town. At night I would hear creepy medieval music and chanting from the forest. Saw people with hoods. One day me and some other kids went to investigate. We saw animals sacrificed on a podium in the middle of a pentagram. Wolves or Coyotes with axes in the gut, etc...this was the 80's. I wonder who these people that did this are today?"

              Yep, I'm aware of the Brotherhood of the Ram vs. Brotherhood of the Snakes significance. Very ancient names to be using in some backwater Saskatchewan town, I must say. Like that goes back to the original split in Egypt between the two mystery schools.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think Brotherhood of the Snake is a grey-area. They're related to reptilian shit somehow? So more Orion based. Brotherhood of the Ram worships Marduk and the Annunaki from what I can tell, clear baphomet/goat of mendes worship. Very Sirius-based worship.

            OK so the article doesn't explain a lot by itself. But the Nelles family is a Freemason family of note.

            So what happened was Susan Nelles was caught 4 times with dead babies with this chemical level very elevated in their blood. The case was thrown out for stupid reasons after being messed with by this shady fuck, Charles Miller, got it blamed on "rubber tubing" which is known to be BS

            "For 24 years, Smith worked at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children. In the hospital's pediatric forensic pathology unit, he conducted more than 1,000 child autopsies."

           <p>
            "A pubic-like hair found on her daughter disappeared during Smith's investigation. It was discovered he had kept the hair in his office before police found it five years later. In the end, the charges against Waudby were dropped and the child's babysitter was convicted."

            Listen to this from the original article:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Crown Attorney Miazga prosecuted parents falsely 
accused of sexual assault by their foster children. The sexual 
abuse claims against the parents were grotesque and outrageous, 
and included alleged ritual killings of babies and animals. The 
prosecution was continued against the families, even though the 
allegations were unbelievably preposterous. The children later 
recanted all allegations."
           </p>
           <p>
            HOOOOOLY SHIT GUYS. Back in 1980's. FUCK EM UP.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is what was going on in Saskatchewan:

            The case got bungled to throw it out, but kids being put in cages on the walls of the church, abused with axe handles and vibrators: 
"By the spring of 1992 Martensville was reeling with rumours about a Satanic cult called The Brotherhood of The Ram that had police officers as members." JEEZE I WONDER WHY THE INVESTIGATION WAS BOTCHED
Who runs Brotherhood of the Ram? Donald Ross Blythe

            What do we have Mr. Blythe doing? Raping a woman at gunpoint and getting away with it 
"she did not wish the man to go to jail and she did not wish to continue with the matter for her own physical and mental well being."
