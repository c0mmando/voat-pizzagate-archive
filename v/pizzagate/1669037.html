            My reasoning for this is that people usually develop these tendencies as they come of age (e.g college or recent graduates). There are a number of power folks who graduated the same year and +/- 3 years as JP, overlapping with him. I would assume that it's natural for like minded people to do these disgusting acts together and become comfortable doing it together as they grow old enough to know what they want. I don't have a full alumni list of the years but that may be something to acquire.

            I'm not trying to unload this task onto others for the sake of being lazy but I am too busy and not willing to go further down this rabbit hole. So i'm just trying to spark someone interest if they choose to do a little interest.

            Other paths of research similar to this could be to look into Hastert's and Sandusky's college history and friends.I think people don't just wake up as full grown adults and decide to do these things but may have developed the motives as they came into adulthood and associated themselves with other like minded people to justify it and help to get away with it.
