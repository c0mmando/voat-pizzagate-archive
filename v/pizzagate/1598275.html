<p>After posting the above link I started to think about Laura Silsby/Dentists/Haiti </p>
<p>We have her advertising for this Dental/Surgeon charity...</p>
<p>&quot;The Haiti effort was not Silsby\'s first attempt to help children overseas. She worked with a local teacher to create a nonprofit group called <strong>Kids Changing Lives With the Gift of Smile</strong>. Through the organization, school teachers encouraged their students to raise money for <strong>Operation Smile</strong>, which performs surgery on children to correct cleft palates and other facial deformities. Operation Smile spokesman Scott Vooss said Silsby and schoolchildren have raised nearly $40,000 so far - enough to cover about 166 operations.&quot;

<p>Laura Silsby advertises Operation Smile again. She may have also been more involved than described in this PR but I\'m not positive. &quot;By purchasing your holiday gifts from <strong>PersonalShopper.com\'s Operation Smile Gift Collection</strong>, you can provide the chance for these children to lead normal lives.&quot; <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/change-a-childs-life-operation-smile-gift-collection-from-personalshoppercom-benefits-children-in-need-55516692.html">http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/change-a-childs-life-operation-smile-gift-collection-from-personalshoppercom-benefits-children-in-need-55516692.html</a></p>
<p>We have her father who was a dentist and worked with orphans in Haiti.
&quot;Ms. Silsby\'s interest in the plight of Haitian children started <strong>with her father, who did missionary dental work in Haiti</strong>, her parents said. (Anyone have more information on this? Does he have connections with Operation Smile? Which Orphanages did he work with&quot;?)
<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703357104575045794048725562">http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703357104575045794048725562</a></p>
<p>We have the dentist Rob Chenvert who was her partner for NLCR and helped find land
New Life Children\'s Refuge began the process of buying land in Magante. One of Ms. Silsby\'s colleagues in the venture – former dentist <strong>Rob Chenvert</strong>, now a realtor in the Dominican Republic who worked with Ms. Silsby to find land and buildings for the planned orphanage – said on Friday that the group had no contact with Mr. Puello until after the arrest. <a href="http://theawarenesscenter.blogspot.com/2010/02/case-of-jorge-torres-orellana.html">http://theawarenesscenter.blogspot.com/2010/02/case-of-jorge-torres-orellana.html</a></p>
<p>In 2000, Rob retired after practicing dentistry for 18 years in the U.S. During those years, he traveled extensively to the Caribbean in search of areas that would be suitable for relocation in the future. One trip to the North Coast of the Dominican Republic was all it took. A short nine months later, Rob and his wife had purchased their property and permanently re-located in November 2005. Rob accepted a position in the real-estate company through which his property purchase was made. One week after arrival, Rob began as an independent broker trainee and eventually became general manager prior to setting out on his own. (<strong>Really one week after? Didn\'t your retire?</strong>)
<a href="http://www.drreba.com/about/">http://www.drreba.com/about/</a></p>
<p>While I was researching this whole dentist angle I stumbled upon an article about a dentist from October 2016 that caught my attention.</p>
<p>Charles Ritzen, founder of The Ritzen Group in Nashville, his wife, Candy, and charity worker Benjamin Cole Brown were lost on Monday evening after <strong>their plane went down while returning from an aid mission to hurricane-ravaged Haiti.</strong> According to media reports from the Dominican Republic and Florida, wreckage of the plane was found, but as of Thursday morning, a search and rescue operation was still in progress. The Ritzens, after leaving Middle Tennessee for their retirement, were living in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic and operating Monkey Jungle &amp; Zip Line Adventures, a tourist attraction where 100 percent of the proceeds fund a medical and dental clinic in Sosua, Dominican Republic, and to pay for medical and aid missions to Haiti.<strong>The Ritzen Group specializes in construction of healthcare facilities</strong> (POTENTIALLY VERY IMPORTANT, I WILL COME BACK) According to The Ledger of Lakeland, Fla., the three were returning from Jeremie, Haiti, after delivering supplies following the devastation of Hurricane Matthew. <a href="http://springhillhomepage.com/ritzen-group-founder-lost-in-plane-crash-while-on-charity-mission/">http://springhillhomepage.com/ritzen-group-founder-lost-in-plane-crash-while-on-charity-mission/</a></p>
<p>So I look into Chuck and Candy Ritzen and find they own a non profit corporation, focusing on medical care, education, agriculture and vocational training in Haiti and the DR. Some info on Ritzen\'s website....</p>
<p>&quot;The Leon-Laroche Clinics at Monkey Jungle started in mid-2009 with visiting Nashville pediatric dentist, Dr. David Snodgrass, pulling teeth in the rear of a Dodge pickup truck. By the end of 2009 we finished our small medical and dental clinics. Then I met Dr. Gerry, a retired orthodontist from Canada, and with his skill the clinic blossomed.
By the end of 2009 it was apparent that we needed a commercial attraction to expand, maintain and perpetuate these free clinics. The ideas to open a zip line and jungle where monkeys could enjoy their native habitat were born.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nestled about 9 kilometers up a lonely jungle road between Sosua and Cabarete (<strong>This is where Silsby was going to lease a hotel</strong>) on the North Coast of the Dominican Republic is a tourist attraction whose sole purpose is to fund a Free on-site Dental and Medical Clinic (<strong>complete with Pharmacy<strong>) for the underprivileged.  The Monkey Jungle and Zip Line Adventure was founded by Chuck and Candy Ritzen after the Leon-Laroche Clinics at Monkey Jungle started in mid-2009 with visiting Nashville pediatric dentist, Dr. David Snodgrass, pulling teeth in the rear of a Dodge pickup truck.  By the end of 2009 we finished our small Dental and Medical clinics. (</strong>Around the same time Silsby was preparing the orphanage</strong>) Then Chuck Ritzen met Dr. Gerry, a retired orthodontist from Canada, and his wife, Sandi, and with their skill the clinic blossomed.&quot;

<p>I keep researching and what do you know, I bump into <strong>ROB CHENVERT</strong> advertising <strong>RITZEN\'S</strong>company! </p>
<p>Interested in providing dental care in the Dominican Republic? The Haitian and Dominican Assistance Corporation (HADAC) is seeking dental professionals to volunteer in a brand new clinic outside the town of Sosua.  The organization is dedicated to offering medical and dental care to those in need in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  In addition to volunteers, HADAC is seeking equipment and supply donations.  <strong>Contact Dr. Robert Chenvert for more information at rob@drreba.com or visit www.hadac.org</strong>.
(Now he wants to get back involved in dentistry and real estate after retiring?) 
<a href="https://cdaonline.org/dentalprofessionals/membership/">https://cdaonline.org/dentalprofessionals/membership/</a></p>
<p>Also on twitter someone posted a screenshot where Rob Chenvert was mentioning Chuck Ritzen and HDAC <a href="https://twitter.com/DropThe_Mic/status/807621839388282881Lola">https://twitter.com/DropThe_Mic/status/807621839388282881Lola</a> (I typed out some of the screenshot below.)</p>
<p>&quot;In the past 5 years we have attempted to volunteer when possible, despite there not being any well organized way to help. We were so pleased to have met Chuck Ritzen just a month or so ago and learn more about his organization HDAC. HDAC.org is dedicated to offering medical and dental care to those in need both in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. <strong>I have offered my services to work dilligently in an attempt to recruit volunteers, procure donatins through HDAC\'s US non-profit organization as well as personally assist in the coordination of all aspects of a volunteer\'s visit</strong> in order to make it a most sucessful one. This is an opportunity to make a direct positive impact for many much less fortunate&quot; The original link is scrubbed. If you type &quot;Robert chenvert and Chuck Ritzen Hadac&quot; into google you can find the broken link.</p>
<p>THEN I FOUND A REALLY INTERESTING ARTICLE ON CHUCK RITZEN\'S SECRET AIRSTRIP
<strong>Agents bust “secret” airstrip next to Dominican resort town Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic</strong>
 Puerto Plata Airbase Intelligence agents and assistant prosecutors dismantled an airstrip for small planes which operated in the dark of night in the sector El Choco, of the Atlantic coast tourism resort town Sosúa.
The 1,800 meter long, 30 meter <strong>wide airstrip is reportedly located on land owned by U.S. citizen Charlis Ritzen</strong>, and the authorities found an ultralight aircraft registry C-IB0R, piloted by Stiben Kostero, who allegedly used it for sports flights, from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Puerto Plata <strong>DA Victor Mueses confirmed that the airstrip operated in secret</strong>, for which the investigation was widened to determine which type of aircraft used it for night flights. He said <strong>law enforcement agencies were tipped off that secret night  landings occurred in the community</strong>, and ordered it destroyed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2011/3/18/38946/Agents-bust-secret-airstrip-next-to-Dominican-resort-town">http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2011/3/18/38946/Agents-bust-secret-airstrip-next-to-Dominican-resort-town</a> 
(He can be seen in the comment section trying to deny this story.)</p>
<p>I then research the Ritzen group and find a VERY interesting article...</p>
<p><strong><em>I will finish my post in the comment section...I know this a lot and unorganized but I just wanted to get this info out sooner than later. I\'m too busy to research anything for a while so I\'m just dumping this. Maybe someone has stuff to had to this, who knows but this could be important.</em></strong>**</p>',

           I keep researching and what do you know, I bump into
           <strong>

           Interested in providing dental care in the Dominican Republic? The Haitian and Dominican Assistance Corporation (HADAC) is seeking dental professionals to volunteer in a brand new clinic outside the town of Sosua.  The organization is dedicated to offering medical and dental care to those in need in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  In addition to volunteers, HADAC is seeking equipment and supply donations.
           <strong>
            Contact Dr. Robert Chenvert for more information at

          <p>
           Also on twitter someone posted a screenshot where Rob Chenvert was mentioning Chuck Ritzen and HDAC
           <a href="https://twitter.com/DropThe_Mic/status/807621839388282881Lola">

           </a>
           (I typed out some of the screenshot below.)
          </p>
          <p>
           "In the past 5 years we have attempted to volunteer when possible, despite there not being any well organized way to help. We were so pleased to have met Chuck Ritzen just a month or so ago and learn more about his organization HDAC. HDAC.org is dedicated to offering medical and dental care to those in need both in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
           <strong>
            I have offered my services to work dilligently in an attempt to recruit volunteers, procure donatins through HDAC's US non-profit organization as well as personally assist in the coordination of all aspects of a volunteer's visit
           </strong>
           in order to make it a most sucessful one. This is an opportunity to make a direct positive impact for many much less fortunate" The original link is scrubbed. If you type "Robert chenvert and Chuck Ritzen Hadac" into google you can find the broken link.

          <p>
           THEN I FOUND A REALLY INTERESTING ARTICLE ON CHUCK RITZEN'S SECRET AIRSTRIP
           <strong>
            Agents bust “secret” airstrip next to Dominican resort town Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic
           </strong>
           Puerto Plata Airbase Intelligence agents and assistant prosecutors dismantled an airstrip for small planes which operated in the dark of night in the sector El Choco, of the Atlantic coast tourism resort town Sosúa.
The 1,800 meter long, 30 meter
           <strong>
            wide airstrip is reportedly located on land owned by U.S. citizen Charlis Ritzen
           </strong>
           , and the authorities found an ultralight aircraft registry C-IB0R, piloted by Stiben Kostero, who allegedly used it for sports flights, from 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Puerto Plata
           <strong>
            DA Victor Mueses confirmed that the airstrip operated in secret
           </strong>
           , for which the investigation was widened to determine which type of aircraft used it for night flights. He said
           <strong>
            law enforcement agencies were tipped off that secret night  landings occurred in the community
           </strong>
           , and ordered it destroyed.
          </p>

           </a>
           (He can be seen in the comment section trying to deny this story.)
          </p>
          <p>
           I then research the Ritzen group and find a VERY interesting article...
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            <em>
             I will finish my post in the comment section...I know this a lot and unorganized but I just wanted to get this info out sooner than later. I'm too busy to research anything for a while so I'm just dumping this. Maybe someone has stuff to had to this, who knows but this could be important.

            Michael Mastromarino was a dentist guilty of the same thing.  Also RTI Organics gave corporate aid to the 2010 Haitian earthquake, probably because they wanted the skin grafts and organs.  They were caught organ trafficking in the Ukraine.

            Remember when Hillary collapsed at the 9-11 ceremony?  And people started digging into the apartment (Chealse's, right?) that she was taken to instead of an actual hospital... and they were saying that her apartment had a medical suite in it???  Is that another place they are harvesting children's organs / stem cells??  And what was the deal with Epstein having a dental chair in his house?  Back when we were on reddit, I think I remember there being quite a few links to dental chairs / medical equipment.

              I don't know. Being objective, having an airstrip seems common there, and could have been very useful to transport aid. On the other hand, given the other points you've uncovered, one has to wonder. With all the documented child abuse going on in Haiti, it could well have been used for other purposes. Very possible. Digging needed.

             I'm so glad this was able to connect to something someone has researched.
             <br/>
             The amount of people connected in this whole thing with these logos is absurd.  I can't name anyone 
I know that owns a business with a logo close to this. But at least 10 different people with all with some sort of connection and lots of money have these FBI pedo logos.
            </p>
            <p>
             I had a feeling that guy would come back into the picture and how the hell does that lady Abramovich manage to come into play again? These things really seem more than coincidences.

            When I read your post, my heart almost stopped. About 3 months ago, when I was on reddit and PG's investigation had just started, I stumbled on this guy's post about a pizza place called
            <strong>
             Boston Pizza
            </strong>
            and its foundation's weird logo. We were the only ones at the time that gave it a second thought. It was at around the same time that the Laura Silsby/Hillary connection on the 33 trafficked children had just broke. As I was digging into Boston Pizza and it's charitable Partnership 'The Boston Pizza Foundation' and its logo here:

             For over 25 years, The Boston Pizza Foundation has been committed to raising funds to help support kids in communities across Canada. Thanks to our various charity promotions, we’ve raised over $24 million to help give kids a brighter future. Every $5 donated equals one hour with a positive role model, and every year we provide over 200,000 hours of positive guidance.

As you can imagine, it has been an extremely tough week for the friends and family of Benjamin Cole Brown and Chuck and Candy Ritzen. At this time, given all collected data and search information, it is believed that the type of plane crash that Cole, Chuck, and Candy were involved in was not a survivable one, and that we will not see the kind of recovery we had all hoped for..."

            Laura Silsby trafficked children from Haiti into the Dominican Republic and this humanitarian worker was killed in a plane crash in between the two countries? It definitely caught my attention and so I went on with the digging.

            "MJ Medical facts for 2010
The clinic served over 3800 patients in 2010
Over seven teams from the US volunteered their time and skills to treat patients
Over 22 volunteers worked more than one Saturday at the clinic
Our pharmacy dispensed over 8,000 prescriptions
We are saddened by the deaths of the terminally ill who passed away in 2010
The clinic has over 20 doctors from the US planning to help in 2011.
 
Thanks to all the hard working volunteers and staff in 2010 "

            The terminally ill?  Could organ harvesting be a concern here as someone else in this thread mentioned?  After all he had an airstrip on the property and when looking up the cost of organ transplants just transplanting one single organ from one patient is quite lucrative.

             That's always in the back of my head. There was an article I read that said there's been a rumor that medical facilities would sneak out the bodies that way.  Sounds crazy. Then you think why the hell do you have a landing strip? who do you know needs to take off that fast that they can't go to an airport? (Some Airport is so close to his place anyways)   This is a RETIRED man BUT he's coincidentally doing good work(DENTAL) for CHILDREN in the same LOCATION as Silsby and is FRIENDS with Silsby's RETIRED DENTIST that is now a REAL ESTATE agent? Also, 1 individual out of no where BUYS $35 million worth of REAL ESTATE (medical facilities)  from the same person that constructed these facilities? That means 1 person knows what's really going on with that development. Remember Jorge Puello worked undercover for the US or CANADA at one point. That guys like a magician. Forging passports, trafficking, lying about being a lawyer. Any one of us would have been in jail. Instead he goes out in the open and defends a child trafficker?  is this weird or what?

              Maybe you someone or happen to know someone that knows someone but odds are small.

             <p>
              <strong>
               Why would you ever think about using that plane in secret?
The risk is so high if you get caught and what could be so important that it had to be secret.

             I think it's worth something. I just said this in a comment above but I'll paste it here as well...

             There was an article I read that said there's been a rumor that medical facilities would sneak out the bodies that way. Sounds crazy. Then you think why the hell do you have a landing strip? who do you know needs to take off that fast that they can't go to an airport? (Some Airport is so close to his place anyways) This is a RETIRED man BUT he's coincidentally doing good work(DENTAL) for CHILDREN in the same LOCATION as Silsby and is FRIENDS with Silsby's RETIRED DENTIST that is now a REAL ESTATE agent? Also, 1 individual out of no where BUYS $35 million worth of REAL ESTATE (medical facilities) from the same person that constructed these facilities? That means 1 person knows what's really going on with that development. Remember Jorge Puello worked undercover for the US or CANADA at one point. That guys like a magician. Forging passports, trafficking, lying about being a lawyer. Any one of us would have been in jail. Instead he goes out in the open and defends a child trafficker? is this weird or what?

                And a lot of them have Google alerts too.  If they have the alerts set up then each time their name (or whatever term, could be a business name etc) is mentioned.  They also get alerts if a google search is done on their name or specified terms.  I think this is how things are scrubbed so fast.  I'm sure they scrub things that we haven't even found yet as soon as their name turns up.  They know when a lot of people suddenly start googling their names.

           <p>
            Florida real estate investor
            <strong>
             Kurt L. Wallach
            </strong>
            didn’t have a single cent tied up in Nashville-area real estate. Six months later, he owns an estimated $35 million worth, including seven condominiums, a home in Brentwood, and a collection of
            <strong>
             medical properties that includes the 81,000-square-foot Cool Springs Surgical Center
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Wallach’s Middle Tennessee buying spree began with the purchase of the Cool Springs Surgery Center in Franklin in late summer 2002. The former physician-owned facility includes a diagnostic center and specialist offices, as well as 27,000 square feet of underground parking.
            <strong>
             It was developed by Nashville’s The Ritzen Group in 2000.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Through the Cool Springs Surgery Center purchase, Wallach said he became acquainted with and befriended The Ritzen Group’s Chuck Ritzen**. Ritzen gauged Wallach’s interest in acquiring other Nashville-area medical properties. Wallach was receptive to the idea and made four additional acquisitions in the past several weeks, two of which were formerly owned by Baptist Hospital.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last Friday, NashvillePost.com reported that Florida’s Kumar Equity Capital LLC purchased Baptist Hospital-owned Baptist Bellevue Medical Center for $4 million. The article also noted that Kumar purchased the 45,000-squre-foot Williamson Medial Center office building on Mallory Lane. The Ritzen Group developed the latter of the two properties.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the time of our initial story, no information was available on Kumar Equity’s members. However, Wallach confirmed that he was the buyer of both properties. Kumar, he explained, is a blend of Kurt and Marilyn, the name of his wife. He paid $5.65 million for the Mallory Lane Property.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also purchased by Wallach on Jan. 2, 2003, were Ritzen-developed and physician-owned Harpeth Medical Center (24,000 square feet), located at the corner of Old Hickory Boulevard and Granny White Pike in Brentwood, and the Lebanon Medical Center. Wallach said he paid $5.1 million for the Brentwood property and about the same for the Lebanon facility.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             NashvillePost.com understands The Ritzen Group helped broker the sale of several of properties above on Wallach’s behalf. Some were purchased first by The Ritzen Group and then re-sold to Wallach
            </strong>
            . According to the Williamson County Registrar of Deeds, Ritzen paid Baptist Hospital $4.5 million for the Williamson Medical Center building on Mallory Lane in September 2002. Wallach paid $1.15 million more roughly four months later. When contacted about the difference in price, Wallach commented that Ritzen appears to have "made a nice profit" on the transaction. The Ritzen Group’s Chuck Ritzen said his firm "leased the building up." He declined to comment on specific activity.
           </p>
           <p>
            All seven of Wallach’s Nashville condos are located in the Rutledge House development on Second Avenue in downtown Nashville. Wallach said he paid just under $1 million for all seven. The Ritzen Group initially developedRutledge House as a 41-unit apartment complex in 1986. The property was converted to condos in 1999.

            INTERESTING THAT ALMOST ALL ARE DEVELOPED BY RITZEN
           </p>
           <p>
            So I go on twitter and find an interesting convo (took place before Ritzens Plane crash)
           </p>
           <p>
            Person 1- Help me look at these (inside + outside of one Lindsley Hall wall). Evidence of a tunnel, or no?
           </p>
           <p>
            Person 2- I had an office @ LittererLabs bldg for 7 years in the 90s.  Chuck Ritzen did the original repurposing in 80s.

            I don't know what to make of it. Yes there are plenty of tunnels in Tenessse but you have to ask yourself why Kurt Wallach was buying  so many properties from the same developer who happens to be Charles Ritzen who is friends with the dentist Rob Chenvert who helped Laura Silsby a child trafficker.

            Are they transporting perscription drugs from the pharmacy they have in DR? Are they trafficking kids?Are they doing experiments? I mean they do have a plane and was found to have a landing strip on their property. Who knows but nothing wrong with questioning this situation.

            Lastly, I was looking at the some info on crimes in the DR and this story caught my attention..
Assailants
            <strong>
             strangled an attorney and former member of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
            </strong>
            (DEA), inside his apartment in the city's Los sector Los Garages.  the Dominican-American Juan D. (Jimmy) Valerio
            <strong>

            , 65, found strangled in his home last week. Valerio was also a member of the Natinoal Investigations Dept. (DNI) in Dominican Republic. 6/15/2012 (Ritzen's secret plane landing strip was brought to attention 6 months before. Hmm)

            I read this and immediately thought of my post last month
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1460802">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1460802
            </a>
            . Is this kid (jon
            <strong>
             Pichardo
            </strong>
            ) who begs the CIA for help connected to this US DEA? He talks about how a lot of his family work for the governemnt, he's checked into the white house, worked for salvation army, talks about the Bilderberg and CIA to help him and not hurt anyone. (Is he brainwashed or something? I don't even see anyone interacting with his posts yet he mentions the same stuff over and over and over)
Everything needs more digging.
