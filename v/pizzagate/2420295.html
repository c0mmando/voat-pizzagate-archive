This was in retaliation of the N.S.A. discovering that the C.I.A. has been behind pedophile rings around the world supplying children and using it as mass blackmail and brownstone operations in order to film politicians and other people of interest to rape children. He claims Snowden was never even an N.S.A. agent but a C.I.A. agent. Lmaolight spoke about this here </p>
<p>&quot;&quot;The battle between the CIA and the NSA became public again when the CIA set up a sting that uncovered that Cisco Systems, a DARPA company, has built-in back doors on all their routers so that the NSA can spy undetected. The main stream media was even given videos of Cisco employees installing the backdoors in routers. The CIA found out about the back doors and made the information public to stop the NSA’s hacking of the CIA systems.”</p>
<p>&quot;The NSA has the global surveillance capabilities to intercept all the DNC and Podesta emails. CIA is college grads only and has the traditions of the urban yankee northeastern and east coast ivy leaguers, “Blue State”, liberals. CIA hacks and has a cyber capability too according to VP Joe Biden. What if the NSA leaked the emails to Wikileaks to help Trump? What if the CIA discovered NSA was leakin emails? What would they go and do about it? Go to the FBI? Go public? What if they ain’t able to go public because they themselves are in violation of some domestic law? Enter the shadow brokers. I rekon the shadow brokers is CIA.What if the shadow brokers incident is CIA tit-for-tat retribution against NSA email leaks? Hack or steal NSA tools? Embarrass them? Get them broken up, fired? Sounds far fetched? Clapper and Carter tried to get Rogers fired. They also called for the breakup of NSA.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;In retaliation against the NSA, the CIA chose Edward Snowden, who was working for the CIA through Booz Allen Hamilton, to release stolen NSA documents that proved the NSA was illegally spying on Americans through computers, phones, and many other electronic devices. Snowden didn’t work for the NSA and did not have access to NSA files though he released a huge amount of data that confirmed the NSA’s surveillance. Michael Alperovitch’s CIA handlers ordered Snowden to turn over the NSA’s PKI encryption codes so that the CIA could enter the NSA’s system and steal the files needed to prove the NSA’s illegal surveillance. Snowden did not personally have access to those codes nor the information in the NSA system as part of his job.&quot;</p>
<p>If this is true, the N.S.A. are at war with the C.I.A. Do we have whitehats with the N.S.A. and the F.B.I.? I know the FBI vs CIA rivilry has been spoken about on these forums and written about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge:_The_Secret_War_between_the_FBI_and_CIA">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge:_The_Secret_War_between_the_FBI_and_CIA</a> Since the C.I.A. get International status they can just tell the F.B.I. to cease investigations and that they have no jurisdiction  I know for sure the C.I.A. is only a quasi government agency. They are  the ones creating these pedophile brownstoning rings. Operation Mockingbird, Operation Paperclip, MKUltra these are all C.I.A. operations. Could this &quot;government agency&quot; actually be rogue and the U.S. Government in a secret civil war? Lamplight brought the topic of but if someone can help find the original Q post that would be great </p>

<p>It was said Military and Intelligence officials working with us thwarted what would of been the worst terrorist attack on American Soil ever seen. I want to know who these whitehats are. I\'m wondering if that\'s the N.S.A.? Would make sense since they have more authority than the F.B.I. does and besides the mass spying that came up we don\'t hear of these atrocities and trafficking rings selling children and drugs occurring within the N.S.A. we hear them coming out of the C.I.A. I think the C.I.A. has so much dirt on the rest of the government it\'s essentially holding them hostage and is completely rogue. Three C.I.A. whistleblowers have come out saying what they have did. </p>

             As far as it ruining sharing outside of Voat, do you really think the PG people don't know PG gets attacked and spammed and COINTEL played all over the place?

               I'm against the globalist Zionists that bomb innocent children out of their homes, that deep state everybody keeps talking about. The people responsible for what we fight against every day. I don't want a war with you, I just don't like the Rothschilds and I think I have good reasons.

                ESOTERIC is one of the more intelligent and level-headed commenters on here. (He reminds me of one H.S., with whom I once worked on the Vince Foster murder.) I have always enjoyed his input. He's never been abusive. And neither has Vindicator. This is a storm in a teacup. Chill, guys. Moving on...

            That is all I am doing is pointing out Qs and Trump's affiliation with Rothschild. I'm not trying to stir up shit. I think its a valid point. You know I appreciate what you have done. I just got through praising the flair experiment in the sticky at the top of the page and praising all the mods for a job well done. The Trump/Rothschild cozy affiliation is one that is hard for me to ignore. I pointed it out. That is all I really wanted to do. I'm done for the moment :)

            Another thought of mine goes like this.. ALL of the 3-letter agencies are bad and they are ALWAYS at war with eachother. 'Q' Anon on 4-chan was maybe real but eventually the NSA figured him out. They couldn't get his password for 4-chan but they DID manage to create some credentials on 8-chan that were reminiscent of the 4-chan stuff. Not exact but surprisingly close (your tax dollars at work). Q Anon on 8-chan has been wrong about too many things to be legit. He denfends the NSA. Therefore my assumption is that he IS NSA.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope this theory is wrong.

              Pieczenik is the one who came out in November 2016 and said there was a war within the government basically just as gamepwn describes in his first paragraph. He called it a "silent coup".

            The Intercept is a CIA publication designed to expose the NSA's secrets.  Just like Snowden, the CIA contractor assigned to NSA duties.  The CIA has built their own SIGINT collection capabilities, though nothing like the NSAs.  They did this as they though Snowden's leaks would bring the NSA down and they would inherit the collections infrastructure.  Flynn shit on the CIAs plans.  Hence the all out assault on him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Israel is not involved in our collections.  Our SIGINT capabilities are based inside of the Five Eyes or UKUSA as it is sometimes called.  US, CAN, CAN, UK, AUS.

              DoD sent us warnings constantly not to visit the website, as well as WL stuff.  It created quite the problem when TS/SCI was all over the www, friends were .commailing  daily with info.  Then it came time for the periodic renewals (PR) of CI polygraphs...boy did that create a mess.

              Here's where it gets more interesting.  It was/is funde dby Pierre Omidyar.  Check out his WP page...Wonder if he comes up in WL?

            I heard a rumor recently that 1 white hat has leaked thousands of government/institutional documents to the FBI that implicates the CIA in their MKULTRA programs. If this is true, then the CIA is fucked and exposed for the evil nazis that they are! Ha ha mother fuckers!

              This guy gets it ^. This stuff all seems like not only a distraction but a way to get us to trust the current administration. "sucking us into" the conservative side of the left right paradigm.

              Then, they can conveniently call us terms like "alt right" or "the trump base". This is literally online warfare, a mass scale psyop. We need to be aware of shit like this.

            The NSA is the granddaddy of intel over the CIA. Of course they know the CIA is trafficking kids and the CIA knows they know. Everybody that is anybody in D.C. knows about it and always has. At least a third of the D.C. politicians, or more, send there kids to prep schools to get sodomized and learn their place in the Freemasonic pecking order.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the NSA ever had any intention of out the CIA they simply would have done it. Trump has never spoken a word about a pedophile ring that a third of D.C. is involved in and that he is taking it down. Until he does Qs war on the deep state is a fable because that that pedo ring runs the deep state. Tired of hearing about white that 64 Gorrillion D chess too.

              Because you are a good moderator but you keep using this sub as your political soap box by doing anything you can think of to drag Q and Trump into a discussion about saving children. Half of the American population do not like Trump and do not want to hear about your Trump and Q worship and would help us if you didn't pound them with your Trump soap box. Today i'm a little more irritated about it than usual for some reason.

              Israel is Rothschild's personal creation. Trump sends billions to Israel while Americans go homeless and live one paycheck away from bankruptcy.

              Q references the evil Protocols Of The Elders of Zion and not once points at Trump to affiliate Trump with Israel. This is called deflection, ignorance, or a lie, because Trump is in bed with Israel and the criminal political movement known as Zionism.

              Trump is a deceptive plague to the truth movement that tells us things we love to hear and does nothing to create long term beneficial changes in our daily lives.

              Thank you Vindicator. I just got to reading all of this and am like what the hell, so for mentioning Q suddenly im disinfo? Thats called not allowing another user their free speech to talk about something becauze suddenly its the no no word. I have 48 posts and the one I mention with Q gets attacked by multiple people when Gothamgirl and many others have had a similar thought as well? Thinking to myself wow. I mentioned multiple times how it's connected to Pizzagate just because im not talking about evil jews does not make me disinfo.

             What are you talking about? Look you can hate the government as much as you want and all the alphebet agencies and Trump and everyone in politics. However I usually never talk about Q or comment on threads talking about him. I found all this information through multiple sources, Q just being one along with my two links I posted and lamplights post. I mentioned multiple CIA operations and three different agents who admit to traffiking children. You can hate the government but I mentioned multiple times how its related, how and who in the CIA admit to doing what, and my link talks about how the NSA intercepted the Podesta emails and possibly gave them to Wikileaks. Don't tell me im posting something nonrelated to PG because I have dozens of topics where I never mentioned Q. This is the first Q post I took interest in through Lamplights research.

              Good one! It takes good eyes to see pizzagate because a person needs to somewhat understand the occult. For this reason pizzagaters should have better eyes than run of the mill conspiracy buffs. And then, wham, from somewhere out of the blue a few pizzagaters have some form of terminal blindness to the two party system. It puzzles me immensely. It also infuriates half of the voting American public who would otherwise be receptive to our message.

              If you gave a seminar on child abuse would you spend half your time beating them over the head with a political soapbox? Half of that audience would not like Trump but would also despise child abuse enough to spread the message of child abuse. This political soapbox mixed in our message instantly drives away half of our available audience and turns them into our enemy as well. I have tried every way I can think of to explain this simple concept to

              , but so far, to no avail. Vindicator refuses to leave the political soap box in the trunk of the car when moderating here and it drives away non Trumpers that also hate child abuse.

              you do a good job but this thread should be flaired because it made no attempt to explain it's relevance and it would not pass the smell test unless it had Q in the title. A lof of us are fed up with your beating people over the head with your politics in this forum and you need to save that shit for Twitter because this forum is not your soap box.

               I’m stressed out today so I’m not going to argue. But think of this for a moment. The ones we’re fighting for abusing these kids many times involve the elite. Royal families, politicians, celebrities, etc...
              </p>
              <p>
               Using your scenario, if there was a seminar on child abuse, if you want someone to see the whole picture and understand it, then yes you do have to dig deeper. You do have to bring up the ones behind it all and the ones that we have to fight to fix it. We can’t do it on our own.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is like war. Good verses evil. If we want change, it involves the people that run the world. Bringing up military, CIA, politicians, celebrities, etc should all be on the table. Sorry if that’s irritating to some. I get irritated by Trump and Q bashers. Nobody holds back on me. People attack me all the time. People can bring up valid points and people only focus on the fact that someone said Q or Trump.

               Pizzagate is like one branch of a tree. To get the whole tree, we have to get over other branches. Sorry. I’m retarted trying to explain myself 🙄 I’m sure you get it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Just to be fair, you also post about politics and anti-Trump articles. So that should go both ways. I’m so proud of me. I’m CALM 😚 Peace out my homies. I got things to do. Like take a nap. I woke up at 2!

               That’s just my 2 cents.

                If I host a seminar about child abuse I don't plan to alienate a large portion of the audience by throwing a one sided political argument at them knowing that roughly half of them will feel like I tricked them into a political rally instead of a seminar about child abuse. If I do plan to pound my audience with a one sided political party seminar I will make sure to tell the people that don't support Trump not to bother to show up and be pissed off. We are not here to alienate half of the public that does not want to hear about Trump. Just my two cents.

                 But Trump is just one person. There are bad republicans too. That’s not what it’s about. My point is that people bring up Trump allll the time. Good and bad. It’s not fair for one group but not the other. I’m always attacked for my beliefs. But at least here we have more freedom and aren’t banned like Twitter.

               I read the post, too, and I too, decided to let it stay, so the reason definitely is
               <em>
                not
               </em>
               that Q is in the headline.
              </p>
              <p>
               As you know, I have said from the beginning that IMO Q is very likely a psy-op by team Trump. And I haven't changed this view since I became a mod.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't agree with OP, as I can't see why the NSA would be an organization which employs many white hats.
              </p>
              <p>
               But it is not my job to decide this, my job is to decide whether the post meets the rules, and it does.

              <p>
               Please note
               <strong>
                the question marks in the headline
               </strong>
               OP uses. He wrote this as a discussion post, and invited the community to chime in.

                I really don't care as much about the flair as I do the constant selling of Trump and the attempts to push it into this sub. This is a child abuse sub instead of place to sell Rothschild's buddies like Trump. Half of the American public hates Trump and we alienate them when our mod pushes it in this sub.

                  Israel is Rothschild's personal creation. Trump sends billions to Israel while Americans go homeless and live one paycheck away from bankruptcy.

                  Q references the evil Protocols Of The Elders of Zion and not once points at Trump to affiliate Trump with Israel. This is called deflection, ignorance, or a lie, because Trump is in bed with Israel and the criminal political movement known as Zionism.

                  Trump is a deceptive plague to the truth movement that tells us things we love to hear and does nothing to create long term beneficial changes in our daily lives.

                    I notice you are not going to stop stirring the pot. I posted the information I wanted to post. If Vindicator wants to be invisible from critique because he is a mod then I don't think that will happen. Vindicator is both a user and a mod and what Vin says is fair game to be examined like all other comments. I already posted the information I wanted to post but if you want to continue to poke at it be my guest.

                Nice. Instead of addressing the following you smear me. I'm on solid ground and you are throwing insults. Nice job. I just don't think we should be selling Rothschild in this sub for obvious reasons. Instead of discussing the following you start pinging up a shit storm.

             Trump hasn't the balls to do shit. All he's interested in is being "Americas Greatest President". Sessions was deliberately picked so that he would do nothing and give trump cover for doing nothing. Q is a time wasting LARP designed to make you believe that things are happening. Reality check the swap is carrying on with their Global Agenda regardless of Trump temporarily in the White House. I doubt its 5 years till they deploy the military robots then its game over. A 100 patriots won't be able to take down one of those suckers. Then the Elite will F$ck ALL your kids if they want.

              Trump has never spoken a word about a pedophile ring that a third of D.C. is involved in and that he is taking it down. Until he does Qs war on the deep state is a fable because that pedo ring runs the deep state, and the deep state is a Zionist Deep State.

             You make some great points.

             However, I will say it seems there is a recent hysteria on pinning the entire "New World Order" elite plan on solely Jewish influence.

             They are a powerful faction within this global crime syndicate, yes. But they do not control everything. On reddit, we're noticing the shills are purposely planting anti-jewish and ant-semetic themed posts and racist rants, to make us look bad. It's safe to say the shills are making us look anti semetic and racist/sexist by nature. Further evidence of them merging us with the "alt right" and tainting our overall image to the public.

               to the list. Pretends "not to understand Zionism well enough to make a decision" about this issue. That is almost a direct quote too. I can probably find it and screen shot it if i have to. Wants to defend Trump so bad that Vind posts articles attempting to prove that Eastern European Armenians pretending to be Jews were in Palestine first. I'm getting touchy about this support for Rothschild's Israel and i'm sort of in a mood about it today.

               Jewish author Benjamin Freedman and many other Jews have blown the whistle on that fallacy long ago. Arthur Koestler too. Take your pick, that cat jumped out of the bag long ago.

            That is a Verizon owned property. Couldn't understand the Yahoo purchase or the lawsuits from NYC about failed contracts for the city of new york.  So you have NSA / VERIZON overlooking Brooklyn, while Manhattan's meat packing district on 15th is home to Google/NSA/FBI/NYPD/Twitter.

            A few things are going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            CIA was OSS. It used to be known as "Oh, So Social!" because they cared more about being friends with their college buddies than doing their damn jobs. Apparently that has not changed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Multinational spy orgs. You see a company made up of an American, a Brit, an Israeli, an Arab, and a Russian. All of them are spies. They all know they all are spies. All of them claim that that they are spying on one another and they all rip up their respective countries' laws to make a few bucks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Private contractors. Also known as mercenaries. George W. Bush encouraged funding private spy agencies under the theory that they are more efficient and effective than the government. He forgot that mercs will work for other countries too. The private CIA takes jobs from our enemies and hires enough of the real CIA to corrupt it into blindness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Legally mandated funding. Convince a judge to declare Bradley Manning's hormone treatments a civil right and whoever makes the stuff has a guaranteed profit channel from your tax dollars. The same goes for AIDS treatments, car insurance, health insurance, education, etc. A business sticks itself onto the profit channel and they will do everything that they can to keep that funding coming in, kick competitors out, and bill the taxpayer for as much of it as they can. They become the "deep state."
           </p>
           <p>
            The PLO. It is really the center of everything going wrong in Western society. Modern Fake News started in the 1970s with the New York Times lying about Israel to support the PLO. Communist college professors were recruited into the PLO back when they were a Soviet front. They are now recruiting today's college students directly into organizations that support the PLO that also happen to be fronts for Hamas, Hezbollah, etc. These college students join the CIA and will need to be deprogrammed or else they will blindly support America's enemies.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Social Justice" is the situation with the PLO all over again, except even worse. School administrators and employers insist upon loyalty to these organizations that are fronts for Hamas, Hezbollah, etc, and their useful idiots. Kids are told that these beliefs are mandatory throughout their K-12 and university and on all of the popular websites. They are taught to aggressively suppress any disagreement. These kids are the next generation of soldiers and CIA.

             Listen though, China and Russia are using the internet the best. and the american government is actually letting them test how radicalized they can make people.

             It's time for the so-called "white hats" in the Deep State (are there any?), use the same dirty tactics that the evil black hats use.  Arkancide, FF's, blackmail.  Take out their opponent by any means necessary before there is a kinetic civil war.

            I fully expect a real shooting war to break out.  It may be the only thing that saves our country.

             If we really do have whitehats and people within our government helping us it really might be the only thing. I hope there are people planning on going in a full blown war with these sadistic elite fucks and the people who follow them.

              Keep waking the mases, thats the tickets. Diverting our attention to presenting a logical and professional argument to the public. Might have to make some noise to get their attention. There was a protest last march, why not have another?

              I'm not sure how reliable that particular site is. I seem to recall they've pushed questionable stuff in the past.
