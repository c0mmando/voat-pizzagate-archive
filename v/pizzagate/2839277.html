            Here's an interesting summary "Esther Rantzen and the Paedophiles":
           </p>
           <p>

             https://www.scribd.com/doc/256503576/ESTHER-RANTZEN-and-the-paedophiles
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            (I'm familiar with one of the items: Child star Ben Fellows said Rantzen had invited her to a party in the New Forest area. He said he was propositioned by adults there. Here it claims ER invited BF to her own party.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder, since ER does have a home in the New Forest. (As my linked document mentions, there was even a pedophile incident in her swimming pool and a man arrested, while she was away.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway Fellows made some claims about a Sir Kenneth Clarke also. It's interesting that the anti-child abuse website Exaro disputed his claims. BF was charged with 'perverting the cause of justice' but found innocent.)

            Where do you get the information in the title? From your link I see she is making a comeback as a consultant on some old show she had.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's very curious that the Aanirfan blog just disappeared from blogspot, which is owned by Google. Did you see my post?:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2847088">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2847088
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            At first I thought 'blog removed' meant Google had deleted the whole blog. Perhaps some sort of 'deplatforming' censorship, but especially onerous since years of research is now gone. Aangirfan wasn't right wing but anti-Deep State.
           </p>
           <p>
            From your headline you could theorize perhaps it was Rantzen's people put pressure on Google to delete. Rantzen popped up regularly on the blog as a likely suspect.
           </p>
           <p>
            One mystery though is the pre-2014 version of the blog is still live. Why not censor that also, especially since it contains many Rantzen allegations. So now my third theory is
            <em>
             Aang and Irfan themselves deleted the blog
            </em>
            under pressure. The pre-2014 stuff became inaccessible and was abandoned due to a lost password, I believe. If you lose your password and your contact info is expired, you are SOL. So they would be unable to delete this material.
           </p>
           <p>
            My first voat-autistic impulse was to post a bunch of archived blog entries re: ER and others. But I consider A &amp; I allies and until I hear what happened, perhaps it's better to keep things low key. The A &amp; I blog entries link to original sources and information about ER and others is available elsewhere on the Net.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going to cut &amp; paste most of this on the other submission.

I am sure some of them MUST have. Then you must ask what happened to that info. Was it "sat upon" if so who had the wherewithall to put the lid on it?
I agree the "charity" sounds bogus and Esther Ratzen sounds like a gatekeeper to me. I can picture a scenario in my head . . . "Now, Esther. You know how we got you those primetime TV shows, and made you the nations darling? Well, we want you to do this little job for us."
