<p>&quot;Despite all of this mitigating evidence, despite the fact that there was not even enough evidence to pursue an indictment against Allen, a number of high-profile actors and actresses, in the name of #MeToo, have launched a campaign to destroy Allen’s career through a blacklist meant to make it socially unacceptable to work with him.</p>
<p>In a 60 year career, no one other than Dylan has ever accused Allen of any kind of inappropriate behavior. While many people (understandably) remain appalled at the Oscar-winner’s relationship with Soon-Yi, Mia’s adopted daughter (that began when he was 55 and she was just 19 or 20) — Allen and Soon-Yi have now been together 25 years. They were married in 1997 and have two adopted children of their own.&quot;</p>

<p>Nolte hasn\'t addressed why he thinks Allen would have volunteered the following in an old interview dug up by TMZ.  Could be he knows the usual &quot;it was a joke, you idiots&quot; defense won\'t cut it this time:</p>
<p>“Then 41-year-old Woody said, <strong>&quot;I\'m open-minded about sex. I\'m not above reproach; if anything, I\'m below reproach. I mean, if I was caught in a love nest with fifteen 12-year-old girls tomorrow, people would think, yeah, I always knew that about him.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>He added, <strong>&quot;Nothing I could come up with would surprise anyone ... I admit to it all.&quot;</strong>”</p>

            This happens all the time. Families split over accusations and other family members loyal to the father become staunch defenders and turn against the victim.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's just how it is. Anybody with even the slightest knowledge of psychology would know this to be true. The father and mother are the biggest influences and play the major important part in a child's development. How could they not? So it's psychologically understandable that members of a family will bad mouth/ostracise a sibling. After all, its the sibling causing trouble for the abuser and threatening the family unit. Never mind that the family unit was already compromised when the abuser committed the act of betrayal. The victim becomes the scapegoat and the child who's defending the father becomes closer and more important to the father (in the child's mind). It's done for that reason. Finally, the father pays attention to them. I think seeking the attention of the abusive parent is most often overlooked in studying these cases. The sibling being abused is seen as receiving the father's attention. It causes jealousy and envy among the other members of the family. The bashing/castigating of the victim releases some of this hostility. It's a way of getting back at said victim, and a way to reconnect with the father and reestablish receiving the attention they felt they lost through the father seeking out the victim to molest.

             Quite to the contrary, Justice Wilk made clear that Woody was trying to "pit one family member against
 the other" and evidently he finally came up with Moses ...
            </p>
            <p>
             However, originally, Moses made clear that Woody Allen from his first visits to Mia's apt was paying
unusual attention to Soon Yi.  This was a 12 year relationship so Soon Yi would have been fairly
young at the time.
Also at that time, Moses made very clear to the Court and Judge Wilk that he did not want to be forced
to have visits with Woody Allen ... and the Judge did not force him to do so.
Visits with Satchel were supervised.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ronan Farrow has made clear observing Woody Allen putting his thumb in Dylan's mouth.
Dylan also talks about that constantly happening and how she didn't like it.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was Woody Allen alone in the DEN with Dylan, kneeling in front of her, his face in here lap, toward her body.
Woody who took Dylan to a third floor dark attic in Mia's Connecticut home --
Woody who took NAKED and PORNOGRAPHIC PICTURES OF Soon Yi and left 
them on the Mantle of his apt for Mia to find.
            </p>
            <p>
             Woody who would have begun to realize that Mia had continued and affair with Frank Sinatra ...
and even worse that the son he thought he had with Mia (Satchel) was actually Frank Sinatra's child.
            </p>
            <p>
             And Woody who had been seeing a psychiatrist because of his "sexual obsession" with Dylan.

              Sorry, I'm not buying any of the bullshit either side is giving out. It's all up in the air because all the kids' genders are in question and Mia's too. It's all masonic trickery on both sides.

            The entire family is a mess and I could never decide which angle is true. Farrow is sketchy and Woody is odd. Usually Hollywood covers up, media covers up, but he has always been a target. Yet he is not a target by the law. I didn't like Dylan's interview, she seemed to be performing. But maybe she wasn't. But if Hollywood was against him, why do they produce his work, give him new contracts and why do top actors and actresses always work with him? Allen hangs out with Esptein. Epstein is protected. Yet they attack Woody? What...is going on?

             Perspective..imagine pedophiles at the top of the heap...they only hire other pedophiles or those who are very tolerant. It is becoming more apparent of late. Woody Allen , for some reason, was approved of. If you wanted parts or jobs, you don't rock the boat.The mind set took over all of Hollywood and US govt. Read Trance Formation of America by Cathy O'Brian....and Thanks for the Memories by Bryce Taylor...And oh...The Strange but Mostly True Story of Laurel Canyon and the Birth of the Hippie Generation Part 1. Dave McGowan. Only way to appreciate current news is by an understanding of the history.

             I think it's pretty obvious to anyone that he is in a relationship that is beyond creepy. It's actually criminal. By the media saying it's creepy (not criminal) and not going into the fact that he is her father (not bio father but stepfather - shouldn't make any difference) it is a way of directing people's thoughts on the subject.

            What people seem to forget is that Woody Allen took naked pictures of Soon-Yi when she was an underage teenager. Almost guaranteed he took many seemingly harmless pictures , than semi nude, than nude and than he raped her. That is how the grooming process works. The fact that he married the child he groomed and than adopted children just shows the possible continuing of the cycle. People need to educate themselves on how the grooming process works otherwise more children will be harmed

             Please look up the actual facts. This is not true.   Soon Yi was in College when this happened.   And I don't think anyone forgets that.  That was the background to the accusations with Dylan.

              Soon Yi was the daughter of Mia Farrow and she reacted as any Mother would at finding the NUDE and
PORNOGRAPHIC PICS of Soon Yi on Woody's mantle piece in his apartment.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let's also remember that by this time Woody Allen is figuring out that Mia has kept up a relationship
with Frank Sinatra and that Satchel is not his son, but  the child of Frank Sinatra.

              The information of her age was changed but Woody Allen ' s pathetic excuse does matter. He stated that Soon-Yi wanted to be a model and wanted pictures taken. Those pictures were not professional, artistic, beautifully lit pictures. They were Polaroid pictures taken by a man who had access to some of the best equipment around and best studios etc. around.  So obviously those pictures were taken for Woody Allen ' s personal gratification and almost guaranteed Soon-Yi was slowly introduced to that idea which could of started at a much younger age. Woody Allen crossed a obvious line by dating Soon-Yi and NOT everybody does remember the Polaroid pictures that were taken

               I always assumed that the pictures were taken when they were well into their affair.   I find it surprising that any forgets about the pictures.   The pictures came out
               <em>
                before
               </em>
               the affair was admitted to.  They were the backdrop to the events with Dylan.  The affair came out after the Dylan thing

               I don't buy Soon Yi as being groomed or being manipulated into the photos.  She seems like she was out to hurt Mia.  In 1992 Mia's team tried to portray her as intellectually stunted and a blank slate for Woody's intention, but she never read that way to me   She was on the Dean's List at college and would Master's at Columbia.  Later on, Mia changed her portrayal

              <p>
               By 1997, while working the interview circuit (Oprah, Katie Couric, Barbara Walters, etc.) in support of her memoir What Falls Away, Mia had shifted her story and stopped portraying Soon-Yi as an innocent who was corrupted by a dirty old man. Now Soon-Yi was described as a near sociopath who had been incapable of forming bonds with her mother and siblings, whom, it was said, she would scratch, bite and sometimes try to kill. .....
While promoting her memoir, Mia told Barbara Walters that she never wanted to see Soon-Yi again
               <strong>
                and holds her responsible for her affair with Woody.
               </strong>
               An unauthorized biography of Woody Allen, published in 2000, painted Soon-Yi as a shrewd seductress....who aggressively pursued her mother's boyfriend and lured him into a relationship because she had decided that she could become successful by marrying a rich, older man.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lots of people in this household had problems.  Soon Yi being one of them in my opinion.

             It is usually multi generational..on both sides. Abused and abuser..In Mia Farrow's case...Her mother.."O'Sullivan was born in Boyle, County Roscommon, Ireland, in 1911, the daughter of Evangeline "Mary Eva" Lovatt (née Frazer)[1] and Charles Joseph O'Sullivan, an officer in the Connaught Rangers who served in World War I.[2][3] Maureen returned to Boyle in 1988 to be honoured by the town. She was of Irish, English and Scottish ancestry.[4] She attended a convent school in Dublin, then the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Roehampton (now Woldingham School), England."
Remember reading of a catholic older woman in Ireland ..she grew up poor.....said the priest raped all the children in the neighborhood.Nobody said anything because he was holy etc..the priest also came around and demanded money from the poor people.There is something about being raped by family members , all the family knowing and doing nothing, that makes a grown woman pretty useless in protecting her own childlren. The books mentioned in the above comment explain this phenomenon.The Laurel Canyon book explains how the people used in entertainment, mostly music, frequently  had high up military fathers. It was my experience growing up also.Sorry for the jumbled up comment...it is a subject that is very important to me.

             </p>
             <p>
              we're to fucking stupid to know what we're doing with our dicks to even begin with.

              women mature faster, mentally and sexually, too.
maybe sounds remedial, but it's the facts!
             </p>
             <p>
              but of course men victimize both sexes too. and both are equally predatory.

            I dont see how the abuse claims can be used to discredit Dylans story. Both tragic if true, but apples &amp; oranges. This is also coming from a man (moses)who had cut off his entire family including his ex-wife who was pregnant when he left. I find that very unsettling.   DOES anyone know about this?  I think I heard something about his complete cut off, and this would show he has some real problems of his own.  Was Mo$es ever abused?

             In an article I linked to the other day -- and at other times -- Mia has just commented that something happened
to cause Moses to separate from the family.  (I'll look for it)

            <p>
             Originally he had made very clear that he didn't want visits with Woody Allen.  Court didn't force him.
He also made clear that Woody had been paying a lot of attention to Soon Yi when he first began
visiting Mia's apartment.  Soon Yi would have been fairly young at that time as it was a 12 year relationship.

              Indeed, in his his 33-page decision, Judge Wilk found that Allen’s behavior toward Dylan was “grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her.” The judge also recounts Farrow’s misgivings regarding Allen’s behavior toward Dylan from the time she was between two and three years old. According to the judge’s decision, Farrow told Allen, “You look at her [Dylan] in a sexual way. You fondled her . . . You don’t give her any breathing room. You look at her when she’s naked.”  WHAT more do people have to know.  I don't understand how people can defend him after reading this.  Also the naked suggestive pictures he took of Soon Yi that Mia found, what about those.  I think we need to research the people that keep giving him accolades and awards.  Those sitting in their Ivory Towers of SAG and others.  Are they questionable as well?  If you don't understand that Woody Allen is a pedophile your understanding of pedophilia are seriously screwed up.

               I noticed tonight on CineMoi network where I was watching a movie after dinner ... they were supposed
to play an interview with Woody Allen discussing his new movie ....
When the time came, I tuned in just to see if there was any possibility someone would bring up the 
subject of sexual abuse of Dylan Farrow .... and I found that they had substituted a program on 
Andrea Bocelli/singer in stead.  I'd like to think the interview was removed for the right reasons.
And it would be "about time" -- !!

                There may be a small chipping away at his suit of Armor.  In Spain there are women that are demanding the take down of his statue!  Spain!  A European country is giving the world a lesson!  I think we must keep posting about him and not stop.  He is a Pedophile masquerading as an Artist.

             Some of the children have come out and said Farrow is the problem and manipulates the children. Another angle is that Farrow starred in Rosmary's  Baby, A Roman Polanski movie about a Satanic community that sets up a woman to give birth to Satans spawn. Woody with Epstein, Farrow a Polanski pupil and married Woody. Are they all guilty of abuse, manipulation?

              NONE of the children have ever accused Mia Farrow of sexually abusing them...
             </p>
             <p>
              This is obviously Woody Allen's workings in manipulating Moses Farrow and I think he has gone way 
too far this time.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was Woody Allen who was "obsessed sexually" with Dylan Farrow -
It was Woody Allen who was seeing a psychiatrist because of that sexual "obsession" with Dylan.
             </p>
             <p>
              Family and friends concerns expressed to Mia ... and Mia's own recognition that Woody Allen was looking
at Dylan "sexually" .... that moved her to tell Woody that he had to begin seeing a psychiatrist to discuss
his obsession with Dylan.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was Woody Allen found in the DEN by a baby sitter in Mia's Connecticut home ...
where the babysitter made clear that there were sexual overtones to it as Woody Allen
was kneeling on the floor in front of Dylan Farrow ... his face in her lap, pointed towards
here body/vagina.  It was after this that Mia noticed -- upon a return from her errand -- 
that Dylan had no underwear on.  Dylan was 7 years old at that time.
             </p>
             <p>
              And later that same day, it was Woody Allen who took Dylan Farrow up to a dark attic on the 
third floor of Mia's Connecticut home where Dylan Farrow makes clear that she was sexually abused
by digital penetration of her vagina by Woody Allen.
             </p>
             <p>
              What Woody Allen has done in manipulating Moses -- and however he has done it -- has gone too far
and I can only hope that the desperation he is showing in doing this will destroy him.

              Yes, I know about the weird connection there with Rosemary's baby. Manson connection too.

              I believe Farrow is a victim of mindcontrol, Allen was her handler. I have no proof, just a feeling. The children are all fucked up understandably.

               Why were family and friends and nannies/baby sitters told to make sure that Woody wasn't off alone with Dylan?
              </p>
              <p>
               Why was Woody seeing a psychiatrist because of his "sexual obsession" with Dylan?

            Why did Allen and Soon Yi never have their own children?  Why always adopted children?  So he could have two daughters?  He could not control the outcome of a biological child.  I wonder what may come out of those adopted daughter's mouths after his death.  I am reminded of how the abused block out their abuse for decades.  Mia was helping Dylan remember when she told her over and over.  It is a hard thing to come to the realization that your father was your abuser.  Mo$es sounds like he is possibly afraid of admitting this himself.

             I think woody may be unable to father a child and that is what he has instead adopted. The story allegedly is that Ronan is his only bio child, however Mia made the comments that Ronan could be Frank Sinatra's son, and the guy looks JUST like Frank and nothing like woody!

              That certainly is possible, but all his other statements in the past that border on his thoughts about 12 year olds make him suspect.  I just read it yesterday, I think someone posted it on DL and it was incriminating.  Something about 12 1 yr olds.  in the sentence.  Not funny.

             Indeed very worrisome... 
And he is protected now from whatever Soon Yi might have revealed.
There is also the money which gives Woody a great deal of power over them in
inheritance.
Same for Moses -- and it looks like Woody is using Moses as his "Ace in the Hole"...
            </p>
            <p>
             Moses originally said that Woody was paying inordinate attention to Soon Yi on his
visits to the apartment.  There was a 12 year relationship between Mia and Woody which
means that Soon Yi was quite young when he first began visiting Mia's apartment.
Evidently Dylan became a larger distraction.  Mia complained he was looking at Dylan "sexually."
Woody was seeing a psychiatrist to discuss that obsession with Dylan.
I've also wondered if Moses was abused ... it looks like Woody has something on him -- maybe $$.
Something's wrong there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Woody would also take Dylan off to his apartment and get into his bed with her -- he was 
stripped down to underwear.
            </p>
            <p>
             Something very wrong with Woody Allen ... and I think it's time we all decide to find out what it is.

              I so agree.  There is something so very sick about all of it.  I have read so many thoughts from people that defend him, saying that Mia is mean and nasty and screamed at the children, and I say, what does that have to do with his abuse.  He is guilty of abuse and they see nothing but his work.  If they would see the writing on the wall, most of his works have had to do with questionable statements that I have read.  I have never seen any of his movies, for the things that he has said in the past Gave Me The Creeps.

                   Just a hunch that she is from ShareBlue and her name is possibly Alison. Not going say why I think that though. Don’t want them to course correct.

              This light bulb only lit up yesterday while I went digging further into their background.  I had been somewhat confused about who was adopted and by whom.  Soon Yi was never adopted by Allen, thus never making her his adopted daughter.  To avoid backlash possibly.  How do we know Mo$es was never abused?  There is so much that is wrong in that family.  Mia did a good thing adopting those children, but unfortunately she was not very good at picking her husbands.  She looks like a flower child that may have believed good in everyone.  She has learned a harsh lesson.

             Very good questions, I think you're right, he wanted daughters.  I imagine those kids will be messed up beyond repair. Their parents relationship is messed up and has been accepted. Their father appears to be well liked despite his actions. I think the reality of this too horrible for them, it might be too horrible for many people to even contemplate. I know I'm having a tough time with this.

                Yes, and I believe he used those tactics on his Fans.  He has Groomed those that are standing up for him. I have a feeling there is something out there that would convince the masses but he has plenty of money for the pay off.  I saw some things on Data Lounge that really creeped me out with him and Mariel Hemingway.  Ugh.  Sometimes I just have to step away from talking or writing about him, because it makes me so sick.  Like with $teven $pielberg.

                Woody never adopted soon yi. Mia adopted her with her ex husband before hooking up with Woody. Not saying it isn't creepy, weird, or that I believe nothing happened with her until after she was 18, but we have to at least get the facts right about the case.

                 He adopted her siblings so he was her father. You're using some legal argument that they use. If he lived with her, it's even legal...it's common-law which is a legal marriage. I have no idea if they lived together for sure but I am assuming so since he adopted both Dylan and Moses.

                I know.  Many are not on to this and others want to look the other way.  Pedophilia has been a Taboo subject.  We have to change that.

                  I believe we have not been very good at lowering the numbers.  I think people just don't want to talk about it or hear about it because it is such a repugnant subject.  I don't blame them, but I believe now is the time. Now this is my opinion, but I believe they are creating them at a very fast pace, whether on purpose or just because  of their sick crimes. We know that in the little town up in Az.  they are bringing in children from foreign countries and impregnating the teens to replenish their supply of teens and you have to think that some of them will turn into pedophiles as well.  So I say the time has come to bring this subject to the forefront.  I think it should be covered in schools in order for children to recognize the Grooming Method, for self protection.  This can be taught without going into the gory details.  But parents will surely prohibit this.  We could of course try to get parents to talk to their children, but we already know how that will work out.  One way or the other, we as a country have to approach this subject.  Now.

                    Yes, they can be made to understand that there are some very tricky people out there that mean them harm. Also, that some of those people may be in their own families.  Thee are ways to go about this at different ages.  Also, they should be told they can report this to their teacher and not fell afraid.  I know this is asking too much, but there should be someone in that school the child can go to. This would also deter those that are in the school that are already working on grooming the child.  We need more oversight of our children in a good way.

                     The problem is that's their family. They aren't likely going to want to get them in trouble, I think that's the worst thing that could possibly happen to a kid from their perspective...that their mom or dad would be taken away. Imagine being tiny, they are all you know.

                      I know. And you are oh so right.  Look at Mo$es.  He cannot admit it either to himself, that his father committed such a horrible act. Even though it was done to his sister.  I have never felt that way for many years, I would have not problem turning in a family member for a crime.  But for a child, yes that would be devastation.  And No, I do not want it covered by someone sitting on Oprah's Couch.  Yes, this must be brought to the adults.  It is time they Act Like Adults and face Pedophilia Head On.

            Woody Allen's forgotten first wife who he dubbed 'Quasimodo' in his nightclub act breaks her silence after nearly 50 years. Harlene Rosen was 16 when she married Woody Allen before he was famous in 1956. Their relationship turned sour when Allen began mocking a 'generic wife' on stage and TV.

              Well, he was 19, but still I can tell you my Dad would not have allowed me to date a 19 yr. old if I was 16 and still in school.  NO Way and he was German.  Would not let me date til I was 17.  So all this stuff about Europe being lax, I don't know.  My Mother and Dad were not even 1 yr. apart.  WA was 3 yrs. older.  I am sorry if the girl is still in school, there IS a difference.

             semi-old folk here... 16 at that time was quite normal for girls to get married. at 16 during that time we were much more mature, and young men were going off to war at 18. I had many friends who got married at 16. i was married at 18. Today its different but back then... my mother in law was married and had a child at 15. no one really thought anything about it back then.

              I know.  I despise WA too.  His day is coming, but as far as I am concerned, it won't come too soon.  I am finding it really hard to read anymore about him, but I have to in order to keep up on his defenders.  I am wondering if there was any abuse in Mo$es's background.  His actions in his own personal life are screwed up.  It is really sad though that he can't see Dylan's abuse claims.  What a sad event for the hope that they could finally come together as a family.

               Maybe he abused her as well, monkey see monkey do. That poor girl though, my god...my heart goes out Dylan, she's dealing the trauma of it and people not believing her.

               I noticed people keep saying Woody Allen wasn't Soon-Yi's step-dad. I'm finding this the argument against his relationship being creepy. I'm reading wikipedia and it's saying that Soon-Yi was already adopted prior to Woody and Mia starting a relationship.
              </p>
              <p>
               "In 1978, Previn was adopted by Mia Farrow and André Previn and relocated to the United States;[4] at the time, she spoke no known language and reportedly battled learning disabilities.[1][4] Rose Styron acts as her godmother.[1]
              </p>
              <p>
               In 1979, Mia Farrow ended her marriage to André Previn and began a long-term relationship with Woody Allen.[5] Allen later adopted two of Farrow's adopted children: Dylan Farrow (also known as Eliza) and Moses Farrow. Farrow also gave birth to Ronan Farrow in 1987."
              </p>
              <p>
               It mentioned that Woody adopted the other two kids but not Soon-Yi? This is weird.

                Yeah, He did not want her as his Legally Adopted Child because of how it would look.  I believe he had it planned from the beginning.  From when he first met her.
