           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Donald Trump is playing an elaborate game of chicken with Jeff Sessions. And they are not on speaking terms.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sessions has sent word to the White House that he has no plans to resign and wants to stay as attorney general even amid daily humiliation from the boss, according to two people familiar with his thinking. But he hasn't told Trump that himself.
...
Trump's public criticisms of his attorney general have led to an unusual spectacle where the two men aren't talking — but sending messages through their aides and waiting for a resolution to the fate of the country's top law enforcement official, according to interviews with six White House aides and advisers, as well as Sessions allies.
...
Inside the White House, a heated battle has broken out over Sessions' future. His supporters, led by Steve Bannon, are trying to walk Trump "down from the brink," according to one. They have told him how badly the move could play in conservative media and how bad the fallout might be.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Bannon is a huge fan and trying to keep him alive," one adviser said. "Bannon will do anything he can to stop that."
            </p>
            <p>
             Meanwhile, conservative groups and leaders, from the Tea Party Patriots to former Sen. Jim DeMint, have complained. Usual supporters of Trump have urged the White House to help Trump come to his senses.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Everyone on the right loves Sessions," said one White House adviser. "It won't be good for us if he goes and we are hearing that."
            </p>
            <p>
             Another senior White House official said the West Wing didn't need another confirmation fight and that it would be tough to confirm anyone under the current circumstances, with the Russia probe.

            For me, as a former leftist, Sessions was always a big concern.  He did some unpleasant things in Alabama. Seems to have locked up the wrong guy.   But his apparent support with Trump, for going after pedophiles, was enough.  I'm a one issue voter.  (I could backslide if we don't eventually see some action.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump's Tweets this morning suggest where he wants Sessions to go, He mentioned DNC,servers, I liked that. The servers look like an obvious weakness in the Democratic Wall.  But he was a Senator, most in both parties seem compromised.  Come on Jeff, take your hands out of your pockets and get to work.

            Trump just gave an interview to the WSJ and demonstrated his sense of loyalty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump Won’t Say if He Will Fire Sessions
‘I’m very disappointed in Jeff Sessions,’ president says in interview
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mr. Sessions was the first U.S. senator to back Mr. Trump, a decision that was seen as a major blow to rival Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas). The endorsement came ahead of a handful of primary contests in Southern states with large numbers of evangelical voters—including Alabama, Mr. Sessions’s home—that Mr. Cruz’s campaign had banked on winning. 
Mr. Sessions’s endorsement came at a rally in Alabama, one of the biggest of the campaign.
“When they say he endorsed me, I went to Alabama,” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday, recalling the endorsement. “I had 40,000 people. He was a senator from Alabama. I won the state by a lot, massive numbers. A lot of the states I won by massive numbers. But he was a senator, he looks at 40,000 people and he probably says, ’What do I have to lose?’ And he endorsed me.
             <strong>
              So it’s not like a great loyal thing about the endorsement.
             </strong>
             But I’m very disappointed in Jeff Sessions.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Session had his people set up that rally in Alabama.  And now under the bus he goes.

            I don't know what to believe anymore, but I was never a big fan of Sessions, no fire in his belly like a Trey Gowdy, no quick action response like rapid fire coming from his mouth like Trey Gowdy, and that is what we need in an AG.....and if what I am hearing about Trump leaning toward Rudy turns out to be true, I am not to crazy about him either.

              I am not talking about his accent, I am south proud myself being from the south.....he is just not quick to the draw, you can have a quick witted response without talking a mile a minute....he just does not look to be out front and on top of things. It has nothing to do with where he is from or how he talks, like I said no fire in the belly..... If I am not mistaken Trey Gowdy is from the south.

                Paranoia? haha You spend a lot of time here, pushing bullshit, for someone who has no agenda. I'm certainly not worried about it though.

               When will you wake up AreWeSure? Or are you going to "Resist" all the way to the end just like Adolf Hitler?
