<p>Lori Handrahan kept popping up for me when I started researching pg. I haven\'t done complete research on her yet, but have read some of her story through Keith Harmon\'s article here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sott.net/article/245202-Pedophilia-in-the-Justice-System">https://www.sott.net/article/245202-Pedophilia-in-the-Justice-System</a></p>
<p>From the page : &quot;The state of Maine has trafficked my child Mila,&quot; Lori Handrahan told me, in January, right before the court forced a gag order upon her and shut down her web site. &quot;There\'s a massive cognitive dissonance and denial about child trafficking by the U.S. public. This happens in India and Africa but it can\'t be happening here. The cover in America is child custody.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Lori Handrahan is a professor at the School of International Service at American University in Washington D.C. Dr. Handrahan\'s credentials are impeccable, with over 20 years of work in international development and human rights all over the world. She was a guest on CNN and her op-eds about human rights and sex trafficking were often published in the New York Times. &quot;Now that my child\'s life is on the line I can\'t get any news coverage at all. Every single media outlet I\'ve gotten interested has killed the story at the last minute.&quot;</p>
<p>Lori and Mila\'s case also involves corruption within the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including the illegal naturalization of Ukrainian and Russian nationals who have stolen Mila away from her loving mother.</p>
<p>While available to discuss her case in early January, Lori Handrahan was later served with a gag order, intimidated into silence out of fear for her daughter\'s life, and possibly her own. Sometime in late January or early February of this year, the web site created to help them -- &quot;Saving Mila&quot; -- went dead. &quot;</p>
<p>You can see why Lori has made it her life\'s work to track these sickos:</p>

             "However anti-father Women’s Aid is, when people see the Mattel ad, they see the unbounded love fathers have for their daughters and the joy and security the kids feel when they’re playing with their dads. Those images, I suspect, do far more to promote, in the popular consciousness, fathers’ rights and the acceptance of men as parents than the anti-dad tribe can do with its hateful notions of fathers as little more than abusers-in-waiting.
            </p>
            <p>
             Plus, Mattel has lately been highlighting the message to girls that “you can be anything you want to be.” That of course is its own positive message, but it’s important that the company is placing it specifically in the context of the father-daughter relationship. Children need their fathers and the need of a daughter for her father is unique. So Mattel is not only striking a blow for dads; it’s promoting the well-being of kids to"

               Yes. But that aside, and even aside from whether Lori Handrahan made up this abuse of her daughter- doesn't take away from the fact that these are lists of pedophiles and the stories of all the families involved with the same court systems in Keith's article (which include Lori's family ) who's children were repeatedly raped by their other parent and others while the court continued to ignore and deny evidence, use every loophole they could to remove all rights of one parent, paint them crazy (PAS-SEE below), drain them financially until they could fight no more.
