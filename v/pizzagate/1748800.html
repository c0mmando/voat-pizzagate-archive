</p>
<p><strong>Why I Am Inclined To Believe This Over Alex Jones\' Denials</strong></p>
<p>I heartily believe the CPP website and computer held the blackmail materials that were the power behind the ring and the reason for it\'s existence.  I also am very inclined to believe Titus Frost when he says he and a compatriot hacker had evidence of it and delivered it to the police.   His original video was compelling, (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=TnW7OT6Dkuw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=TnW7OT6Dkuw)</a>) but he once again has taken the best opportunity available to clearly repeat this information last Saturday at the protest march to a gentleman who claimed to be a reporter from the Associated Press (AP).   <strong>Titus stated firmly that Marcus Stevens of the DC Police verified reciept of this evidence.</strong></p>
<p>Below is the transcript of the conversation they had on livestream at the protest and here\'s the link:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5260&amp;v=tk5qaZswT-o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5260&amp;v=tk5qaZswT-o</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>3:50   &quot;I\'m independent journalist Titus Frost, 20,000 subscribers. What is your name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kalide&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kalide?  from the Associated Press?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah&quot;</p>
<p>4:20  We\'ve found more than compelling evidence.  I\'m connected to a hacker, I\'ve put this out on You Tube, the video has over 40,000 views already.   What we showed is that we sent the DC Police emails where they confirmed receiving data from the back end of Comet\'s website - on the back end of their website, was child porn.   
</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>We submitted that to the DC Police, DC Police officer Marcus Stevens confirmed receiving it.  We then sent that information onto DHS, the FBI and Attorney General Sessions, none of them responded.</p>
<p>&quot;There is not any kind of investigation?&quot;</p>
<p>Nothing, it is just crazy.  
</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>
<p>So there is real evidence out there, so just when you go back and tell your boss like do the real research on this.  Just look at the evidence we have found and give us a fair shake. </p>
<p>&quot;Yeah definitely.  I\'m sure he will do that.&quot;</p>
<p>Thank you very much sir, it was very nice to meet you.  Take care.
5:20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then somebody tries to say he was way too aggressive which I don\'t agree with at all, he was very polite and did the right thing, so she needs to be schooled a bit.  <strong>Titus, no apology needed.  Great job.</strong></p>
<p>It was the CPP website Redditors were trying to hack when Reddit pizzagate subreddit was shut down abruptly with no warning.   This is according to at least one public figure who spoke about it on the radio right after it happened.  I noticed I got strong, almost vioently strong pushback on this when I posted it here the first time.   Here is that post  <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1477927">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1477927</a>   
</p>
<p>So events and evidence is leaning towards what Seaman\'s CIA contact said, which he discusses in a video already seen by many and a post written about it here <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1477927">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1477927</a>   EXCEPT WHOOPS!  The video is already down?  WTF?</p>
<p>Well luckily I can give you an exact transcript of what Seaman said in that video.   
</p>
<p>at 1:55 David is cute and says, &quot;I can\'t say if it is CIA or NSA but it begins with a C and ends with an A. but, this particular source has been a very good source to me, very accurate about things ahead of time.  He actually said to me the reason there has been so much heat put upon people covering Comet Pizza and covering James Alefantis specifically, the reason there has been such an insane amount of threats and legal action against those individuals covering that aspect of pizzagate, which of course pizzagate is a bigger story....pizzagate was created by John Podesta\'s emails that ended up on Wikileaks.  That was the creator of pizzagate was John Podesta and nobody else.  The fact that he\'s using pizza as a codeword for something hundreds of times in his leaked emails led a number of researchers around the world down a very dark rabbit hole.  And it\'s a rabbit hole that I\'ve covered as a journalist and that I mostly believe in, I mostly believe that pizzagate is real.</p>

            i agree with you about david semen but you are really not getting what pedogate is about if you don't take the satanic ritual sacrifice and cannibalism part seriously. Thats the reason they do this evil shit to children. they do it all as part of satanic ritual based on the babylonian talmud and the kabbalah, ancient hebrew serpent worship. they truly beleive they get supernatural power from killing the kids for satan and they terrorize the victims then drink the adrenaline infused blood and get high as fuck

            Has anyone every been to this establishment? Perhaps the best way to investigate would be to go there. Go Next door. Go in the alley. Pretend to take drunk selfies, whatever it is young people do. Who is going to stop you? Pretend to get lost and find these so called secret doors. All of this is talk and online stuff. If it's next to a gallery, would you be able to hear something from the windows in the back of the building that are the kill room? I looked, i guess there are windows between the 2 buildings.

             I have seen strong warnings against personally taking any physical actions including phone calling, snooping, casing, following, photgraphing, stalking, etc regarding places and people that surface in this investigation.  It is not condoned because it may be interpreted as harrassment and also may be dangerous especially with anything regarding Alefantis as he allegedly is a CIA asset and allegedly has made death threats against Scooby Doo kind of investigating pesky kids.  These activities are for law enforcement.
            </p>
            <p>
             That said there have already been a few people who have snooped around and done as you suggest.   Look around on You Tube.

              VERY important advice!
             </p>
             <p>
              If I were in the area, I might visit CPP to have a look for myself, but if I did, I would be just a casual customer.  No live streaming on periscope, no snooping around, just go for a bite to eat, maybe read some stuff or take a friend and chat mundanely.  Do nothing out of the ordinary.  Maybe even go a few times, over the course of weeks/months, and start to fit in.  But I would give them absolutely no reason to think I was doing anything but casual "normie" dining.

            I know we all want to find the smoking gun and be heroes, but I don't think any of us are going to do that.   However, I do think it adds value to do research to find possible connections for the real investigators who can get the records that we cannot to look into.  I think both the bad guys and the good guys watch this group.   As to FBI Anon I have no opinion.  But if he was disinfo it seems to have backfired because he generated TONS of interest.

            I don't really have anything worthy on the CF.   I was really curious about why the Dutch Postcode Lottery was giving so much money to the CF when they had their own charities to support.   I thought maybe it was about Shell Oil and access to Iran's markets despite UN sanctions etc.   But think it might also be about trafficking.

            OK, clearly JA and CPP was doing something, but we don't know the truth.   The pizza place itself is kind of a dead end.  This the disinfo tactic - to say pgate is an accusation that Hillary Clinton was running a pedo ring with children in the pizza restaurant.   Ha ha ha so stupid.  And it is.   HRC certainly didn't know JA well.    What we learned from the Podesta email is that very powerful people are pedos, and they have infiltrated charities and foundations, especially with those that deal with children.    JA seems to have some part of it, perhaps a business/dealer role.   It seems he was associating kids with money in some of the images.  Anyway, my point is that we
            <em>
             don't
            </em>
            actually know what was going on at CPP, and it is a waste of time to focus on it.   The real story is the Clinton Foundation, and all the pizza-people in Podesta's emails - where they work, what they do.

            I can't say that this is wrong - there is definitely room for doubt.  surely a "Kalide" at Associated Press bureau in DC wouldn't be that hard to find.  Also it looked like one of the women there knew that Kalide fellow and directed TF over to him.

            Doesn't anyone recall the November Specials page from comets hacked page? And 30% off and u must finish off your pizza afterwards as they are in bad shape? It almost disappeared and whenever I mentioned it people would say it was fake. I always believed it was real and still do.

            If they found any CP on those servers, of the black mail variety, at this point, they might consider releasing them. It is clear there is darkness involved and there is every reason under the sun to wait (say those in intelligence agencies, news agencies, etc.). Tired of it, these people need to be in prison yesterday, or hung.

            Does anyone have a link to a saved image of the "for newcummers" instructions?  (This was a page that a 4chan anon hacker found in the members' section of the CPP website way back in October.)
           </p>
           <p>
            There was a discount for "sick pizzas" left over from the previous month.  The condition was the customer "had to eat the whole pizza".
           </p>
           <p>
            The "newcummers" page for CPP members was even more sinister than the instagram pics.

            I did not know about this. I hope that hacker recorded his screen during his hacking so that he has proof to show to all. That DC police chief needs to be taken down. I'm convinced more than ever that this is the pedoring thread that will tear down the US government. This is why it is untouchable.

            Is there any way someone could do a myth busters style video to find out if one bullet from the same gun Welch used can travel through a padlock, a door, and a computer tower so we can put that part of the official story to bed?

             Nice idea - good to bring attention too!

            <p>
             I have been told that a bullet at close range has no problem going through a lock, a door and a tower, BUT the ridiculous thing is 
1) Welch is supposed to be there to save children, not shoot them while they may be hiding in a closet
2) What are the chances his aim would just HAPPEN to hit that tower, since he would not know anything about it being there
3) The CPP computer harddrive is an important piece of evidence that did NOT get confiscated by DC police who "investigated the Welch shooting".  Why not?

              Also, if the bullet was traveling diagonally across the room to the computer, and made the hole in the top of the case which we've been shown in media imagery, then the bullet's trajectory would certainly have missed the hard drive and only hit the power supply and maybe the CD/DVD drive.

             Well, it's true, that we here in marketing were taught that you can sell anything if you dress it up good enough. I remember the instant coffee commercial (years ago) served to diners in a swanky restaurant ... when asked what they thought about the cheap coffee they said it was 'divine,' the best coffee they'd ever tasted. I do like DarkMath though.

              In some of those cases, there is a genuine difference in taste. Ben and Jerry's is a lot, lot better than supermarket ice cream.  And anyone who has ever eaten an Indian or Pakistani mango, will know the difference. My friend who first told me about them onto Indian mangos raved about them.  This is true story, she literally called it a sex mango.

              In the case of Olive Oil, many, many people are buying for health benefits and don't know real good oil from plain oil.  A lot of Italian branded oil is olive oil from Spain shipped to Italy to be sold as Italian brands.
             </p>
             <p>
              The demand for Italian Olive Oil is so great, Italy can't grow enough olives.    So if you're looking for bargains in Olive Oil, look for a good Spanish or Greek brand.

               I got family in New Zealand. I hate Kiwis (green supermarket). They asked me if I'd ever tried a "golden" kiwi. I had not. They said no comparison, it's like eating flavored yogurt or ice-cream with a spoon (just dip right in).
              </p>
              <p>
               How about a garden heirloom tomato vs grocery. Raw milk vs.store-bought. BTW Whole Foods got busted recently for cheating (you may know).

               People have no clue what they're buying with Olive Oil, just look at the variety on the shelves ... makes you dizzy, and "they're all the best," so much hype on the labels. Virgin! Extra Virgin! Extra extra virgin!! Some of them aren't even wrapped properly to keep the light out.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks for the tip on the olive oil (Spanish/Italian).

               Starbuck's beans are modified to be able to grow in sunlight, coffee is meant to grow in the shade, so I only buy organic and shade-grown, can't drink anything else once you've had that. Nothing beats coffee from Costa Rica, and I love the roasted chocolate covered coffee beans from my friend who lives there on a coffee plantation.

               Thanks for the info, gotta run for a bit.

                 I think I have tried it, my kids have served me coffee from something that looks just like that (just googled it) ... they're spoiled. (And they really bragged about it being superior.) Is it espresso? It was some of the best I've ever had, though strong.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Friends have given me some kind of exotic espresso (sorry my brain's not working), it was really good ... they've also given me Big Bend coffee from West Texas that was good (this 'friend' is an art director coffee freak). Thanks for the tip. I hate Starbucks. And Maxwell House makes me want to, well, never mind. (I used to grow organic veggies, too much trouble, now I just buy 'em.)

               I don't watch him much either, but I do know that flat-earthers swarm to wherever they can get a platform (they are sincere too btw believe it or not) and they really flooded Seaman. I think they were trying to get him to check into it. He was mad at them thinking they were trying to shill him (some probably were but not the majority) and make him look foolish, somehow people started saying Seaman was espousing flat earth. Something like that. The only 'out there' thing I remember Seaman mentioning was Antarctica because (I think) it had to do with Vault 7, or maybe why was John McCain and others going out there?

                You're right about Seaman and FE people.
               </p>
               <p>
                To be fair to Seaman (whom I think is a Zionist and Goldmoney shill), I think his comments on Antarctica were only in the spirit of a "heads up; something weird is over thataway" warning.  I don't think he was taking any position on what was happening, just alerting people that SOMETHING was going on.
               </p>
               <p>
                I haven't followed the recent Antarctica hullabaloo, but there has definitely been an increase in discussion about it, so maybe there is something brewing.

                 Plus, to me, he's kind of a grandstanding self-centered kid. I'm much older than him. But I used to be the same way :) And I LOVED attention. He doesn't bother me as much as probably some of the younger guys around here are bothered by him.
                </p>
                <p>
                 For flat-earthers, Antarctica figures very importantly into what they believe. So maybe that's partly why they were attracted to Seaman and his discussion.

                  Without watching the video (I don't feel like spending my time on his stuff any more), I'd say walking things back is a good indicator of either (a) dishonesty or (b) impetuousness -- or perhaps both.  Either way, I feel like looking elsewhere for my info.

                  What you say about Antarctica makes sense, although I didn't pay attention to the timeline of events, so I don't know if that's how it really happened.

            And wouldn't you know that the false flag gunman op happened days after the discovery of the CP at CPP...with initial reports of no shots fired...then a single shot into the ground...then the magic bullet going through a padlocked door, hitting the computer, and destroying the hard drive. How convenient? Based on the timeline of providing the CP to the police, they had several days to act and raid the place prior to that event and did nothing. The police then lied, claiming they had investigated, only to be exposed through a FOIA request to be lying (having done no investigation). 60 Minutes repeated this lie last night...great investigative journalism in simply asking to see the DC Police report of the investigation, which DOES NOT exist.

             I am not clear on the specific and complete timeline of events from Reddit hacking through to "We Support CPP" propaganda party with DC police chief in attendance, with some of those weird backdoor areas allegedly on the CPP site surfacing online.   care to give it a shot?

            Infowars-aligned will definitely not help the cause so it is good that they are not onboard. I cringe everytime I hear Cynthia McKinney supports the investigation. She is not sane in the least. The good news is that the story will not fade away no matter how many discount it. You can't expect this to be resolved any time soon. You have the richest, most powerful Democrats in the crosshairs.  They have the tools to coverup their crimes.

             whatever his reasons, it will probably be best anyway for him to disengage.  Pedogate doesn't need the baggage of the Alex Jones "conspiracy nut" label going forward with the public.  He needs to actually just stop talking about it.

             Exactly. And tbh a technical write up of site security wouldn't have taken more than a couple of paragraphs. Anyone who's ever self-hosted / built a site from scratch could verify. I know my two hosting providers are pretty bulletproof out of the box. A savvy dev could make any site unhackable nowadays, once it's not overly reliant on 3rd party components.

            I believe seaman and Titus are all limited hangouts. We will have to wait and see. As for Jones, most of us know he's an oppurtunist at best and a gatekeeper at worse.

            I am so sick of accusations of shills or larpings, for God sakes I just want this shit to come out,  I mean we are talking about kids, also we will know who is right and wrong who we need to prosecute and so on,  if this doesn't happen soon then I feel this will be what started the next American revolution, this is how serious this is!!!!!!

             i know, right. Difference of opinion = shill. different emphasis on evidence = larping

             FFS if someone is screaming to the blue heavens that there's pedos in high office, they are on the right side. They may not have the best standards of evidence, but the shills and larpers would still be in the business of overall discreditation.

              I wish it were that simple, but it's not.  Infiltration and sabotage are longstanding practices, and we should expect them in this campaign no less than in any other -- in fact, given the stakes, probably more.

              Exactly. And if you're a black guy w/ a sense of humor who wears sunglasses and claims that he has seen evidence, by all means minimize him and pronounce him an egregious and atrocious liar and larper post-haste.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, if you keep him on the back burner for a while just in case, you've lost nothing, if you damn the guy and toss him overboard outright, you may lose much, and end up with egg on your face.

              When a shill with a juvenile username gets angry, you know you're getting close to the truth. Edit: Goes without saying that my reply is not intended to you VieBleu... but to the moron above.

            I believe Seaman, but I think that Alex Jones had to say that 'legally' otherwise they could try shut him down. Don't think hes done, I think hes playing the game to catch the bigger fish. He is still on our side, we could all see what he was saying.....enough to stop them hounding him. Come on, look what he has to loose... the potential of reaching millions....we DON'T want INFOWARS closed!!!  David Seaman is great, but his reach is not as wide ranging so easier for him to critisize.  COME ON GUYS, we are all on the same side here, we need multi-faceted ways to capture all of them and save the CHILDREN. Don't forget 'they' want us to turn on eachother because we would be more vulnerable alone.  ONE goal = the CHILDREN!

            <p>
             I am actually a basic AJ positive type (ha ha sounds like a bloodtype or something).
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway I have a few thoughts -
            </p>
            <p>
             1) First of all pedogate will do better without Infowars immediately associated with it.  He was distant to the investigation anyway and not really part of it.   Better for public perception to have him step away.  This could actually be a good strategic move for him and for us.  Sometimes the Art of War requires strategic retreat.
            </p>
            <p>
             2) He got Trump in, I don't think that was a disinfo move.  Although there is a good argument that the Obama Admin was going against Isreal, and Hillary was going to too, so they used their guy (you have to believe AJ is an Isreali operative which has some merits and some defects as an argument) to put Trump in who is apparently more pro-Isreal.
            </p>
            <p>
             3) Alefantis threatened others, of course he threatened Jones, at the very
             <em>
              least
             </em>
             legally.
            </p>
            <p>
             4) If Jones is a Rothschild run Isreali operative, they might want to protect their own (Alefantis, if you buy that he is connected to them which there is some interesting evidence for it) and throw the rest to the wolves.  Hence AJ apologizes to Alefantis and says keep looking at the others.  Lynne Rothschilde did tweet that scathing tweet to John Podesta about him "ruining a great family". But Jones seemed to back off from Podesta also.
            </p>
            <p>
             5)  I shrug, my brain let's off a few sparks and goes bleu screen.   ; )

              That Lynne Rothschilde account wasn't verified. I'm not assuming it wasn't her, but I'm not sure we should assume it was, either. Could be a LARP account, unless anyone has evidence to suggest otherwise.

            Great work! I don't trust Seaman, but this was good. I believe in Titus Frost about the hacking of CPP and what was found, and turned in to the DC police. Was the hacking done after the "we support comet" thing? With Chief   Newsham and JA colluding.

             no, if you look at the thread carefully (I know it is sort of a hard to read frankenstein) you'll see a part about a radio personality talking about the night of the hack.  He says he was online witnessing it and that as some were hacking - THE REDDIT SUBREDDIT PIZZAGATE DISAPPEARED.

              That means that the DC Chief of police Newsham goes for a friendly visit to the local pedophile place, a few days after the material was turned in to the DC Police by Titus/hacker. That is bizarre behavior of Newsham, I get that he is compromised and probably a perv himself. But that is just insanely arrogant. Don't you think?

               it was a few weeks later. - even worse.  Guess they had a lot to celebrate with pulling off the Welch thing.  Maybe he considered it more prudent to drop by in person if a payment was due.

            I don't like the sound of either of those. They sound like pure speculation.
           </p>
           <p>
            And regarding the page itself and the files the German dude downloaded we can't conclude anything either way. Anyone who sees that download page is justified in being suspicious. But we have no way of knowing if the page existed or the German dude used Photoshop and an Html Editor.
           </p>
           <p>
            There isn't enough evidence here. And worse the German dude technically hacked into the site which I'm pretty sure is a crime.
           </p>
           <p>
            What's even worse is Titus Frost not having concrete evidence will just be used to discredit pizzagate. Don't blame me. I'm no shill. It's just there are bigger fish to fry namely the robust Mango business Huma and Hillary were/are running in Chicago. Can anyone here explain why someone would stick their nose up at $1 Mangoes from Mexico and buy $6 Mangoes from Pakistan instead? No? Ok then, moving on:

           <p>
            I hate being the "wet blanket" but we need hard evidence now. Speculation isn't good enough anymore. If there's no audit trail and/or hard evidence it's not worth digging.

              Can anyone here explain why someone would stick their nose up at $1 Mangos from Mexico and buy $6 Mangoes from Pakistan instead? No?

             "  Kinda...Mexican mangos suck really bad compared to those from the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, India and Pakistan....but yeah, it makes no sense to go to all that trouble setting up a legit pipeline into the US from Pakistan for mangos when there was already importation from India and the PI...unless you want to bring some opium in as well...or maybe ship some arms on the plane on the way back....

              We should remember that once flown to Chicago-O'Hare they are then driven by car to Iowa, which entails 8 1/2 hour drive.  All that for these mangoes? I think not unless they are special HRC mangoes.

              The Philipines, Thailan, Vietnam and India don't have close ties to the CIA. Pakistan does have strong ties going back to about 1980 and the war to kick Russia out of Afghanistan.

             You have no evidence to prove he is lying at this time, therefore you should not assert that he has no concrete evidence.

            <p>
             The entire post is about whether or not he did indeed have evidence to hand over the police and did he do so. He has stated publicly multiple times now and talked to an AP reporter.
             <strong>
              Yes if he is lying that will discredit him but it certainly doesn't discredit other hard evidence such as on the Weiner laptop, etc.  But bottom line he has definitely not been proven a liar by any means, and evidence is mounting that he is not.

                 We know, because people clicked on that link before it was removed. And I say 'we' because ofc, there are hundreds, if not thousands of people who clicked on it. The problem is, I'm not sure if there's an archived version of the original link, (not a screenshot, I mean). If there is, I missed it. And if it was a sli.mg archive, then it was lost that way. I personally 100% believe it's a genuine, non-photoshopped screenshot. I just can't prove it.

                  I believe you. But don't shoot the messenger. If we can't prove the download page was there then it's useless as evidence. In fact it's worse than useless because if it were used in court a defense lawyer would point to the wayback machine and you'd lose your credibility.

                   Not shooting the messenger, lol. The link was lost when reddit pizzagate was taken down. With no link, there is no way to find it on the wayback machine. We're still "grinding water", if there is an archive somewhere out there, i personally don't know where it is.

                       keeping it real with you: i'm no computer expert, but i was following this closely at the time, i saw the login page myself, and logged into it myself, and saw the download page with my own eyes. archive.ls and the way back machine were compromised around this time as well, they removed many archived pages from many different 'investigators'

                        Thanks for the input. I believe you. I strongly suspect "they" were able to remove the page from the wayback machine.

                       <p>
                        But this might not be as bad as you think. My theory is CPP was/is a red-herring. So yes there was a page there that looked very much like a highly secure download page which would scream child pornography. But that was it, there was no child porn there. The page was there to do exactly what it did: attract random deplorables like you and me who would scream from the mountain tops that CPP was serving up child porn.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        By the time we had spread that message all over the world and associated James Alefantis and CPP with child porn "they" pull that page and erase every trace of it from the wayback machine.

                        Then they start working the story in the media that Pizzagate is just a bunch of homophobic bigots which would act as a dog-whistle to every enlightened liberal in the Milky Way Galaxy to stand up and fight the fascist homophobes at Pizzagate.

                        Make sense? See how diabolically brilliant the trap is? It's so fucking brilliant I want to create a Hall of Fame of spy-craft and make that the first inductee. Once I saw what they did I was just blown away by how smart these people are at the top. Let's call a spade a spade, if you ignore the heinous and inexcusable crimes and just looked at how things worked you have to tip your hat to these people.

                       <p>
                        And note the trap isn't even done yet. If you'll notice James Alefantis' brother is starting to show up in some of the posts here. Guess what his brother works on? Vaccines! Can you just see the reaction from the limousine liberals: "My god I thought the bigots at Pizzagate couldn't get any lower. Now they're investigating James Alefantis' brother for working on vaccines!"

                         That one page might possibly have been a red herring.  CPP and Alefantis obviously are not, as the web of evidence and associations is very extensive, going back years and spanning numerous individuals and organizations.

              I hope so. I don't see how the U.S. of A. could continue being a country if the government is literally raping children, organ harvesting and making money selling crack and heroin to poor black people.

                You're so right. That, to me is even worse... you post this on Facebook &amp; watch the roaches scramble. Nobody comments &amp; you might even get people to unfriend or unfollow you that way. I'll randomly post a pic of a diver with a shark behind him, "You'd want to know, right?!" or other tragedies on the brink ... but most people want to stick their head in the sand. It's irritating but we've got a better chance at strangers leaning to listen than family, friends or acquaintances.

              I remember just before the closing of
              <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
               r/pizzagate
              </a>
              a link to a youtube video had shown up with a focus on Red Shoes and a lot of subliminal stuff including bits of e-mails which seemed to be from JA to Kleinman. It was intended as a threat to JA that he had been hacked and couldn't hide anymore. Nothing followed and it felt like empty threats.

                Late reply (time difference, work...). I was much too scared  (somehow, mostly being a computer noob) of getting planted to have saved anything at the time. Can't remember much from the e-mails (you could only see them for a second and into the background... what I call subliminal although it wasn't really, just mixed in the background superimposed images). It was mostly headings ("from", "to" and first lines. Nothing stoke me as very significant in the content) The video was about the red-shoes dance in Oz movie, played slowly with scary - supposed to be and in fact quite - evil trance music.
               </p>
               <p>
                I thought this would either make the headlines and be commented at length or be droped. I could then judge more. But it didn't get much notice and got burried. So I decided it was just made-up empty threats. As I remember too, it was pretty soon after it had shown up that the ban on reddit happened, but I couldn't swear. Nothing of what you mention made its way in my memory, sorry.

                 thanks for that.   Dorothy's red shoes and Wizard of Oz programming is used in MK Ultra.  I have long speculated that Kleinman is handled by Alefantis.   There is also a men's group in DC that all wears red shoes when they get together, we've seen the pics.   There is no end to the weirdness of this whole thing.

            Screenshots of email entries as prove that something was sent? Emails written on the mobile? LOL.
That's what "Titus Frost" is selling us as evidence of having submitted useful info to the police?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is that the same "Titus Frost" who showed his damaged car and suggested that this was because his investigations?
Reminds me about David Seaman, who had a fast heartbeat, after someone shaked his hand. And lost a friend already, because of his "investigations".
Just like the other guy who sold t-shirts and was allegedly threatened by Alefantis.

             Sounds like the derision that was attempted to throw shade on Ryan, when he was threatened by Alefantis.  Turned out all the deriders were hyenas and Ryan was correct.

              Sure! Just like prove that "Titus Frost" submitted documents to the police with a screenshot and that CPP homepage was hacked.
Too bad an evidence of the hack never was presented...

               There's people out there making a lot of money off of pizzagate that's for sure. Must be a tremendous amount of pressure to have to deliver a new bombshell from "sources" every couple of weeks to keep those monthly donations rolling in.

                dumb comment.  If anyone is "making a lot of money off pizzagate" that means there is a huge ocmmunity out there supporting them, or we are all rich!
               </p>
               <p>
                You can't have it both ways -  If we are a small community as you like to say, no one is getting much money out of us,  If we are a huge enough community to make people rich, then you've already lost  ha ha ha
               </p>
               <p>
                Or we are just a few bored billionaires and pizzagate is our hobby.   That's it.

                 I missed where I said it was a small community. Or a large one for that matter. (Are you sure you meant to respond to me?) Nice non-argument though.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Of course, everyone is free to believe hearsay. People tend to do that when they let emotions take over logic. That's sort of my point.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I on the other hand haven't seen any actual evidence of CP from this hacked site. Whether I believe it was there or not doesn't matter in the end of course. If it exists it's certainly not admissible in court now. That's not a win for us. And I have to question the logic behind the whole thing. (Handing illegally obtained evidence over to LE in the hopes that they will use it to what, arrest, prosecute? No judge will accept it!) At least that's what I glean from all this, correct me if that's not what happened here, please.

                  do
                 </strong>
                 see however, is people making up to

                 </a>
                 for mostly repeating the things they read here on Voat and telling us that their "sources" confirm everything we want desperately to believe is real. (How nice!) And it worries me that if we are not more discerning about some of this stuff there will come a time when it will be used to further discredit everything done here as a witch-hunt once and for all.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you believe that there is a huge effort underway to discredit pedo/pizzagate, then it's not a stretch to believe that there will be those that actively work against the community from within under the guise of having "special access" and "sources" in a effort to push disinfo, keep people running in circles or simply to exploit the generosity of people who want something to be done about it. It is like this in absolutely

                  every
                 </strong>
                 conspiracy community from JFK to Chemtrails to UFO's.

                <p>
                 I'm certainly looking forward to actual evidence but, in the meantime, I won't apologize for my skepticism or criticisms of the people selling merchandise, shilling products and collecting donations while not providing anything concrete that I can't just find here for free. (edit: And by free I mean done by people who are doing it because they are passionate about it and have nothing to gain from it)

                  I'll just repeat - people who are upset at the way other people freely choose to spend their money remind me A LOT of Nellie the mod here who concern trolls the hell out of our protests because of being so very afraid on behalf of everyone.

                  Spending your time grousing about other people's money is a waste of your time, if you are sincere.  If you are here to sow division of course, it's a great tactic.   'nuff said.

             Wikileaks will only publish if it is verified. They don't go releasing any random hack sent to them.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the fact that it was hacked illegally a problem? How can this possibly be used in a court of law?
He would have been better off releasing it anonymously online.

              That might depend on what it is.  If it's just a bunch of generic CP, it wouldn't prove anything, and would be dangerous for him to post.  The value would come in the images showing specific people or places, which would then establish the truth of certain things we're looking at.  If that kind of verification isn't in the images then posting this material online seems like a giant Bad Move for the hacker (or anyone else).

              Both David Seaman and Titus Frost are LARPers.  You described the CPP hack, which Titus is not revealing (he claims he sent it from his anonymous source to the DC pollice).
             </p>
             <p>
              In your post, you are describing David Seaman having an anonymous source from an organization that begins with the letter "C" and ends with the letter "I" which is obviously the CIA.  I am not willing to give Seaman the benefit of the doubt that he actually has CIA source, based on his previous propensity for LARPing.

                He is Armyseer. The funny part is he claims to not know who Armyseer is but he linked to Armyseer in another post a minute before he ever said that. Check his account to see it. It is pretty funny.

               Thank you for clarifying.   You are right - both of these people are not the original source.  However, considering they both call themselves journalists, it is very common for reporters to do their work using sources that are not themselves.  You see what I mean.  We are used to reading it in print like that, but when it is video journalism, we demand it be the person themself who has witnessed.  That is not always possible.   Or safe.
              </p>
              <p>
               A CIA person is unlikely to ever also be a reporter that actually reports the truth about the CIA.
              </p>
              <p>
               Still, I have no problem with your comment, to provide balance to the discussion, except I don't see automatic proof of your LARPing charge.  Those charges are opinion.

                I can confirm that there was a password-protected area on the websites and that all the files were eventually replaced with a .pdf of CPP's menu - even though the page showed the old file sizes. I have no idea if they were child porn before that or not, but they were definitely replaced.

                 I will say that there can be an argument made, and I've seen it, that having a password protected area on a website could be explained by simply having an area that the management accessed for accounting or whatever that was closed to some staff and the public.  HOWEVER, from the testimony we've seen, apparently it wasn't just password protected, it was sealed like a vault at a bank.  The guys hacking were shocked at that level of protection on a pizza pie joint's website- and it made them very very interested to get in and see what was being so highly secured.  Unusually highly secured, as in government level encryption.   If anyone has any more info or links to statements or videos about how highly secured the password protected area was please leave them here.   I'd like to put that in the main post.

               thanks bopper, I was strongy encouraged by V___T who provided some of the links.  Luckily I had the Seaman video up in another tab.   I think the transcriptions is good in case videos get taken down.
