<h1>Monica\'s own mother is now questioning the supposed suicide. Why is the Washington Post not helping her find out the truth? What is WaPo COVERING UP?</h1>
<p><strong>I have the full footage of Monica\'s funeral from last week, but out of respect to her family I am only releasing her mother\'s segment in which she openly says she does not believe the storyline of Monica committing suicide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>VIDEO</strong>: <a href="https://vid.me/gcj6">https://vid.me/gcj6</a></p>
<p>See video beginning at the <strong>10:25 mark</strong>.</p>
<p>Some quotes (in the order they were made):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;She seemingly took her own life by hanging.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<strong>But since that time things that have come to light that just don\'t fit with Monica\'s life and her personality</strong>. When she went there 10 weeks ago, she was happy, she was up, she was motivated ... and so we don\'t know. What happened? What changed, so much?&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Her family, her friends, her colleagues, just don\'t see this as being her. And yes, she was upset by some of her personal living conditions in Haiti, but she dealt with similar conditions in other countries. She knew she could leave and no one would place blame on her.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;So, we don\'t want to deny or blame as a family, but none of this seems to fit her. And maybe that\'s just the way it\'s always going to be.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;We will likely always have more questions than answers, about, about what transpired in that time.&quot;</p>

            So, I found this thread following another thread about Dyncorp..there's just SO many elements to research we need a mega brain to investigate all these different aspects and have different groups, I feel Dyncorp alone is a huge monster with CIA protection?

             In the last 2 months I've held the belief that Monica Petersen is the key to all this. Also the fact that her professor/boss had/has ties to DynCorp is not a coincidence.

            There's a whole ton of nefarious shit going on in Haiti.  $7B USAID disappeared.  Kids trafficked to oil ministers and arab royals by Dyncorp.  Probably organ harvesting at brand new strategically-isolated hospital.  Libya's gold is hidden there as well as kids from all over.  It's a cesspool because there's no oversight.

            When Washington Post put in their article a dominatrix I was angry! #WTC is happening that they can get away with that crap. Does the mother need a a Go Fund Me Account to get to the bottom of the crap and find the truth? Money to sue the Washington Post about the crap written?

            Yes.  I don't think ALL of those people were killed by their hit men.  But i wouldn't be surprised if 30-40 percent were --which would be around 30 to 40 people over the past 30 years.

            Looking at the screen captured write-up and FB responses including Monica's reasoned messages to colleagues\friends she's not presenting with any signs of someone depressed or wanting to kill herself. Its interesting that her employer's website based out of Denver is 'under construction.' Right...those were the old days...no continuity or cut-over. Haiti is the poorest country in the world, or at least it makes the top 10. Your susceptible to disease, crime ect...and no reason to visit as tourists...

            according to this. John Podesta directs some of the media, directly. he reminds me a bit of the shadow gov guy, in the blacklist.  maybe he is really the president! if politics is a competition to see who can become the biggest abuser, he is a serious contender. I am hoping we will see there are some real people in high positions who oppose him, and will distinguish themselves, by stopping this blatant ring or criminals, and learn from what they have shown us, to make children safe from now on... hopefully everyone will see it is up to all of us. but would be good to see some people use the positions life has given them..

            That WaPo article is very strange indeed. First, Monica is described as a sex worker activist, and her US friends quoted in the article are a BDSM prostitute from Denver and another prostitute from RI. Yet this sex worker activist worked full time at a private pre-kindergarten-through-12 school in Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was also a research fellow writing an article on a very famous, well researched and shocking book by Siddhart Kara, Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery (2009).  The WaPo, calling this book 'controversial' (it isn't, at all, on a factual basis) says she was 'critiquing it', according to her professor, who callled her brilliant even if she worked for two years (!) on this as yet still unpublished article.
           </p>
           <p>
            What the WaPo seems to be saying is that Petersen, far from being a sex trafficking investigator, was  actually critical of people fighting sex trafficking. She was "an advocate for sex workers who disdained the rhetoric of people she considered anti-trafficking zealots".
           </p>
           <p>
            What the fuck? How is fighting sex trafficking even a controversial subject? Why did Petersen take two years to not even finish an article critical of one of the best, well researched books on the billions of dollars industry of sex trafficking and slavery?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why does a sex worker activist work in a kindergarten in Haiti, where (underage) sex trafficking has become endemic, and writing a pro-sex trafficking article in her spare time?
           </p>
           <p>
            So many anomalies, this is making my head spin.

             Yup. I don't believe that lady was good friends with Monica. OR if she was, she was probably paid off or only loosely acquainted. What she says completely contradicts the family and friends who were close to her. Why would this so called friend disrespect and contradict Monica Peterson's own mother?

             I agree with you on your observation that the WaPo article is fishy, but on this part I just want to offer some insight.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sometimes survivors of sexual abuse are critical of academics with a savior complex. Oftentimes people claiming to "help" look down on the very people who they claim to be helping. In addition, there is a lot to be said about hypocrisy in laws and loopholes which don't serve as much protection for survivors of human trafficking in the sex trade.
            </p>
            <p>
             It makes logical sense that Monica would be critical of those "fighting sex trafficking" if she were fully aware of the Clinton Foundation's ties to so called anti trafficking initiatives, in addition to her shady dealings in a lot of ways.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't get me wrong, you are completely right about the WaPo article being completely faulty.... but on that specific point they are faulty because they left out information pertinent as to why she would be critical of those supposedly fighting human trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             A lot of what Monica Peterson has written herself serve as the biggest clue as to what she was onto.  Back in 2014 Hillary advocated for urgent action expanding Correction Corporation of America prisons to accommodate the influx of migrant children. A critical analysis of this involvement is something the "alt-right" seems to miss, because they are stuck in the partisan paradigm and are conditioned to demonize migrant children. There are so many leads in Monica Peterson's own writing, and not enough people following these leads.

             I agree, something is very wrong with the Wapo story. Doesn't make sense, especially in light of no returned body, no autopsy, and now, mother's admission that family is puzzled, as well. And her Professor being former DynCorp? Isn't this reeking of the Agency?

            I don't know exactly how Haitian laws work concerning such a matter, but going by the way other countries operate, she SHOULD be able to demand an independent investigation and the case remain open.

She grew up reading sci Fi book, to end up the Orwel world of her parents, other dad and arranged marriage with other shady fam..Deep down inside, no matter how much money, she's insecure, has to be..

            Can someone please take this article and see if anything can come out of it? It is in relation to the human trafficking in Haiti, CF and Laura Silsby. I believe it contains some important info. Pass along and verify the contents. I really do believe that the Clinton Foundation is the key to uncovering the real smoking gun in relation to the Monica Petersen, pedophilia ring in government and child trafficking.

            I think she stops far short of your headline.  She never says she does not believe her daughter committed suicide.   She is saying she doesn't understand why her daughter committed suicide.  This a big and important difference.  I think the key part is we don't know what changed.  If she was murdered why would her personality change?

            Not sure anyone said this yet, but as a former LEO and as a current student getting my master in Psycology and here is where they fucked up. It is is an extreme anomoly for women to hang themselves or use guns. That is just not how it goes down. Females by far use narcotics to end their lives, you can take that to the bank.

            The popularity of the methods used also varies a little between the sexes. Whist for men firearms are by far the most popular, followed by suffocation/hanging and poisoning, women have poisoning as their most popular method, followed by firearms then suffocation/hanging. Given firearms are the most reliable method, and drug poisoning one of the least successful, that may account for some of the difference in actual suicide rates between the sexes. It is also interesting to note that women have 45% more non-fatal self-harm incidences than men.

             Hi, please spread word to call cps in DC. 2016717233. The child that comet owner taped to table and posted on web, has no parents coming forward; not for any of the other kids or infants he took photos and posted. They need to be found, patents if any, full well-being check. If they all call story false, then simple; cps finds those children. A taped child is restraint, mixed msgs, boundary invasion a D co fusion, dissociation, on a public web, mixed msgs can split mind to PTSD or schizo. There is evidence, all the kids in pic, esp the taped on, all he put on web and no consenting and livid parents are coming forward. I'd say these children are considered highly endangered, whereabouts needed asap, big change of no parents. This needs a me.e about call cps. It's a huge legal tool. In fact, media and others did not adhere to child safety laws and mandate report to cps. Ones took video today, boys walked out, told to run, go to bustop, get in a uber..very odd. I'd say the shoot was a psychopath to clear kids and evidence at the joint they got bold and comfy in.   Huma was never cps accessed for her toddler , either, as Weiner, jacked off MRI times. Any regular parent would have been bombarded by cps for way less. Look up cases of cps bombarding food parents. Use the laws and psychology research to our advantage.

But I wouldn't be surprised if a feminazi would say that's sexist because it's kind of hinting that women aren't as brave as men.  Lol

              Yep, you are right about that but here is what I think of those crazy bitches(feminazis) I have worked primarily wit men all of my life since I was 18. and ya know what , I got paid exactly the same as men. I worked in my extreme youth as a CDFer, then went on to work as,LEO. The only people in law enforcement that ever gave me shit was jealous females.Always made a fair wage, was always treated pretty good.

               LOL.  I hear ya!  Jealous women are way more of a problem - at least in my experience.  The one boss I had that didn't pay women fairiy was a woman --abd she was the type that considered herself so generous and liberal 🙄

                Yeah, I have had mostly very good experience working with men, of course in a career where they had no choice but to pay me a fair wage. in Law Enforcement, it is not about your sex or skin color. can you do the job? yeah, I was a liberal till my son showed me the light. o,f course I was not happy it was a 4chan light but hey it worked.

             This also rules out the earlier suggestions that she may have died as a result of a random crime in Haiti (robbery, rape, etc.)
            </p>
            <p>
             So it narrowed the options down from many possible scenarios to only two: either she really killed herself, or a Clinton/Trafficking operative suicided her.

              as I said rare for women to hang themselves , Hanging is a long process and painful. women opt out other ,cleaner easier ways. Ask the other LEO on voat about it.

               Doubt she would kill herself as travel to Haiti, determined to find answers. That is a very non suicidal role, to be a advocate and be on guard, working nonstop. She surely was rushed to eat, sleep, find needs, resources. I'm confused why if with organizations, a girl is sent herself for such dirty pedo. Did her organ set her up?? No legit organ sends even one male, to even local areas to search these things. All know that even taped high in Haiti. Anyone on here from Haiti, that can.look into that housing development, get word on street about all?? Got to be one alert aware Haitian to find that's legit...

             Did I hear that Seth Rich's parents set up a reward? With all this talk about tunnels, I've been wondering if his killer used them to avoid street cameras.

            That Washington post article was the WORST! It was so unprofessional.  The only person they could get a quote from was "Domina Elle, a Denver-based dominatrix." Why did they feel the need to include her profession and give her a link to her website? It was FREE advertising. They paid for her quotes - completely and utterly unethical!!

             I read about Aaron and I also find it odd how many people are suicided.  Any of you investigating have to be very clear with your families or loved ones that you would not suicide. I have written a letter and sent it to a very dear friend to hang onto, she also worked in law enforcement, should anything happen. Better to be safe than sorry and all of you should do the same.

               Or when the report by the SS has him found in his car and then, oops!, changed to the wooded area. Now why would that be?? Could it be a matter of who would have jurisdiction over the "suicide"? The two bullets to the head though make it super clear it was suicide. I mean, his office wasn't cleaned out and shredded bc he actually had any inside baseball info on the Rose Law Firm or anything. Silly conspiracy theorists...

                 A suicide as on a huge advocacy mission in another country, and by herself. No way, shed be too busy researching, finding food, office and computer and charging her electronics up, etc. No time to even think to take a dump, busy and on high alert. Question is why and who sent a young girl.on her own to research a dangerous issue in a dangerous country, known for high rapes and angry at outsiders for being scammed in two earthquakes. No way, a suicide. If the organization sent her alone, that is highly suspicious to even send a male alone. Her mom sounds like a sweetheart that prob always just was so real home American and can't wrap her head around this. Bless her soul to raise such a advocate child, to go like this.

            It must be very hard for her family to deal with. Her mother seems like a genuinely nice, caring, decent person, just the type not to make waves. That's not a criticism. I don't know if I would under the circumstances either. But this is the story. When you think about it, look at the importance of this young woman's young life. Then multiply that by all the other lives this group is ruining and you have some idea of the carnage they inflict. RIP, Monica.

            There are a lot of threads mentioning you. Many people were very worried and puzzled by your disappearance. I can try and locate the threads, but updating them and letting the community know you are okay would probably help relieve some of the users here.

            EDIT: Oh and that's not the only thing WaPo lied about. She was investigating all kinds of trafficking, including human trafficking. WaPo is a fake news machine that has lost all credibility, to the point where the opposite is generally true.

             Andrew Breitbart, Monica Petersen, Katri Ikävalko and Anne Vihavainen. Kinda funny how all these people who get a little too close to the truth seem to expire so easily. How many more people are going to have to die before the wider public recognizes that the conspiracy is real?

             Goats, there will be/are many smoking guns...I truly believe we could find one with Laura Silsby-Gayler... it's on record she told the parents they were there to help take care of the kids...she was stopped and the story was the kids were orphans. We know she lied. What EXACTLY happened when HRC arrived?  LSG is the key to unraveling this whole thing. Imo. She got orders from someone. She was going somewhere specific with those kids. Who gave her her orders and who was she meeting. Obviously this thing is shocking in scope and I would bet my 401K that she is one of many "straw-men".  But, if we could figure out who she was in contact with, her movements, I feel like we could suss out a Modus Operandi. At least in regards to the CF. And move forward with a template of sorts to work with. Insofar as this refers to the rest of the world.  i.e. Qatar, Dubai, Saudi Arabia.

               Chill. It could have been a drunk goat that missed their upvoat click. I came here around the same time you did pardner. I like the vigilance against shill tactics, but do we really need to make it voat meta to bitch about shills at every potential occurrence of a dissenting action?

                 100% Agree. I was watching Colbert take a shit on pizzagate and I had the thought that we need to start a list of all the "informed" denials of the investigation. People who, as part of their job, were tasked with investigating topics before spouting their opinion to the public as fact. Get all the denial pieces into one giant list of archived links and wait for the day of vindication.

                 I've only been here 16 days. I don't know how many do this or that and frankly I don't give a fuck what other "users" do. Now we sound like a bunch of addicts, which I guess is true... Lurking around and parsing my speech into the language of the hivemind here is not my priority. Jumping in and feeling things out is more my style.  I'm sure the hivemind will do its job reinforcing a certain style of discourse over time, but I could care less.  One thing that sticks with me whatever site I use is my lack of brevity. When I have compared my comment histories to others on many sites very rarely do I find another user who is as long winded.

                   I was referring to language used, not behavior. My beef is that IMO pitchforks do not need to come out over 1 goddamn downvoat. It's a boy who cried wolf slippery slope in my eyes. I specifically drew attention to how new of a user I was in case some older "esteemed practicing participants" of this site would know that I was commenting from a viewpoint with very little historical knowledge because it is a possibility that getting up in arms over one downvoat is business as usual around here.
