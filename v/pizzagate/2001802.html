            Great quote. This is the jew in a nut shell. Why they cant be reasoned with, they have none. Only diabolical manipulations and lies as a tactic. Its why EVERY country in all of history has had to kick them out...

            "The more I argued with them, the better I came to know their dialectic. First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If all this didn't help, they pretended not to understand, or, if challenged, they changed the subject in a hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they immediately related to entirely different matters, and then, if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience, he couldn't help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken you at least one step forward, your amazement was great the next day. The Jew had not the slightest recollection of the day before, he rattled off his same old nonsense as though nothing at all had happened, and, if indignantly challenged, affected amazement; he couldn't remember a thing, except that he had proved the correctness of his assertions the previous day."

            Yup. They wiped the elsagate topics same for every other board. A leaker left crumbs and we deciphered and found unsettling crap that talks about a childs alters.

            I noticed the elsagate threads disappeared and were wiped. I think we have another dirty mod, its happened once before. I just find it so odd how a thread made just a week ago can't be found, as well as every other message board wiping this topic.

            Voat just went down for awhile and the hot section is all months old news, some serious fuckery just happened and a scrub of the last 24 hours just happened, so much dirt has been uncovered I'm curious as to which bombshell set the censoring off, this 1984 bs is getting out of hand. I thank God everyday Trump won

            Lots of difficulty involving numerous retrys accessing Voat from screen shortcut today.  Also, yesterday, shortly after submitting to frontpage, "Executive Summary of Obama Administration's Entrapment of Don Jr. to Get a FISA Warrant to Spy on Trump Tower," with a Reddit link provided with the story and quickly received 8 upvoats, was deleted within 10 minutes.

            Resurrecting Nazi propaganda about Jews and Catholic Church propaganda about Jews -- which they spread over the Papal States for 1,500 years while keeping Jews in Ghettoes until 1864 -- is intended only to create intolerance and hatred for Jews.   In trying to recreate that past you are seeking to repeat the past violence against Jews.

             Nazis have a few minor issues, but they dont run suggestive pizza restaurants, which is the biggest threat to this nation. Just ask a child who's being raped right now. OH YOU CAN'T BECAUSE THEIR MOUTHS ARE TAPED SHUT. why don't you people think?

              If the point of the people posting the loli/young girls stuff is to discredit voat because of pizzagate, then how come neo-nazism isn't doing the same thing? I mean I understand why this phenomenon is rising and in reality the nazis have been demonised, while the crimes of the allies have been ignored, but we don't want the truth movement to be hijacked by ideological nazis. Have "the jews" (meaning SOME jews) been part of many of the major conspiracies, also involving pizzagate? Absolutely. But making this about something other than truth, fighting criminal corruption and protecting children is counter-productive. Especially if that something is an ideology that carries probably even more baggage than "communism" in people's minds. Besides, Podesta, Clinton, etc. are not Jews. So, are you "nazis" actually really the CIA trying to discredit this investigation? You can't really tell anymore, and how much of the anonymous traffic on the internet in general is fake, controlled etc.

            Troubling but unsurprising.  They will have been monitoring and cajoling Voat from the get go, and it's obvious that shills walk among us but remember it's that way round, not us walking among them!  We outnumber but urgently need to consolidate efforts to trip up and expose these bottom feeders.

              you nailed it. As soon as we expose the Jesuits it all gets scrubbed. Spewing Jew hate is totally allowed. Tell the truth about the Jesuit/CIA/Vatican and that shuts down VOAT.....you know what the real truth is now everyone. Focus your research

                Idgaf about religion.  I like this tho: Donohue believes marriage is "not about love" or "making people happy" but that the whole purpose of marriage is to have a family.

                Manifestly, 100% of media and popular culture in america, which is 100% jewish, are wholly dedicated to depressing white birthrates until we are just another minority.

                That doesnt benefit white european jesuits dumbfuck, it benefits JEWS WHO ALREADY HAVE STATUS AND HAVEN IN ISRAEL.

                  You deny that jews control all major media conglomerates, and that they encourage women to spend their child bearing years working instead under the guise of feminism? Those are facts not in dispute. Are you even american you kike shill?

            I'm against any form of censorship of legal material. Even things that I disagree with or find disgusting. Censorship is bad, that's why we're here at voat and not Reddit. We don't want safe spaces, we want honesty and integrity.

            That said, if it's illegal content, then in needs to go.

             The loli shit could be our downfall though. All they have to do is use lolicon to tie Voat to 4chan, and once we're tied to 4chan, people will associate us with pedos, sickos, freaks, and degenerates galore. Trust me, you do NOT want Voat to be lumped in with a group of people who spend 65% of their lives discussing cuckoldry and whether or not jerking it to trannies is gay or not.

             I'm not sure that you get the point. So somebody's like, "Hmm, what's Voat about anyway?" and they Google it. Then they see (at least this is what I see as the top three predictive results)...
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              voat.co/v/pizzagate

             Okay, our main one is top, that's good. But people will quickly notice that a lot of the discussions here evolve around sexism, racism, hating on fat people, gay people, coloured people, Jewish people... which all amounts to downright bigotry. There's Freedom of Expression, but then there's blatant hate speech. I guess it depends on the laws of the country where the website resides, and potentially depending on the country of the viewer, as to whether or not certain things are legal.
            </p>
            <p>
             So far as the OP is concerned, there is a legitimate concern in respect of what I can only describe as a conflict of interests if people are promoting the sexualisation of teenagers, which is something I am personally very much against, and all the while here we are trying to nail a global child trafficking network.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a no-brainer, but it's just a shame that we don't have many places to openly discuss this matter because administrators are all too often trigger-happy and would be much quicker to listen to their lawyers than their users whom actually provide the content which drives their domain.

              I get it. You like free speech unless you disagree with it. If someone wants to know what it is about they'd go to the site not the Google results. You're a Jew piece of shit. Please die irl.

               The Google results are probably reflecting the general themes on this site, so if people see "hate this, death to that" then they may not bother to take a look. If it were my website, I'd be taking stringent measures to improve its credibility. Likewise, if people just looked at your post then they might think the entire site is mostly inhabited by Hitlerites.
              </p>
              <p>
               You see, this is not a case of disagreeing with somebody's point of view. That is blatant hate speech which serves no purpose in a civil society.

               As for me, I've lived before and I'll live again. And I'm Christian, by the way.

                I don't care what silly belief your parents picked for you. You have no idea if you've lived before or will again. That is faith, belief without evidence, lying if conveyed to others as fact.  The google results are based on what pages get the most traffic vs bounce ratio. So that likely means they are likely the most popular. It's not your website. Users can check things for credibility and there is a voting system. I hope your family gets tortured in front of you and you have your eyes cut out shortly after. Go back to reddit shithead. You clearly have no clue, free speech doesn't give a shit about your fefe's. Go find someone else to give a single fuck about what you want to be right and enjoy not ever knowing their true thoughts.

                No they are pussies like you. I support fascism and youre the reason -- too low-IQ to be at the table. If you dont realize Jews are 95% of pizzagate.

             By "mods," I hope you mean "admins."  Mods can't do shit about what kind of subverses are allowed.  Free speech is Voat's thing by the way, so unless there is illegal content, Voat isn't going to remove any subverses.
