<p><strong>Idea specifics</strong>: A few Voaters Would create multiple in person MeetUps for their state (or region, if outside the US) at a library or public place initially. Taking a state or region, keeps everyone more anonymous and does not give away your specific location. </p>
<p>Once you volunteer to take a state or area, look up the major hubs and create MeetUps (surely there\'s something better? Looking for ideas on that) across the area you chose moderate. Of course, one of those will be within driving distance to you so you have an in-person group. </p>
<p>After a few weeks/months of members  gathering together, no more (or minimal..whatever is collectively decided in the group) coordination is done over the Internet and groups work independantly based on their schedules. </p>
<p><strong>During in person MeetUps, we would:</strong>
-plan ways to advertise to our area
-divide and conquer the hanging of posters
-work together in investigating in person
-tech savvy people could advise others
-find allies in case the internet is censored at some point
-discuss current developments
-encourage each other 
-pretty much a redpill party :) (maybe we should title them that...haha)</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong>
-keeps us more independent from the web so that if the government goes on a virtual witch hunt we don\'t all go down with voat

<p><strong>Cons/issues to work through:</strong>
-how would we stay safe?
-how could we keep shills out?
-maybe no one is in my/your area
-is MeetUp a good service to use initially?

<p>That\'s all I have for now. Please shoot holes in my idea and offer up suggestions! This may be a difficult thing to start, but I think it will benefit us long term for support as we see the US (and most of the world) imploding.</p>',

             Maybe we need to work through existing (hopefully) like-minded groups that already meet in our areas... like, plan to all show up at a HAM radio group or Prepper group if the online system goes down. Flip side is, if we had a planned location, it would be easy for, say the police lurkers, to also know and bust Is up there too. I really don't have a good solution yet. Keep brainstorming though!

             Interesting! Do we have a large enough following in the area to support something like that? At some point we'll have to get off the Internet, but it's hard for me to figure out when and the best way to do that.

            This is a terrible idea.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at the sort of people who are investigating pizzagate or making videos and discussing it on youtube. While there are some trolls in the mix who spew disinfo for clicks/subs/etc, most are the tiny percentage of people left in the U.S. and elsewhere who still have enough of a moral compass left to give a damn about warning signs of child abuse and trafficking and try to raise awareness. Many of you are more precious souls than you realize.

            Then look at what has happened to others throughout history who tried to speak up or investigate about this stuff. Murdered. Suicided.

            The lot of you are too few and too important to be risking your lives meeting up with strangers who seem convincing on the internet. Just keep gathering, discussing and spreading evidence/awareness. Don't assume that anything anyone says here about themselves is true. It's very easy to bullshit. And don't forget that child sexual predators usually have that down to an art, it's how they lure children online.

             I see your point. But, the Internet is not a safe place either unless you have an IP scrambler and use other tools to be truly anonymous. We have become quite centralized online and the easiest way to take us down at this point is to kill our communication. I'm just trying to find a communication plan outside the web. Maybe the web is the only way though. I appreciate your comment.

              The internet is not a safe place, no, and of course people can do what they want. But my protective instincts start sounding major alarm bells as the thought of you all meeting people in person from here before there is significant support from the general public over this, like enough for actual large protests and such. Even you could be someone who just pretends to be supportive of the investigation until you establish yourself and then tries to persuade someone to meet you in person, or even give you personal information beforehand so that you can doxx them, and so on. I'm not accusing you, but just saying, who knows? That's the reality of the situation, nobody does. To each their own life to live and their own judgement calls to make. But the idea creates a feeling in my gut that something is amiss.

               Okay, so you're saying maybe we should wait until we get to the level of protests before we see anyone in person.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yes, and that was on my list of concerns, safety. This is more for brainstorming than anything and if we can't reconcile the safely aspect, I agree with you.

            Maybe we could have separate subverses for different major areas, I'm in central florida so something like
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            _orlando specifically used to coordinate meetups? that way you can just search for your area and if there isn't a subverse yet, you can create one.

             Does one have to have special permission to create a serbverse?

            <p>
             Also, good idea to focus on major areas. Instead of blanketing all the states, maybe we would get more productive groups if we target a few major area a first.
