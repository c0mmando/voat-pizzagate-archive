              All those "common law grand jury indictments" are complete bullshit. They have been popping up to feed the moronic hopefuls since usage of the internet became common.

            I don't have Netflix, will not support them, and do not want to input their programming into my mind...but I'm not surprised that they would include symbolism like that in their programming.

            Thanks for Your First Post.  I am sure your next one will be much better, we all had to learn.  Here is something I found about this AHS Show.

            "It's all gone. Everything," Timothy tells the group of the outside world. Outpost Three has enough nutrition to last 18 months and an update from their surviving allies appears to put Venable and Mead on edge. There are no more governments, only rotting mounds of corpses; three outposts have been overrun and, according to the message from a carrier pigeon, they are among the"last vestiges of civilized life on the planet."

            We are all too familiar about their Messages Movies.  Is this how they want to leave Our Beloved Country?  Is this what they have in mind for us?  I would not be a bit surprised.  This is an Evil Show imo.  I will never see it for I don't have Netflix nor do I want to .  I have seen enough of their Evil Garbage.  The Obamas are now part of Netflix so why are we surprised.

             Its just fear porn...
The system cannot be shut down...
Its so simple to set up a currency system...all u need is a ledger ...and a pen...
..
They cant do a venezuela..in the US at the moment..
In venezuela..the hyperinflation is caused by the corrupting elite with the guns and gangs to terrorise any uprsing..they control the issue of the currency that way..
..but in the US their plan for.huperinflation cannot happen since the residents have guns..all it takes whem the currency devalues is for residents with guns to get togwther and set up a local currency system...
..
U already have a delocalised sustainable cureency at hand ..we just dont use it to reduce debt at the treasury ...instead we loan ot to banks and the debt system..
..thought experiment ..
If everyone took their dollars out of the bankimg.system..and injected it into our own treasury...the banks crash...and the govt is left eith us to issue currency based on the servixes and goods we offer to each other..
When u want to buy a loaf of bread...the baker charges u in dollars...
U as surety over the US instruct them to set off the bill..
The baker does the same with his suppliers..
...
We dont need banks if we make the US treasury our debtor on paper..
They acknowledge that they r our debtors...it says so on the Fed note...as debtor they admit on the note ..that they cannot pay..its a promise to pay...its not.money..because they admit it ...their wjole banking system is an admission that they operate on the basence of money...everything is recorded as a credit ..a payment in future..
..
This is the main reason they want to take away guns...they can role out a venezula type hyperinflation scenario..

              If they were to succeed that would be disastrous.  That is why they are upping their attack on arms and creating fear with all kinds of shootings in many cities.  We cannot let this happen.  People that understand this monetary plan must band together, people like you, and set in into operation, get the ball rolling, so to speak.  Although I don't understand all this banking stuff, I know for sure they are running a scam on us.

               Core aim: to band together and use dollars or any currency to reduce debt at the debt reduction department..
in return .( important ) and only in return for a written acknowledgement from the treadury that they will reduce any debts or charges , past ,present and future in the individusls name..
..the last condition is called surety rights..
              </p>
              <p>
               Method : multitude of ways
Individually email the US treasury 
Crowdfunding group .or residential group or forum..to raise money to reduce debt...each one can donate a dollar or two...a month..one can contribute pounds or any currency or bank credit..the treasury accepts it ...
When it
..it should not be a donation ...it must acknowledhge surety rights over the duration of ur life..
..
Effects:  u r outside the constitution...running it..
..u will be free to open carry firearms for protection..
US marshalls will be boynd and obliged to protect you..since u rhe thr true creditor of the US corporation...
Not the bankers ...they r virtual creditors owing to the fact they run and keep as security UsS treasury bills..
              </p>
              <p>
               U will be able to initiate investigations and bring charges payable to the US treasury against pedogroups..and the congress thug inc..and any deep state operative ...
..
The benefits r endless as one gas become the true creditor and surety over the US ...
When u reduce debt u begin to control inflation dirextly , instead of depending on central bank tweeking of the economy..whilst politicnas fund their lifestyle carrying out criminal.activities..hiding behind martial law adminstrative courts..

             Great link, Carm.  I don't watch much television, so the season description was very informative. Show is right out of Illuminati playbook. Hiding their true goals in plain sight. Average brainwashed sheep just thinks it's fiction.

              TY.  They sit around laughing at these type of programs.  It is like the Romans watching the Christians at the Coliseum.  We have to remember there are more of us than THEM.  They are so full of Narcissism that they forget that.  Also, there are many that are catching on to their NWO plan and also their Movie Messages.

            Hi

             @ShaneE11183386
            </a>
            ,
           </p>
           <p>
            welcome on board! And thanks for posting. Below you'll find the
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            rules (you can also see them in the sidebar, if on mobile, please switch to 'desktop view'.) Most important one: Please always include a link
            <em>
             in the body of the post
            </em>
            . ;-)

           <p>
            Please don't hesitate to get back to the mods if you should have any questions - we're here to help.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            1: Relevance: Posts must be directly relevant to investigation of Pizzagate: the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of children by elites, child trafficking organized by elites, and/or cover-up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities. See definition of Pizzagate and examples of relevant posts.
           </p>
           <p>
            2: Empiricism: EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link. If you ask a question: Explain what led to your question and provide sources. If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them. Avoid baseless speculation. ALL posts must include at least one link.
           </p>
           <p>
            3: Clarity: All titles must adequately describe post content and must establish direct relevance to pizzagate. EACH link in your post must include a description of content and how the link relates to the post (except when markup is used to embed links in the specific text they support).
           </p>
           <p>
            4: Meta submissions and general discussion submissions without sources will be removed. Please submit indirectly relevant posts to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             /v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            and unsourced questions to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/AskPizzagate">
             /v/AskPizzagate
            </a>
            . Sourced activism / publicity posts and memes are allowed. Posts about the subverse itself go to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             /v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            5: You must label NSFW posts (“Not safe for work”; for example gore, nudity etc.) as such when submitting.
           </p>
           <p>
            6: No Link Posts -- Only editable submissions made with the "Discuss" button are allowed. "Link" submissions have been banned by the community for the reasons described here. Link posts will be immediately removed.

            This post is pretty low effort.  If you would like to discuss something, you are going to have to post details that can be discussed. I hate to be that guy but, please take a moment to read our community rules regarding what is acceptable to post a new thread about. Just giving you a heads up. Welcome to the rabbit hole.

              Appreciate the post. Carmencita's link below is very helpful in supporting your post. Good to know more people are recognizing MSM programming for what it is: Illuminati plotting.
