            The pizzagate sub gets drug further and further into the fake D.C. theater of bread and circuses for the masses. Everything that comes from D.C. is for our amusement. This sub is rapidly becoming polluted. Thanks Q.

            The FBI is the banking cartels asset. They could simply tell potus no, wacha gonna do bout it? Nothing well happen to them. FBI only goes to prison if they fuck with the "system". Trump knows this. He is a Rothschild crony. This is theater. This has as much weight as Trey Gowdy waving a finger at them. Probes, hearings, invetigations....stretch them out indefinately, never resolve them, move on. Rinse and repeat.

             No one in FBI has ever been tried for murder. One of them is on video assassinating the Patriot, Lavoy Finicum. Nothing happened. Equivalent of SS in Germany 1935.

            at least several of these are legit national security threats. why are our agencies not preventing/solving these issues?
           </p>
           <p>
            what good is the domestic spying apparatus if they cannot thwart an attempted coup on an elected president? the questions of analyst incompetence, bad data, and higher level corruption are irrelevant. if the data net cannot deliver we shouldnt have to pay for it and we shouldnt have to surrender our privacy to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            this question eliminates the political theater. if we cannot solve these issues with our data collection network, the network has to go, it is ineffective and useless.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some of what was outlined and mentioned above is treason. I swear you people have no back bone we know we should be marching in the streets right now and taking our country back right now. I mean in any other country they would be breaking into police cars and stations and stealing guns and starting a revolution and overthrowing the government right now right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            I mean god damn it how much more is it going to take? How much more are we going to let them get away with before we say enough? Well i say enough what about you? These people have betrayed all of us. They've raped and fucked our country up and your still not hanging them? Your still not guillotining them to death? Where is the torches? The pitchforks? The rifles and AR's? Why am i not seeing FBI agents jailed and executed for treason? Will it take another Christopher Dorner figure on a Rambo style crusade against the deep state? Or another Timothy Mcveigh who bombs an FBI headquarters and kills many FBI deep state secret society agents? To inspire revolution.
           </p>
           <p>
            My god it's going to take something trivial for people to realize what has to be done. All of the above happens and nobody bats an eye. But if i just want to go back to reddit and make it more like voat or what it used to be. Well then everybody loses their mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            Introduce a little anarchy, upset the establishment, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos, and you know the thing about chaos, it's fair. I fucking promise we are all ready so close to proving the FBI did the Vegas mass shooting and tried to kill as many American's as possible and the FBI did the Sutherland Springs church shooting and tried to kill as many American's... people... human beings as possible, and if we do, when we do, i better see all of you out there shooting and killing all of the FBI agents because fuck that shit and fuck this shit and fuck what the FBI does and did. I mean they all ready can be shot at and killed and nobody would give a fuck the FBI and deep state agencies have all ready done too much wrong. But if we really can all so prove it beyond a reasonable doubt the FBI was so pure Satanic evil that the FBI would work with other deep state agencies to engage in mass shooting American's and their never going to own up to it or face justice for it then yeah i'd say all is fair in war and all bets are off and then that we could kill all of them.
           </p>
           <p>
            And i really hate the idea of violence but when you've got the FBI acting like the KGB and abusing it's citizens and committing sedition and treason you might not really have a choice in the matter to take back our country and reign in the FBI. It's why we have a second amendment and around 2004 we really should have used the second amendment at the time
           </p>
           <p>
            I swear to god so much is about to happen and come out and be explosive and i just really hope every one is able to handle it. This is all ready bigger then watergate and how we have allowed the FBI/DOJ to get away with this and so much more and god knows what else i have no idea this nation is a nation of pussies. What is it going to take to take this country back? I want my country back i know every body wants their country back i want my freedom, civil liberties, civil rights, and pride back. And i know every body wants their country, freedom, civil liberties, civil rights, and pride back.
           </p>
           <p>
            Respect and dignity, and truth, tolerance, family, community, neighbors, friends, hard work, pride, and freedom used to be the lay out of the land. Now it's illegal surveillance, patriot act, concrete jungles, school to prison pipe line, debt, 
 drama queen illegal immigrants, primadonna feminism, cultural marxism, police brutality, MIC, greed, politically opinionated fake news, cabal, secret society, homosexual rights, consumerism, deep state, Illuminati, free masons, and a bunch of politically correct rich wealthy shut ins who's feelings have superseded all common sense, reasoning, and reality. And you fucking let them. Pussies.

             There was no coup attempt on the potus. You think they would go unarrested? You think he wouldn't say a word? You are being played as usual. The NSA does not protect us, they are the serveilance states chief weapon. The rule is, if they can see you, they can kill you. All "smart" devices are theirs. Apple is theirs. They intentionally make a cult of personality out of all their assets. Steve Jobs, Elon Musk. They try to create a frenzy for their servilenace products and their green energy scam cars. The fact that you think that you can become president with being theirs, shows how you are still a sheeple.  YOU let them, because YOU are waiting for a super hero to save you. That is why you cling to the Trump psyop. You are the problem.

              Both parties are aligned against Trump.  The psy-op here is those attempting to suggest Trump is part of the globalist (thats the aim of the bad actors) conspiracy (yes there really is a conspiracy to surrender sovereignty to global governance.  The Dem Party and most of the GOPe leadership is pursuing globalist policy without running on it in elections...thats a conspiracy).
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               QUESTION:  If Trump is really part of the conspiracy:  Why not just elect Hillary, and quietly enshrine the "police state" and amok immigration?  Why have Trump make ISSUE of the trade deals and immigration insanity?
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              The "reason" is that they DID NOT COUNT ON TRUMP winning the election.
             </p>
             <p>
              The position that Trump is in on it all, and just working to advance the Globalist agenda is asinine.  It makes no sense to awake so many citizens to human trafficking and trade deals and the insanity of open immigration for 3rd world dirty-butts and Islamists...just to CONTINUE the Obama/Clinton agenda.  In light of what all of these people are actively doing, suggesting that somehow Trumpism is established to further the Globalist agenda is too stupid to contemplate seriously.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why would Trump go on a world tour, decrying Globalism, and encouraging countries to be nationalist, have pride in their own countries, etc?  When they COULD have had Hillary, and a peaceful slouch into more Globalism without any attention to globalist pedophilia and the occultic nature of the Globalist cabals....
             </p>
             <p>
              Trashing the ONLY national candidate to make an issue of human trafficking, the loss of national sovereignty and the immigration agenda to dumb/average down the Western Democracies?  That makes you either:

               You know I ask myself the same question ....why not just have Hilary in office instead of this whole Trump MAGA angle if he is a cabal asset!  why wake everyone up to corruption and so forth?
              </p>
              <p>
               I think it's because they WANT people to know to a certain degree what THEY are up to...the cabal/cultist needed to reveal their misdeeds at some point and this could be a way of doing it . Why? from my understanding of their cult they needed to! time was up! Revealing their evil ways does two things it  puts the blame on the people of this world in a karmic sense for letting it continue to happen...and  it hurts the heart/soul of the good people of this world!
              </p>
              <p>
               Now for the people that are up in arms over all this nonsense well they install a false hope TRUMP to quell the uproar!!
              </p>
              <p>
               look thats just my opinion I hope I'm wrong I hope an actual insider of their club TRUMP turned to the good pure loving side of his being and truly wants to change the world for the advancement of humanity...an advancement that is good for ALL of the inhabitants of this world...that is love ...that is righteously driven...time will tell...in the meantime dont be a cheerleader be  a player any which way you can!!!

                I'll say why I defend Trump again....He ISN'T part of the Globalist cabal, he was obviously recruited by the "good guys" in --mostly-- the military/military intelligence.  Obama tried to clean house of military generals/officers who were patriots, remember?  He didn't get them all.
               </p>
               <p>
                No way the cabal VOLUNTEERED for the kind of spotlight Trump brings to them.  They are fighting for their lives.
               </p>
               <p>
                More important,,,the cabal CAN'T defend their Globalist ambitions openly, much less their child-abuse-rape-torture etc with its occultic basis.  So they have to smear Trump, "he's so bad"  "he's beyond the pail" etc etc....They have to take him out politically, especially since he seems to have the physical protection of military intelligence (every bit as good as the CIA, but more guns).  Defending Trump from these stupid gullible propagandized ankle-biters and their puppeteers  --by supporting him politically-- is just as necessary as the tea-leaf-reading we come to this website for....

             They text more than middle-school girls.
How can they have time to do their jobs???
