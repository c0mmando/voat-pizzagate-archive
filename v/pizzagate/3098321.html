<p>The Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church, officially the Orthodox Catholic Church,[1][2][3][4] is the second-largest Christian church, with approximately 200–260 million members.[5][6][7][8] As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, the Eastern Orthodox Church has played a prominent role in the history and culture of Eastern and Southeastern Europe, the Caucasus, and the Near East. </p>

<p>Then there\'s this intriguing article: <a href="http://visupview.blogspot.com/2016/05/le-cercle-fratelli-neri.html">Le Cercle: Fratelli Neri</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Le Cercle, sometimes referred to as the Pinay Group or the Pinay Cercle/Circle (in some accounts the Pinay Group was held to be the inner circle of Le Cercle), is one of the most mysterious international bodies one is apt to encounter in the annuals of conspiracy literature.</strong> Over the years it has rarely been addressed in the English language and when it has, it is typically depicted as a mere auxiliary of the <strong>Bilderberg Group and other neo-liberal/globalist bodies</strong> (i.e. the Round Table groups, the Trilateral Commission and other long time bugaboos of the conspiratorial right). </p>
<p>...<strong>In addition to [David] Ferrie\'s pedophilia</strong>, he was alleged to have been a bishop while also standing accused of conducting bizarre rituals performed in his apartment. Accounts of these acts are quite incredible: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;... According to Perry Russo – one of Jim Garrison\'s witnesses during the Clay Shaw trial, and not necessarily the most reliable or credible of those witnesses in the eyes of many investigators – Ferrie conducted the equivalent of Black Masses in his apartment at the appropriately-numbered 3330 Louisiana Avenue Parkway, New Orleans. James Kirkwood, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of A Chorus Line, conducted his own informal investigation in New Orleans during the Clay Shaw trial, published as American Grotesque in 1970. Kirkwood was unequivocally pro-Shaw and anti-Garrison, so although his lengthy study makes for entertaining reading, his conclusions are not always above reproach, but it is worth quoting his transcript of <strong>Perry Russo\'s description of Ferrie\'s weekly Black Masses:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chalice featured animal blood, the wafer consisted of some kind of raw flesh, instead of cake or bread. He wore a little black toga, solid black. He wore nothing underneath.... <strong>He called it the American Eastern Catholic Orthodox Church</strong>... After all the ritual, shouted ritual... It ends up and it\'s a brutal thing, sadistic quality to it – bloodletting, chicken killing, stuff like that.... &quot;
Black masses? And supposedly on behalf of an organization Russo referred to as the &quot;American Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church. Ah dear reader, this brings us to quite a murky netherworld.</p>
<p>The great Peter Levenda has long alleged that the church Ferrie was reportedly a member of was in fact the America Orthodox Catholic Church (AOCC). Levenda himself was briefly involved with the sect in his late teens and thus his claims must be taken seriously. </p>
<p><strong>The AOCC was one of several curious churches that crop up in the Kennedy saga (a topic I briefly delved into here). Many of these churches were quite obscure and dominated by what are typically referred to as &quot;wandering bishops.&quot; These are alleged holy figures with dubious consecrations that may have been driven into fringe sects due to their inability to confirm to orthodoxy (many wandering bishops were homosexuals) or because they were simply hucksters with some other covert agenda.  …</strong></p>

<p>There\'s a lot more in that article so it\'s well worth a read.  I just wanted to stop at that phrase \'covert agenda\' because <em>coincidentally</em> Harry and Megan have just brought in as head of their communications team a political guru, well versed in dealing with spin doctors and the Clintons and the Blair government. See: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3094958">Buckingham Palace has announced that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will get their own PR guru Sara Latham - Freud/Podesta, Clinton and Matthew Freud links...</a></p>

                 Interesting.  I believe when you get orders from the Crown to stay hidden down low, you obey.  This guy is a ne'er do well who has amounted to nothing.  Also if he was in the entertainment biz, I dare say, maybe there are some things to hide that he did then too.  He probably has been handsomely paid to stay out of the Limelight.

                  Her move to Canada also coincided with her father’s retirement. So, with little to detain him in Los Angeles, he sub-let his shabby apartment opposite a film studio, arranged for his mail to be delivered to a PO Box address, and went down Mexico way.

                 <p>
                  So he has been down there since 2011

                  For the past decade, Rosarito Beach has been gripped by a bloody war between rival drug gangs which frequently spills over into supposedly peaceful residential areas. Last year it had one of Mexico’s highest murder rates, with 80 victims in a population of only 60,000.

                  However, Thomas Junior says, his father guarded his privacy fiercely even before Meghan met Prince Harry, and when Thomas Snr discovered that a neighbour had also worked in the LA film industry he quickly moved to a clifftop a few miles down the coast. By the time I went there a few months ago, it was empty and derelict. For reasons unknown, Mr Markle had again done a flit.

                   Vietnam and Thailand are famous for trafficking.  Many pedos go there for their love of Children...... He took a lot of pics of Meghan?  Why so many?  Did he abuse her?  Did he abuse others while working in Hollywood?  Is he afraid he will be recognized in Rosarito?  Somethings up with that.  He is leading the life of a recluse. Hiding from what and why.  There is a reason.  Stuff could also have happened in Pen.

                       Thanks for that link.  Too bad some of the comments were deleted but I got the gist of most of it especially as I've picked up most of that gossip from Twitter as well.  I'm particularly interested in the possible links with Epstein and NXIVM as I'd come to the conclusion on my own that that's where all of this is heading.

Alvin and Deborah McCuan, Scott and Brenda Kniffen, and Rodney and Linda Phelps (parents of Deborah McCuan) were indicted in 1982 on charges of sexually molesting children. The alleged victims included their own children, traded between families and used for group sex, as well as children from the Bluebird troop run by Deborah McCuan and the unlicensed day care facility in her home. The McCuans and Kniffens were convicted on all counts in 1983, drawing aggregate prison terms in excess of 1,000 years. The Phelps fled town and disapeared after being charged with 33 counts.

                            Ritual elements in the case were ignored by authorities at the time. (Newton, 1996).

                            In August 1996, a judge overturned the child molestation convictions of Alvin and Deborah McCuan and Scott and Brenda Kniffen.** (Northwest Herald, August 14, 1996).

                            A second intrafamilial child-sex ring was exposed and prosecuted in Bakersfield, with trials continuing into 1985. Five adult defendants were convicted, including: Richard Cox, 47 (14 counts); Ruth Ann Taylor, 31 (14 counts); Anthony Cox, 25 (7 counts); George Cox, 24 (7 counts); and Theresa Cox, 21 (3 counts). Prison terms ranged from 10 to 41 years. (Newton, 1996).

                            Seven defendants in another Bakersfield child-sex ring were convicted in August 1985, with multiple charges including child molestation and endangerment, assault with a deadly weapon, and production of child pornography. Wayne Forsythe, 28, was convicted on 41 separate counts. Other defendants, each convicted on a minimum of 50 counts, included Forsythe's wife, Colleen Dill Forsythe, 26; Ricky Pitts, 31, and his wife Marcella Pitts, 29; Wayne Dill, 26 (Colleen Forsythe's brother); Grace Dill, 50 (mother of Colleen Forsythe and Wayne Dill); and Gina Miller. Cumulative prison sentences in the case came to 2,100 years. (Newton, 1996).

                            Leroy George Stowe III was convicted on 16 counts of child molestation and sentenced to 30 years in March 1985. Shortly after his conviction, victims in the case expanded their disclosures to include graphic descriptions of satanic ritual abuse and murders, involving nine more defendants.

                            In January 1987, Gerardo Gonzales (facing 117 charges) pleaded no contest to one count of molesting a 5-year-old girl, and Rev. Willard Lee Thomas (facing 43 charges) pleaded no contest on two counts, including child endangerment and unlawful sexual intercourse with a 17-year-old girl. Both defendants were released from jail on the basis of time served, and charges against the remaining defendants were dismissed as part of their plea bargain.

                            In February 1987, a California appeals court reversed Leroy Stowe's conviction on 12 of 16 felony counts, with the grounds cited as a technical insufficiency in the pleadings.** (Newton, 1996).

                             Good God.  What a bunch of sickos live there.  I can bet the PD is involved and give protection as does the rest of Cali.  Remember the Turpin Family?  They are not far from there.  Their town was a Hell Hole too.  Bakersfield is coming back now.  There are many other cases and much more going on in towns around there too.  I think it is a CIA set up or something.  I had a post on the Turpin Family.  Those Children were all Home Schooled.

                               She’s a weird one alright. They have really picked one this time. She has too much of a shady past to hide it all. Are they running out of candidates? LOL. That’s why they are turning Kate into a baby machine. If Dparkles has two that will be 4 more in the pool down the road.

                                 I don't like her either.  Not one bit.  The whole lot of them are Scalliwaggs.  Like Carpetbaggers that pilfer everyone and leave in the middle of the night.  Only that bunch won't leave.  They go all the way back to Russia I believe.  They are really the bottom of the barrel and have convinced everyone otherwise.  People will believe anything nowadays.

                          there have been plenty of star offspring — such as Johnny Depp's daughter, Lily-Rose Depp, and her friend Harley, daughter of filmmaker Kevin Smith

                          I'm a public school kid whose mother was a teacher, so sending my son to a private school was a concept that had to be overcome," says Grey's Anatomy actor Jason George. "Not only was HSH better academically, but I was paying for an extra level of diversity." (Donors include Al Pacino and Sam and Aaron Taylor-Johnson.) The school's proximity to studios and filming locations makes it popular with busy actors and executives. "There are a lot of parents involved in production, and that sometimes entails being on location for a long time with their children," says Siren Studios CEO Dean Gavoni. "The school does an amazing job of prepping kids and accepting that this is part of our lives."

            Remember the Gotthard tunnel openening, which was a Satanic ritual under the very eyes of the EU leaders present?
           </p>
           <p>
            The creation of this ceremony was sponsored by a Swiss bank (I would have to look up which one, not sure whether it was Credit Suisse), and one of its heads was rumoured to be a member of Le Cercle.

            DAVID TEACHER: PIONEERING CERCLE AND PANEUROPA RESEARCHER -

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Along with authors as Pierre Pean from France, Jurgen Roth from Germany, and Hugo Gijssels from Flanders, Teacher should be counted as one of the major pioneers on documenting the conservative Paneuropa elite of mainland Europe. Without his writings for Lobster magazine in the late 1980s, almost none of this type of information would be available in the English-language world today.
In fact, when Teacher's book Rogue Agents was finally published through ISGP in 2008, 15 years after various publishers refused to put it on the market, it still instantly became the premier English-language source on the Paneuropa elite, the NGOs it was working through, as well as its interactions with roughly similar conservative and very anti-communist elites in Great Britain and the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
             In contrast to other works, which are focused on various scandals or hard-to-define Opus Dei activity, Teacher's book is specifically aimed at identifying all the different NGOs in the Paneuropa network and figuring out who its members were. In that sense it has a very practical approach and simply is the most detailed book on the subject. On top of that, having information easily accessible in English is absolutely crucial in pushing research forward.

             Following German reunification, the US government announced plans to fully withdraw its troops from Frankfurt, Germany by 1995, at which time control of the entire site would be restored to the German Federal Government.[1] It was suggested that the building could become the location for the European Central Bank. In 1996, the state of Hesse bought the building and associated land for the University of Frankfurt. The buildings were refurbished at a cost of 50 Million German Mark (about US $26M or 25M €), by the Copenhagen-based architecture practice Dissing+Weitling[11] and were handed over to the university. The complex now houses the Westend Campus of the university,[8][12] which includes the departments of Philosophy, History, Theology, Classical Philology, Art and Music, Modern Languages and Linguistics, Cultural and Civilization Studies, the Center for North American Studies[13] and the

              Who are the Real Pilgrims (Society)?   The Pilgrims Society is the organization which consistently recruits only very elitist members of society, many with nearly endless resumes.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Le Cercle, an outgrowth of the reactionary Vatican-Paneuropa network, is more mixed, and most participants are intelligence insiders. The 1001 Club recruits the most influential businessmen, often in mining and bulk shipping, from all over the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Pilgrims and the 1001 have been set up and are managed by a combination of Anglophiles and radical, not to mention criminal, Zionists (2). The Pilgrims Society was set up by the British aristocracy, many of them Privy Council and Garter families. In fact, the person who came up with the name 'Pilgrims' was a great grandfather of the late Princess Diana (3). The British monarch became the official head of the Pilgrims Society and members of the royal family have always attended the London meetings. The 1001 Club was mainly created by Prince Philip and the South-African billionaire Anton Rupert. Officially the 1001 only coordinates the WWF, but many members, who represent a huge chunk of the conventional environmental movement, seem more occupied with the West's need for inexpensive natural resources. Le Cercle was set up by interests tied to the Habsburgs and the Vatican. Soon, an important trade representative of the City of London, Sir Peter Tennant, was attracted, and about two decades later British aristocrats, the last three of them Privy Councillors, took over leadership of Le Cercle. Its latest head is a former Rothschild banker.

             PRINCE CHARLES &amp; His Role in Sustainable Development Agenda 21 by Joan Veon
            </h2>

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              ​Even before the people of the world understood the threat to world population, the Group of Seven, now the Group of Eight world leaders stated in their 1981 communique that they were "deeply concerned about the implication of world population growth." In 1990, they commended the forthcoming 1992 Rio Earth Summit and in 1992, they wrote, "The Earth Summit has been a landmark in heightening the consciousness of the global environmental challenges and in creating a world-wide partnership on development and the environment."
             </p>
             <p>
              It was at the 1992 UNCED conference that sustainable development was unveiled. Interestingly to note, there was a very strong and powerful corporate lobby that had come together to support this evil agenda of control. Called the World Business Council for Sustainable Development-WBCSD**, they still exert great power and influence on the international level. The WBCSD has nurtured and expanded sustainable development-all the way to the ten year follow-up of UNCED in 2004 at the World Summit for Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.
             </p>
             <p>
              In Johannesburg, sustainable development evolved to a much higher level. There many of the same people who were involved ten years previous were present, along with some new players which included Congressman Dennis Kuchinich and others, along with former governor of California Jerry Brown. The Bush Administration put forth a World Summit Vision Statement that said in part
             </p>
             <p>
              We believe sustainable development begins at home and is supported by effective domestic policies and international partnerships. We recognize poverty remains a global problem of huge proportions that demands our action.
             </p>
             <p>
              To fulfill its commitment, our government is spending $970 million over three years which will be used to leverage private monies to generate more than $1.6B for water-related and other activities globally. Projects included: Clean Energy, an Initiative to Cut Hunger, sustainable forest management and monies to help fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
             </p>
             <p>
              ​The centerpiece of Johannesburg was the launching of "International Sustainable Development Law" that will govern the implementation and legal rights of sustainable development. This new discipline is based on poverty alleviation and the rights of the marginalized (socialistic transfer of wealth mechanisms). Over 150 environmental lawyers and those from other related disciplines met in Durban, South Africa a week before to discuss the integration of environmental, economic, and social laws into one new discipline. There were policy papers put forth which they hoped would be used as the framework for a Treaty on International Sustainable Development Law. Their actions reaffirmed Chapter 39 of Agenda 21 which recognizes the need to continue progressive development and codification of international law related to sustainable development. It should be noted that these laws will be incorporated into every local and national level of law worldwide.
             </p>
             <p>
              ​For those of us with Christian values, this is the anti-thesis of what we believe for sustainable development is pagan. It perverts Genesis 1, 2, and 3 in that it puts the earth as being dominant over man and not man as having dominance over the earth-hence, you and I have no value since we have been demoted to the same value as an animal or plant. So what do you think is the end result of international sustainable development law? Enslavement.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now who were THE players behind the birthing of sustainable development? To my surprise, it was Prince Charles. Not happy with the Christian faith, Charles turned to "para- psychology" which some define as "dabbling in the occult." He was greatly influenced by the South African-born writer, explorer, and mystic Laurens van der Post who was a friend of his grandmother, the Queen Mother. The prince was also influenced by James Lovelock, a British scientist who formulated the "Gaia hypothesis, which today is known as the worship of the earth, a belief based on the Greek goddess Gaia, the Earth Mother. Charles concurs with the perversion of Genesis 1, 2, and 3.
             </p>
             <p>
              ​Most people will not find Prince Charles or his environmental activities in the headlines of major newspapers. Nor do his biographies really explain his involvement, as there is basically a blackout on what he is really doing worldwide. In April 1991, fourteen months before UNCED, the Prince held a private two day international conference aboard the royal yacht Britannia, moored off the coast of Brazil. His goal was to bring together key international figures in an attempt to achieve a degree of harmony between the various countries that would happen at the Rio Earth Summit. Then Senator Al Gore was present, along with senior officials from the World Bank, chief executives from companies such as Shell and British Petroleum, the key NGO's, and other officials.
             </p>
             <p>
              Several years ago, I had the opportunity to interview Maurice Strong and specifically asked him about this meeting. He told me he was in London at a World Wildlife meeting hosted by Prince Philip and was asked by Prince Charles to accompany him to Rio for the April 1991 meeting. Furthermore, in 1990 when sustainable development had just been formulated by the Brundtland Commission, it was the prince who commended them for "bringing the term 'sustainable development' into everyone's vocabulary."

              ​As sustainable development has evolved to the point where the teaching of Agenda 21 is called "Earth Sciences" in schools, universities, and colleges, our government has instituted Agenda 21 through the Presidents Commission on Sustainable Development. Throughout the U.S., there are cities that have adopted Agenda 21 and there are those that are now sustainable, such as "Sustainable Racine." We must remember Russia did not fall to the communists all at once-it was city by city.
​
​I wrote Prince Charles the Sustainable Prince in 1997 with major updates in 1998 and 2000. It is key and relevant for those who want to understand what is happening today. At every turn the Prince is still involved in the affairs of the United Nations, sustainable development, and public-private partnership. The Prince's representatives are to be found at all the key global meetings, expounding and advancing this life changing philosophy. Perhaps we should wonder why the world still follows him and carries out his dictates.
             </p>
             <p>
              ​For ten years, various activists have been warning and educating about sustainable development. Who do we go to? The church has been silent. Major "conservatives" have been silent. No one has even questioned President Bush about his support for sustainable development. It is not even a key issue in this election.

             I did a little research on Butler and he is tied up with stuff in Racine which is where he is from.  All this stuff gives me a headache.  There is no end to it it is just one long maze that leads to a deep rabbit hole.  Butler helps kids by giving away free bikes.  Hmm.  And more.

             Besides being a star player, Butler is also a dedicated member of the community. He is extremely active with community organizations that specialize in youth outreach. He enjoys using his personal experience to motivate kids to pursue their dreams. In 2005, Butler started visiting incarcerated kids at the Oak Hill Youth Detention Center, located outside of the District in order to share his life story and to provide the kids with support and encouragement. He also helped organize the community outreach event, “Urban Dialogue: Stop the Violence,” in his hometown of Racine, Wisconsin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Butler demonstrated his steadfast commitment to bettering his hometown, when he chose to sponsor the “Cops N’ Kids” Legacy Project. The unique initiative strives to bring new life into the community by encouraging communication and strong relationships between kids and law enforcement officers. Police officers distribute books to local youth and have a Reading Center where youth can read, borrow books, use computers, and receive one-on-one tutoring. Butler also teamed up with the Salvation Army and Wal-Mart to sponsor a program called the “Bike Brigade.” The “Bike Brigade” distributes brand new bikes and helmets to youth in Racine and in DC; to date, he has helped gift over 2,500 bikes. Butler created his own program “Caron’s Coats for Kids” which distributes coats, hats, and gloves to youth in both Racine and in Washington, DC. In the summer of 2009, Butler organized “Caron’s 3D Summer Explosion,” a summer-long program that included events almost every weekend for kids. He organized a day of service, a charity basketball game, a free basketball clinic, his annual Bike Brigade, as well as a back-to-school supply drive for kids in the area. In July, 2012 Butler continued to better his hometown of Racine by donating 200,000 dollars to the local United Way, George Bray Center, Juneteenth Foundation and YMCA organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yup, looks like there is no end to Butler's kindness and good will towards Children.  His adopted city is DC.  Oh boy.

               A BRAZILIAN witch doctor has said that Peter Mandelson once held a chicken while he cut off its head as a sacrifice to a pagan god in the Candomble cult. Later the voodoo practitioner was, it appears, asked by Mr Mandelson's friend Reinaldo Avila da Silva to do something to make Charlie Whelan "who is always trying to harm Peter" disappear from politics. The magic man was sent a photograph of Mr Whelan, and - hey presto! - his bad vibes evaporated and Mr Mandelson was restored to the Cabinet.

              Mandelson was also involved in NSPC, which is an organization to protect children. Cheri founded the Matrix chamber, which primarily focuses on human rights, sex trafficking, etc.

            Orthodox-Catholic Church of America -

             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox-Catholic_Church_of_America
            </a>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Orthodox-Catholic Church of America (OCCA) is an independent and self-governing Christian Syncretic (Eastern Orthodox/Oriental Orthodox/Western Catholic) jurisdiction based in the United States (including the Territory of the US Virgin Islands), with clergy also in Mexico, Brazil, and Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
             The OCCA is not associated with the Orthodox churches whose bishops are members of the "Assembly of Canonical Orthodox Bishops of the United States of America," the body which replaced SCOBA.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Orthodox-Catholic Church of America was established in the United States in 1892 under the mandate of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch, Ignatius Peter IV. The founding archbishop, Joseph René Vilatte (ordained as Mar Timotheus), had been ordained as a priest by Bishop Ernst Herzog of the Old Catholic Church in Bern, Switzerland on June 7, 1885.[7] Working in the Great Lakes area, predominantly in Wisconsin, Fr. Vilatte sought to bring about the return of a Western Rite of Orthodoxy. Fr. Vilatte received both support and opposition in this attempt, but eventually he was consecrated as archbishop for North America, in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka)[8] by Archbishop Francis Alvarez with the permission of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch in 1892. The history of the OCCA is grounded, therefore, both in the East and West.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1921 Vilatte ordained the first African-American bishop, George Alexander McGuire, for the African Orthodox Missionary District of New York, which later became the African Orthodox Church.
            </p>
            <p>
             The OCCA has canonized two saints: St. David Edwards, a former priest of the OCCA, and St. Fr. Mychal Judge, O.F.M., a Catholic Franciscan friar and firehouse chaplain who was the first identified victim of the September 11 attacks in 2001.
