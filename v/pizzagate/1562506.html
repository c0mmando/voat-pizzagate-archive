<p>Id like to ask, what are the odds of Alefantis\'s goddaughter or a girl who looks just like her be put on PIZZABRAINS tumblr then the people associated with the supposed unrelated business be into the same sort of behavior as the comet crew eg satanism spirit cooking for anyone saying the goddaughter is not the pizzaslut (<em>shivers</em>) </p>

<p>I would normally dismiss a silly cartoon like this apart from a few reasons,</p>
<p>My belief that pickles is a new codeword - this would tie together the evidence presented in the mr pickles tv show (clear satanism) and the evidence presented below in this POI\'s IG connected to the new Philly evidence</p>
<p>This thread is actually related to POI connected to the new Philadelphia investigation that started today - did not want to &quot;witchhunt&quot;</p>
<p>!) a newly collected person of interest named GARY DUCKET - posted a reference to the show on his public FB clearly referencing satanic pentagrams and such - very scary, also on his public IG &quot;pickles&quot; (referenced clearly in the cartoon video in a crude way) could be referencing a codeword? there is an image of a baby with the words &quot;cute-cumber&quot;???</p>
<p>I believe this person has many smoking guns on their fully public social media and has been more careless even as much as jimmycommet, another reference to #Fillmorecontainers WHILE ON VACATION HOLY SHIT COMON PEOPLE! on his facebook. This voat thread including the real photo of what looks to be a satanic event that they attended, plenty more scary stuff and scary people are present.</p>

            Here's another one. Marc Vetri of Pizzeria Vetri, Osteria, etc. has a picture with Obama and can be found in the podesta emails. He can also be found in the WH logs(2 for potus, 1 for flotus). He is connected to Michael Solomonov(idk how to spell) you can see in the photos. He owns Zahav. He also seems to own Federal Donuts. He is pictured with HRC. The manager of federal donuts is pictured with Joe Biden. He also has a lot of..odd photos on his Instagram. Federal Donuts is connected to both little baby's ice cream and pizza brain.

            Is there a source Instagram/archive of the "pizza slut" picture by itself? Whose instagram account is it from? I'm trying to find it in the recent Pizzagate 2.0 archive dump.

            As someone that hasn't been following everyday, I'm wondering if this really is anything? I'm not doubting it, but maybe it'll lead to something bigger, I hope it does..but viewing it this way I'm not seeing a lot of crazy things, however it's still interesting to try to find. I wish we knew about this in quiet so we could've seen things that I'm sure were deleted before all this broke.

            OP, that comet ping pong is 6 weeks old, so I doubt it's a real one, looks like he's being sarcastic based on the news reports from 6 weeks ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please stop putting everything in caps and saying OMG, it just makes you look fanatic especially when it turns out to be nothing. Not trying to be rude, but please dial it back.

            Okay so you have posted some more images from a guy talking about comet ping pong that are much older than 6 weeks, so that's good. Now we have a link to JA (Or at least  a link to someone who is a big fan of his).

            I don't know about pizzabrain, but this pickle crap sure is creepy. And yes, it appears that they are using pickles as a slang for dick

            They have tons of codes and symbols we don't even know about but have seen. Various fruit. Nail polish. Get this, kinda hard to describe but clothes and items set in certain patterns has a whole type of meaning. The way a room is set together. I have a lot of evidence gathered. Hard to make sense because we don't know the exact meaning of the symbols.

            Here is an archive for the hashtag #WaldoJamesMysterious  which appears to be the baby that shows up in some of these Gary Ducket IG posts, I found the # by following it from a picture where he called the baby his "pickle intern".  I am not convinced this kid is a victim of HT, rather just the child of some hippies.  From what I gather they let him give them their names and he looks to be breastfed until at least 2 years old but I'm not sure he's a HT victim, just some hippies' kid.  Here's the archive just in case:

            In December 2010,
            <strong>
             Dwyer met Joe Hunter
            </strong>
            , a pizza chef hailing from South Carolina interested in opening a community-minded pizzeria in his adopted home of Philadelphia. The following month in January 2011, businessman
            <strong>
             Michael Carter
            </strong>
            and carpenter
            <strong>
             Ryan Anderson
            </strong>
            teamed up with Brian and Joe. Hunter immediately set to work on Pizza Brain’s unique pie concepts and flavor profiles. Carter provided curatorial direction to Dwyer’s collection and developed the business’ strategic model, including its emphasis on content-rich social media.

            Might be a good idea to edit your post and change all orignal links to the corresponding archived links. I
            <em>
             hate
            </em>
            clicking on original links when the content is so disturbing.

            First off- this IG is going to be taken down or made private so fast. That is why you archive everything before posting it. This is how we get accused of witch hunts and harassment, and how evidenced disappears. I really recommend as few people as possible click these links. Copy any link you want to look at, paste in an archive.
            <br/>
            Second, ok, thank you for this, and I don't deny there are potential connections. But... I don't think "pizzaslut" girl (...
            <em>
             shivers
            </em>
            ) is Alafantis's "goddaughter." I just don't see it. Besides similar themes in creepiness, is that the only connection to the Comet crew right now? Did I miss something?
