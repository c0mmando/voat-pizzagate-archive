<p>by Brian Burgess | Mar 13, 2020</p>
<p>At the end of every week, we praise a political playmaker, “swipe left” on the week’s biggest political loser, and explain what it all means for Florida’s political arena. </p>
<p>CHAMP: Jose Oliva</p>
<p>Champ of the Week</p>
<p>The first two-time champ and outgoing House Speaker had a week to remember, passing key legislation aimed at providing Floridians greater access to healthcare and taking aim at the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Oliva saw his magnum opus cross the finish line, with HB 607, sponsored by State Representative Cary Pigman, being immediately signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis.</p>
<p>The bill will remove unnecessary barriers, expanding the roles of registered nurse practitioners to be able to practice medicine to a greater extent without supervision.</p>
<p>The measure, which passed after it was amended by the Senate on Tuesday, allows Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRNs) more autonomy to deliver health care for patients during a time where the state is facing problems meeting the demand for health care providers due to an influx in population.</p>
<p>Expanding the scope of practice has been a top priority for Oliva who has devoted much of his tenure instituting responsible health care reform and making it more affordable for Floridians.</p>
<p>Oliva then placed a bow on his already successful week, putting COVID-19, the virus that has now been labeled as a pandemic, in perspective — something needed with mass hysteria dominating the 24/7 news cycle.</p>
<p>Jose Oliva@RepJoseOliva</p>
<p>No, we aren’t #COVID19 deniers. It’s a serious health risk for the elderly and immunocompromised. And prudent mitigation, isolation, and treatment plans should go on. But fear feeds on misinformation. These data points (cited) keep things in perspective <a href="https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/covid-19-coronavirus-infographic-datapack/">https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/covid-19-coronavirus-infographic-datapack/</a> …</p>

<p>Though Oliva will surrender his gavel at the end of the 2020 Legislative Session, his leadership, admiration, and conservative principles will catapult him to his next destination — should he continue to serve the state of Florida.</p>
<p>CHUMP: Andrew Gillum</p>
<p>Chump of the Week</p>
<p>This one might actually propel Gillum into the lead for Chump of the Year. Last night in Miami, Gillum was found in a highly intoxicated state by Miami Beach Police at a South Beach hotel. He was so impaired he couldn’t communicate with the responding officers, who were primarily focused on trying to help another man present at the scene who allegedly overdosed on crystal methamphetamine.</p>
<p>That man was later revealed to be gay porn-star and male escort Travis Dyson, who maintains some eye-popping social media profiles.</p>
<p>Gillum released a statement very shortly after the story first broke online, claiming that he did not partake of the contents of three baggies filled with what the police believed to contain crystal meth, but instead said he had “too much to drink.”</p>
<p>In the statement, Gillum referred to Dyson as his “friend,” and in a subsequent interview with the Miami New Times, Dyson confirmed the claim, saying he met Gillum about a year ago, but then seemingly contradicted Gillum’s claim that he was in Miami to “attend a wedding celebration.”</p>
<p>“I personally was not celebrating a wedding,” Dyson told the Miami New Times. “I don’t know if [Gillum] was in town for a wedding. He did not mention that.” (Liars lie - wife not invited? Name the newlyweds)</p>
<p>A third man, Aldo Mejias, was also involved in the incident. He is alleged to have provided Dyson with a credit card to rent the room where the drug-fueled party took place and told police he arrived after Gillum and Dyson and called the police after he observed Dyson collapse.</p>
<p>(See how they work around their degenerate activities having others rent the room?)</p>
<p>In the public statement Gillum released, he stated he planned to spend the next few weeks with his family and asked for privacy during this time.</p>
<p>No matter how much time Gillum remains out of the public spotlight, if he chooses to return to the public spotlight, he’s got some tough questions to answer.</p>

           CHUMP: Andrew Gillum

            , is there a connection to abuse of kids here anywhere? I'm not seeing a pizzagate connection per Rule 1.
           </p>
           <p>
            While I am stoked to see another liberal bite the dust, I will need to remove this per Rule 1 if no pizzagate link can be found in the next 24 Hours. Grace flair activated.

            You forgot the part about leather chaps and blood/poo stains on the sheet. Plus piles of puke all over the place.  Sounds lovely.

            In regards to the non-PG portion of the story, I really like some of the stuff the Advanced Practice Registered Nurses have put out.
           </p>
           <p>
            They did some excellent research into the CDC's
            <strong>
             manipulation of seasonal flu figures.
            </strong>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Flu results in "about 250,000 to 500,000 yearly deaths" worldwide, Wikipedia tells us. "The typical estimate is 36,000 [deaths] a year in the United States," reports NBC, citing the Centers for Disease Control.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The numbers differ wildly from the sober tallies recorded on death certificates
             </strong>
             -- by law every certificate must show a cause -- and reported by the official agencies that collect and keep vital statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the National Vital Statistics System in the U.S., for example,
             <strong>
              annual flu deaths in 2010 amounted to just 500 per year
             </strong>
             -- fewer than deaths from ulcers (2,977), hernias (1,832) and pregnancy and childbirth (825), and a far cry from the big killers such as heart disease (597,689) and cancers (574,743).
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Even that 500 figure for the U.S. could be too high,
             </strong>
             according to analyses in authoritative journals such as the American Journal of Public Health and the British Medical Journal.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Only about 15-20 per cent of people who come down with flu-like symptoms have the influenza virus
             </strong>
             -- the other 80-85 per cent actually caught rhinovirus or other germs that are indistinguishable from the true flu without laboratory tests, which are rarely done.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              In 2001, a year in which death certificates listed 257 Americans as having died of flu, only 18 were positively identified as true flus.
             </strong>
             The other 239 were simply assumed to be flus and most likely had few true flus among them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because the flu was rarely an "underlying cause of death," the CDC
             <strong>
              created the sound-alike term, "influenza-associated death."
             </strong>
             Using this new, loose definition, CDC's computer models could tally people who died of a heart ailment or other causes after having the flu.
            </p>
            <p>
             The CDC's decision to play up flu deaths dates back a decade, when it realized the public wasn't following its advice on the flu vaccine. During the 2003 flu season
             <strong>
              "the manufacturers were telling us that they weren't receiving a lot of orders for vaccine,"
             </strong>
             Dr. Glen Nowak, associate director for communications at CDC's National Immunization Program, told National Public Radio.
             <strong>
              "It really did look like we needed to do something to encourage people to get a flu shot."
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             "Medical experts and public health authorities [should] publicly (e.g. via media) state concern and alarm (and predict dire outcomes) - and urge influenza vaccination." This recipe, his slide show indicated,
             <strong>
              would result in "Significant media interest and attention
             </strong>
             ... in terms that motivate behavior (e.g. as 'very severe,' 'more severe than last or past years,' 'deadly')."
            </p>
            <p>
             Other emotive recommendations included
             <strong>
              fostering "the perception that many people are susceptible to a bad case of influenza"
             </strong>
             and
             <strong>
              "Visible/tangible examples of the seriousness of the illness (e.g., pictures of children, families of those affected coming forward) and people getting vaccinated
             </strong>
             (the first to motivate, the latter to reinforce)."

            Propaganda 101. Brought to you by the same fake news media and lying CDC that are pushing corona fear like it's going out of style.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they would lie, year after year, about the seasonal flu statistics and dangers, then why on Earth should we trust them about the Coronavirus?
