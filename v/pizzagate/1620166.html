            Actually no it isn't overtly obvious and this was discussed here several days ago. My point then was that it was odd that ALL of the rescued victims were turned over to DCF since that would indicate that none of the children had local family members who were able to take care of them. If your child had been missing or was being sexually abused by a non relative, your child would be turned back to your custody when this type of abuse was discovered by police- unless you were a part of the abuse, lived out of the area, or DCF already maintained legal custody of your child. There's really no logical explanation why DCF would be caring for all of the victims.

             Very interesting. Another implication there is that they are purposefully not being released to their parents because the whole thing is in the process of being covered up.

             WERE being cared for is past tense indicating they had been cared for by various agencies. Wouldn't it have said ARE present tense if they were currently being cared for by those agencies?
