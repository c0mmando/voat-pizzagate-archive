            This is what I am arguing against. If you start shooting they will start shooting back. If everybody came out of their abode and took the streets and stopped looking at their goddamnnfucking phones or TVs or talking about themselves for one minute they could instantly bring down the government and bring it to a halt. If they came out gums blazimg the terrified soldier trained to kill would shoot back and use every tool at his disposal for his own safety. If he sees wo!em Mem and children in unity, billions of them, he cannot do nary a thing but become part of that justice. For we are greater in number and goodness. Good always triumphs over evil but always requires more energy. This is obviously going to end in multiple false flag that draw gun nuts out of their homes designed to put people on martial law to prevent them from revolting more. And it will be severe. That will only happen if we give trained army men and Cops a reason to shoot.
