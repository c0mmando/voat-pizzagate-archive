<p>Edit: Going back to what fartyshorts said (I posted above). The archive shows a change that happened recently. Interestingly, there could be a reason why it has changed. </p>
<p>Read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/13/tech/web/tokelau-domain-name-holder/index.html">this article from CNN</a>
talks about the .tk domain creations and what happens when idle. It gets parked and will show ads. It wasn\'t for sale. It said disabled. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Freedom Registry makes money through ads on expired domains. Zuurbier says registration and renewal are free for users, but when they abandon the site or don\'t meet the minimum requirements of 25 unique visitors every 90 days, the domain gets &quot;parked.&quot; That means the URL still exists, but the content is replaced with ads tailored to the original site.</p>
<p>&quot;If your website was about your trip to Mexico, we have spiders that go through all of the live websites, and the moment the live website expires, we take the domain name back,&quot; Zuurbier said. &quot;We then put ads on there that are relevant to the content that was there before. In this case, your trip to Mexico.&quot;</p>

            11:09 could be 911 backwards.

            Even DC insiders know Seth Rich was killed by Podesta/ DNC. Why would Donna Brazile dedicate a book to a low-level data analyst of little importance who died in hospital after a botched robbery?
           </p>
           <p>
            Do not trust Assange, especially after 10-16-16. He had the goods on the Podestas' McCann operation, and died or was brought in for brainwashing before hitting the kill switch properly.,

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Here’s where it gets much more interesting–-Don Jr. ultimately released the conversations he had with Wikileaks himself after they were leaked to the Atlantic.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who leaked the transcripts in the first place? The leaking of a private citizens correspondence from what was supposed to be a Senate Intelligence investigation is and should be, considered a very serious crime on somebody’s part.
            </p>
            <p>
             You may remember, Senator Dianne Feinstein sending a request directly to Twitter last month, completely bypassing procedure, asking the company to release the private direct messages of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, and others.
            </p>
            <p>
             It would appear Twitter complied with the request giving Feinstein at least the chats between Wikileaks and Don Jr.
            </p>
            <p>
             At some point in or after this transaction, somebody was able to obtain and leak these transcripts to the press. How does this make you feel about your rights and privacy on Twitter?
            </p>
            <p>
             Regardless, it would appear this was exactly what Don Jr. and likely Wikileaks, expected would happen and Don Jr. released the transcripts in their entirety to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
             The link, posted in almost every mainstream outlet across the globe, now leads to a page saying thanks to Don Jr., you know Seth Rich was the leaker of the internal emails to Wikileaks and for this reason, was killed by order of John Podesta and the DNC.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, simply making a website stating Seth was murdered by the DNC does not make it so, but it certainly raises many questions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Was it pure coincidence the domain formerly owned by Wikileaks happened to expire and be repurchased by someone who, seemingly expecting new traffic, had a web page ready to go crediting Don Jr. to the people visiting?
Whoever purchased the domain had to know traffic would be coming, and exactly who the traffic would be.
            </p>
            <p>
             In other words, it appears Don Jr.’s release of the chat transcripts was planned knowing the media would be spreading this link across the world.
            </p>

             PS…is this foreshadowing of what is yet to come?

            All of this Makes My Head Hurt.  The last two tweets (tracybeanz)  is a Real Head Scratcher.  We all have to make up our own answers right now.  Who knows if this will be ironed out or not.  Assange could be gone or not, He could be in control, or the CIA, it is all Up In The Air, imo.

             Yes, but why would Wikileaks relinquish this free domain site?
            </p>
            <p>
             Either way, just a fan or Wikileaks themselves, LOTS of people are reading about Seth Rich today!!!
            </p>
            <p>
             EDIT: On second thought, why would Wikileaks have ever even used this .tk site in the first place??? Why wouldn't they have asked Don Jr. to link directly to their secure site? Plus, the last messages were sent after Julian's internet had been but off. This is really strange.

                 Yeah, the inverted way of doing the date (to Americans) is what confused everyone about the "death of Paul" date on the drum-skin of the Sgt. Pepper album cover. McCartney regretted doing it that way as it caused so much confusion, their primary market was the states, so in effect they made kind of a boo-boo, shoulda done the date the American way.

                    No revelations as it were just that it is possibly not an American style of writing. These are not the typical details remebered with an inexperienced LARPer...Or it could have just been a mistake I dont know with all this stuff with Q ect I feel like everything is either a clue or we are all on overtime hivemind its an interesting ride lately though.

                     Yes, I couldn't agree more, w/ everything. "Not the typical details of a larper." No they are not. Too much military and / or intel speak. Thanks for answering.

                 It's been gnawing on me for a few days now, and I've mentioned it in a few comments as this date is popping up a lot lately. It's not exactly an opposite, but I guess an inversion or even a reciprocal? 11/9  -  9/11.  Numbers all seem to make their way to the top as these things continue to stew. I can't help feeling it was on purpose. Just hope it was the good guys that decided to make it happen on purpose.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Source code and analysis for CIA software projects including those described in the Vault7 series.
            </p>
            <p>
             This publication will enable investigative journalists, forensic experts and the general public to better identify and understand covert CIA infrastructure components.
            </p>
            <p>
             Source code published in this series contains software designed to run on servers controlled by the CIA. Like WikiLeaks' earlier Vault7 series, the material published by WikiLeaks does not contain 0-days or similar security vulnerabilities which could be repurposed by others.

             Who said wikileaks was neutral and unbiased? I've only seen the claim that they're reliable and accurate, never that they had no motives of their own.

              Assange himself has.
             </p>
             <p>
              He tried to portray himself as equally anti-Trump and anti-Clinton.  He did this specifically in June 2016.  Meanwhile he was actively aiding the Trump campaign AND asking for Trump's help in making Wikileaks look like it's not working with Russia.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why do you think he got involved in Seth Rich's death?   Reliability?  Accuracy?  Or he correctly assumed that people would then claim Seth Rich leaked to Wikileaks?

               LInk, link, link? Assange has published truth as a journalist is supposed to. Aiding the Trump campaign by telling the truth? Working with Russia? Julian already told you shills he is not giving sources, so stop. You think you are going to come here and question the anti- pedophile crowd in behalf of your free paycheck?

               Keep in mind Bill Clinton's wife has said "Why can't we just drone strike the guy?" regarding Assange. He totally was pushing leaks that would help Trump win the election. Just because Assange lent a hand to the guy most likely to keep him alive doesn't mean that's the only reason he wanted him to win.

               I'm not accused and I'll say they're biased/non-neutral. The timing of leaks is considered, and Assange doesn't want to live in an embassy until he rots.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's just a false dichotomy, it's entirely possible for the organization to be biased and push a self-serving agenda (Assange wants safe haven somewhere), while also serving the good of the many.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's actually very similar to the false dichotomy around Trump: I've heard a lot of people suggest that he only ran for the presidency because of his ego as though that is necessarily a bad thing. But I feel that if he ran for his ego, that's reassuring, because his ego would take a massive hit if he went down in history as a failed president. Whereas if he goes down in history as "the man who saved america", his ego will be thrilled.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sometimes, what is good for the individual is also good for the many.

                Exactly, about Trump. False dichotomy. Why can't both be correct. I think you said it well. Congrats, you are thinking. This is something that would be helpful to many if they could refrain from just thinking either / or. It's not that simple w/ the man and his agenda.

                 As far as Trump goes, I accept that I only have access to the least important information: What happens in the public sphere. What goes on behind closed doors is anybody's guess, and mine is about as good as anyone else's, so I don't bother dwelling on what my guess is precisely.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Belief is a powerful thing, strong enough to turn ordinary men into living gods (pharaohs), if those men truly lack any spark/touch of the divine, that merely lends more credence to the sheer power of belief. In my mind, whether humans drive belief or belief drives human behavior is a foolish question, it's asking which part of the wheel drives itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The man's antics make me laugh in the face of darkness, and I think that's one of the strongest factors of belief there is: Danger, darkness and despair are all a part of this world, but their strongest power is that which we give them, so why give them anything but laughter? Why cower in fear at terrorists when instead you can call them gullible losers? The act has already been done, you're not going to deradicalize them from suburbia, so just
                 <em>
                  laugh at the losers duped by the forces of evil
                 </em>
                 . You'd have to be a dummy to work for evil!
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's honestly great. Words are so lacking for the light that has been put into my heart over the course of the last year. Who could have imagined a world where all it took to show me the beauty of God's creation was Donald-Fucking-Trump being elected President of the USA? The gods gave us this world to laugh and love in, and isn't Donald-Fucking-Trump as POTUS all the evidence we need of that fact?

                  Nice. And to think there's more to come. There is, trust me. (Don't mean to sound condescending. But keep a very, very open mind. Big things are coming. It will be traumatizing for normies, and a spiritual awakening for many ... anon, whether legit or not, mentioned The Great Awakening ... that was an historical event.)

                 The human body is like a brilliant computer, one of the things that makes it brilliant is how neurons can remap themselves essentially at will. The secret of quantum computing is locked in the structure of our minds.

                <p>
                 Switching to "either/or" is a comforting but very limiting behavior, because you're changing your switches from "0, 1, 2, 3" to "0, 1". Suddenly expressing even a simple thought (Base-10 "33" = Base-4 "201") becomes much more difficult (Base-2 "100001").
                </p>
                <p>
                 The more options you have available, the more densely you can store information. When you're stuck in binary thinking, even a simple thought is complicated/difficult to express.
