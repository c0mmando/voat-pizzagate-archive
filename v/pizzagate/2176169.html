<p>Judd Apatow\'s Secret Pedophile Comedy? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I read the description of it, I cringed, winced, and threw up! It reads like a playbook of what we\'ve been talking about!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to an alternative weekly called the Weekly Dig, Apatow has been secretly shooting a movie called Pedovan in Boston. They claim we haven’t heard about it because city officials have gone out of their way to help them keep the whole thing under wraps, hidden away from all you pesky internet scoopers. Here’s the really interesting thing. Why the need for secrecy? They claim Apatow is scared to death of lawsuits. See, he’s making a pedophile comedy… allegedly  ...</p>
<p>Here’s how the Weekly Dig describes Pedovan: “After creating numerous doomed youth programs, Davis founds Ped-o-van (&quot;Why walk when you can ped-o!&quot;), a ZipCar-like community service where drivers pick children up from the park, their school or their extracurricular activities, and drive them home. All the vans are refurbished, soon-to-be junked conversion vans from the \'70s. &quot;He loves these vans,&quot; says writer Evan Goldberg. &quot;And he loves these kids.&quot; Davis equips the vans to run on biodiesel, so he must stop at fast-food restaurants to fuel up. The vendors start offering the kids free fries, inciting the wrath of high-strung parents concerned about children\'s nutrition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failed youth programs? Fast food restaurants to &quot;fuel up&quot;? And vans? Aren\'t vans what we were discussing in Pizzagate?

<p>Yeah, this is a VERY funny joke ... or is it more a hint. The FUTURE OF COMEDY? Really. Including the pedo not really being a pedo!!!! </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The film centers around misguided hipster Glenn Davis (played by Jonah Hill), who makes several failed attempts to bring the children of his community joy. Hill\'s character sports a bushy mustache, sideburns, dark glasses and thrift-store apparel. &quot;He wears his clothes ironically,&quot; explains Apatow. &quot;People think he\'s a pervert, but he\'s a soft, lovable lug.&quot;</p>

            Raping children is no joke for "Jews". It's a serious matter for them. That's why their Talmud endlessly recounts the different ways a child ought to be raped.

            Remember that Judd Apatow also said something like "This is just the beginning" when commenting on the UC Berkley riots. The guy is a cum gargling pedo freakshow like like the rest. Him and all the people he constantly casts, like Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen.

             UPDATE! Thanks to Cody below in the comments section, for simply having the good sense to check the URL of the image being used on the movie's "official site". As we'd all but assumed, this is a hoax. Viewing source on the image reveals that the URL is the newspaper. There's one trail they forgot to cover. Great journalism Weekly Dig. I'm sure you're patting yourselves on your back for your wonderful sense of irony. Some though, might call it lying... which is only acceptable on April Fools.

             OBVIOUSLY, the film was fake! It's stated in my subject line for this so it's not the point. The point is why this for a fake film? Why the pic of Will Ferrell? And why did someone running the website Ped-O-Van.com have it up until 2014? That's when the following tweet was posted:

              Apatow was not involved that's the part you are misunderstanding.
             </p>
             <p>
              Read the disclaimer at the bottom of the article again.  Judd Apatow was not creating this fake movie.  The Weekly Dig created a fake Judd Apatow movie.  Apatow had nothing to do with it.

             Cult is right.

            <p>
             The thing I'm wondering is if this "movie" was an inside joke? Was Apatow and the rest of his "family" know someone that was doing this in the Boston area circa 2008? Was there someone doing this? Hence the reference to filming this "blackmail" with the cooperation of the Boston police?

            Does anyone know why tweets linked to VOAT no longer show up with pictures?  Seems somebody 
(at Twitter or VOAT?) wants these tweets to be less noticeable.  Can we get this fixed?

            <p>
             So Sony pictures is taking out all the normalization stuff that Apatow wants to be in his films so bad? Too bad, a$$hole! Nobody wants to see your propaganda campaign! Families want to go see movies, not be programmed to believe kids should  be abused!!!
