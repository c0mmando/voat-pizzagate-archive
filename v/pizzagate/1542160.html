<p>&quot;If it wasn’t for the telltale black balloons hanging outside a Columbia Heights alleyway, you might not have been able to find Paper Sun — a two-story warehouse/art space where local bands practice and sometimes even play intimate shows.

<p>I found these by looking at the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/furcafe/">Flickr gallery</a> of photographer Chris Chen (Fur Cafe). </p>
<p>He has a Flickr gallery called <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/furcafe/sets/72157664937954550">Rock &amp; Roll Flea @ Paper Sun</a> from July 2013 which includes <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/furcafe/24948886703/">this photo</a> of three hipster looking folks standing outside the building we now refer to as the Pegasus Museum.</p>
<p>And this photo of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/furcafe/25629966335/in/album-72157664937954550/">two women sitting next to a garage</a> that appears to be the same garage doors across the street from Pegasus.</p>

<p>This leads me to believe that the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/furcafe/sets/72157664937954550">rest of the pics</a>  at Rock &amp; Roll Flea <strong>were from upstairs</strong>. The event itself looks like a punk rock flea market with artists, music, etc. Nothing suspicious with that. </p>
<p>But...</p>

            The band is True Womanhood, the song is "The Monk", and the EP is "Basement Membranes" and the lyrics say in this video "We eat our young."  Check this out.

            I've followed this link for a few pages :

            What strikes me - in spite of all the edgy-weirdy stuff - is that I never get the "bad" feeling that I got right away from the JimmyComet IG pictures and comments. There are a few kids here and there. They look as healthy as they could be in this kind of surrounding. No bad intention or focus from the photographer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most pictures relate to things I could have been involved in many years back (art school and rock hype). Even the "Voodoo" and ugly esthaetics don't surprise me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course I now find it just silly and boring but nothing more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Somehow it confirms me that JA, with all his "cultural" arrogance does not belong to the same world. If for one reason, I would never have expected then to be even remotely connected with someone in touch with the political elite. Strictly impossible.

            Glad the investigation of Pegasus continues, hopefully with less gut and more wisdom. One fundamental exortation is always PUT THE MONEY WHRE YOUR MOUTH IS. So from AJ point of view what is the fundamental reason to become a museum founder and owner. In his mind likes his arcadia of ancient names the winged horse Pegasus, the Antinous alter, the Castellum domain. Why he is expanding his operations, why is opening the purse for that. How he is projecting for the future of all this? These are fundamental questions that precedes the details. Can we speak with his accountant or the bank? Alas not yet
BTW that crossing where there is the playground is designed with a elevated basin that contain 3 trees. This deisgn is perfectly horizontal to Washingtho layout. 
Pedophilia, snuff, prostitution is endemic and institutional, might as well also be a kind of pyramid scheme those at the top that joined first gains the most?
Everybody dont fight each other, do it for the children and please stop swearing, there could be children reading voat too.

            What's the address of Pegasus? It's not 3518. That is a neighoring house according to Zillow, perhaps the one with kid written on the front wall..

            On a side note, we should take note of the markings on the indoor floor around the tree table. I'm sure that they'll come in handy later.

            Sorry everyone, I'll take the blame for the most recent use of "Kill room" although I did put it in quotation marks in my post on purpose to say that it's not really the kill room just the site of the construction pics (although in my defence the guy in the video put his own spin on it and said it was the kill room multiple times - not my intention, read my thread).
A couple of things to clarify: the part at the far right of the Pegasus building is the part with the rolling mezzanine, that is the only part that I have seen that rolls, so to say the whole floor rolls as someone did, is not accurate.

            Occam's razor should have killed the '#killroom' at Pegasus rather quickly. A restaurant proprietor has pictures of a walk-in freezer, well in all likelihood it is located near his restaurants.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the building site photos do indeed depict construction of the freezer (only evidence is the patch on the floor at far right corresponding  But walk-in freezers usually have insulated floors?) then the freezer is likely at or near Buck's or Comet.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since the building site photos do not correspond to McCullough Construction next to Comet, it has to be somewhere else near Comet if it is an Alefantis restaurant freezer.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI also confirms there is an outside freezer accessed through the rear of Comet.
           </p>
           <p>
            But satellite images seem to show there can't be, unless it is hidden in one of the buildings on 5039 Connecticut Park. Because Comet has no side entrance or rear access to the Buck's and Besta parking lots.
           </p>
           <p>
            Could it be at Little Red Fox next door, where there is a structure in the back that looks like a freezer, even if it's square not rectangular?

            Yeah, that's what I was thinking. This was created more as a garage or a storage building. Why would it have a basement. The main property on the other hand it makes sense.

            the "tree trunk table" is known as a Live Edge Slab table in woodworking circles.  Pretty nice one too.  The wood is Black Walnut.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now in one of the pics the wood has a water stain on it and the other doesn't.  So perhaps these are from two different times.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other possibility which more is remote is you have two slabs taken from the same log.  You would end up with virtually identical shapes that way.    If you were a design head and were fitting out an office space, you might do it this way and have almost matching tables.
           </p>
           <p>
            However the wood seems unprotected, so it's probably just taken at a later time and it got stained.

            Great work! I wonder if when the building was originally built if that room with the tree table actually had a regular height ceiling, and that ceiling was removed making it a tall room instead of two stories. There are irregular bricks and holes along the line where the "rolling Mezzaine" tracks are and if that floor were removed it would explain why there is a door opening into space and there are no stairs (previous to the metal stairs built by Wills) going up in this particular side of the building.

             Well now, this is getting far more interesting.  If you looked at pics of newly renovated Pegasus you will see large O-ring imbedded into ceiling of second floor. We now know that was put there purposely based on these Paper Sun pics. It is apparent the upstairs was completely gutted.  We also know that the whole second floor will slide across making the room multi-faceted. Open two story. What could possibly be suspended from that O-ring? Plant?

            Wtf with all the recent sliding of the term "kill room" into discussions of 3518 11th st?
The origin of  "kill room" is the IG tag that has not been demonstrated to have a connection to any property involved. On the contrary there are clear reasons why the "kill room" is very unlikely at Pegasus/11th st, including size, expense, large compressors/coils (absent from the site) and electrical supply required.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is this "kill room" mislabeling by shills to confuse or undermine investigation with deliberate falsehood?
Or is it just dumb kids' attempt to make their reps with click-bait terms like "kill room" ??

             I agree it is likely that Pegusus is not the #killroom. There was actually a better lead somewhere I thought, where one of the users who used this term on IG, used it referring to image of a restaurant location that they owned.
            </p>
            <p>
             More likely IMO, is that "killroom" is a code-word itself. You don't see any of the other terms used in pizzagate referring to the literal act of anything. "Is killroom a code-word?" Is the question I'm wondering.

             Agree. There is something fishy about the deliberately ignorant use of "killroom". It has become deceptive to the point of misleading.

             It has actually been connected with the Pegasus building. There is a video that shows the identical brickwork. Also James Alefantis himself confirmed it was the same room with a conversation he had with the person that made the connection.

             I originally saw a video saying "Kill Room" was in the Pajama Factory, but then later it was found to be the same room where they were digging trenches (which happens to be pegasus). Is this true? I would like a source to know for sure.

              Nothing has been proven yet. Pegasus is a very interesting spot and it has undergone huge renovations but so did CPP and, iirc, the walk-in freezer was the room that was # killroom. Then Jsmith had another one that he called his Killroom and that one people initially thought was at the Pyjama Factory, but again, nothing was proven. A tiny space (alley) between CPP and neighboring building McCullough was discovered and so another theory came out of that (killroom found at McCullough) but again, nothing concrete because of some discrepancies in ceiling beams, ping pong table being in the dig room et al... It's all very interesting and possible, but the killrooms could be at any of these locations. The smoking gun piece of evidence that will definitely place the killroom at an exact location is still missing. However, I have a feeling that we're getting extremely close and would encourage everybody to keep digging.

              Edit: Question. Does this Pegasus building have a basement?

               From the property records I saw yes, but if so it doesn't make sense that they would dig, there would be a basement... so if there is one it's not under the room to the left of the furthest to the right because that would have been the room they are digging in.
