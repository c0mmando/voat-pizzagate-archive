<p>The real reason Pope Francis is lenient on pedos while against truthers on pizzagate is because of a document issued by Ratzinger (Cardinal then Pope Benedict XVI) when he was the &quot;Grand Inquisitor&quot;-- yes Grand Inquisitor (Torquemada was the first Grand Inquisitor).</p>
<p>Ratzinger was named by this survivor as being part of human hunting parties and ritual torture and murder of children:
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1800676">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1800676</a> </p>
<p>He also avoided prosecution in a sex abuse case by claiming &quot;diplomatic immunity&quot; (because the Vatican is <strong>country</strong> with it\'s own currency central Rothschild bank, intelligence services etc.):
<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/pope-seeks-immunity-over-sex-abuse-suit/2005/08/17/1123958097061.html">http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/pope-seeks-immunity-over-sex-abuse-suit/2005/08/17/1123958097061.html</a>
NB: Pope Benedict XVI was the first pope to resign in over 500 years, and the first to resign voluntarily in over 700 years. We might well ask why.
The obligatory red shoes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_shoes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_shoes</a></p>
<p>The document Ratzinger was responsible for is called <em>Crimen Sollicitationis</em> (it\'s written in Latin).** It effectively silences those reporting pederasty by clergy no matter who they are, as well as the victims themselves under pain of excommunication.** Excommunication for a Catholic means eternity in hell. Even, nuns and priests who reported pedo clergy were not only defrocked but excommunicated.

<p>Although articles, as on Wikipedia ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimen_sollicitationis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimen_sollicitationis)</a>) say it is no longer in effect, the fact is by all accounts including their own in the same referenced article, it was simply <strong>replaced</strong> with another (secret) one in May of 2001.</p>
<p>This document came into the public consciousness due in part to media coverage of the pedo scandal.</p>
<p>Interviewed for a television program in 2006, canon lawyer Thomas Doyle described the tight secrecy demanded for the procedure [of investigating child rape, etc.] as &quot;an explicit written policy to cover up cases of child sexual abuse by the clergy, to punish those who would call attention to these crimes by churchmen&quot;. This is a quotation from a (an ironically) BBC documentary on clergy sexual abuse in Ireland. While periodically removed from vimeo and YouTube, here is one I found today:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcJT0b-gkIA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcJT0b-gkIA</a>
This is important because the it is this show which made <em>Crimen Sollicitationis</em> known among the general public.</p>
<p>This document has been used in American cases (which have been won to the tune of billions so far) against pedo priests.

<p>Parenthetically: This is not at all an indictment against Roman Catholic people or their faith. Please read this post according to it\'s relevance to pizzagate and institutional protection of pedophiles.
It is important to note that homosexuality among RC clergy is rife due in large part to the prohibition on marriage of priests after the great schism in the middle ages. After a thousand years of Christianity, when the RC decided to split from the original church and become a quite different and <strong>worldly organization</strong>, they sought to confiscate property and all assets of clergy as they had considerable wealth and land. Priests were ordered to divorce their wives and turn everything over to the Vatican. [The original church, the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church, allowed and still allows married priests.]</p>',

            Sincere people of good faith are not the "Catholics" in this discussion.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is the Vatican (a city state) centered organization invented in 1054 that is the problem. From it's inception, it was run by a war lord who usurped the apostolic succession and it has been downhill since. The true church is a theandric organism, not a state which has it's own bank, issues currency and passports, wages war (the Crusades, inquisition, etc.) and so forth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course they divorced themselves from the original, undivided church of the seven ecumenical councils and just trashed just about every canon, and now invent them as they go. They have always been political. People in the West generally have no concept of ecclesiology, but instead complain about the RC church from the point of view of an even greater heresy--Protestantism.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can't just "make up" a church. The True Church was founded by Christ on Pentecost in 33 AD. Anyone who imagines that martyrs died so some idiot could just decide what anything in a Rothschild sponsored translation of the Bible means, is far form the mark to say the least, and  "perishing for lack of knowledge" ---all while they imagine they are so superior to the RC.

            It is not weak to say I have read the document you are writing about, which was written by Ratzinger in 1962. I have been researching this for a long time--years-- before pizzagate
I do not think this forum is appropriate your
            <strong>
             unsupported
            </strong>
            personal opinions about Ratzinger, even less about whatever "press" is or isn't doing to him. What nonsense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any Pope (or other clergy for that matter or anyone at all) who has been
            <strong>
             positively identified by multiple survivors of abuse and witnesses to murder and "human hunting parties"
            </strong>
            , needs to be exposed. Period.

            I have read Crimen Solliciationis in it's entirety. Have you?
It (Crimen Sollicitationis) is so important that it has been used in cases against the Vatican all over the world. That's why the new one is secret. Many cases are still being prosecuted.
Why are you defending pedos? 
This has nothing to do with sincere people who have faith, or were raised RC. This is about the organization, the nation-state called the Vatican.

            Ratzinger is the author of the document that protects pedos.

            And how is the Washington Compost which is Bezo's vanity blog and employer of Podesta, the cannibal, and which feature articles written by a women who is "raising her cats gender neutral" a credible source?

            His mom's maiden name was MacLeod, very Scottish, dad was German, don't know if his dad was Jewish. He's only of late shown any interest in Christianity, and has been for the most part surrounded by "false prophets." But his mom was very old school strict Scottish Presbyterian.

            Who do you think the devil is?  I know he exists and he is here on earth.  Masquerading.  Who is it?  J Podesta?   Soros?  HRC?  Lucifer could be masquerading as a woman also. I have not believed this until very recently.   Maybe I am wrong, but with what I have learned and seen happening to this world lately, someone really evil is in control.

             Satan is accepted as a very real entity, a "person," albeit spiritual, by all solid theologians (not these modern idiot ones). He can manifest himself in "bodily" form but employs chiefly his minions, demons, believed to be fallen angels, angels who rebelled.

            Ya know...when all this comes out..what will happen to religion?  I believe in God, I believe Jesus was divine and sent here to help us (but somehow got squashed by the pedosatanist..).  But if rumors are true...we are at least 200,000 years old.  How many catholic religions, or jewish religions have come and gone in that amount of time?  Would all there is to know about God only been discovered in our short 6k history (&lt;&lt;--BTW a big lie..)?  Doubtful...I am sure there are truths in every religion but my guess is we still have ALOT to learn about good/evil (service to self/service to others) and how it functions in the universe...

            I think this was a HUGE slip by the pope...consider these facts..we know that these pedosatanist will lock children in cages.  We know these folks will also torture these children.  What is also sometimes reported is that they make the children eat feces.  MY OPINION but based on lots of data...they are trying to demean and degrade.  They are evil..what we think of as "loving kindness" well just flip that and that is what these people are about.  Eating feces would be almost the ultimate humiliation for a human.  They want us humiliated and they think of us as "useless eaters" or "useless shit eaters".  Would guess the pope wished he had that comment back!

            LoPhatt: unfortunately you seem very confused and somewhat hysterical. Who is bashing anyone? Facts speak for themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            Protestantism, which is a heresy derived from a heresy, has nothing to do with the Vatican's Crimen Sollicitationis or rampant pedophilia.There is no such thing as a smorgasbord of belief; that idea is a manifestation of syncretism or any of the delusions that perpetuate darkness. Only darkness fears the light of Truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am well aware that there are many thousands of different Protestant denominations and I am aware of their complaints against the RC church, but I am no part of any of that. I honestly cannot fathom anyone subscribing to a "protest" rather than actual positive belief. Nor do I have anything to do with any cults.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am interested in Truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suppose Protestants, who are largely ignorant of any church history before the sixteenth century, imagine that Christ died on the cross so they can make Joyce Meyer, Joel Osteen, Benny Hinn into billionaires because they give motivational speeches to lazy, soft, idiots who are not following anything Christ actually said in the Gospels. But my post is not about Protestants, or the merits of any particular sect.
           </p>
           <p>
            It might interest you to know that there is a
            <strong>
             pre-denominational
            </strong>
            Christian Church, which is not divided nor divisive. Back in the 80s when many mainline Protestant clergy were seeking a return to the "original church", they actually found it and returned to it, abandoning their heresies, for truth--whole denominations converted. In the Philippines, and even Mexico there have been mass defections from Roman Catholicism, and have turned to the original church as well. There are books written about this, and even YouTube vids, though you won't see it on MSM.
           </p>
           <p>
            Facts are not ridicule. The fact that Vatican City is a country, with it's own currency, secret police, central bank, embassies, and ruler (Pope) is not ridicule. 
More facts:

              Yes, they are and the Roman Catholic church is a heresy invented by men, which culminated in 1054.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is now known that agents of the Medici (the Rothschilds of their day in every respect) bankrolled Luther and then the movement was taken over by other agents such as Calvin (real name Cohen), Melancthon, Knox etc.
             </p>

              I am not saying this lightly; I spent years studying books and manuscripts in the libraries of Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University.

               I hear you, but there is a supernatural spiritual element to the men of the reformation that cannot be denied, they were subject to, and obedient to, a much higher power than the Rothschild's, they were martyrs that risked and lost their lives and property for what they believed. It was a work of God. They conquered their own sins, the greatest of battles. Here we can agree to disagree. Also, God can and does employ weak and wicked men to work his will (Rothschild's) ... I give them only a certain degree of credit, they are on a leash, God determines the length of that leash.

             Intelligence analysts have cogently argued that:
            </p>
            <p>
             *The Illuminati were behind nearly every major split in the Christian church – beginning with the Catholic-Orthodox division of 1054.
            </p>
            <p>
             *Illuminati infiltrators in the Catholic Church spawned the Inquisition to deliberately alienate Christians from their faith.
            </p>
            <p>
             *This infiltration was also responsible for the 16th-century Papal corruptions – such as selling indulgences and squandering the church budget – that resulted in the Protestant split. Martin Luther, while himself a sincere reformer, was encouraged by Illuminati seeking church division.
            </p>
            <p>
             *The Protestant church was in turn infiltrated to split it into smaller and smaller denominations, ostensibly over doctrinal issues – some less essential to the Gospel than others. Unquestionably, many of those who argued for division were sincere in their beliefs, and truths can probably be found on both sides of most doctrinal rifts. But Satan held the long view: divide to conquer.

             As part of its strategy to fragmentize Christianity, the cartel was also reportedly behind the formation of major cults – including Jehovah’s Witnesses and Mormonism. (I mention this while having great respect for the morality and sincerity of many of the followers of these two sects.) Jehovah’s Witnesses deny Christ’s divinity, His physical resurrection, and the existence of hell. Mormons believe in multiple gods, that Jesus is a created being – Lucifer’s brother – and treat the Book of Mormon as holy scripture, equal or even senior to the Bible.

            I have not found convincing evidence that Hitler was a bad guy. It seems obvious that he and Germany were victims of Zionist propaganda. See

             While I will not go with Hitler=nice guy..no question he was demonized.  Hitler did NOT want to go along with the occultist and did not fully support the SS mission to retrieve artifacts and gain spiritual power.  In fact, he also was opposed to some of the off world stuff they began doing.  Everyone should watch William H. Tompkins discuss this period of history..it FREAKED our guys out when they found out nazi's were working with reptilian's.  We actually made some deal with them mid WWII.  Hitler was a PAWN and was used...but doubtful he had a "heart of gold.."

              The only way anyone could know if a humanoid were reptilian is by doing a thorough exam, especially on DNA. I seriously doubt that any such exam has ever been done. The idea of reptilians is extremely far-fetched.

            That so-called true church (Orthodox Christianity) is a fraud too. Since the sixth century under Emperor Justinian the concept of "eternal hell" was added to the Bible to instill fear into Christians to make them afraid to disobey the ruling class. Emperor Constantine in the fourth century was also guilty of founding the fraudulent Roman Catholic Church in the first place. He bribed a minority of bishops to attend the Council of Nicea and hammered out what books to put in the Bible by majority vote. Majority rule is not condoned anywhere in the Bible. Unanimous rule, i.e. consensus, is supported instead, as explained in Acts 15. Regarding "eternal hell" BS, see

              Jesus said he is the Good Shepherd who goes after all his lost sheep. That is proof against "eternal hell". There's plenty of other proof as well. No Bible is a true word of God. God's inspiration comes to individuals directly. Since everyone is fallible, what they write in a Bible etc is fallible.

            Great post.

            The 1200's were a wild time for Christianity. When the split from Orthodox the RC remain with division, the Franciscan Catholic beliefs were manipulated from the simple nature of the old Franciscan belief of 'no need for temples or things for GOD'

Calvin was one of our Children; he was of Jewish descent, and was entrusted by Jewish authority and encouraged with Jewish finance to draft his scheme in the Reformation.

              "Thanks to our propaganda, to our theories of Liberalism and to our misrepresentations of Freedom, the minds of many among the Gentiles were ready to welcome the Reformation.  They separated from the Church to fall into our snare.  And thus the Catholic Church has been very sensibly weakened, and her authority over the Kings of the Gentiles has been reduced almost to naught..

"We are grateful to Protestants for their loyalty to our wishes - although most of them are, in the sincerity of their faith, unaware of their loyalty to us. We are grateful to them for the wonderful help they are giving us in our fight against the stronghold of Christian Civilization, and in our preparations for the advent of our supremacy over the whole world and over the Kingdoms of the Gentiles.

              As if Almighty God can be outmaneuvered by the Elders. When it was God himself who cursed them for their wickedly forsaking Him and their messiah Christ Jesus. Luther became anti-semitic after he exhausted himself trying to convert them. The Elders have put their spin on the Reformation because it was destroying the evil Roman church which they exulted in. 
Edit: Remember, they are ruthless, implacable liars. "Of their father the devil, who is a liar, and the father thereof."

            It is hard to believe we realize but the Vatican's intelligence services were part of the NAZI rise to power. The darkest secret of all is the inner circle of Hitler &amp; the SS were involved in occult rituals that included Aleister Crowley practices. Criwley was a satanist but also a British intelligence officer. The Vatican was the outside enforcers for the NAZI's.

            The Catholic Church was used to help indoctrinate German children against Jewish children in schools.

            This is the power and name behind the US intelligence service the CIA.... it stands for Catholics in Action. It was inverted and brought in secretly through black budgets because of the constitution.

            This is not all Catholics of course. It is the elite who have deceived for years.

             Hitler's Pope, Pius XII, was a crypto Jew, who distributed rosaries with a swastika in the place of the cross to Croatian Roman Catholics who actually decapitated Orthodox Christian priests during WWII. In all, the Roman Catholic Croatians killed 750,000 Orthodox Christians purely because of their faith. Here is a quote from Avro Manhattan, authority on WWII atrocities: "The hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church in Croatia under the leadership of then Archbishop Stepinac during this period was not only complicit with the Nazis, but that their Catholic version of the Nazis, the "Ustashi", were even more guilty than the Nazis, because they committed atrocities in God's name, with the blessing of their priests, their bishops and even of their so-called "Vicar of Christ" ! "

             More than 2,000 children were starved to death and 12,000 murdered outright in the notorious Jasenovac concentration camp, which was run by a Franciscan monk, Father Filipovic (often referred to as "Brother Satan"). They don't tell you that on the history channel. Many children were kidnapped and given to Croatian families to be raised Roman Catholic; many children also disappeared and are unaccounted for to the present day. Note; This has nothing to do with the German army or National Socialists.
            </p>
            <p>
             That Franciscan monk was hung as a war criminal in 1946, after having been earlier convicted. Here's just one of the things he did  when he was a teacher (from his Wikipedia page): recalled that when Filipović and some Ustaše entered her classroom, the children looked on with curiosity but no fear. Šunjić was ordered to separate the Orthodox children from the Catholic ones. Filipović took a child, Vasilija Glamočanin, and "slaughtered her with a knife" in front of the class. He urged the Ustaša troops who accompanied him to deal similarly with the other children and assured them that he would take the sin upon himself. Victor Novak had attributed a similar account to Martinović in Magnum crimen, with grotesque details: “As each child passed, an Ustaša would gouge out an eye and push it into the child's slit belly” etc."

             Perhaps Brother Satan was a poofter as well, "In one of the first published memoirs about life and death in the Jasenovac complex, a Croatian medical doctor and academic, Dr Nikola Nikolić, who had been imprisoned in Camp III, described his first meeting with Filipović: “His voice had an almost feminine quality which was at odds with his physical stature and coarse face”.

             The Roman Catholic Church never defrocked or excommunicated this guy.

             In a footnote of history: 'Mein Kampf' was never put on the Roman Catholic Index of Forbidden Books, but Galileo's, Kepler's, and Kant's works were on the Index until 1966 when the Index itself was abolished. About the Index itself:

            The Roman Catholic Church did not exist before 1054. You are either ignorant or misinformed. The Church Fathers, The Nicean Creed, the Seven ecumenical councils, are all of the original, unbroken church. When the bishop of Rome decided he wanted to have authority over all of Christendom and when he changed the only Creed of the Christian Church which was codified at the council of Nicea, and appoint himself head of the church, he excommunicated all other Christians, including The entire Orthodox Christian Church, the Copts, etc. He removed himself from truth entirely.
The Protestants (who are still "protesting" the heresy of the Roman Catholic Church) are even further from the truth, with no creed, invented dogmas, and they rely entirely on the ignorance of people about the True Church. The bible the "evangelicals" use--the Scofield Bible-- is a creation of a convicted forger who was paid by the Rothschilds to insert "notes" extolling the importance of their plan as outlined in the Balfour declaration of September 11th, 1917. 
 The "mass" is an adulterated, truncated version of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. It is far from what the true church has used for nearly tow thousand years. The head of the Orthodox Church is Christ, not some pedo warlord, in an unbroken apostolic succession since Pentecost in 33 AD. 
Here is a chart which will make this easier to understand:

               Sorry. "Reformed" churches trace their origins to the Reformation. The only decent ones left nowadays are in Holland and Scotland, plus their "satellite" congregations scattered here and there across the world. Trump's mom attended a reformed church in Scotland, the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which goes back several hundred years. The "WFC" is the Westminster Confession of Faith, it is the creed, or "confession," of most of the reformed churches. These are the only churches that are still relatively sound.

                Thanks for the explanation; I appreciate it. It is difficult to keep up with the thousands (more than 2500 in the US alone) of Protestant denominations.
So, to answer you, now that I know what you mean, no, I am not invovled with either "reformed" or WCF.

              The New King James version is closest to the original Koine Greek of the New testament and the Greek of the Septuagint for English speakers today. There is an Orthodox Study Bible, available from many sources, even Amazon.
More info:
The Orthodox Study Bible uses the New King James Version of the Bible as the basis for a fresh translation of the Septuagint text. The Septuagint is the Greek version of the Bible
              <strong>
               used by Christ, the Apostles, and the early church.
              </strong>
              The new Orthodox Study Bible contains the entire Old Testament of the Orthodox Church, including the "Deuterocanonical" books. Based on the New King James Version, it offers a fresh translation from the Greek text of the Septuagint.
The Orthodox Study Bible includes:
    New Testament from the New King James Version
              <strong>
               Commentary drawn from the early Church Christians
              </strong>
              Easy-to-Locate liturgical readings
    Book Introductions and Outlines
    Subject Index
    Full-color Icons
    Full-color Maps
Additionally, the most recent edition (released in 2008) contains a number of improvements over the original edition:
    The Psalms have been re-translated from the Septuagint.
    The notes for the Psalms have been greatly expanded.
    The NT notes have been revised slightly.
    The liturgical notes at the top of the New Testament pages have been expanded and placed into their own section at the foot of the page.
    The index to the notes at the back, as well as the glossary, have been expanded.
    New study articles have been added to the back of the Bible.

                 They were holy. Not sinless, but exemplary in "experimental religion." And intellectual giants. We'll never see the likes of them again.

                   Which translation are you talking about? Sorry, it gets confusing on here. I prefer the original KJV simply because the men were giants spiritually, and they would render a better (more spiritual) translation.

                       Exactly. You should look into the puritans and all their commentaries and books. They had the truth. I follow this church, it's hundreds of years old, was Trump's mom's church. I've been over there to his old home island and to one of their churches.

                         No, but I think he's "not far from the kingdom of heaven."  Mark 12:34  This is why I supported him, his family (mom) is from a very strict old school church, and that's never really left him ... and I watched as he became more and more "religious" and more humble during the campaign. I pray that he will become converted. What an amazing thing it would be.

                           666 signs and symbolism aren't to be feared as much as being "dead in trespasses and sins," which Trump apparently still is at this time.

            I understand. 
I have seen the damage that pedo priests have done. Their victims suffer incredibly, and what is worse, they loose their faith which otherwise could console them. One man told me that he was afraid to say anything because the priest told him he "deserved it" and his "parents would learn how evil he was and abandon him"--at age six. He could never have a close relationship with anyone. 
People are turned away from the church by pedos and corruption, but propaganda has ensured that most western people are unaware there is an unchanged, true church, so they drift into heresy or atheism.
There was another documentary about Crimen Solicitationis, but it is no longer available anywhere. It showed how the RCC preyed upon the very poor and ignorant in Brazil, Africa, and other such places and got away with it. If anyone finds it, I hope they post it.

            Thank you for a great post.  I have hated Ratzinger for years.  I hate his red shoes and what he did to Fiona Barnett and the other victims.  I hate him for all the years in Germany when he looked the other way and allowed so many priests to abuse and abuse and abuse.  But I mostly hate that he is now living in the lap of luxury and locked away in a fortress that we cannot enter.  I hope this whole mess of PG comes crashing down on all of them.  Especially Ratzinger and Bergoglio.

              Here we go again?  Blaming the victim for the crime.  We were lied to for decades, even centuries about religion and so I will not accept blame.  They will pointing fingers at us to take suspicion from themselves.  No more.  I have hope because people are getting disenchanted with religion and leaving. I had given up and almost stopped my prayers, but now I pray again and believe, but the structure of the church in it's present state, it is a lie.   If this whole thing blows up, I think there is hope for a change and a new beginning.  It is time.

              Francis and Ratrzinger are criminal hypocrites, yes.  I hope you are right.  Since we have not been there, we don't know what will happen,  My friend believes in re incarnation and that reap what you sow.  That would be good too.  Whatever, I hope they get theirs, big time.

                That is what I am hearing.  I hope the "roads to rome" " are "burned down"  and can never be traveled again.  I hope they burn all the way to the fortress that houses Ratzinger.  He is a prisoner there and able to avoid the punishment that should befall him for all the horrible abuse by priests and all the heinous acts that he committed on his "hunting trips".  It must all come to an end.

              I think it has something to do with sacrifice.  Blood.  I don't remember if it was ever found yet, but all the Pedophile Elite wear them. Maybe someone knows?  Tony P,  Ratzinger, Alex Soros, and I think there was a picture once on here with a group of them wearing the red shoes.  Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz wore them in the movie, but in the book she had yellow or gold shoes.  There is something about the red shoes they just love.  With their sick minds, I am sure it is not a kind gesture.

              I don't think he looked the other way because he wanted to just cover what the priests did, I believe he actually believed they had the right to have sex with children.  He is a sick and evil man down to his bones.  It is not bad enough for Germany to have Hitler, they also have the Killer and Defiler of Children, Ratzinger.

             Of course they will. In earlier times there was no way people could find out what theywere really up to.

             In the middle ages, most westerners, even kings, were completely illiterate, but the RC clergy was not, nor was a certain other (((group))). Imagine, in 1054 AD, they decide to make war for the purpose of theft, murder and human trafficking, so they divorce themselves from the true church and turn their church/religion into a country led by a warlord. Yes, a country with an absolute ruler. They changed canon law, added fake dogma. They sold "get out of hell free" indulgences to king and peasant alike, and launched the crusades against the Christians of the east. They raised armies by promising them salvation, as if they have any control over that. In the Holy Land, they slaughtered Christian and Muslim men, women and children, captured slaves, desecrated churches, and absconded with all the treasure. They even stopped along the route to torture monks and steal what they could from the Eastern Orthodox monasteries. Now that people can read and have access to many sources of information, no one can believe this crap, so you get RC apologists who sincerely have faith, but then say stuff like, "I don't like this Pope or anything since Vatican II; I am a traditional RC. To them I say, take a look at ecclesiology and where things went wrong for the west for last thousand years. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Most RCs have no idea about their own church(though they might look askance at the burning at the stake of so many people for hundreds of years),  and how it came about or that there have been at least 150 Jewish Popes since 1054. And what church has it's own central bank? It's a political, temporal organization, and the ones at the top are well aware of this.

               I have no idea. But, about the document, they may not have always known, but they must know by now, don't you think?
Also "lay clergy" is a bit of an oxymoron, don't you think?
