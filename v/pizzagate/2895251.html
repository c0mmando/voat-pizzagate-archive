For me, I was a fan of her work when I was a kid, so this case is personal.</p>

<p>I’m noticing some signs of bot activity regarding this subject matter. Look at the tweets, then the profiles. You’ll notice a formula in these tweets, making it highly likely these are not humans. Meaning that this could be part of a suppression campaign by Twitter. </p>
<p>I’m noticing its far more common in regards to Judith Barsi than with Heather O’Rourke. Question being why? The O’Rourke case is more heinous, both implicate Spielberg. Could this because the cover up in the Barsi case is more damning? The effects of opening people’s eyes to the Barsi case much more dangerous to Pedowood? More high level people implicated in Barsi case?</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2893974">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2893974</a> A thread regarding Twitter actively protecting pedophiles. Guess we have a motive for Twitter using bots to suppress Pedowood related info now don’t we. Which brings me to this...</p>

<h2>🚨🚨 We need meme makers to read that thread. We need memes and infographs made and SPREAD! No longer having a coordinated date! Just carpet bomb Twitter, Gab, etc with memes regarding this case. This is the case that can become the killshot that wakes up the masses to Pedowood once and for all. The lack of memes and infographs about this case is the BIG reason there’s less awareness about it compared to the O’Rourke case.🚨🚨</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/06/15/why-cant-revolvers-be-suppressed-or-can-they/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2016/06/15/why-cant-revolvers-be-suppressed-or-can-they/amp/</a> Point of these links is that it’s extremely difficult to silence a revolver due to the cylinder gap. This means that if a revolver was the murder weapon, it would have been impossible without anyone in that neighborhood noticing it. Therefore, the murder weapon was actually a pistol. Since a revolver was at the scene of the crime, this weapon is a distraction and part of the lie.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-agents-for-the-biggest-actors-and-directors-in-Hollywood">https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-agents-for-the-biggest-actors-and-directors-in-Hollywood</a>  What do a lot of Hollywood luciferians and Pedowood suspects have in common? A certain few talent agencies. UTA also works for Johnny Depp. Creative Artists Agency works with Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Cruise, Nichole Kidman, Ashton Kutcher, Demi Moore, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Jimmy Fallon, Madonna, Sean Penn, Jim Carrey, Tom Hanks, and Jared Leto. ICM works for Michael Caine. WME has worked with Steven Spieberg, Conan O’Brien.</p>
<p>Working Theory:
-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith\'s mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao
-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Michael Caine (note: the incident mentioned in the “Blame It On Rio” CDAN Blind with that underaged girl makes him a suspect in this incident), Joseph Sargent. Witness: Lorraine Gary. Accomplice: Adria Later, Judith’s mother</p>
<p>-The Murder:</p>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg (orders), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was beloved by the country as a whole). She would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of lose ends to cover pedowood\'s tracks had a part in the motive.</p>
<p>Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a hysterical breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (25 year talent agent) warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2647662">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2647662</a> A post about Grand Climax.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match &quot;Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. What this basically is is that it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up. Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the claim of a death date of 7/25-7/26 (based on the lie told by Ruth Hansen) is wrong, for the smell would have been obvious at this point. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.findadeath.com/directory/b/Judith_Barsi/index.htmlThe">https://www.findadeath.com/directory/b/Judith_Barsi/index.htmlThe</a> October update mentions the “pile of bodies”.</p>

At fifty feet away, the scent of a corpse is enough to make people hurl. With the other evidence in part 6, nightime of 7/25 (includes AM of 7/26) can be ruled out.</p>

<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death? I suspect Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.</p>',

           I’m noticing some signs of bot activity regarding this subject matter. Look at the tweets, then the profiles. You’ll notice a formula in these tweets, making it highly likely these are not humans. Meaning that this could be part of a suppression campaign by Twitter.
          </p>
          <p>
           I’m noticing its far more common in regards to Judith Barsi than with Heather O’Rourke. Question being why? The O’Rourke case is more heinous, both implicate Spielberg. Could this because the cover up in the Barsi case is more damning? The effects of opening people’s eyes to the Barsi case much more dangerous to Pedowood? More high level people implicated in Barsi case?

           Point of these links is that it’s extremely difficult to silence a revolver due to the cylinder gap. This means that if a revolver was the murder weapon, it would have been impossible without anyone in that neighborhood noticing it. Therefore, the murder weapon was actually a pistol. Since a revolver was at the scene of the crime, this weapon is a distraction and part of the lie.

           What do a lot of Hollywood luciferians and Pedowood suspects have in common? A certain few talent agencies. UTA also works for Johnny Depp. Creative Artists Agency works with Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Cruise, Nichole Kidman, Ashton Kutcher, Demi Moore, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Jimmy Fallon, Madonna, Sean Penn, Jim Carrey, Tom Hanks, and Jared Leto. ICM works for Michael Caine. WME has worked with Steven Spieberg, Conan O’Brien.
          </p>
          <p>
           Working Theory:
-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith's mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao
-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Michael Caine (note: the incident mentioned in the “Blame It On Rio” CDAN Blind with that underaged girl makes him a suspect in this incident), Joseph Sargent. Witness: Lorraine Gary. Accomplice: Adria Later, Judith’s mother
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder:
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects: Steven Spielberg (orders), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was beloved by the country as a whole). She would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of lose ends to cover pedowood's tracks had a part in the motive.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen, Jack Dorsey.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a hysterical breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (25 year talent agent) warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down.

           A post about Grand Climax.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match "Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". What this basically is is that it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up. Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the claim of a death date of 7/25-7/26 (based on the lie told by Ruth Hansen) is wrong, for the smell would have been obvious at this point.

           Note #4. At fifty feet away, the scent of a corpse is enough to make people hurl. With the other evidence in part 6, nightime of 7/25 (includes AM of 7/26) can be ruled out.

           Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death? I suspect Spielberg found out about that attempted protective migration (which means Judith would have told if she got older) and had to wrap up some loose ends.

            I know you can do some basic meming from certain trolling images. Could use your help with something. The images in the linked memewar thread just need text (sample text already suggested) added to them. Then I can REALLY go to town exposing this case to the public.

             🚨🚨 We need meme makers to read that thread. We need memes and infographs made and SPREAD! No longer having a coordinated date! Just carpet bomb Twitter, Gab, etc with memes regarding this case. This is the case that can become the killshot that wakes up the masses to Pedowood once and for all. The lack of memes and infographs about this case is the BIG reason there’s less awareness about it compared to the O’Rourke case.🚨🚨
