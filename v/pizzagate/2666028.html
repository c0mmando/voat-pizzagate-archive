            The question is:  What was done to the newborn during the five days away from its mother?
           </p>
           <p>
            Newborns are constantly being abducted under false pretenses, held for a short time and then returned after no parental wrongdoing is found.  It's a pattern.  A lot can happen to a helpless baby in a few days.

            I have 2 younger siblings that this has happened to. When my younger brother was born my Mom and her man at the time tested dirty for drugs, CPS came and took him away. A year later my sister was born, and CPS came and took her away too. The thing about my sister is that my Mom was clean, her drug tests came back negative, we have all the paperwork from the hospital, but CPS lied in order to take my baby sister away. Mind you this was in Texas. They put her in a home in a weird military town called Clarksville, Tennessee. My mom and her man lawyered up and began fighting the case to get my sister back. It took them 6 years to do it, and it was a very expensive process with lawyers, hotels, driving to and from Tennessee. Here is where it gets really fishy. As soon as my Mom began fighting her case, the CPS case worker from Texas who illegally took my sister in the first place, immediately quit and moved to Oklahoma. During my sisters time in the foster home, she was sexually abused repeatedly since as far as she can remember by both the woman and the man. She finally got to come live with my Mom and her Dad 3 months ago, court granted them custody, but nobody knew about the abuse yet. When she arrived she displayed  a lot of behavioral issues, at first she would throw tantrums as if she was terrified, would always suck her thumb, and had big compulsive problem with lying. Now it wasn't until one day after church 1 month ago, we went out for lunch at a restaurant, where we caught her on a lot of pointless lies (small things like me giving her to try something new to try, asked her if she likes it and tells me yes when she obviously didn't because shes afraid of displeasing me with her answer, which I wouldn't have) so I had a serious talk with her about lying, told her the story of The Little Boy who Cried Wolf, and how nobody will ever take her seriously if she kept lying, and that God and my Mom would always know when she was, so it's always better just to be honest. When we came home she came clean and told us about the abuse in very disturbing details. How her foster parents (Nikki and Elmer Romero) would play with her "peepee", rubbing it and sticking their fingers in there, she visually showed us with her arms, thrusting movements. How Elmer would go to her room and wake her up in the middle of the night. Or Nikki would invite her to her room and they would have a 3way, how Nikki would make her suck on her vagina, or how Elmer would try to penetrate her from both holes, how Nikki would drop her off for "sleepovers" at an older single gay man's home. She even mentioned that they would get her naked, throw her in a cold shower, take her out immediately drenched and naked and take her outside where the cars are and fondle her while she was wet and terrified (a method to disassociate the child?) [Im getting physically ill typing and thinking of those things]
We immediately made a police report, CPS became involved and here is where things got fishy again. After they interviewed my sister, the detectives said they didn't believe her, and that her allegations where rehearsed, by us. So after the court date they ordered her in the State's custody and was fixing to be put back in a foster home. My mom took her child and fled to Mexico without telling anyone. There is something terribly wrong with the System! I am infuriated with this whole situation and l honestly think the Judicial system isn't built to help us. The only thing I can do is let other people know our story.

             OMG. Unfuckingbelievable. I’m so sorry this happened to your family. Your poor little sister. Why don’t you get in touch with the Honey Bee who exposes CPS and this exact bullshit they do. Your sister needs intense therapy now from her trauma. I would think she has been disssociated. These two individuals are SICK and should not be foster parents. I wish I could help you I feel sick about this....

              Any help we can get to expose these people would be greatly appreciated. As of now, the system has failed us, tore our family apart. Now we're just waiting for an investigation to get started on us because I'm sure the State will view what my mom did as kidnapping, and us with conspiracy... I'm afraid to speak out. All we are trying to do is look out for her and keep her safe, she is only 6, but the system will try to make us out as criminals. I'm just glad she's out of harm's way, she deserves a happy healthy childhood, she's such a sweet kid.
Horrible, horrible human beings, makes me sick to my stomach.

            "It takes a village, to raise a child."
           </p>
           <p>
            Sounds good in theory. Learn who runs the village and who they want raising your child. Then it gets strange.
What kind of village are these people trying to build? One where gender is fluid? Where government is your god?
Where you must consume, conform, and obey, or your life is useless to the government? A village where parental rights
only exist in your mind? Where the government expects you to meet criteria set by their "trained" employees' or your child
becomes a bargaining chip? A village where children's rights to their body are exploited into allowing them  sexual consent under the guise of "legal"?(Not teens, but actual prepubescent children.)

            CPS has proven to be the number one global trafficker of children.

            So the laws regarding these things vary by state and jurisdiction. Where I live if a woman presents to the hospital to deliver and has had no prenatal care or very limited prenatal care it triggers the hospital to drug test her. If she tests positive a report is made to CPS. A positive drug test alone is not enough to remove a baby from its mother, however if it turns out through an investigation that there are other risk factors then a warrant will be sought to remove the baby from the mother.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm assuming due to the outcome in the op article, there were no other risk factors and they were somehow able to tell her story was legit. It's scary to think that could happen, but infants are the most vulnerable and most at risk when parents are drug addicts. It's just shitty all the way around.

             Agreed, i know one mother whose child was removed due to Crystal meth exposure , but cps worked with the family toward reunifying after mom got treatment, and the child ended up back with her.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do know one mom who was investigated by cps after she gave birth and also tested for marijuana, due to her having a past cps case for child abuse. The baby was not taken.

              Thank you for all that input! Of course the system has a ton of flaws and corruption, every system does. Add on top of that it's a system that deals with children and it should be expected tha tpeople with ill intentions will be drawn there to exploit it. However with that being said the sad reality is there are a lot of parents who do awful things to their own children. We see that through investigating pedophilic families. That has to be something in place to protect children when their own families either can't or won't do it for them. im motmsure what the answers are to fit this, but there has to be something.

            I have felt that they are allowing the legalization of marijuana for this very purpose.  Those states that do not allow, well, imagine if you are dumb enough to smoke before you deliver.
