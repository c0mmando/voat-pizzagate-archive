              Maybe simply because, even though it is indeed capitalizing on pizzagate (I assume this happened after pizzagate broke?), it is small potatoes comparatively, and also getting drowned out by all the other stuff.
             </p>
             <p>
              And many are 'capitalizing' on it now, either rubbing it in or for sensational or monetary reasons or both ... if there wasn't so much going on people would be commenting. I can never figure out who downvotes what, and for what. Sorry, someone else could give you a better answer.
