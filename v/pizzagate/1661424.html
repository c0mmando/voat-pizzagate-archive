<p>milo was abused himself as a child. he\'s not a pedo, never abused any child, his articles caused the arrest of pedophiles, and maybe he\'s gay and confused and has a seriously dark humor, but fuck that shilling that was turned against him! milo also knows of the inner pedo workings of hollywood... <a href="https://www.facebook.com/myiannopoulos/posts/851263248344905">https://www.facebook.com/myiannopoulos/posts/851263248344905</a> + <a href="https://www.facebook.com/myiannopoulos/posts/851826321621931">https://www.facebook.com/myiannopoulos/posts/851826321621931</a></p>
<p>trump was cleared of any relation to esptein\'s wrong-doings by investigators of the case wayyyyyyyyyy before trump announced for presidency.</p>
<p>The milo audios suddenly SURFACED - meaning someone inside the GOP (milo was gonna talk at CPAC and establishment hated it) invested lots of money in scanning all his articles and radio shows to find something against him - you don\'t find it odd in regards to timing and everything that is happening now?? <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/19/video-surfaces-of-milo-yiannopoulos-defending-pedophilia-acu-board-reportedly-not-consulted-on-cpac-invite/">http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/02/19/video-surfaces-of-milo-yiannopoulos-defending-pedophilia-acu-board-reportedly-not-consulted-on-cpac-invite/</a></p>
<p><strong>My guess - whatever comey briefed those senators in private the other day, or whatever is cooking at the DOJ - is going to roll out soon!!!</strong></p>
<p>this is not about left or right, you misinformed concerned trolls out here, this is about deep-state pedos trying to ruin the new movement that aims to finally clean house!!</p>
<p><strong>Please do not fall to divide &amp; conquer strategies orchestrated by those in shady power! voat is an important community - stay vigilant so those with real good intentions that are now in office (we havn\'t had this oppoortunity since maybe JFK) can keep their support and attack the real evils of this earth! trump\'s admin doesn\'t have to go against deep-state pedos, much easier for him not to, but he wants to for the sake of us people - and only if we show him we wish for it!</strong></p>
<p>Let\'s use this window opened by the dishonest MSM to push pedogate more into public attention - just like trump\'s remarks on sweden made everyone talk about sweden, and this opened the door for awareness over all the refugee crimes happening there.</p>

            Idk why you trump DNA think he's on our side.  Pizagate is non partisan.  It runs across party lines because it is not political.  It is an attempt to have life extensions by the rich, or organ harvesting.

            If you listen to what milo said it is cringe worthy mostly because of how the left is going to use it. He was defending cross generational consensual sexual relationships which can't be entirely discounted as a point of view.  The problem is the left thinks that this is what "we" are fighting against.  It's not.  We are bringing awareness to a global ring of child rape, torture, slavery, and murder.       IF ... the only thing these elite were guilty of was consensual sex with a sexually developed minor that they met and fell in love with, personally I would still distrust them and think they missed out on some basic maturing in thier life but I wouldn't be crusading to have thier heads put on a spike.     We know it is far worse than that and to put milo in the same ball park is insane.   Unfortunately this is going to be very difficult to distinguish because the average blue pill citizen doesn't believe that mass child torture and murder is even happening.  They think people like Bill Clinton and the like have , at worst, slept with some 17 year old hottie prostitute.     Again If that was the worst of it I would still disrespect them but I wouldn't outright fear them as the monsters they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            My point is two fold....
           </p>
           <p>
            1.) they are using this as a way of discrediting Milo so the general public won't take him so seriously. 
2.) they are going to use this exact argument he made to defend the public opinion of any high profile individual that is convicted of child abuse.   They have already done it wil Anthony Weiner.  "He's not so bad... it's not like he was fucking babies he was just sexting with a minor"
           </p>
           <p>
            Damn this is going to get ugly.  I'm starting to think that even if we get some of the convictions we want the general public still won't have their eyes open. They will think "so a few big names got caught going for some young women... is it that big of a deal?"
           </p>
           <p>
            I really don't know what we can do about it.  We have gotten to a point where the only people that will be able to tell fact from fiction are the ones who have been following these stories the whole time.
           </p>
           <p>
            So many levels of deception.  I guess just be glad you took the red pill when you did because it's going to be harder to come by.

            Trump and Milo are of the Establishment, this I believe is certain.  Therefore this is a strategy of role reversal, oppressor becomes the oppressed, vice versa.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Illuminati Jews who run the entire show have exploited this stratagem for centuries and most ostensibly through their engineering of anti-Semitism which has become weaponised to shut down anyone who is antithetical to their ideology.  This was also the method employed to guilt the entire World for decades into not liberating the WW2 Jews in time.  As the sacrificial lamb, the ordinary Jew paid with their life during the war so that the Illuminati Cabal could foment their agenda for global domination and hide with impunity to commit further crimes behind the existential guilt that the World thought it ought to shoulder.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not to blame the Jews as a people as the majority aren't aware of the situation but the likes of Milo and Breitbart will certainly know of and support the Zionist agenda and the Kabbalistic, Talmudic doctrine that states goyim are subhuman and their children essentially commodities to be exploited in the worst ways imaginable.

            Gotta love the implosion it's causing here. What next, Trump attacking Russia? Oh wait he did that already over Crimea. It's like every circlejerk voat had, from ageism to wall-building is going down.

            I have to admit I am confused.  is Remdy4Reality a shill?   I just thought he made a good argument for Milo being a spokesperson for taking over the narrative, much the same way everyone has attacked Kutcher.
           </p>
           <p>
            But when I read Milo's facebook post, it has a ring of truth too.
            <br/>
            Anyone else feel like I do?   Voat seems definitey split in two about this.  Wait and see I guess.

            Now that Trump is denouncing the media, the media's counterattack is to tell some truth.  Then he can't discredit them for that stuff, then they'll  throw in a great big lie.

             Nah, Obongo flew $65K worth of hotdogs from chicago to the WH that forbids eating anything not prepared on site and provided by their own secret food providing channels but I'm sure he isnt involved. Hey after all we dont know what these hotdogs actually were.

            Debunked when and by who? We don't know what type of activities Trump did with Epstein and what he knew about him before he was caught being a filthy pedophile but we do know that this is what Trump had to say about Epstein back in 2002, "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
           </p>
           <p>
            Also why is Trump getting credit for what the police and the investigators have done to catch those pedophiles? Investigations and gathering enough evidence to make arrests takes time, they are not done in a month or so. Trump just happen to be in office at this time.. 
Yes i am still waiting for the big arrests, everyone keep saying they're coming soon but so far nothing.. I am also waiting for Trumps special prosecutor that he will pin on Hilary...

            Epstein had 14 different numbers for Trump and his associates when they raided his phone book.

           <p>
            'And when FBI investigators looked through Epstein’s private address book, they found 14 different phone numbers for Trump, including numbers for his security guard and houseman. Epstein also had numbers for Trump’s daughter Ivanka and his ex-wife Ivana.'

            And agreed that's a great thing that they arrested so many human traffickers, but it is NOT drastically more than usual to ICE.

            2016 had 2000 from I.C.E.

            An investigator is suppose to look into all possibilities with no bias right? So why is anyone who presents information and/or connections that goes against the popular pizzagate narrative that ''Trump will save everyone'' gets called a shill? Trump did have connection to Epstein, that is not fake, it's there and should not be glossed over. His pick for labour secretary should also raise some eyebrows for everyone here.  He could very well be implicated in Pizzagate as well, that is a possibility and anyone pointing out that possibility should not be called a shill just because it goes against the Trump narrative here.

              I don't believe you've called it right one bit. Sure, you've helped undermine Trump but all you've done is shoot yourself in the foot for, correct me if I'm wrong, it's thanks to the Zionist controlled media, the Zionist controlled intelligence agencies, the Zionist controlled Congress &amp; Senate, unimaginable pressure has been heaped on Trump. It couldn't be more obvious Trump isn't part of the establishment but you're mind was so made up you couldn't get away from thinking any different. Quite why I don't know but for some inexplicable reason you refuse to accept that Trump wanted to implement policies the Zionists &amp; Globalists oppose - in other words ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT. Why do you think they so oppose him? And don't say it's some sort of daft double-bluff because then I will really unload...... Instead of people throwing their weight behind him, as they ordinarily do after a democratic election, Trump has literally been shoved onto the back foot, all thanks to the Rothschild Zionists &amp; detractors like you. As a result, Netanyahu has now been able to coerce Trump by saying 'if you don't do what we say we will destroy you'. Can't you see that those creating untold grief for Trump are the very people you despise?"

              Yes Trump opposes the zionist which is why he was at AIPAC licking jews ass as much as he could, which is why he has been personal friends with Netanyahu way before his presidential campaign, which is why he's continueing the zionist neo-con plan of ''New American Century'' by heavily focusing on Iran now(no need to focus on Syria anymore because Syria is now a weakened divided country, a failed state), which is also why his recent press conference with Netanyahu, Trump basically said that Israel can do whatever the fuck it wants when it comes to ''peace deals'' with the Palestinians, also Trump is surrounded and has surrounded himself with jews and zionist.. 
Just because the media attacks him does not change that fact, also there is alot of things that trump has not only said but has also done so far that is worthy of criticism.. Look at his actions so far, tell me, how is he anti-establishment? But i'm sure you got excuses for every point i laid out there.

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Q. How does Russia fit into all this?
               </p>
               <p>
                A.  The CIA and Israel are responsible for the creation of Isis. Isis was created specifically to weaken Iran and destabilize Syria. It worked for awhile until Putin shored up Assad and bolstered Iranian Qud forces. The real reason you see such anti-Russian fever from both Schumer and McCain, Graham and Feinstein, is because the operation has blown up in our faces.
               </p>
               <p>
                Q. Is Israel behind the anti Russian sentiment?
               </p>
               <p>
                A. Yes. Israeli intelligence is furious with Trump, and will do anything to keep Trump from working with Putin.  Understand that if Trump and Putin work together to defeat Isis, they are actually defeating a CIA/Mossad creation, and furthermore, Syria and Iran grow stronger, which the Saudis and the Israeli’s fear. Their goal was to divide Syria and ultimately destroy Iran’s regime. It is not just an oil grab, but a much bigger attempt at moving the chess pieces to allow Israel and Saudi Arabia to dominate the entire Middle East.
               </p>
               <p>
                Q. So they demonize Putin and try to tarnish the Trump administration?
A. The Deep State is at war with both Trump and Putin. Understand that when Israeli intelligence hears “America first” from Trump, they go apeshit. Israel has bribed, extorted and intimidated our politicians for decades and suddenly this upstart billionaire threatens to ruin everything.
               </p>
               <p>
                Q. You mention the word extort. Does that relate to Pizzagate?
A. PedoGate is only a modern term associated with a long history of Pedo-blackmail connected to both Israel and the Intel community. There is a full court press to stop PedoGate from being looked at because if people knew the true motives behind the pedophilia epidemic, they would do more than march on Washington. They could actually seed a revolution, with the spark coming from decent American parents who want to protect their kids. Our politicians are compromised. The senior analyst nicknamed “FBI Anon” alluded to this in his exchange with folks on 4chan and with you.
               </p>
               <p>
                Q. What do you mean compromised?
               </p>
               <p>
                A. Do you notice 2 central themes running through the MSM lately?  Those themes are “Fear the Russians” and “#PizzaGate is fake news“.  Both tropes come from the same place.
               </p>
               <p>
                Q. Can you explain?
               </p>
               <p>
                A. How do we exert power?  Via fear. Do you ever wonder why both Democrats and Republicans fall all over themselves to kiss up to Israel? Odd, since Israel is the size of Rhode Island… The fact is, many of our politicians – on both sides – have been compromised by CIA and Mossad for years. It’s actually not admiration they are expressing for Israel, but fear. Notice Lindsay Graham and Chuck Schumer repeating the same salute when it comes to Israel. How does that even happen? The American people are finally seeing that there is no two-party system, but one big shadow Government pretending we have political dichotomy.

                Q.  So PedoGate is real and “they” have to get Americans to disbelieve it?
A. Let me explain how threatening PedoGate is… Who wins? Trump. Putin. Americans. Russians. The world…. Who loses? Israel, since they no longer can blackmail our politicians, the same goes for the CIA. The Shadow Government loses. But, the people win.

               I despise "Jews did it" people, mostly because they are racists and believe they are not. Two: they are illogical and "fruit loopers" [alwyas looping back to the same bullshit] and Three: Most have never met a Jew, known any, or had any friends who were Jewish.. i.e. Know zero about actual living, practicing Jews..

               The baby - eaters are not really Jews, and include the Vatican and royals who claim to be Protestant Christian. The perps are likely an ancient religion cult and there are break-out leaders in the Muslim, Christian and Jewish - and likely even Hindu and or Voodoo faiths.

               Notice Abramovitch [obviously a Jewish name !] with a cross around her neck, pretending to be Christian or something. And with a Great - Uncle who was a patriarch in the Eastern Christian Church [equivalent to Pope].

                Sure, you've helped undermine Trump but all you've done is shoot yourself in the foot for, correct me if I'm wrong, it's thanks to the Zionist controlled media, the Zionist controlled intelligence agencies, the Zionist controlled Congress &amp; Senate, unimaginable pressure has been heaped on Trump.
               </p>
               <p>
                It couldn't be more obvious Trump isn't part of the establishment but you're mind was so made up you couldn't get away from thinking any different.
               </p>
               <p>
                Quite why I don't know but for some inexplicable reason you refuse to accept that Trump wanted to implement policies the Zionists &amp; Globalists oppose - in other words ALL THE THINGS YOU WANT.
               </p>
               <p>
                Why do you think they so oppose him? And don't say it's some sort of daft double-bluff because then I will really unload......
               </p>
               <p>
                Instead of people throwing their weight behind him, as they ordinarily do after a democratic election, Trump has literally been shoved onto the back foot, all thanks to the Rothschild Zionists &amp; detractors like you.
               </p>
               <p>
                As a result, Netanyahu has now been able to coerce Trump by saying 'if you don't do what we say we will destroy you'. Can't you see that those creating untold grief for Trump are the very people you despise?

            Actually, you bring up a good point! He states that he is doing it in memory of all those killed by muslim terrorism and he specifically includes 9-11. Now we all in the conspiracy community know that it wasn't the muslims who did 9-11 -or at least that they weren't the most important part of the equation. That's just Milo intentionally muddying the waters. Oh yeah, while bathing in blood. You never look at what a person says. Talk is cheap. But what is he doing? Bathing in blood. And looking pretty comfortable with it.

            Stop acting like a bunch of T_D shills by making Trump &amp; Friends seem squeaky clean and perfect and making us libtarted liberals all seem like a bunch of crybaby pedos and the only ones associated with PGate.  Many of us on the left hate the limousine liberals associated with the DNC just as much as you guys, but are still progressives with our political leanings.  I also am one that cannot discount the fact that a lot of what was uncovered with PGate just seems way too fishy, despite the fact that it sounds like it all started out as a semi-joke on 4chan.

             I also was in with the Progressives.. If you are here you are way too smart to still be one, and defending them. Yes, more work was put into influencing that demographic, since they are more likely to be activists and actually do something. But , that side is 100% controlled. And as the people on the Right [and some on the Left too ]  say, "There is no moral relativism" "All are not equal"
            </p>
            <p>
             And as I was taught on my mother's knee "Some are sicker than others"
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is a report from a right - winger who infiltrated Leftist groups.
            </p>
            <p>
             "OATHKEEPERS INFLITRATING SUBVERSIVE GROUPS, THIS IS PURE GOLD
NavyJack Operation HYPO After Action Report: Infiltrating Violent Protest Organizations
            </p>
            <p>
             As many of you know, Oath Keepers initiated Operation HYPO in response to the increasingly violent protests that broke out across the country following the election. We had some members already in a position to quickly infiltrate the protest organizations that were active in support of Operation Sabot.
            </p>
            <p>
             I myself assumed an identity of an individual from another state with all of the necessary elements to ensure success of my assigned responsibilities. Working during the day, I would travel by night to meetings and protests in various cities.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most weekends were consumed with assimilating reports from other operatives, grooming equipment and planning our activities. Our entire team had immense support from Oath Keepers senior leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
             In my case, it took quite a while to become accepted into the groups that I was responsible for observing. I think a lot of this was because I am a little bit older than our other operatives.
            </p>
            <p>
             I dyed my hair and bought clothing appropriate for the assignment. By actually participating in a large number of protest activities, I was eventually recruited into a series of organizations with increasing levels of responsibility. It took a month of steady involvement before any of the really hard-core group leaders would even talk to me.
            </p>
            <p>
             My military and post-active duty DoD experience was extremely valuable. I learned to behave as they behave and to trigger on appropriate issues. I also learned that the brain-washing that moves people into these organizations is mostly external to the organizations themselves. The people joining are brain-washed by numerous sources before they even participate in their first protest or direct action. The MSM, our colleges and universities, social media and leftist alternative news organizations are the primary sources of the initial brain-washing that is taking place. The radicalization process is unique to each person, but generally follows a pattern of being very rapid for those with little or no responsibilities in their daily life to long and laborious for those with a real life outside of the movement. Young, under-employed single white males are the vanguard of these movements.
In order to gain trust, we found that the best thing to do was to be aloof and skeptical with regard to the plans and activities of the groups and to be independent and outspoken when plans were being discussed in our presence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of the details associated with â€œdirect actions were not discussed with anyone other than the group of individuals assigned to carry out the specific task. In the groups that I was assigned to penetrate, there were plenty of blowhards thumping their chest about something they had done that demonstrated their skill and ability to participate or lead. Most of this was hyperbole, but the newer members would eat it up like young soldiers listening to the inflated heroics of a platoon member that had only been with the unit a month longer than them. We all know the type.
            </p>
            <p>
             While most of our operatives started and stayed with one specific group, I was unable to initially penetrate the group I was responsible for infiltrating. I had to work my way up the ladder, moving from one group to another in order to achieve my objective. In my migration from group to group, I found that political ideology was a significant factor in the determination of what types of activities the groups would sponsor; ranging from sit-ins to marches to direct action. I can broadly classify these ideologies as liberal socialists, communists and anarchists.
            </p>
            <p>
             The liberal socialists are primarily coming out of our higher education system. They are comprised of professors, students and under-employed graduates. They are primarily white with a roughly equal split between male/female. They are not militant. They are willing to conduct blockades, marches and sit-ins.
            </p>
            <p>
             The communists are a much broader spectrum of society with a strong leaning towards immigration issues. The communists actively recruit from a wide pool of candidates, including liberal socialists, the LBGT community, the environmental activists and the anti-white racist groups (Black Lives Matter, La Raza, Islamic Fundamentalists, etc.). They have a significant number of minorities in their ranks and they are militant in their operations and planning. The communists encourage independent action of their members to assimilate members from groups like Black Lives Matter, La Raza and other less militant organizations like ANSWER Coalition. They have no ethical boundaries. To communists, the ends always justify the means. They will do everything that the liberal socialist do in order to protest an issue and always take it one step further. They are not inclined to conduct direct actions.
            </p>
            <p>
             The anarchists are by far the most dangerous of these groups. They are organized like militias. They actively train and practice their operations. They have discipline and zero tolerance for weakness. They have a number of former military personnel providing expertise to enhance security, logistics and martial arts capabilities. The majority are physical fit, military age males. They are primarily white with few minority members. Their leadership tends to be either former military, a proven leader from the occupy movement or a highly educated alpha-male. They are far more capable than their recent activities would demonstrate. They have formed community defense organizations and are idolized for their willingness to take action from the other groups discussed above. They are however anarchists that despise communism as much as they despise capitalism. They see patriots and constitutionalists as their primary enemy. To them, everyone is a NAZI or a fascist unless they are an anarchist. There is no debate allowed on these issues, ever.

              This report of yours doesn't really convince me of much. Infiltrations like this can be done on many groups all over, and can be spun in many ways.

              Shit comes in all shapes colors and sizes. Labels aren't necessary, humanity just sucks balls, especially when humans are grouped together with a shared idea and an agenda.

              At the end of the day, I'm on this site mainly for this sub, because I think there's a legit concern and some truth to a worldwide pedo ring that involves rich elites.  That's the true concern to me, not political leanings.

            Those videos and this conversation has been around for a while. They have been effectively buried by mods and downvote brigades though. It does appear that there is a bit more organized muscle pushing this conversation forward in the last 24 hours and if that just happens to be the GOP in reaction to Milo speaking at CPAC, so be it. It is a necessary conversation and long overdue. This dude bathes in blood and speaks glowingly of paedophilia - how exactly is he a pizzagate hero? The disconnect boggles the mind.

            I liked a lot of things Milo said. I had never heard this video clip before. Milo does not belong at CPAC. I will never accept sexually abusing children. I don't care if he was a victim. I believe many pedophiles have probably been abuse. That doesn't excuse them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with you that the timing is suspicious. But he said it &amp; unless he disavows his own words, he should be uninvited.

            Anything that comes out of Jake Tapper I don't trust. He was one of the main people touting this story. His twitter feed was cringeworthy considering how he never cared about pedophilia and sex trafficking until now. Apparently he is friends with a sex trafficking victim. Sure. No one seems to question that.

            Ben Shapiro is a dirty fuckin POS who does not in any way rep conservatives. When you stand behind the GOPe Natl Review and that dumb twit who lied about Lewandowski, it's easy to see where your loyalty lies.

            I see Milo as an articulate queer with an intent to normalize homsexuality (and pedo "coming of age" practices) within the conservative community. Let your yea be yea and your no be no ... and rather than the conservative community degrading itself to accept the likes of Milo, Milo and others should attempt to upgrade their lifestyles. It's one thing for those with deviant tendencies to ingratiate themselves by proclaiming the benefits of conservatism and yet another when they expect conservatism to change in order to condone their deviance.
           </p>

             Christ, where are all the sane people coming from all of a sudden. Other than the pretty valid pizzagate stuff (I am a believer) I thought this place was pretty much just full of  unquestioning Trump/Breitbart/Milo worshippers and paid agents/shills. And anyone who thinks that there isn't a well oiled republican style CTR operation in effect is dreaming. With famous dirty tricksters like Roger Stone on the scene!? It's good to see people finally looking at the bigger picture. People should be sceptical that the new conservative "hero" is a giant queer caricature  and wonder what indeed is being promoted. And the big picture is not conservatives versus liberals or left versus right - it is the elites versus the rest of us. Elites who would rather have us fighting or buggering each other than forming actual alliances or productive families. The game is deep and our understanding must be deep as well. And professional button-pushers like Milo should always be considered suspect.

               Not really. These guys go to each others weddings and have a lot of the same facilitators (Epstein) in common. But there are certainly perverts to spare in order to toss something to the wolves and I think we should expect more low hanging fruit to fall. I think at best Podesta might get scratched up, but we must remember that the Podestas (as well as the Bannons and Roger Stones) of the world are of lesser importance and more expendable than the Clintons, Trumps and Bushes of the world, who, though untouchable, are in turn of less value than the true elites who have little, if no public profile at all, save royalty. No, I think this is but a skirmish/feint in a much longer, difficult slog. And anyone thinking our Pussygrabber in Chief is going to save the day, well........

            I wonder how many sexually abused kids, who was abused by someone of the same sex, later claims to be a homosexual?
           </p>
           <p>
            Not all homosexuals are pedos, but it seems many are. Now, I fear proclaimed homosexuals who are out pushing agendas, any agenda!

             I think it is just that especially sexual trauma at a younger age does a lot of damage and that young minds have trouble coping with and developing while dealing with the aftermath. From what I've read it sounds like drugs are frequently used by the abusers so add drug addiction on top of sexual trauma and that could really mess a person up. And this is the time of life when the mind is learning about gender roles and relationships, so these concepts are at risk to be twisted heavily in the victims.

             Some girls raped by men become lesbian and hate men.  Maybe it's abuse in general that proves the environment for some homosexuality.

            unfortunately this is true.  just saw video of Milo saying basically that we need to get RID of regulations about sex and that it's "good" for a young gay man to have an older man.  I will find the clip.  and yes, Trump did say he knew Epstein, and that he knew about the younger girls.  Not sure if he flew on his plane.  Look - they all have dirt.  We all have dirt, some of us, on some level.  They will find it, which is their right too.  This is war, an information war.  Good will prevail, truth will prevail, I have to believe if we keep pushing, it will.

            Hi there, I'm noone222 and just starting with this forum because I believe this pedo crap is just the tip of the psychopath iceberg. Ultimately I believe it may even lead to human organ harvesting and worse. I am grateful that so many people/researchers are determined to see these people prosecuted for their crimes. If the so-called government won't address this wickedness then it will be left up to the people to do so.

            I'm not quite sure you are getting it. The argument "some are bad, some are good" holds no merit, we can sit here showing each other good and bad people forever. It proves nothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The idea isn't that "all/some Jews are bad" or "all/some Muslims are bad". The idea is that Judaism is bad for non Jews and Islam is bad for non-Muslims. Their doctrines(seriously, read about it) culture, ideas, values etc. are not good for our people, culture, ideas, values etc. This is why many refer to doctrines(Judaism, Islam) and not people(Jews Muslims),
            <em>
             except for when they can point out a single person who in this instance happens to be Jew and indulges in questionable behavior that benefits the goals of Zionism directly
            </em>
            . I'm talking about making the left and right fight each other, not the sex stuff.

            wants to use the word "Jew" when referring to what he sees as bad/questionable behavior from a single Jew he can do that. Personally I wouldn't, but that is my business. The again that is what you would call someone who are from the chose people, a Jew.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can't separate the good from the bad, so therefore we don't want anything from them(their doctrines and ideas follow the people). If you accept them(the people) in your culture, you will get the bad side(from their belief and doctrines). This isn't abstract math where good+bad=neutral. The bad does not eliminate the good and vice versa. If you accept foreign doctrines, they will try to get influence in your society and therefore over you.
           </p>
           <p>
            What people need to ask themselves: Is Judaism is a) good for us, b) neutral for us, c) bad for us
The beauty of this question is that our opinion doesn't matter, their own
            <em>
             doctrines
            </em>
            answers this question for us. The same thing can be said about Islam
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not gonna say you are committing a fallacy, but as I said you don't get it. It's the doctrines that makes Jews/Judaism a bad influence for us non-Jews, not every single Jew. I'm sure many people disagrees with me and that's fine.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't hate Jews, but I sure as hell hate Zionism and Judaism. Same goes for Muslims and Islam. Same for Christians and Christianity(not so much as the other two, because of the doctrines).

            I'd like to add I have no problem with Milo and I think he just loves to troll the left. Teens can have sex with whomever they want as long as the are old enough(age of consent). It'still gross to some extent though if the oldie is very old.

            I can't know exactly who this is coming from or exactly where it is coming from. But i can know WHY it is coming. DIVIDE AND CONQUER.  Cui bono ?  Who benefits?  The sewer rats in DC that are about to go down benefit by every division they can create.  DON'T TAKE THE BAIT.   FOCUS ON THE REAL ISSUES.  Don't waste any time or energy chasing bait.  The best response to all this will be SILENCE.

             People want to diss Trump. I feel that is Media Propaganda. It made my year that he won over Clinton and that he's cleaned up the State Dept.! that he's pissed off the powers-that-be enthralled Mass Media to the point they are co-ordinating and putting an orange filter on all images of him . The head of the Beast is showing itself. Most of the leading articles I have seen coming out against him are from the BRITISH! They still think they own us. Who do you think the Rockefellers and Clintons bow to?

              Exactly.  They are getting no traction with the "Trump and the Russians" media campaign.  They are probing for soft spots to SPLINTER the opposition.  Who gives a rat's ass about Milo?  I've never listened to him in my life. If he turns out to be a pedo, let him go down with them. Either way, push him to the side and stay on the trail of the High Power sewer rats that are running all the worldwide networks (and our governments)!

            Also I would include the Ashton Kutcher scenario - paraphrasing, but he says 'my software THORN is working to prevent this horrible situation' after describing an "American man" in Cambodia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Welcome to have anyone verify this but I am highly skeptical his outfit has any impact on anything that happens in Cambodia.  Seems like a tremendous amount of crocodile tears there to me.

            So we're defending a guy who sings the virtues of "those relationships between younger boys and older men, the sort of coming of age relationships, the relationships in which those older men help those young boys to discover who they are, and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable and sort of a rock where they can’t speak to their parents."
           </p>
           <p>
            Did the lizard people force Milo to talk about how great "cross-generational" relationships are?

            I hope people realize how most people on this sub are in it for politics. They defend child molesters as long as the agree wit them.

            He talks about how great it is that older men help young boys discover who they are. The Milo defenders are a bunch of pedos too. You people are sick if you think it's okay for him to have sex with 13 year old boys just because he supports Trump.

            When Hillary's Goldman speeches were getting too much attention fucking Brock started in with the Berniebros bullshit and said Bernie should make his speeches transparent too. Bernie replied that he only had 1 paid speech in his whole career , it was for a nurses Union, he gave all proceeds to charity, and the speech already posted on YouTube. That was a rare case when Brock's dirty tricks didn't pay off, but it's absolutely right that projection is his preferred misdirection and sure as shit he's already scheming how to project pedo away from the real perps.

            There are 12k people on this sub. 12,000 people out of billions that understand, only after a few months, completely how the world works. We know exactly who is guilty, we know exactly what is going on. We know that the world is literally owned by a Satanic pedophile bloodline, we know what their plans are, we know who they are, we know what they've been doing and what they want to do, and the evidence for this is sitting in front of every single human being who has access to a computer and a shred of intellect and desire to understand the world, and yet here we are.
           </p>
           <p>
            We get to sit by, knowing exactly what needs to be done in order for the world to be right, and watch the exact opposite happen while everyone around us cheers, blindly supporting the people who own them, despise them and want to kill them and condemning and fantasizing the murder of the only people who have humanity's interest at heart, who are quite literally this planet's only chance at survival, because their representative said something about a woman's pussy 20 years ago.

            And Milo was prevented from talking ... remember: Milo was asked to wait to talk on pizzagate. So is he going to speak now? Absolutely, they're trying hard. Yeah, like Milo was the one that was supposed to speak out on the pedos in Hollywood. Nobody else was attending those parties ... just Milo. The question is WTH the authorities didn't speak with Milo and ask him who he was talking about? No one was interested? Really? Upvoat for you because of this post and because you get this.

              I didn't hear that at all. He was talking about the boys being very, very young and he was shocked and not approving.
             </p>
             <p>
              Can you give me the exact quote? He talked about himself, and then the subject was switched to the parties he attended.

               So the fuck what, OP isn't talking about about anyone else, he's talking about Milo and how Milo is being smeared. That's a huge fucking pile of bullshit. Milo is no hero, he's a fucking pedophile and you're OK with that? You'd rather try to derail the conversation that actually admit Milo is a pedo? Really?

             Well, is he lying then or is he lying when he sayings it's great for 13 year olds to be in relationships with older men? You know, because of all the "discovery" that goes on?

             Thank you!  That is a very definitive statement that doesn't leave anybody in any doubt.  That certainly quashes any major concerns that I might have had about Milo.  I've got a horrible feeling that Shapiro is behind this.

                So, with overwhelming evidence in front you that Milo is a pedo, you want to do what ... throw dispersions on me. Look at the fucking video, it's not deceptively edited, it's right fucking there for you to watch. You don't want to believe Milo in his own words ... that's fine, it's not like you people have any meaningful relationship with the truth anyhow:

                  Ok, so he condones pedophilia between older men and young boys. He thinks its AOK, and even praises the priest that molested him. He's a pedo apologizer. He's a pedo appreciator, he's a pedo enableer. How's that?

                   I think it's fair to call him a victim and someone that's been an underage sex apologist in the past, possibly due to being a confused victim.  He's also a Catholicism and Catholic priest apologist.

            There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for labelling Milo a pedophile. It's typical of the left the accuse their opposition of being what they truly are. It's like all the protesters calling Milo a fascist, but they are the fascists shutting down free speech. They accuse the UC Berkeley rioters of being sponsored by "Alt-right" when they are definitely sponsored by the left. They accuse him of being a neo-nazi when, in Ukraine, after the coup, they put Svoboda and Right Sector in to run the country alongside Nuland. They accuse PDT of being a womanizer when BC is a certified womanizer. They call PDT a bully and then turn around and bully Melania and Ivanka.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone with half a brain can see this pattern emerging here.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe the ppl are waking up now and looking for evidence based conclusions. NO MORE accusations can pass as fact anymore. Open source evidence. Look  at how "FAKE NEWS" backfired on the corp-media.

             yup there is a big difference between passing off one pedo act wherein one was the victiml as "not a big deal" and doing the same with one in which one was the perp. The former can be excused as a coping mechanism.

               Oh I read Milo's reply. You know why Milo's reply is bullshit? Because he redefines pedophilia so it doesn't include the children(13-14-15) that he wants to fuck. Watch the fucking video. Sure, now that he's busted and it's out in the open, he's going to deny deny deny, that doesn't change the facts or his words.
              </p>
              <p>
               So you'll believe what he writes AFTER his words comes out, but deny the words he actually spoke. Fucking amazing. You should sign up for the Olympic Mental Gymanastics, you appear to be a natural.

                 I genuinely hope for this and he may need professional help to see this and understand this. And as a side note-  there are countless others who are not famous as well as those who are famous who believe as he believes and speaks. As pedogate/pizzagate unfolds into general awareness and consciousness, it is possible we will also see friends and family come to realization they in fact themselves were also sexually abused.

            In the interview with Rogan he also mentions being at a hollywood party where he stresses some of the boys there were very young, doing drugs and sleeping with older men. Guess he wasn't outraged enough to contact police or expose the peado's there, pretty shitty attitude to have towards abuse of young boys/teens.

            Keep defending a gay jew who is trying to get white people to fight each other instead the elite who control us and who is trying to normalize sex between teens and old men. It's your conscience. I would be disgusted with myself. You seem to be proud of it.

            Why does everyone expect the swamp to be clear?  Its a dirty mess that you need to navigate for yourself by using information from everyone.  Obviously some can be trusted, some cannot.  Some only speak the truth, some like Alex Jones exaggerate and you need to find the truth in what he is saying, and others downright give disinformation and lie.  We all need to do our own research from the information we share, This is where true understanding will come from, and the truth.

            Yeah, I've not mentioned pedophilia once. I've been consistently talking about him trying to normalize teens having sex with older men. Second time you yourself point out that you didn't even read my posts before yelling and attacking me like an immature brat. Another well done for you.

            That's not how that works. You don't get to not even read what I write, then yell at me and insult me and still make demands. The only thing you are getting from me is some parting advice. Grow up you baby.

            Milo, if that's you, I think that you're in denial about the abuse you suffered. It might be fine for you to deal with your abuse 'in an edgy way' but it throws survivors under the bus, even though I don't think you mean to do that. Your 'manning up' about it implies that survivors of child abuse who try to speak up will think twice before doing it.

            Here are the two talking points of the radical left on Twitter at the moment -:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Trump has brain health issues that are causing him to be incoherent and say nonsensical things.  It looks like he's unfit and will need to step aside!
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Milo is a pedophile and the reason he likes Trump is because they are pedophile buddies.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            This shows their level of desperation.  They are like cornered rats.

             So you defend Milo here? Maybe you are just in this for the politics. Or maybe you want to throw Podesta in jail so you and Milo can keep all the 13 year old boys to yourself.

            They do have the evidence to jail a lot of pedos. They will not arrest anyone they can't prove did something wrong. Im not sure if they have evidence about the biggest fish, but arresting smaller fish will produce it. Somebody will talk.

            Again with the attacks. Keep defending someone who is trying to normalize teens having sex with old men. Try to do it in a more mature way do. Would help you with being taken serious.

            This may be why Trump is doing some rallys in the southern states. He is gauging support from the American people. His way of determining the mood and determination of his constituents. This man knows what he is doing and trusts no one in the establishment. Our president knows his power is from the people as it should be and not from a behind-the-door deal. Support him the best you can!

            I dont think milo is a pedo. I might get shouted down but i don't know that Milo is a friend of pizzagate. He's never had the guts to talk about it.  He puts his foot in it when he says that the reason he gives good head because as a teenager he had a 29 year old lover.  He says he was the pursuer.  To me, this throws survivors under the bus. It minimises their trauma. It is victim  blaming as it's almost like saying, 'i wasn't a victim so they should just tough it out'.   With a friend like that, who needs enemies.

            I find the suicide of the biggest lobbyist, Evan Morris, a little bit odd. Considering he worked in the Clinton White House and his connection to Genentech which also leads to the Podestas. Then there is the investigation into him by the FBI and justice department.

            All you have been doing is attacking me for pointing out that Milo tries to normalize sex between teens and old men. If you want to think that's normal and ok, that's your choice. You don't get to tell me I have to agree with you.

             The problem here is that Americans have been propagandized for years and years to never question Jews and their motives.  Then along comes Pizzagate and it leads to the NWO which leads to the European Royality and the Rothschilds.  So you kind of get a real annoyed feeling about Jews.  They only are 1-2% of the population but you can damn well believe they are probably 50% of the world problem.
             <br/>
             The Homosexual thing....I am still on the fence.  I kind of think they are being used and some are being created with the raping and molestation.  I still think most gays are probably decent folks.....but a dangerous minority of them are pure Satanic Evil.

             Maybe some are.  If you see some anti-Jewish or anti-gay comments, they will probably be voted down, but people don't pile on in the comments because they don't want to tank the thread.
I think most of us know pedophiles are everywhere, in every economic class, political party, culture, religion and race.

             Left leaning progressive here that "believes" in PGate. There's a sect of PGaters that do indeed politicize it and make it about being pro Trump and anti dem. That's stupid and dangerous.

             There are plenty of elite right wingers and Trumpets involved too, some don't want to acknowledge it though and focus only on Pedosta and company.

            I am not a lost cause. I am fighting against controlled opposition like Milo who is making us fight each other. You are trying to protect him even though he is for having sex with teens by old men. Are you listening to yourself?

             I agree with you. I'm not sure why people here are defending Milo so strenuously. He's not doing pizzagate any favours by being cool with teenagers having sex with men twice their age

              Some of them are paid to repeat the narrative - shills. Milo is normalizing paedophilia. If one is sincere, one can see this. There are no contradictions in nature - they must be shills or useful dupes if unwilling to look at the evidence objectively.

              Exactly. Thank you. My guess would be that they are in love with him. The ones who are defending him are awfully upset and emotional about it. I don't mind having a mature and rational discussion. That's not what I am getting for pointing out facts though.

            Milo is a jew who is trying to make the white left and right fight with each other. Instead of telling them about the elite who control us all. By your own logic you should disagree with yourself, and agree with me.

              You understand this is actually a fantastic reason to listen to his story, and understand the psychology of someone who was abused as a child and how they will start to be convinced their abuser actually cares for them or even loves them. He is an abuse survivor, and he is clearly damaged in some ways from it. Now we can attack him all we want for that but I do feel sorry for him, he is damaged from being abused. Now that being said if he is implicated in any crime or any way he should go to jail for that.... however hes just expressing his opinion the opinion of an abuse survivor, take it for what it is.  You guys can try to spin this as much as you want but if you have met very many survivors of sexual abuse you understand, their views are going to be skewed they have trouble being angry at their abuser because of the psychological trauma it causes, we've all heard of Stockholm syndrome. He also says specifically in the video HES NOT INTO 15 YEAR OLD BOYS, he just didn't think the priest molested him because of the psychological damage that occurred from the trauma.

              Except at 4:00 he specifically says he's NOT INTO 14 YEAR OLDS. He got fucking molested, you guys are seriously blaming a guy for telling the story of him being molested by the priest at his church. Nobody is mad at the serial child molester priest that was raping him and raping little children?? Again, it really truly shows your hand.

                You’re misunderstanding what pedophilia means. Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13-years-old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty. Pedophilia is attraction to people who don’t have functioning sex organs yet. Who have not gone through puberty. Who are too young to be able (unclear and cut off by others)…That’s not what we are talking about. You don’t understand what pedophilia is if you are saying I’m defending it because I’m certainly not.

                Yeah, I don’t mind admitting that. I think particularly in the gay world and outside the Catholic church, if that’s where some of you want to go with this, I think in the gay world, some of the most important, enriching and incredibly life affirming, important shaping relationships very often between younger boys and older men, they can be hugely positive experiences for those young boys they can even save those young boys, from desolation, from suicide (people talk over each other)… providing they’re consensual

                 No where, that I saw in this video, did he say anything about older men being with young boys. He still defended his relationship and talked about how rewarding it can be ... Sorry, Im not buying it. He's crying foul now cause it stands to derail his gravy train. He talking about late night streams and partying, and he just really didn't know what he was saying and that's bullshit. He said in multiple times in different forums, was called out on it EACH time, and still defended it. Fuck him.

                Ya aye those comments are fucked no arguing that! I was just saying he is a kid that was molested, being aware of that fact gives perspective. Not condoning it any way its fucked I'm just saying he also said hes not attracted to young boys. So, some of his views on it are really fucked up because he is suffering what many sexually assaulted children suffer from which is empathy and compassion and later feelings for their abuser. Fucked up shit a terrible cycle that people have been turning an eye to for so long, the churches have been doing this shit forever just the most vile of humans to take those kind of vows and then molest boys and bribe everyone to not talk. We have a fucking epidemic on our hands at this point.

               WTF??? What he said is absolutely HORRIBLY BAD and condoning sexual abuse. He is rationalizing his sexual abuse as well as trying to take responsibility for his own abuse so as to feel safer and in more control of his world. The body of children may respond to sexual touch and their bodies may even register pleasure as a body is physical. Even if a child's body responds and a child identifies it as "pleasure" - When an adult is involved or directing it IT IS SEXUAL ABUSE

            No more slippery slopes. I don't care what's "hip" in the gay community with their Twink and Daddy bullshit. Pedo's were a legit part of their community up until about 1980, when being gay started going mainstream and so they cut them off.

             I'm OK with your statement, but the same thing occurs/occurred in the hetero community, especially in rural communities where a 25 year old man might marry a 13 year old girl.
            </p>
            <p>
             ...for the record, I am a raging heterosexual..my point is that it seems (at least to me) more abhorrent in some way because it's two dudes.  In fact, the most disturbing thing I have ever seen in person was two dudes passionately kissing...it never occurred to me that two dudes would engage in foreplay..
            </p>
            <p>
             The point is, Milo is not the enemy..HRC and crew are the enemy because they traffic in children and then harvest their organs, skin and bone marrow once they hit puberty...let's not lose sight of that...

             That's not ACCUSING anyone of shit. That's Milo clearly endorsing sex with underage children, while simultaneously protecting other pedophiles. This is Milo in his own fucking words.

              The cabal owns and controls all corporate media. Joe Rogan and Milo are performers on corporate media otulets. Why anybody does not get this is beyond me. You are not allowed to do anything but push their agenda if you get on their TV/Radio/Film. Focus people.

               Yeah, try posting that as a submission here and see how long it lasts before being deleted. The mods here are definitely on patrol against stuff like that. Something tells me the only reason this stuff is still up here is that the GOP itself is pushing back against Milo due to his proposed CPAC appearance.

                 That is immediately what I thought the first time I saw the pictures. As crazy/sick as it sounds, that probably wasn't his his first time being completely immersed in blood. Either that or he's used to far worse. How many non-medical/non-meat processing people that you know could do that without vomiting their guts out. 
This dude is 100% creepy.

              Yeah this sub is getting ridiculous. Sarah Silverman, a comedian who tells offensive jokes for a living, jokes about pedophilia and is instantly labelled a pedo by people here. Meanwhile, Milo actually, seriously states that sex between an adult man and a boy is beautiful, and people fall over themselves defending him.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you guys not see the hypocrisy in that??
             </p>
             <p>
              BTW, I don't think Milo is a pedo. He does has some views that line up with NAMBLA, which I find reprehensible, but I don't think that means he would actually have sex with a boy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Focus on the task at hand, which is exposing actual criminals, not people who dislike Trump. All of that other stuff should stay on the_Donald where it belongs.

                 Milo is a good guy who is utterly and thoroughly appalled by all things pedophilia. He
                 <em>
                  KNOWS
                 </em>
                 that #PizzaGate / #PedoGate are
                 <em>
                  very
                 </em>
                 real and
                 <strong>
                  MUST BE STOPPED, EXPOSED AND PUNISHED TO THE ABSOLUTE FULLEST FUCKING EXTENT OF THE LAW
                 </strong>
                 .
                </p>
                <p>
                 Is he a troll? Yes and his trolling is aimed squarely at precious snowflakes, #SafeSpaceSJWs and hypocrites of all kinds.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The fact that those who publicly rage and whine about him and his opinions, who un-ironically call him a #HOMOPHOBE, a #RACIST, an #ANTISEMITE as well as a #NAZI,   all whilst knowing he is a #GAY man who is half Jewish and has had a number of romantic relationships with Black men.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Perhaps even more ridiculous than those absolutely propaganda-based smear campaigns of baseless claims and
                 <em>
                  weaponized -ists &amp; -isms and labels
                 </em>
                 , the most hypocritical attacks against Milo have involved the
                 <em>
                  very loud
                 </em>
                 and #SJW - Celebrity - Academia - Scientology-like cult that is The Far Left these days, who have all openly encouraged and put their Stamp of Approval on pretty much any and every types of personal, public, professional witch hunt against those they deem to "Deserve it".
                </p>
                <p>
                 This includes attacking him as a victim of what was an ongoing, repeated childhood sexual assault by a priest who was also a teacher while Milo was a student at a Catholic school.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Anyone who has suffered through childhood sexual assault and long term abuse by a trusted adult and mentor knows how devastating and life altering it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Even if they haven't been a victim it's mind blowing and the lowest form of hypocrisy to attack, defame and attempt to get him fired and ruin his career for the way Milo, as a victim, chooses to deal with the abuse he suffered.

                 , Sarah Nyberg/Nick Nyberg can say and do whatever he or she wants, including sharing cp of her 7-8-9yr old niece, as well as share other cp links and later call it "being edgy Mc edgelord deluxe and if you question it you're a #TRANSPHOBE since Nick is now Sarah! You monsters!!!"

                 Milo is a self admitted troll. He uses humor, sometimes dark, to get his points across and to deal with being sexually assaulted and abused as a young teen.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I love Milo. He is one of the only voices around that can snap the mushy brains of this generation out of the #NWO #GLOBALIST propaganda that is making them into#CULTCONTROLLED  #SJW #SNOWFLAKE ZOMBIES .
                </p>
                <p>
                 And for those wondering, Milo is NOT "Alt Right".
                 <br/>
                 That phrase is yet another piece of well placed propaganda by our enemies.

                 Just like the "Bernie Bro" label that is
                 <em>
                  still
                 </em>
                 a lie.

               Nobody sees the irony in vilifying a person they disagree with based on a few statements, and defending a person they agree with using the same rationale.
              </p>
              <p>
               Either people sometimes make jokes that are offensive but not how they actually feel, or everything everyone says always has a kernel of truth to it.  Can't have it both ways depending on how you feel about the person.

                I disagree. There's a difference between a comedian making a joke and a journalist making a serious statement. Milo gave no indication he was joking, whereas Sarah Silverman has never once supported boy-love, she's only made jokes about pedophilia.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you listen to Milo's statements, you don't have to do any searching for a kernel of truth, he repeatedly and earnestly insists that sex with minors is ok. He leaves zero room for ambiguity as to what his opinion on the issue was.

                <p>
                 it felt good, so it wasn't "abuse or abusive*

                 "you feel/felt special and loved and excited to see your abuser as they groomed you so you should trust your feelings and follow along with where it takes you!"

                 "You will still think of me and how much I love you and gave to you, even when you're older. It's PROOF that what we did together wasn't wrong. The laws and everyone else is what's wrong!"

                 However, Milo stated very clearly that he does NOT agree with children being in sexual relationships with adults.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He was speaking about his own experience, which in order to deal with, he has made himself either joke about it or retained the mantra that abusers place in the mind of their victims; that the victim was the aggressor, therefore the victim wanted it to happen therefore Milo has believed, at least partially, that it's his fault and it happened because deep down somewhere, he must have wanted it to happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's one of the very difficult things for the victim to deal with.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Thus the dark humor you see which is painted all over it in this particular case.

                 Have some compassion.

                 Besides, the man fucking despises pedophiles and outs them and exposes them every chance he gets.

               And he ALSO points out that its PERFECTLY ok that men 25-28 years old have relationships with boys that are 14 or under. He redefines pedophilia so it happens not to include the little boys he wants to fuck. And you are OK with that?

                No I do not, and he is not advocating that, he said that age of consent is arbirtrary and the ages are about right.   I agree that it is arbitrary..for instance, in TX the age of consent is 17, so an adult can legally have sex with a 17 year old, but if you take pics or vids you go to jail for child porn...make sense or arbitrary?  He was the victim in this case BTW..he was not the adult preying on a 13 year old.  And it is only an issue because he is a faggot.  Had he said the exact same things about himself as 13 yo boy banging his hot female teacher, everybody would be high-fiving him.

                 Now, tell me again about how is because he's a faggot. No! Not at all, this is about a man talking about diddling underage boys and how it's good and nurturing for them. In fact he says he wouldnt give such good head if not for 'Father Michael'. And we're the assholes for pointing out he's talking about fucking under age children.... fucking really?!1!?

                  Technically, he is right about pedophilia is sexual attraction to pre-pubescent children (0-12 or so).  Abuse victims regularly reveal that the abusers dumped them once they hit puberty...I was 5'10" and a lean 190lbs at 13 because I had been lifting weights for 2 years...I was not some innocent child coloring in coloring books.

                    Nothing...it's just what Milo is describing is not pedophilia and is not what we are fighting.  Excuse me for being graphic, but it is needed for context and to brace those for what is coming.  Videos and/or pics will inevitably surface so that Pres. Trump is not accused of jailing his political enemies....these videos will be soul wrenching, and will show adults raping a crying or drugged child that is well below the age of 10....that is what we are fighting and it is a totally different creature than what Milo is talking about.

                     Ok, then Anthony Weiner was AOK because his target was 15 right? So this all started from a bunch of bullshit because that 15 year old isn't prepubescent, good to know.

                     Maybe that is what YOU are fighting against, I am fighting against the shit Milo is apologizing for. If YOU are OK with 30 year old men fucking 15 year old boys, then fuck you, plain and simple.

            Do we use this tactic against them? Why does it seem like we are the only side with this issue? I feel like the opposition is a bunch of catty high school cunts. I wish all shitty people would self combust.

            There is the interview of Milo where he says that sex between a 13 year old boy and an old man is a beautiful thing. That's simply showing people that he said that. It's hardly trying to make things up about him.

             He WAS the 13 year old victim in this case.  Just because he fell for the old banana in the tail pipe and liked it, does not make him any less of a victim in this case.

              He is also glorying this type of sexual assault now that he is older. That's where the problem I have comes up with. If he didn't tell his followers that teens being fucked by old guys is great, I wouldn't mind. He does do that though.

             Rarely, if ever, have I agreed with you, but the mental gymnastics these motherfuckers are doing to make this OK makes my physically fucking ill. They talk a good fucking game, but when push comes to shove, they are no better than the perpetrators.

            While I think these people are ridiculous and doing a disservice to the actual evidence surrounding this case by letting their political hatred for Trump fuel petty accusations, I think Hanlon's Razor fits the bill for 90% of these people.

            When high level arrests happen the corporate media will try to say the Russians planted it, and that Trump is trying to eliminate his competition to be a tyrant.

             It seems like he should go after retired/dead GOP first.   It would be hard for the left and the media to get together on the same page and defend a right-winger.   Use that to get the public used to the idea that somebody that had power was into this stuff.   Then continue on the right-wing side if they are guilty.    Save the Dems until later if possible. If Wikileaks drops Vault7 and it has proof of HRC involvement, I'm sure they are ready.   They've had many months to carefully plan, by looking carefully at her own copies of the emails.

             Possible and predictable. Yet latest FBI anon says that what's coming out will shock the dumb public. And prove the MSM wrong.

             I'm guessing that's why the arrests are taking so long. Trump has to play this right, and that takes some planning. At least I hope that's what's up. I want to see Clinton behind bars before year's end.

             And people will believe it.  I'm sorry but I have to admit that I wasn't a huge fan of trump at all in fact quite the opposite but he is a fucking paragon of virtue compared to crooked Hillary and I'm now defending him to the hilt.  I'm not from the U.S. but back during the primaries I preferred Sanders over everyone for potus and I think most democrat voters preferred him but crooked Hillary fixed it and by the looks of things from the Wikileaks emails she wanted to run against trump and had the media in her pocket which might be why he won the candidacy in the first place.  Hillary is like Dr. Frankenstein she created a monster and couldn't control it and now the mob are out with torch and pitchfork when she is responsible for him winning.  Honestly the world has gone mad

               Was laughing with one of my friends the other day actually about exactly that, how friends we've known for 15 years are listening to us talking about trump and the alt media and looking at us like we've suddenly become neo-nazis.  I've got a couple of friends that no matter what you tell them about Hillary, they still see her as better than trump.  Honestly though if you find a way to get your friends to see sense let me know, I'm tearing my hair out trying.

              We have to support Trump no matter what now. The Hillary/Podesta WikiLeaks showed how corrupt Hillary and US politics are in general.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you are against Trump then you are basically for his enemies which are Hillary, MSM, Corrupt politicians etc

             <p>
              He's literally all we have left. If you think he's corrupt you should pray he isn't. Without him we have nobody in significant power on our side

               Idem, just not a convinced fan yet. I have to see it happen first and also, I keep wondering why Trump keeps making himself look so bad with the Sweden story and the electoral vote lie and the inauguration crowd, ... If he's a master at 4-5-6-300-dimensional chess, why would he want to look like a fool to the whole world?

              I too initially thought Trump was just another puppet put in to run in another reality show election....like Romney against Obama, McCain vs Obama, Bush vs Kerry...etc.   Somewhere along the way I changed my tune and did everything I could to get Trump elected.  I watched every one of his speeches pretty much, searching for clues he's a fraud....only to be convinced the opposite.  It could all be a ruse, but if it is....its a good one.  Am not thinking Trump is a ruse.

               As with most anyone,  I started out suspicious of trump. But when the podesta emails leaked and it showed all the reports and emails to msm outlets about the candidates (what to say,  etc) and when I saw their reports about EVERY candidate (repub and dem) that listed their main points and histories, pros and cons, from birth I was convinced that trump was the real deal. first of all,  they wrote him off bc their initial concern was for mccain, then ryan, etc. Trump surprised them. Then in all their dirt digging they never came up with anything.  So when all those accusations came out from those women I knew it was utter bs bc it would have been in their report on him. Anyway,  I'm convinced trump is legit otherwise TPTB in our government wouldn't all be against him.  Repubs hate him as much as dems.

               Watched a great trump press conference yesterday posted on the Wikileaks Twitter where he's talking to the CNN reporter a bit more amicably than last time about their biased coverage, he seems so genuine I think the problem with most people the world over is they listen to the reports but not the speeches themselves.  For Christ sake the man's inauguration speech was the most truly liberal and unifying presidential speech given since the days of JFK, he spoke about listening to the people and giving power back to them and the msm called it divisive, it was one of the most inspiring things I've ever heard.  Honestly how anyone believes a word the msm say anymore is beyond me

              Count me as another Sanders supporter who then preferred Trump over Killary and now is solidly backing Trump. Most Berners I know support Trump now. We all think Trump's the best / only chance we have now to finally drain the swamp.

               Also a Bernie supporter but fuck if I believe trump is some sort of savior.  Dept of education pic = he's a moron like the rest of them.  At this point I'm just hoping isis takes out all of them. They're all crooked; even Bernie caved and supported Hillary.  Ugh.

               Same! I worked my ass off in Bernie's campaign here in NH starting a phone bank in my town and staging location director for small towns around me to GOTV. Hillary stole that primary and I was thinking about going Jill until she started looking a little too crazy for me. I started watching Trump videos instead of listening to MSM, because we all know the BS lies they did to Bernie #OccupyCNN #March4Bernie #SethRich #ShawnLucas and went Trump afterwards! Screw the Democrats! #DemExit I'm ready for Trump 2020 now...

                Good question, here we go: I understand that at the top he's up against a legion of deep state and various ptb, understand that lower levels in the hierarchy (judges, police, bureaucrats, etc) are infested, understand that many / most of the organized crime syndicates have no interest in the swamp being drained, understand that certain foreign intelligence services prefer the murky status quo, and understand that even natural allies for him may be compromised due to some non-pedo related error of judgment in the past, rendering them unable to be of much assistance now.
               </p>
               <p>
                The deck is stacked against him, the smoke and mirrors must be intense, and he's not Batman.
               </p>
               <p>
                Having said that, here's where we should hold him accountable:
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Don't appoint scumbags to high positions (Obama revealed his bait and switch from Day One by appointing Rahm and Larry Fucking Summers)
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Continue to commit to draining the swamp (Obama revealed his bait and switch in his 'forward not backward' speech)
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Continue to keep his promises and engage with his supporters (Obama revealed his bait and switch by not appointing any progressives after financing his campaign through grass roots donations)
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Don't stand in the way (Obama was almost literally standing in the way of swamp-draining, I.e. by Holder's Justice Dept taking the time to send amicus letters to protect John Yoo)
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Take opportunities when they arise (if evidence can be available or a bad guy slips up, make your move)
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  Continue to go after pedos &amp; traffickers as a swamp-draining priority (so far he seems to be doing this)
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  No blatant bullshit like gagging Sibel, using an arcane legal gambit to prosecute corruption whistleblowers like Thomas Drake, no political prisoners like Siegelman, etc.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  If any pay for play, for fucks sake make it be about getting a casino license or season tickets somewhere, not about starting a fucking war

               Yeah even if he fucks it up or ends up doing something corrupt for personal gains he'll still be better than Hillary, almost every politician is corrupt but Hillary is a fucking warmongering psychopath, even if her pay for play human trafficking charity didn't exist you could be damn sure she'd have kept pushing missile defences closer and closer to Russian soil until they were forced into a ground war in Europe, or ww3 if you like.  The world has dodged a bullet.

              I voted for Rand Paul and Gary Johnson. I honestly thought Trump was a Clinton plant. I've been interested in conspiracy theories for a while but have never had any strong convictions anything was real except the fact Agenda 21 and plans for a New World Order are real. Other than that all I knew is the Government lied about JFK, 9/11 and many others but it's impossible to know the truth for certain about what happened. As for pizzagate, I've never been more convinced a conspiracy was real.

             <p>
              It's encouraging to know that so many with opposing political views can all come together in support of the truth.

               Yeah I was always 100% convinced about 9/11 but not aliens, reptilian shapeshifters etc. and as for the moon landings well if that was faked to cripple the Russians during the cold war then so be it all is fair in love and war.  Trump being a Clinton plant crossed my mind as well but I suppose we can rule that out now lol.  All conspiracy theories become incredibly convoluted when they should stick to the simple and obvious evidence, for 9/11 the tower 7 collapse is the proof and as for pizzagate the podesta email about the kids in the pool is the proof, the fact we'll never get a good (or in fact any) explanation for either those points shows they are the proof.  What pisses me off more than anything is the fact that the vast majority of people I've spoken to who buy into the msm rhetoric regarding conspiracy theories are poorly educated, I'm an honours graduate and somehow I'm the crazy one for not believing the lie.
              </p>
              <p>
               As for politics I think that's the biggest lie of them all, I've always been a lefty but now I just vote whatever way i think will cause more chaos for the establishment, I was a yes for brexit even though I'm Scottish and we don't have the same immigrant problem as down south and, I voted yes for Scottish independence even though I believed it would be financially detrimental to me in the short term.  Basically I voted against my own interests both times because the government and the media told me not to, I'm seeing a lot of that these days it's pretty refreshing.

                I got into conspiracies through politics. Ron Paul started a 'brushfire of freedom' in the young me in 2008, and I read a lot about him leading up to getting involved in the 2012 campaign. He's still my hero, a very courageous truth teller. I remember being angry at other Ron Paul supporters online for pushing what I thought were stupid conspiracy theories until someone showed me a clip of Ron Paul himself talking about the New World Order. He said something along the lines of "There is a real movement to overthrow US sovereignty and install a one world government and it's no secret". After some research I found Agenda 21 and it was on from there.

                 There are exceptions of course, I believe Jeremy Corbyn is a genuine man (again partly because the msm and his own party are attacking him so much) and even though I vowed I'd never vote labour again after the Scottish independence debacle (anyone looking for proof that major political parties are all one and the same google 'Scottish independence the vow') I will vote for him if he's still around at the next election. By and large though politicians are scum.

                  In America the tragedy is that 90% of us are just pulling for their party and know nothing about policies or principles. Most hate to even think of discussing politics and all they can do when forced is spew talking points from one side or the other. Everyone is a blind partisan, and every 4 or 8 years the politicians and sheeple flip flop on their beliefs.

                   In an old episode of family guy Brian says that undecided voters are the biggest idiots alive, in fact it's the exact opposite, as you say most people have made up their mind before anyone opens their mouth

                    "Family Guy" is an insider perp. Anything that thing suggests, I would take the opposite, as you did.

                     I always found it weird that Seth McFarlane missed his flight on 9/11 and was booked on one of the planes that was hijacked, something fishy about that story.

                      Here's the cartoon "plane" crash where afterward the "John Q. Public" is so upset he beats his wife.

                      Just what happened, as planned, with the public hating on and beating up Muslims [even Hindu-s since they couldn't tell the difference] after 9/11. And then going to War overseas. That's how they got their recruits.

                      He's at the top of my list for arrest. I'm angry at the cartoonists who got rewarded for their part in 9/11. "Ugly Americans" Devin Clark is another one.

                    Rand Paul had already dropped out of the Republican primary when I voted for him. I didn't know who to vote for, didn't like the choices I had left. Ted Cruz is who I should have voted for on paper but he has really shady connections to GS and the CFR and Henry Kissinger so he was a no go. I used to think undecided voters were low info, turns out some of them have too much info.

                   He's not to everyone's taste and I didn't agree with his views on Scottish independence but he's funny as hell and every second time you see him on t.v. he's getting pissed up in a bar which i love.  If more politicians spoke to the media with a few pints in them we might get a lot more honesty from them.

               Welcome, I see your account is new. Thanks you for joining the fight, thought from the sounds of it you have been lurking for some time. This is unfortunately real, and something thats really taken me back is how this links most other 'conspiracies' together. All we have seen with JFK &amp; 9/11 etc. is the end result of the actions, we are left with more questions than answers.
              </p>
              <p>
               Pizzagate/pedogate is how they operate, this is the infrastructure of the machine. How could something like 9/11 take place without someone breaking rank. The thoughts of an angry mob headed up by your own family dragging you down the road in some Ghadafi style vigilante execution will do it.  Over 5k people in the pentagon purchasing CP thats roughly 1 in 4.5 ,  this buys you a lot of influence considering what 4 of them were convicted if even that.

                Thanks. I found this page through the Pizzagate wordpress blog. I'm not much of a researcher, and honestly I've had a hard enough time keeping up than actually finding anything on my own. I have been vocal to those who would listen. I only made an account here to defend David Seaman. I've followed him for a while and know he is credible. Not perfect, but credible.
               </p>
               <p>
                The thing about conspiracy theories is that no matter what subject lures you in, it seems like all roads lead to devil worship. That's always been about where I drew the line in the past. I struggle enough believing in God so it's hard to think that so many others could believe so strongly in satan. Alex Jones' claim to fame was his video of satanic rituals at the bohemian grove. Mark Dice, David Icke, Ted Gunderson have all said the same things about the satanic 'illuminati' for years and I always shrugged it off.
               </p>
               <p>
                Pizzagate is clearly rooted in the occult and this weird evil stuff. Seeing the pictures of Podesta with the bandaid, Marina Abromovic...etc made me reconsider my thoughts on many conspiracy theory figures that I had written off as insane or disinfo.

                 These people dont believe in the 'devil' either truth be told, this whole forum went through a huge phase of omg Satanic Worship. This is just another piece of how to create an alternative mindset, out of mind experience for the actors involved. Creating an altered state of reality is the bedrock of reprogramming, the occult is a means to an end it is not the end unto itself which I feel quite a lot of people misunderstand. I do not think for one second that the survivors of this abuse did not go through Satanic style rituals etc. Though this is my 2cents worth I genuinely believe that this is the case.

                 Plus even 20 years ago Satan Worship was considered worse than touching a child so it worked two fold.

                  Devil worship also whips people like David Seaman into a frenzy. Feels like the Satan narrative is being pushed, perhaps because it's a small slice of the pizza whose loss can be afforded. James Achilles-heel-of-pedogate Alefantis Rothschild might be a scapegoat or the key to the whole thing. Gahhh which is truth???

                   Your dead right for bible bashers or those inclined to religious fervor dropping the S bomb is worse than kiddiefiddling, and whips up a whole lot of feelings. But if James Alefantis is the key to all this god help us all, hes a wannabe clown, the worst type of clown.

                MEN
               </em>
               helping little boys see who they are, you are suggesting what?
               <em>
                Women
               </em>
               help little boys see who they are? What does a fucking woman know about growing up into a man? All a woman can teach a boy is how to grow up into a woman. And that's exactly what happened, and the reason there are so many pussies today. Single mothers, fatherless children, and a whole lot of pussies.

                 No, just strong men of society, so they can grow up to protect our people from predator pedophiles the likes that you are supporting.

                 Of course you don't want able bodied men, thinkers, warriors. You want this jelly mass of whiney SJW white knights, because they're stupid and easy to control. But if boys had strong fathers again, you and your kind of filth would be out of a job.

                Let's not lose sight of this complete fantasy that we have been building and building and building.
Let's keep indulging in this fantasy that was started as a political op.

               <p>
                If you had come across anything so obvious as what Milo said about sex with 13 year olds in Podesta's emails, you would have put it on a billboard.

                This is complete political tribalism on your part.

               Agreed; he cant even have a covert friendly relationship with Russia because of how messed up our intelligence agencies are. That said, the best way to deal with Russia is still to be overly transparent, explain in simple terms everything hes doing (Trumps already a master of this); lord help us if a covert Trump-Putin dealing gets leaked that media can spin.

               Yes, the majority of Americans still wouldn't believe that all major news outlets could (or would) conspire to fabricate, distort or supress a story.
              </p>
              <p>
               If it happens, it will take brute force via Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, alternative media etc. to the point where inaccurate coverage will appear to be an admission of involvement.  After the Megyn Kelly interview fiasco, Tucker Carslon's love of Comet Ping Pong and Bill O'Reilly's ties to the deep state Fox News will almost certainly participate in a cover-up too so they can't be relied upon.

              We need to brainstorm on how to a avoid civil war at all costs as it is obviously what the globalists want (they want to bring order out of that chaos). I expect huge manufactured rioting in the spring.

               Don't pick up weapons that kill. Pick up weapons that inform, enlighten, engage, and unite. Truth is the best weapon. Who will stand against the truth? Democrats? Liberals? Conservatives? Blacks? Whites? Once the truth is known, there are only two sides: those who accept and fight to destroy the lies, and those who deny it and fight to destroy love. Sorry this sounds either new-agey or holier-than-thou, but it's what we're facing. We're at a point in history when/where everything that we know can be known by all. The shadows are growing thinner and darker by the day; the light is brighter than ever. As the protesters become more and more aware of what's been going on, what's REALLY been going on, they'll drop their signs and come to the side of right. It won't be easy. People will have to make a choice, especially those in positions of power: Do I fight to keep what I have and deny what's right and good; or do I let go and accept that the elite have created a chaotic, evil world that must be ended? Fortunately for me, I only have my family and my mind. If I lose either, there'll be hell to pay. I'd prefer to keep my wits, and help others find theirs. Just don't fight the fight how 'they' want you to. Protect the government, the institutions; but, throw out the people who occupy and govern with impunity. Jeez, my bad. Quite the rant.

              I agree with your opinion because the wrong-doers have infected almost every area of protection that was devised to thwart this criminal behavior. The sick and deranged population have been incrementally shoving their agenda up our butts for the past 30-40-50 years. Their numbers keep growing as the children are being propagandized in so many ways to accept abhorrent behavior as if it's normal.

               You know what really pisses me off? I always used to wonder why wars happened. The history books always watered the explanations down. Like the American civil war. It was about human rights, plain and simple, but when I left the classroom, I left confused. That was done on purpose. Now when I hear the word war, I immediately ask myself: Who were the perpetrators of human rights violations? The rest doesn't matter, but the history books will create fantastic tales to obscure the truth.

                You can put 100 people together in a room, and none of them believe the cult they were raised in is actually the truth; yet none of them brave enough to speak up simply out of fear that there might be believers elsewhere among the 100%. They may all continue to act out the lie as a group, too afraid to step out of line because none of them can see the truth of the system. Then those people have kids, who mostly get raised to believe its all true, cementing the problem into tradition. There are only a few personality types that aren't vulnerable to this thinking, such as the autistic, the mentally ill, and psychopaths. The first two are marginalized, but psychopaths are able to manipulate neurotypical with ease because they have all the independent thinking of the other types, but they have the ability to read social data without actually feeling anything. The other very important thing to understand is inverted mental reward structures; they are actually incapable of finding joy in anything normally positive. Ironically, this puts them in leadership positions, because they have no qualms about stepping on others and they are more immune to groupthink.

              The corporate media has painted a picture of Trump and Putin as white nationalist, leaders of a new Reich. If there is a civil war it will be a race war. Or they assassinate Trump, blame it on Russia and start WW3, or God knows how many other ways this could play out.

               The cult of death is clever. Unawakened humans are smart as cats chasing laser pointers. We really do chase holographic illusions by default if/when we're not careful.

               This is exactly what I thought their method would be. They're trying to race to finish line of their little game plan. I was watching that video w the "illuminati wife", it was kind of depressing how saturated with evil at the upper levels we have been. Gonna take some help from above to expose and protect.

             For one: Trump didn't intend to be President. He didn't expect it. And yes, he was picked by Hillary's people. He was a Dem three years ago.

             "Election Night Coverage"
            </p>
            <p>
             Listen carefully to this interview. Fast forward through "Jones" if you need to
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1498628">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1498628

            </p>
            <p>
             It's clearly stated that there was a Coup behind Trump. The Coup clique, in the Intel community and in the Military, would not tolerate Clinton. Because, if they did so, the cabal she is involved in, would be able to complete their plans and that was not tolerable.
            </p>
            <p>
             Two : Trump is a gangster. To put it more politely . He is a "connected" man .
            </p>
            <p>
             You can tell that by his background; how he got where he was, what he did in NYC, how he speaks, how he operates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Alright, that is very good news. Anyone less, than one who is experienced in that realm, could not survive what he is going through.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, he understands the landscape: because who is he dealing with, from Putin to Bibi to the Saudi-s to Alephantis and Podesta?
            </p>
            <p>
             Criminals.. Takes one to know one , as they say.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you listened carefully to what he said to the Press the other day .. "I know you. I know you are lying."
            </p>
            <p>
             How does he know that, really? He is an insider. He is himself an actor.. Look at his IMBD entry.
            </p>
            <p>
             And he himself is an insider. That's how he knows they are lying.
            </p>
            <p>
             So Rodham Clinton was expected to win. Trump was a default candidate, who was the "last man standing"
            </p>
            <p>
             The people behind the Coup had the choice made-up for them. And they are whom are protecting him and helping him in what he has to do now.
            </p>
            <p>
             I has to be G-d's will.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, Robert Steele is full of shit and a liar. He lied about 9/11 and I wouldn't believe one word he has to say about the inner workings of the CIA. On the recent 4chan it was stated that the CIA was ruined by H.W. BUSH which is likely way more true than "7 categoreis of CIA" They are just confusing you with the "7"
            </p>
            <p>
             "7" likely refers to the blackmail over 9/11 which they are holding over the head of the would -be Pedo arresters/ prosecutors. . If the Pedos are not arrested there is a switch that will be pulled and they will dump the 9/11 material.
            </p>
            <p>
             Good news about Trump and his background is  this: NYC gangsters despise pedos. It's make their eyes turn red like mad bulls. Not all gangsters are the same. The main gangster "mafia" of NYC despise pedos. That is all.

             but with the size and extent of the paedostocracy, no-one on this planet worth more than $50 million wouldnt be compelled to rub shoulders against them, wittingly or unwittingly, and when you do learn of them you can't just go to war against them - it means your own destruction
            </p>
            <p>
             If Trump is clean, and he is genuinely as disgusted by paedophilia as he projects - then  having to deal with these sick freaks at every turn in his business life may well have been a primary motivation of him to become POTUS, and finally get the chance to clean house

              Doesnt the whole Trump/Epstein-connection basically boil down to:
             </p>
             <p>
              1) Trump said hes a teriffic guy, who likes woman on the younger side (No idea when it was said, and if he knew about more back then)
             </p>
             <p>
              2) Trump kicked and banned Epstein out of mar al-lago for hitting on a 14-yo?.
             </p>
             <p>
              3) Mark Epstein(Jeffrey Epstein's brother) said that Trump visited the island and flew on the jet.
             </p>
             <p>
              4) Nothing on the flight records though which circulates around.

             It's fucking disturibing how people so blindly follow without facts, or will over look the facts because they like trump. I like facts. So far trump has been alright but I'm not letting fucking guard down.

             It's so hard to stay impartial - everyone who reads this comment. Think of this - who you voted for, who you like and who you support should have no bearing on this. It's ALL about facts.

              It's not just a take down of pedos it's a take down of the Cabal and the whole system. This shit is everywhere and once it starts being exposed on a grand scale the whole world system is going to come down paving the way for a bright future. We will win. I'm am praying every day with you that humanity's salvation comes soon. God bless

             I had a hunch from the very beginning that Milo was an agent of Soros/CIA and his rapid rise was the result of a vigorous sheep dipping operation.  An inflammatory figure to play one side of a conflict with paid protesters playing the other.  It's GANG VS GANG, folks. Lot's of effort by the MSM to give Milo high visibility and paste him to Trump, as well.  The Kutcher dog and pony show last week was a coordinated effort in flipping the script on PG . This is another. Dianne Feinstein is attempting to hijack the narrative also, planning to submit guidelines on the heals of the US Gymnastics scandal.

Feinstein was close by in City Hall at the time of the shootings, and discovered Milk's body after hearing the gunshots and going to investigate.

              You might be onto something and that does sound like something Soros would do. Soros that sick fuck was into fucking with every part of our lives.

              Any of the down voaters on this comment want to offer a counterpoint or is it knee jerk reaction because it doesn't fit your own ideas of who Milo actually may be?

               not down voting, try this:
              </p>
              <p>
               Fascists historically first use then destroy homosexuals (and other minorities).
              </p>
              <p>
               Libs/MSM/pedos (so darkly funny that they are now aligned with each other) are driving for a narrative that has Trump or alt-right Trumpists destroying Milo, because he has supported Trump, creating the illusion of Der Trumpenfuhrer offending against the liberals' pets, "the gays."
              </p>
              <p>
               This would "prove" Trump is the uber fascist they need him to be to make their fascism look like something other than fascism.
              </p>
              <p>
               Who is Milo though? Just a gay guy, that's about it!
              </p>
              <p>
               Like many he apparently was taken advantage of as a teen. This is sad to me, regardless of the gay/straight/whatever angle.
Keep in mind in the victimology reference frame, he is just a victim reclaiming his life.  That's a weak and shitty POV though, because it's limited...
              </p>
              <p>
               A tough "red pill" for many to swallow may be that for a young gay guy, even &lt;18, the struggle to understand who he is when society and family tell him he is something else may be so hard that the violation of sex with an adult, pales in comparison.  So years later for various psychological reasons he can consider the relationship a net positive, even though at 13 or 14, so much too young, it is criminal and has fucked him up. To everyone else, he is obviously a victim.
Anyway Milo does come off as a fucked up freak, as well as a truth speaking,  "red pilled" "alt right" media personality.
              </p>
              <p>
               No doubt it would have been better for him and everyone else if he had not been through that kind of coming of age. People  can come of age without going through trauma and damage. Supporting that possibility is a big part of what pizzagate, pedogate, Trump's election, brexit, etc., are all about.
              </p>
              <p>
               So, short version: Milo is a gay dude, kinda fucked up, a victim who refuses to be only a victim perhaps, bucking the trend, kinda conservative. All the political forces. from all sides want to use him as a football. Which due to his issues, probably gratifies him, though it might not be good for him.

               What do you think of that take?
