             Hey, it totally proves a large scale massive child sexual abuse cover up. More to the point existance of government protected child abuse on a massive scale, with a large number of victims lives destroyed to satisfy the needs of who the authorities refused to arrrest because of their connections for years.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is that sounding like pizzagate? If it has happened before, does it make /pizzagate/ more plausable. People don't believe pizzagate because they can't believe large scale VIP pedo rings even exist. Let's burst that bubble shall we and leave this post here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most people who oppose pizzagate says if it would be going on THE PEDOS would be arresteded already. Massive pedophile rings don't exist - the police would catch one and then catch them all.
            </p>
            <p>
             This post proves legally the massive scope of PROTECTED VIP PEDOPHILES actually existing through CASE LAW. It validates the plausibility of /pizzagate/ and you want it deleted?

             The OTO child sex cult uses that same defense in court here too. We haven't been proven guilty yet - so it never happened. Alefantis and co haven't been investigated because they are gay and only a

            </p>
            <p>
             Don't do the same angle as the pedo cult to censor the truth about large scale child sexual abuse cover up.

My information about the O.T.O.is based on reading of various Crowley and Thelemic texts, academic literature about the O.T.O. and similar new religious movements and informal conversations I have had with other academics about the O.T.O.
            </p>
            <pre><code>Professor Ezzy described the OTO as a small international religious movement modeled on Freemasonry and heavily influenced by the writings of Aleister Crowley who became the head for much of the first half of the twentieth century.[65] The report stated that the OTO is clearly a religious organisation; it has rules of association, the ritual practices are clearly set out and policed and there is an established set of interpretations of religious beliefs and texts.[66]
In response to the question[67]-

            <p>
             Do you think it likely if the OTO was practicing child sacrifice, paedophilia and cannibalism that may have actually come to the attention of law enforcement?

            <p>
             Yes, indeed.... I would say it was extremely unlikely that this is a systemic or organisationally organised aspect of the OTO.
            </p>
            <pre><code>Professor Ezzy stated in his report:[68]

             This ezzy pedo did perjury in court and is going to jail soon don't you worry. He used lies like - WE HAVEN'T BEEN CAUGHT YET - SO IT ISN'T HAPPENING...

             Now when someone gets caught and the case exposes A MASSIVE COVERUP showing that Pizzagate could be real too - you want to delete the thread - a thread that shows there has been as big as pizzagate before if not bigger?

             I got banned for proving a mod wrong on that issue. half the comments got censored but I agreed in the settlement not republish.

             Please don't delete this whole post because my comments triggered the pedophilia normalizing elite and the LGBTI puppets that wont denounce their own leadership (like Harry Hay) being OTO child sex cult pedos and NAMBLA members - as proven on Camera.

               it shouldn't need to be spelt out in the OP too appease someone who wants my comments in this thread deleted more than the OP.

              <p>
               Surely people can just process the facts in the OP and not be told what to think right?

                The reason is that without the rules being enforced it's easy for shills to post noise to the subverse, which makes it harder for researches to find relevant information.

            Remember the Catholic Church has a homo problem. If there was no homos in the catholic church there would be no little boy rape.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only a homosexual can rape a little boy, because that act is a same sex sex act and the dictionary says someone is a homosexual if they do a same sex sex act WITHOUT ANY LANGUAGE LIMITING AGE. Is a man male? Is a boy male? If sex happens is it a same sex sex act? worked it out yet?
           </p>

            So IF you are a cultural Marxist against the PROPER USE OF LANGUAGE - PROPERLY UNDERSTAND THIS... Go fuck yourself.

            As for them covering up all the child abuse like the special gay police etc, they can go to hell for that twice over too. There is no excuse for giving justice to a faggot child rapist frock or not.

            NSW Police protected pedophile robert Dolly dunn also had a priests frock, and an adult gay partner when he was raping boys as exposed here. The leader of Australia's gay lobby was defending him! Christopher Pooplicker AM. Details here:

            Also guys google "Derryn Hinch" "Simon Cooper". If a gay judge fucks a few boys boy, he can plead guilty to multiple counts of gay judge little boy rape and get no punishment whatsoever, no listing on a sex offender registry. Only the journalist exposing the crimes of Australian gay judges get jailed.....

            gets all the "children's guardian appeal cases". So the policy is only a gay judge can over-rule the police / children's guardian office to decide wether a convicted pedo can work in a preschool again. Read their case law you will see most of the time gay pedophiles get to another ticket to the pay pen but hetrosexual pedo's dont.

             I &amp; FBI Agent of Los Angeles Ted Gunderson said that satanic ritual abuse is REAL!
to add: he said the McMartin abuse case was 100% TRUE! - even said there was confirmation of tunnels under the school,backing up the kid's court testimony

             P.S. Australia makes special child fuck case only judges as a world first. Who want's to deal with child sex all day every day - and be the single gatekeeper for letting all pedophiles off in an entire state. The special dyke judge child sex case only training program cost 20 million dollars. WTF is going on here!

             Its' funny how the MSM puts a nice spin on mass child sex cover up power being concentrated into a hands of a couple of homos for an entire state, with the history of mass child sex cover up going on in Australia. I can't even report MSM celebs publishing child porn and being friends with an infant sex normalization activist
