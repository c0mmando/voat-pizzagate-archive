<p>Cue the Alliance to Rescue Civilization, a group that advocates a backup for humanity by way of a station on the Moon replete with DNA samples of all life on Earth, as well as a compendium of all human knowledge — the ultimate detached garage for a race of packrats. It would be run by people who, through fertility treatments and frozen human eggs and sperm, could serve as a new Adam and Eve in addition to their role as a new Noah.</p>
<p>Far from the lunatic fringe, the leaders of the alliance have serious careers: Robert Shapiro, the group’s founder, is a professor emeritus and senior research scientist in biochemistry at New York University; Ray Erikson runs an aerospace development firm in Boston and has been a NASA committee chair; Steven M. Wolfe, as a Congressional aide, drafted and helped pass the Space Settlement Act of 1988, which mandated that NASA plan a shift from space exploration to space colonization, and was executive director of the Congressional Space Caucus; William E. Burrows, an author of several books on space, is the director of the Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program at N.Y.U.</p>
<p>William E. Burrows, M.A. is cofounder of the Alliance to Rescue Civilization (ARC), which seeks to move comprehensive data about Earth to a man-tended base off the planet to salvage civilization in the event of a near- or long-term catastrophe. He is also Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication and Director of Science and Environmental Reporting Program at New York University. His major interests are air, space, and national security reporting.</p>

             An earlier version of this article misstated when the prominent scientists Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen Hawking, Murray Gell-Mann, Oliver Sacks and Frank Wilczek attended gatherings hosted by Jeffrey E. Epstein. The events they attended occurred before Mr. Epstein’s 2008 conviction, not after it. The article also misstated the name of a group to which a charity established by Mr. Epstein donated $20,000 in 2011. It was the

            <p>
             Match.com is not only the most popular dating website on the planet; it’s the granddaddy of them all. This year, it celebrates its 20th anniversary – marking two decades since a little start-up suggested that Cupid’s arrow might strike through a screen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today, one in five new relationships and one in six marriages are estimated to begin online. The global online dating market is worth at least a billion dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Match.com was a flare from the future. It promised a clever algorithm, which used character traits and interests to pair users with their perfect partner. Within six months, 100,000 people had registered.
