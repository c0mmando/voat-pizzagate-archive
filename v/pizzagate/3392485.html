<p>Cue the Alliance to Rescue Civilization, a group that advocates a backup for humanity by way of a station on the Moon replete with DNA samples of all life on Earth, as well as a compendium of all human knowledge — the ultimate detached garage for a race of packrats. It would be run by people who, through fertility treatments and frozen human eggs and sperm, could serve as a new Adam and Eve in addition to their role as a new Noah.</p>
<p>Far from the lunatic fringe, the leaders of the alliance have serious careers: Robert Shapiro, the group’s founder, is a professor emeritus and senior research scientist in biochemistry at New York University; Ray Erikson runs an aerospace development firm in Boston and has been a NASA committee chair; Steven M. Wolfe, as a Congressional aide, drafted and helped pass the Space Settlement Act of 1988, which mandated that NASA plan a shift from space exploration to space colonization, and was executive director of the Congressional Space Caucus; William E. Burrows, an author of several books on space, is the director of the Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program at N.Y.U.</p>
<p>William E. Burrows, M.A. is cofounder of the Alliance to Rescue Civilization (ARC), which seeks to move comprehensive data about Earth to a man-tended base off the planet to salvage civilization in the event of a near- or long-term catastrophe. He is also Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication and Director of Science and Environmental Reporting Program at New York University. His major interests are air, space, and national security reporting.</p>

<p>Ray Erikson is the Principal Engineer for Flight Materials, Inc., a Boston-based consulting firm specializing in aerospace environments and effects, material system problem-solving, and new material system development. His background includes systems engineering, structural design, stress analysis and materials development work on the Shuttle, the Space Station, various unmanned NASA probes, Air Force missile warning satellites, and some other space systems. He holds a patent on the truss-hex solar concentrator for space power generation, and currently co-chairs the Space Infrastructure Committee of the NASA Aerospace Technology Working Group.</p>
<p>Steve Wolfe spent over five years as the legislative aide for space policy to the late Congressman George E. Brown, Jr. (D-CA). A high point of Wolfe’s career in Washington was the drafting and passage of the Space Settlement Act of 1988. Wolfe also served as Executive Director of the Congressional Space Caucus. In the 1990’s he built a career in the management of not-for-profit organizations, and currently serves as an executive for a major trade association based in New York City. Wolfe served on the Board of the National Space Society, his writing on space policy has appeared in The New York Times, Space News, Space Front, and Ad Astra. He has also appeared on radio and television speaking on space topics</p>

             An earlier version of this article misstated when the prominent scientists Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen Hawking, Murray Gell-Mann, Oliver Sacks and Frank Wilczek attended gatherings hosted by Jeffrey E. Epstein. The events they attended occurred before Mr. Epstein’s 2008 conviction, not after it. The article also misstated the name of a group to which a charity established by Mr. Epstein donated $20,000 in 2011. It was the

            <p>
             Match.com is not only the most popular dating website on the planet; it’s the granddaddy of them all. This year, it celebrates its 20th anniversary – marking two decades since a little start-up suggested that Cupid’s arrow might strike through a screen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today, one in five new relationships and one in six marriages are estimated to begin online. The global online dating market is worth at least a billion dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Match.com was a flare from the future. It promised a clever algorithm, which used character traits and interests to pair users with their perfect partner. Within six months, 100,000 people had registered.
