<p>I keep pondering these questions of Q which were posted last night on /pol:</p>
<p><strong>Is the House of Cards about to fall?</strong>
**
What are dominos? What is a cascade? What is the domino effect? This domino will come last.**</p>
<p>Q also talked about a map:</p>
<p><strong>What is a map? Why is a map useful? What is a legend? Why is a legend useful?</strong></p>
<p>1) The references to &quot;the house of cards&quot;. Of course this refers to the HBO series. Interesting that <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-08/latest-wikileaks-revelations">Zero Hedge</a> some time back thought this show was art imitating life and one of the actors, Doug Stamper, was John Podesta. I\'ve never watched it, so I don\'t know.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe when the anon told us to \'follow the cards&quot; the House of Cards show was what we were to follow.</strong></p>
<p>(Hat tip to the perspicacious and intrepid Commoner for this insight.)</p>
<p>The House of Cards show is mentioned several times in the Podesta emails. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55807">In an email entitled &quot;Fun Bus Mentions on Twitter,&quot;</a> Podesta\'s aide Milia Fisher sends John Podesta tweets about his Washington Post &quot;bus&quot; article and mentions that in a House of Cards episode, Kevin Spacey shoves a reporter in front of the train.  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And potentially the best of all. This is the official Twitter account for the Netflix show House of Cards. The Tweet is a reference to a particularly memorable scene in which Kevin Spacey\'s character kills a reporter by shoving her in front of an oncoming train...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This email is attached with a screenshot of the tweet from <a href="https://voat.co/user/HouseofCards">@HouseofCards</a>: 
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55807">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/55807</a> (the one marked: 5:21:18 PM png) which says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/user/johnpodesta">@johnpodesta</a> Buses we can do. It\'s subway trains we avoid. Bad memories . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/IsJA0">https://imgur.com/a/IsJA0</a></p>
<p>Another point is that &quot;card&quot; was supposed to be a code word in the Podesta emails. This was discussed at length <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1554174">in this thread</a> which was about Tony Podesta: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Saturday, December 26, 2015, Tony Podesta podesta@podesta.com wrote: &gt; Pull out two Sotheby\'s cards. 4 free admissions to Whitney &gt; Meet at home or there?????? &gt; &gt; Sent from my iPhone &gt; &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This led to speculation that he was talking about special VIP access cards to art museums.</p>
<p>FBI Anon <a href="https://churchmousec.wordpress.com/2016/11/04/fbi-anon-speaks-part-3/">gave these instructions</a> on &quot;Cards&quot; in the Podesta emails:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And, as an aisde, when you are reading Podesta’s e-mails, remember that the Clintons deal in weapons, drugs, and people. Some terminology in use is far more nefarious than many of you suspect.</p>
<p>“cards” [Child Abduction Rapid Deployment]</p>
<p>“favors”, “extras”, “officers”</p>
<p>[What next WikiLeaks will reveal] Evidence of favors for foreign nationals including the sale of human beings.</p>
<p>I know a lot of info regarding their movements of people and children.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2) The references to &quot;dominos&quot;. Two possible meanings to dominos:</p>
<p>a) a series of geopolitical events happening in a series and dependent upon each other. The<a href="https://search.wikileaks.org/gifiles/?q=domino&amp;mfrom=&amp;mto=&amp;title=&amp;notitle=&amp;date=&amp;nofrom=&amp;noto=&amp;count=50&amp;sort=0&amp;file=&amp;docid=&amp;relid=0#searchresult"> Stratfor guys</a> used &quot;dominos&quot; in this context to describe things going on in the world scene. They also sent out for Dominos pizza a lot, too, and one guy wrote a strange &quot;domino&quot; poem which we analyzed on VOAT.</p>
<p>b)&quot;Domino&quot; of course, could also mean, in my estimation, the most sinister and horrifying revelation of the Podesta emails---what many of us concluded was a perverted, sadistic pedophile game conducted in secluded mansions on the Labor Day weekend on Martha\'s Vineyard.</p>
<p>A series of Voat threads exploring the &quot;domino game&quot;:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1724087">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1724087</a></p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1481145">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1481145</a></p>
<p>Perhaps Q\'s reference to dominos conflates both meanings? That geopolitical events tied to the worst of the pedophiles\' activities are going down.</p>
<p>Very interesting that &quot;dominos&quot; and &quot;cards&quot; are mentioned together in Q\'s thread. If it\'s true that &quot;cards&quot; and &quot;dominos&quot; refer to the pedophile elites\' atrocities in art museums and on Martha\'s Vineyard, it would seem that exposing those criminal activities are the ultimate card to play in Trump\'s deck and that revelation would bring down their satanic house of cards more than anything.</p>
<p>It could literally cause a &quot;cascade&quot; of falling dominos.</p>
<p>3) The map reference is very intriguing because the black and white &quot;handkerchief map&quot; which Susan Sandler told John Podesta she thought was &quot;pizza-related&quot; was an especially sensational finding in the Podesta emails and caused a great deal of speculation. Of course, the legend to the notorious handkerchief was never discovered. That was the missing piece.</p>
<p>I\'ve always thought the black-and-white handkerchief map was related to dominos which are also black and white and may have been instructions to the &quot;dominos\' game which occurred in the same house the handkerchief map was found. Voat threads about it:</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1750186">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1750186</a></p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1522951">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1522951</a></p>
<p>I don\'t know about anyone else, but the &quot;domino&quot; game was for me the absolutely most terrifying and sinister discovery of the Podesta emails. That Q seems to be bringing up these references now is giving me the chills.</p>
<p>This is taking us back months, almost a year ago. I never thought I\'d be combing through the Podesta emails again, but that seems to be where this is pointing to, unless I\'m way off base.</p>
<p>But, for all of you autists: don\'t &quot;map&quot;, &quot;domino&quot;, &quot;card&quot; all ring bells? How many times did we sift through those darned emails looking for clues about them? Maybe our hard work then is going to pay off now.</p>
<p>(This is related to pizzagate because it is about references in the Podesta emails, the source of the Pizzagate phenomenon.)</p>',

           Perhaps Q's reference to dominos conflates both meanings? That geopolitical events tied to the worst of the pedophiles' activities are going down.
          </p>
          <p>
           Very interesting that "dominos" and "cards" are mentioned together in Q's thread. If it's true that "cards" and "dominos" refer to the pedophile elites' atrocities in art museums and on Martha's Vineyard, it would seem that exposing those criminal activities are the ultimate card to play in Trump's deck and that revelation would bring down their satanic house of cards more than anything.

           This is taking us back months, almost a year ago. I never thought I'd be combing through the Podesta emails again, but that seems to be where this is pointing to, unless I'm way off base.
          </p>
          <p>
           But, for all of you autists: don't "map", "domino", "card" all ring bells? How many times did we sift through those darned emails looking for clues about them? Maybe our hard work then is going to pay off now.

           (This is related to pizzagate because it is about references in the Podesta emails, the source of the Pizzagate phenomenon.)

            There were a few more theories.  Could it be "playing dominoes" could be something generic like "ordering pizza", except it just refers to their deviant orgies in general?

              I have no proof, but I believe it's possible Hillary learned a sadistic, evil variation of the game of dominoes during her many visits to Haiti and passed it on to John Podesta who taught it to the Sandlers. There is an email dated on the day before the realtor asks Susan about the handkerchief where Susan Sandler thanks John Podesta for teaching them the game and says she's getting a set. There is also talk of "Podesta rules" and "Sandler rules".

              I think you are over investigating the meaning of a word that simply stands for some BDSM house rules for pedos. (lets blindfold the kids and make them walk in circles obeying orders or whatever)

               Yes but these people dress up in costumes and have elaborate rituals and ceremonies. This has been documented thousands of times. Their theme is domination through fear and abuse. Dressing up like Darth Vader is one of their favorite things to do in order to add drama and trauma. Its part of the satanic schtick. The word "domino" means Lord Dominator or Lord Destroyer in a nutshell. So i'm not sure what you are missing about the word domino meaning, basically, "i am your dominant lord and you will obey me." It is BDSM with added fear and drama through ritual practice.

                 We didn't know it until I made that post several months ago as far as I know. But that doesn't matter.

                 It seems like we are saying the same thing to me. We are both saying that "domino" is a code word for their activities of dominating and abusing other people. So what am I missing? Is there something else here that I am not seeing? Maybe I am missing a clue somewhere? Not arguing just interested.
