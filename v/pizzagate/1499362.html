            "While [Bounce CEO Adam] Breeden wouldn't share names, AceBounce promised a big-name chef to oversee the kitchen and an award-winning mixologist who will handle cocktails. They'll serve American food, so don't expect English touches on the menu. Over in London, where the spots are routinely packed with young, urban fun seekers, they serve pizzas from a wood-burning oven."

              Ping pong and pizza are both very cheap. What you do is you spend money on making them seem special and charge more.

              Consider the popularity of "Pho" which is essentially garbage meat soup.

             And in a way, that's the point; you don't have to be a prodigy to get enjoyment from table tennis. Bounce, a cool new London ping-pong hangout, deliberately targets big groups to come and play, and maybe have a drink and some food.
Not that some don't take it seriously. One of last year's very best documentaries, Hugh Hartford's film Ping Pong, was about eight elderly champions. Octogenarians in the main, they'd probably thrash people half their age. In Berlin, the city credited with encouraging ping-pong's hipster credentials, there are outdoor, all-weather tables in most parks - and the Dr Pong bar only really gets going at midnight.
Dr Pong's loosely translated motto is "conversation, participation and unmitigated happiness". With aims such as that, no wonder table tennis is in rude health.
