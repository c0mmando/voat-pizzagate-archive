             Because Pegasus location with his other properties aligns with DC underground tunnels used by them for trafficking children as evidenced by this:

              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1551878
             </a>
             They even hide talk about it in plain sight as evidenced here: https:// www.sick chirpse. com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kill-room.png They talk about Pegasus there, "lining it up" with something obviously. Also at least five disappearances of kids in DC align with positions of those tunnels:

              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1743876
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             With creepy carpenter Justin Barrows ( he build Comet Ping Pong ) was talking about finding a human scalp near his place on P street - aligns with tunnels perfectly. If you don;'t know who Justin Barrows is - check this out:

              You can look into something like a museum being a killroom where Alefantis is raping and murdering children in satanic rituals with ZERO evidence to back that up...just like you can look into Obama being a Reptilian, the world being flat or other conspiracy nonsense.

               "or other conspiracy nonsense." What conspiracy nonsense? Formation of conspiracies are part of human nature, are you a humanist or something?
              </p>
              <p>
               You are also poisoning the well by associating legitimate PG research and researchers with wild hypotheses which aren't even necessarily conspiracy theories. Some of them are just theories, such as Flat Earth. The PG theory is well supported by evidence. Flat Earth is not, though it is an understandable belief given that humans throughout all ages of the Earth have believed the Earth was flat.

                Those types of claims DO NOT PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF A CHILD SEX RING OPERATING AT CPP IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM.

                 Correction, the Pizza code from Wikileaks and confirmed by dark web users and linked to the popular sexualization of children is definitive proof on its own of child sex trafficking. All the concurring evidence, including the very few pieces you've listed, support that claim. Besta Pizza was proven to have a basement as it was captured on video by an anti-pizzagate investigator.  The Podesta's friendship with Alefantis, the pizza shop owner who for some reason is the 50th most powerful person in DC, is suspect seeing that the Podestas have a very keen interest in child sex abuse, cannibalism and serial murders based on their "artwork" which would not even have been legal to possess or create in our republic 200 years ago.

                 Victims have come forward about all sorts of scandals, such as Franklin Scandal, MK-Ultra, Monarch, other pizza fronts, elite families, satanic ritual abuse, etc. CPP is a front with customers from high places, the victims are not likely from the US and furthermore are just children. I expect victims coming forward to be rare and dangerous for them. Nobody believes children anyway, as seen by the "Satanic Panic" propaganda operation where the pseudoscientific "False Memory Syndrome" was invented to discredit victims.

                  is definitive proof of child sex trafficking. Imagine the disconnect from reality happening here. Well it's no wonder you believe that there are all sorts of pizzagate evidence lying around if this is the standard of evidence that you're working with. This type of ignorance and inability to discern fact from obvious falsehoods was totally necessary for buying into something like pizzagate.

                 <p>
                  Why haven't you fact checked that obviously bogus code? It took me abut 10 seconds when I first heard out about it to realize that it was total bs. 4 years later and you're still duped into believing it's a legit code? Do you even care if what you believe is true or not?

                  Specific pizzagate distortion of facts, there isn't any evidence supporting this claim. Probably based on claiming that some paintings in Podesta's house depict child sexual abuse, which is false. Typical pizzagate fuckery of distorting facts to make the accused people look bad, when even if true, even if Podesta was caught downloading cp of the internet, that still wouldn't prove the existence of a child sex ring operating at CPP in any way shape or form.

                  When even if it did, that still would not prove the existence of a child sex ring operating at CPP in any way shape or form. Just pause and think for a second about how insane it is to accuse people of kidnapping raping and murdering children based on their taste in arts.

                 <p>
                  Every single piece of pizzagate "evidence" is built on falsehoods, distortion of facts and complete non sequiturs. On stuff like trying to distort a fact to make it look like something else to make the accused people look bad, when even if it was true, that still wouldn't prove the existence of a child sex ring operating at CPP in any way shape or form.

                  Who are you kidding here? If you had any type of real evidence of a crime here, you could have taken it to law authorities and be taken seriously. You pizzagaters could have easily hired a private investigator to look into CPP during all these years...why haven't you done that? Because the private investigator would have instantly recognize the blatant conspiracy insanity happening here?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Bottom line, the only real perpetrators here were you pizzagaters, who because of your complete ignorance and inability to discern fact from fiction helped spread absurd false accusations and conspiracy insanity that led to innocent people being threatened and harassed.

                    No i didn't simply dismiss it, I realized that it was false after a simple google search. There wasn't any evidence showing that codeword list was discovered by law authorities or by Wikileaks or that was extensively used by pedophiles.

                   <p>
                    A simple google search was all it took yet many pizzagaters spent years believing that codeword list was discovered by law authorities or that was a known pedophile codeword list without bothering once to fact check it.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Furthermore many pizzagaters not only refused to fact check that codeword list, but straight up refused to accept that it didn't have any legitimacy behind it when someone pointed that out to them and made up all sorts of mental gymnastics just to circumvent that.

                    I'm not just talking about local police here. Because the pile of crap that you call evidence is entirely made up by things like distorting facts, falsehoods, half truths, taking things out of context, photoshopping pictures etc. containing no real evidence of a crime or that logically supports the pizzagate conclusion, it was/is totally useless.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    You could not have taken that pile of crap to any police station anywhere, or to any institution that combats child trafficking or to any private detective office and be taken seriously.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Simply put, that pile of crap that you call evidence won't work anywhere outside your irrational conspiracy theory circle.

                   <p>
                    I'm sorry but in the real world official police investigations don't get launched into ridiculous conspiracy theories with no evidence of a real crime behind them.

                   <p>
                    Using this fact as evidence that somehow the police(and the FBI, the media, and basically any institution that combats child trafficking that would not have taken you seriously based on that pile of crap) is in on it is laughable, and shows the distorted pattern of thinking that pizzagaters use of rationalizing everything in a way that fits their narrative.

                   <p>
                    You are living in your own bubble of reality and are basically forced to invent all these rationalizations about how everyone is involved in this mass murdering of children operation, basically just how a flat earther must invent all sorts of mental gymnastics and claim that everyone(world governments, scientists, the media etc.) is involved in covering up that the world is flat.

                   <p>
                    Which is a real crime that has real evidence behind it, not non sequitur-esc shit like claiming "person X has a general creepiness surrounding his house therefore this proves that he has harassed CPP staff." No, actual evidence like victim testimonies or videos of the harassment.

                    "Antinous has attracted attention from the homosexual subculture since the 18th century, the most illustrious examples for this being Prince Eugene of Savoy and Frederick the Great of Prussia.[97] Vout noted that Antinous came to be identified as "a gay icon".[105] Novelist and independent scholar Sarah Waters identified Antinous as being "at the forefront of the homosexual imagination" in late 19th-century Europe."

                    For the sole purpose of making the accused look bad or like pedophiles. While accusing them of abducting raping and murdering children and having zero evidence that shows that.

                    That's right. Because none of the things used as "evidence" for pizzagate supports this conclusion. You can easily debunk every piece of "evidence" showed in the executive summary of Pizzagate evidence by adding the line:
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    "Which doesn't prove the existence of a child sex ring operating at CPP in any way shape or form."

                   <p>
                    behind it and showing the total disconnect in logic from the claim to the conclusion that it's trying to prove.

                    And what do you mean for the sake of? Are you actually so detached from reality that after 4 years you still believe that arrests will materialize out of this dumb conspiracy theory? In that case, let me give you a reality check:
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Pizzagaters could/can circumvent logic and reason all they want, but the real world consequences of pizzagate being a fictitious conspiracy theory remain a fact:
                   </p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>
                     <p>
                      Hillary, Obama, Podesta, Tamera Luzzato, Marina Abramovic, James Alefantis, CPP staff and bands that played there etc. will never be arrested and tried for being part of an satanic child sex ring.
                     </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     <p>
                      Pizzagate will never be taken seriously by law authorities, the media mainstream or independent, fact checking sites, or by just about any source that isn't in the business of propping up dumb conspiracy theories. On the contrary, if it will ever be mentioned again(unlikely since it died long ago) it will always be ridiculed and labeled as fictitious or used as an example of how ignorance and stupidity can lead to real world consequences, like CPP staff being threatened and harassed.
                     </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                     <p>
                      You will never be able to use your "mountains of evidence" in court or in front of law authorities.
                     </p>
                    </li>
                   </ol>
                   <p>
                    All you pizzagaters could ever do is talk nonsense in echo chambers of conspiracy insanity like this subverse and expect arrests that obviously won't happen while reality went on independent of your irrational beliefs. Deal with it.

                     I did not accuse you of anything, least of all pedophilia or child abuse or being a shill. I was voicing a question of whether you might be acting out of your political party's interests (the Left). I assume you are politically on the Left by the following:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                     <li>
                      "Hillary, Obama, Podesta, Tamera Luzzato, Marina Abramovic, James Alefantis, CPP staff and bands that played there etc. will never be arrested and tried for being part of an satanic child sex ring."
Of course not. Only the Q crowd says otherwise.....these problems run too deep. That's the argument we're making here. Also, no arrests is a miscarriage of justice and nothing more. This happens in the political world all the time and the occurrence of political figures and celebrities getting away with crimes is well publicized in mainstream journals.
                     </li>
                     <li>
                      "Pizzagate will never be taken seriously by law authorities, the media mainstream or independent, fact checking sites, or by just about any source that isn't in the business of propping up dumb conspiracy theories." This is why I implicated you as being influenced by your party. You are completely lacking in skepticism of and indeed very amiable to mainstream news sources, fact checking sites (Snopes being funded by Soros if you cared to check) and any source that confirms your worldview.

                      "You will never be able to use your "mountains of evidence" in court or in front of law authorities." I think this is accurate, as circumstantial evidence cannot be used in court, however, whether or not evidence can be used in court has no causal relation to whether an event happened or not. For investigators, a great amount of circumstantial evidence builds a Cumulative Case argument in which it becomes irrational to not draw a conclusion pointed to by said evidence, regardless of whether the crime is prosecutable. There are many law enforcement tools which are not admissible in court which are used in the course of investigations, such as lie-detector tests and statement analysis. The latter can be used to trap defendants giving testimony of the event in question by the words they choose to describe the event which can indicate guilt. Convictions have followed in many cases. Admissions and confessions have followed police interviews where the subject's written testimony is analyzed and they are caught in their own words.

                     The basis for the concept of someone's "taste" in art or music indicating their preferences and beliefs is not a new idea. Jesus Christ in Mat.15 says, "[18] But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     [19] For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And in Matthew 12:34:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     <strong>
                      The spirit of this principle is that people show outward signs of their inwards beliefs.
                     </strong>
                     This principle can be extended to any type of expression and not just words. I'm simply believing they are interested in those things. The fact that someone is interested in cannibalism and child abuse may not be admissible in court, but is well enough evidence to start an investigation, which these days will not happen but in the Founding days would certainly have happened.

                  Not that I see.  If you scroll to the bottom where the map shows and give it 10 seconds, the road map will change to a property map.  You can click the different parcels and then use the &gt; next to info to see who the owner is.  I didn't see any adjacent properties owned by Castellum Achilles or similar entity.

                   ok.. thanks...  I do remember searching his LLC and coming up empty. But did searches on the owners brought up associations. I'm sure there has been lots of changes since then.
