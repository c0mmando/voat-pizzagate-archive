<p>Some background on The Pink Room case: When the Mornington Peninsula child-care-centre case broke, an investigative journalist infiltrated an elite child-pornography and pedophile club based in Melbourne. Its members were all wealthy and elite members of Melbourne society. It was chaired by the CEO of a major Melbourne Charitable Trust.</p>
<p>The children from the Mornington Peninsula child-care-centre reported being taken to a &quot;pink&quot; room with a spa and other significant decor. It was in a house where the children were sexually abused, tortured and filmed (amongst other locations). Three children independently identified the house that they had been taken to, to the investigators. Sure enough, the room had been painted a dusty-pink color, and it had a spa and the other decor items described by the children. However, as you now know, no further action was taken against the owner of the child-care-centre, nor others suspected of being involved in the ring. What is most significant however, is that the pink house WAS REGISTERED TO THE VICTORIA POLICE!!</p>
<p>It\'s hard finding info on this case, as the sickos have made art exhibits, stores all with the name &quot;pink room&quot; since then to cover their tracks, much like the Discovery Channel documentary &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot; on child abuse was scrapped and the sickos followed it with a documentary on marital domestic violence called &quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot;. Anyway, the pedos got busted partly because of the distinctive room. The elite have houses and show off their money and taste with distinctive decor. So here\'s the plan:</p>
<p>Ask under FOIA for photos of all rooms used in the pedo films, snuff films etc. which FBI has.</p>
<p>Publish these photos</p>
<p>Ask everyone if they have seen similar rooms (such as cleaning staff who may have cleaned the room)</p>
<p>Do background check on the person who owns the house</p>
<p>Inform authorities + media.</p>
<p>What do you think of this idea?
Yeah here\'s a source for the info for the pink room:

The connection between the Pink Room and Pizzagate is that the investigative technique used to bust the Mornington Peninsula pedophile ring can be reused for Pizzagate. Here\'s a source for the FBI using room photos to identify sex traffickers so the FBI should support us with this endeavor:

Goodluck getting it accepted by moderators. Maybe the authorities don\'t want this thread succeeding ... sorry for any blockback caused, I did warn &quot;for those who are brave&quot; ...</p>',

            This is a great idea. I watched the Scully documentary yesterday and matching the rooms/furniture etc is EXACTLY how they caught him..over multiple properties. That was one sick fuck.
