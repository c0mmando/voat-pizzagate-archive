<p>Zion was said to be the last Human city on Earth, built underground. The Humans there believed they were the resistance. They were the freedom fighters. The redpilled. They were on the right path, to be saved by &quot;The One&quot; who would show them the way and lead them to victory.</p>
<p>Sounds like Q right?</p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Zion">https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Zion</a></p>
<p><a href="https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/The_One">https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/The_One</a></p>
<p>However Zion was a trap. The machines let Zion be built, let a fake resistance be built, in order to control Humanity. The people who thought they were freedom fighters were still slaves to the Matrix and the machines, just in a bit different way. The redpill they took to awaken in the real world turned out to be just as fake as the blue pill.</p>
<p>&quot;The Architect tells the story differently. According to the Architect, Zion is in fact a place allowed to exist by the Machines as a form of control. Although 1% of the population subconsciously reject the Matrix, only a small fraction of that 1% are actually freed from the Matrix to become a citizen of Zion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Zion is a control measure designed specifically as a society expecting a messiah figure. This expectation, which is created by the Oracle\'s prophecy, helps to ensure that when the next One arrives on the scene that they will treat him as a messiah and cause him to eventually believe that he is the One.&quot;</p>
<p>Do you know what happens when Zion gets to a certain population? They get exterminated and the cycle resets.</p>
<p>&quot;This is because of the Architect\'s need for the One to take the code he carries (consisting of the rejections of 1% of the population) to the Source to be disseminated. This temporarily brings the Matrix to 100% acceptance, which will allow the Architect to perform a reload of the system.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be pointed out that the real threat to the Matrix is not Zion, but the systemic anomaly created by 1% of the population subconsciously rejecting the Matrix. Zion\'s location is always known by the Architect, as it is rebuilt in the exact same location as the previous Zion. With each iteration, the Machines get better and better at destroying it. It is allowed to exist only as long as it is needed. Once the One is found, trained and sent on the Path of the One to the Architect\'s chamber, Zion is scheduled for destruction. Most of the agents of the system are not privy to this information and act out accordingly.&quot;</p>
<p>Humanity in the matrix, and the one who leads them, are all being controlled. They are controlled opposition and don\'t even know it. They celebrate waking up from the Matrix and going to the real world, but it\'s just another level of control.</p>
<p>Take this information as you must. This is not anti Q and I welcome your thoughts. It is concerning however how much emphasis Q puts on this movie series, being as the plot is about subjugation and controlled opposition.</p>',

            Reading too much into this reference IMO. Faggots like Wilcock on youtube and boomer soccer moms are driving the dates thing. Q's never mentioned anything of such things. It's called rides on the coat tails. I wish however Anons would scrutinise Wilcock as much as they did Corsi.

            I don't view this kind of stuff as black pilled, in fact I think it is the opposite.  THIS is the answer to ppl who think they don't have to pay taxes or can make their own currency: sure we are all slaves of a system but everyone always has been so the best answer is to live a good life within the confines you have to work within

             that argument is redundant due to the fact that neo is able to use his mind powers from inside the matrix while outside of it, showing clearly that they're still in a simulation and that zion in fact is just the overflow.

                 There is a relationship to the physical, but not in the terms you are referring to, like physical predetermined location.
                </p>
                <p>
                 God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are persons with physical human bodies. That's why the ultimate reality, that contains physical, emotional and spiritual dimensions, can't be replaced by any single minded individuals(wicked) using lies, corruption, deception, quantum computer simulations, virtual realities, etc, because the ultimate reality unfolds from the relationship of three individuals that although have separate bodies share a 'magical' spiritual connection that can't be explained in the physical dimension by science, which is like a 3 way quantum entanglement of their souls into the one unified spirit of creation (God Almighty). This is an eternal cosmic constant (although eternal is not the right word because it’s outside time and space, above all that can be perceived) at the foundation of creation itself and all that was created, it’s the mind of God, pure consciousness, the source of the divine will that manifests itself through all possible dimensions, like biology, physics, technology, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In order to understand the role and attributes of the ultimate reality you can check what the Bible says:
                </p>
                <p>
                 John 14:16 And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate to be with you FOREVER 17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot receive Him, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. But you do know Him, for He abides with you and will be in you.
                </p>
                <p>
                 John 14:26 But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                 John 15:26 “When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.
                </p>
                <p>
                 2 Corinthians 3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Isaiah 9:6 For to us a child is born,
                </p>
                <p>
                 to us a son is given,
                </p>
                <p>
                 and the government will be on his shoulders.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And he will be called
                </p>
                <p>
                 Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
                </p>
                <p>
                 EVERLASTING Father, Prince of Peace.
                </p>
                <p>
                 7 Of the greatness of his government and peace
                </p>
                <p>
                 there will be no end.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He will reign on David’s throne
                </p>
                <p>
                 and over his kingdom,
                </p>
                <p>
                 establishing and upholding it
                </p>
                <p>
                 with justice and righteousness
                </p>
                <p>
                 from that time on and FOREVER.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The zeal of the Lord Almighty
                </p>
                <p>
                 will accomplish this.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Isaiah 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. 15 He will be eating curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, 16 for before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's clear that the third person of the Godhead, The Holy Spirit, is the ultimate reality. No one can reach the ultimate reality except through Jesus: John 14:6 Jesus answered, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In this ultimate reality (which is the equivalent of the 'Zion' that the lost souls of jewish descent are trying to establish on Earth by their own corrupt means), God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are real people.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This ultimate reality has nothing to do with a physical location and it can't be established through human efforts alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The only way you can reach it is through networking, by creating relationships based on love and truth with the people AROUND you, starting with your family. As your network expands, it will transform you into something more than what you were when being all by yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When you become like Jesus (sacrificing yourself for the network you created), only then you can actually meet Jesus himself (the original version) in human form (you might not know it's Him, Revelation 16:15 Behold, I am coming like a thief).
                </p>
                <p>
                 As you grow even more and prove yourself to be not only loving but also wise, you will meet God through Jesus, and only after that you will have the chance of meeting The Holy Spirit (the Spirit of Truth, Immanuel, host of the ultimate reality).
                </p>
                <p>
                 If your intentionality is aligned with the intentionality of God and His plans, you will have the opportunity to meet The Holy Spirit (Immanuel), the host of the ultimate reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The ultimate reality can't be modeled in the physical world or fully comprehended by any human, nor can any spiritual force (group of people united by a certain purpose) become aware of its presence, unless The Holy Spirit himself decides to make you aware of it. But not even then you won't be able to contain it with your mind or emotions, it will overwhelm you completely, you will be stunned, but you will be released from it so you can go back to your own limited version of reality, and you will only remember glimpses of it, you will know you are part of something far greater than you can ever imagine, but the emotional and spiritual impact of the experience will be forever imprinted in your soul.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Many individuals have tried to replicate the ultimate reality through all means possible and place themselves as God, but that is just insanity, Jesus explained it in this verse:
                </p>
                <p>
                 Luke 6:40 A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.
                </p>
                <p>
                 No one can become greater than the Holy Spirit, Jesus and God, the Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace, but they can become like them by following the teachings of Jesus and obeying to the point where they sacrifice their own life if needed. There's a deep mystery about sacrificing your life, but that's something that everyone needs to experience by themselves and it's completely personal to everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                 No mathematical model, quantum computer simulation or virtual reality can ever encapsulate the ultimate reality (that unfolds from The Holy Spirit, Jesus and God) because all these means of understanding are like the disciples that follow the master and can never become greater than the master.
                </p>
                <p>
                 To become greater than The Holy Spirit, the host of the ultimate reality, implies completely overriding the free will of all creation, becoming the absolute truth yourself, and by becoming the absolute truth you replace your own freedom with enslavement, because when the lie that you created becomes the truth, you will no longer have the freedom that the truth alone can provide, thus becoming a perpetual slave, enslaved by your own deception. This is the fate of the wicked, they will not understand anything of what was just revealed, to them wisdom is insanity and insanity is wisdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Daniel 12:10 Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. NONE of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you don't understand what I said so far, you are not worthy to mention or talk about the truth, love, power or wisdom, nor call others liars, do not play with fire, you will burn like the rotten wood you are, do it at your own peril but know you have been warned.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So all other questions you are asking aren't really worth asking anymore. The only question you should ask yourself is: Am I on the right path to be accepted in the ultimate reality? Do my thoughts, emotions, actions and intentionality recommend me or condemn me when compared to Jesus? That's the only way, the narrow path.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Matthew 7:13 Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14 But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it. 15 Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 16 By their fruit you will recognize them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 17 Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 So then, by their fruit you will recognize them.

              It looks a bit to me like Q is agreeing with you -- that the movie depicts a reality about people being kept like farm animals for purposes of the elite, not that he is covering that up or promoting a false awakening.

            Zion is another word for the Pinnacle. It's the collective ideal of the Jews. It's literally the top of the hierarchy. So high up that it's holy. Zion is not what's happening with Q. Q is a distributed information network that drives the social idea within the greater community. It's literally the opposite of Zion. It's a rebuff of the typical power hierarchy that produces the one in the first place.
           </p>
           <p>
            The entire idea of Q is to take charge of your own life and your own abilities and capabilities. To contribute and be vested in the ebb and flow of society instead of distracted and farmed for your energy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Zion, in the case of the movie The matrix, would be the cult that feeds into the hierarchy. The top of the cult is literally Satan which would be the architect.
           </p>
           <p>
            The way to break the system is the collectivizes will of the people, built upon a foundation of love. That is exactly what Q is doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The metaphor is all twisted in your analysis.

             The cycle is a reference to the cults need to break free of it's reliance on blackmail.

             Inherently blackmail requires the THREAT of exposure to the greater community, otherwise known as the light.

             Once the power games stretches so far that it's ready to attempt to step out of the shadows and rule as gods, cataclysm occurs. They can't do it. They become unstable, the people's vision strikes them at the last minute destroying them, and the society built upon the hierarchy collapses. Cycle starts anew...

              The architect is the "idea" of Satan from the people of Zions perspective. The all powerful game maker. The figurative personification of the top of the hill. That's why the one is idolized because he is the first to step into the godly realm, only to be stopped by a cataclysm.

             It does and it doesn't.  Any Christian "Qtards" (of which there are many) DON'T see Trump/Q/Q+ as a "messianic" figure, or certainly ought not idolize them too much.  Objectively Q has given us plenty of behind the scenes info we may not have gotten; otherwise it is a moral boost/time waster.

             For what it's worth, I believe Q first mentioned that in November 2017. He has always said dates will never be telegraphed. It's anons doing that, not Q.

              The Matrix draws from several themes, most of which are in the Bible:  Zion, Nebuchadnezzar, “the One” (ie. The Messiah or savior).  The reality is that many stories and or narratives are made up of other ideas and concepts that preceded them. Q referring to the Matrix in the sense he did, was for the purpose of making the point that deep state scum have been harvesting the energy (or worse) of vulnerable human beings for their evil lusts. Does it have to be anything more than that?

               This may all refer to parts of the bible but I must admit there is a distinct lack of mentioning Jesus in Q posts in addition to the Glamis calling posts indicating the probability of a controlled narrative that makes me believe this is a "Great and Secret Show" for the masses, but the real followers of Jesus know the real deal: Everything ahead of He whom we shall meet in the air, is a fake. We are in the great awakening because we were asleep to something. Check yourself.
