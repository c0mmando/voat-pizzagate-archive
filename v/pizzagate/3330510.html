<p><strong>He Said Not to Tell Anyone‚Äù: How Trump Kept Tabs on Jeffrey Epstein</strong></p>
<p>In the months before he ran for president, Donald Trump was in conversation with National Enquirer owner David Pecker about his old acquaintance, Jeffrey Epstein, and how his sexual abuse scandal might affect the Clintons. </p>
<h1 id="md-trump-said-that-pecker-had-told-him-that-the-pictures-of-clinton-that-epstein-had-from-his-island-were-worse-recalls-a-former-trump-organization-employee.">‚ÄúTrump said that Pecker had told him that the pictures of Clinton that Epstein had from his island were worse,‚Äù recalls a former Trump Organization employee.</h1>
<p>Perhaps the most revealing commentary Donald Trump has offered on Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who pleaded not guilty this week to sex trafficking and conspiracy, occurred in late February 2015, onstage at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. </p>
<p>Trump, then flirting with a presidential run, was fielding softballs from Fox News host Sean Hannity when a lightning round of questions turned to a favorite topic: Bill Clinton. ‚ÄúNice guy, Trump said. ‚ÄúGot a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island with Jeffrey Epstein,‚Äù he added, seemingly veering off topic. ‚ÄúLot of problems.‚Äù</p>
<p>Over the previous several weeks, the National Enquirer had published a string of stories about Epstein, including a ‚Äúworld exclusive‚Äù interview with one of his accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who said in court documents that Epstein forced her to have sex with him at his Palm Beach home. </p>
<p>She told the tabloid that Epstein paid her to have sex with Britain‚Äôs Prince Andrew, one of an expansive retinue of high-flying elites who enjoyed Epstein‚Äôs company and took advantage of his private jet. </p>
<p><strong>Another was Clinton, who the Enquirer reported had traveled with Epstein‚Äôs assistant to Epstein‚Äôs private island in the Caribbean.</strong> (Clinton denies ever traveling to Little St. James Island, but has confirmed that he traveled with Epstein several times in 2002 and 2003, including a trip to Africa on behalf of the Clinton Foundation.)</p>
<p>In the week or so leading up to his CPAC speech, David Pecker, who owned the Enquirer until it was sold in ruin earlier this year, visited Trump on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, bringing along an issue with a Prince Andrew and Epstein-related cover, according to people familiar with the meeting. </p>
<p>Trump‚Äôs lawyer, Michael Cohen, who would later go to prison in part for his role in these hush money schemes, was in the room when Pecker sat down. Pecker, he later told me, used to send him articles and issues before they were published so that he and Trump could read them. </p>
<p>After the meeting Trump called in Sam Nunberg, then a Trump Organization employee, who saw Pecker leaving Trump‚Äôs office. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúMichael was sitting in there when I came in, and the issue of the National Enquirer with the pictures of Prince Andrew was on his desk,‚Äù Nunberg recalled. ‚ÄúHe said not to tell anyone, but that Pecker had just been there and had brought the issue with him. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Trump said that Pecker had told him that the pictures of Clinton that Epstein had from his island were worse.‚Äù</strong> </p>
<p><em>(Cohen, speaking by phone from the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville, corroborated Nunberg‚Äôs version of the events, though he declined to add any additional information about the meeting.)</em></p>
<p>(The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)</p>
