            Ok, I met the head of the Bandidos (the biker group) a few days after the shooting. He said that they rode into an ambush. The police shooters were on the roof, and opened fire as they rode in. All of his guys were shot between the eyes, or in the heart. They were supposed to meet with a new biker gang, that he says were young Mexican immigrants, trained and supplied by the police. These guys had been trying to pick a fight w/the Bandidos, and they were riding in to tell these young guys that they were being used, and set up. If you look at the rival gang in pics from that day, they all have new vests, and short haircuts. There was no shootout. Just a set-up. I tried to get him in to talk to Alex Jones, or  Joyce Riley, and he said that they have a rule against talking to the press. I guess they are relaxing that rule now, b/c this guy in the clip talked. They had better come out and defend themselves, in my opinion. Not that Bandidos are all great guys. I asked him about the atrocities they had committed back in the 70's, (kidnapping, torture, rape) and he said they did some sick stuff when they first got back from 'nam. Most now, seem like this guy in the clip, hard working, responsible, riding for fun. However, in the old days, they had their girlfriends working at strip clubs, and turning tricks. If they found it on 1or 2 guy's phones, could be real. All the phones? No.

            the DA announces they found kiddie porn on the phones seized and illegally searched at the event. but curiously,, they haven't gone after these people's home computers OR searched their houses,, which spells 'planted evidence' to smear credibility.

             Does somebody need to set up a gofundme for these guys for legal assistance?  I am not a biker lover but am always in favor of fairness no matter who it is. I would do it but am not too handy at the tech stuff.
