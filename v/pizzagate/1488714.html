<p>I noticed that Old Vic Tunnels was listed and started looking into that and found that U.S. President Bill Clinton did a fundraiser there, amongst other interesting details: Theatre Delicatessen performed &quot;A Midsummer Night\'s Dream&quot; this is very tied in to the world system administrators, their secret language is Shakespeare. Some of the performances done there: Les Enfants Terribles, New York Dolls, Phil Mann, National Youth Theatre of Great Britain. </p>

<p>I noticed that the Old Vic Tunnels were taken over by the &quot;House of Vans&quot;, interesting. I used to skateboard myself yet always hated Vans sneakers because of their icky likeness to the super cheap K-mart skips that existed back then. I started looking into Vans and ties to pedophilia and then found out that, unknown to me was that in the 1980\'s popular culture was aware of &quot;the pedophile van&quot;. Basically a white van with tinted windows. </p>

<p>&quot;A large, older van, typically brown or white in color, and often with tinted front windows and no windows in the back.&quot;</p>
<p>Interesting, the Old Vic Tunnels - &quot;art tunnels&quot; taken over by <strong>Vans</strong> - a company catering to children\'s footwear needs, who converted the sketchy Old Vic Tunnels into a playground place for children to play and interact. </p>
<p>I then turned on the TV to Wheel of Fortune, and noticed Vanna White. Playing around with her name we get - A WHITE VANN, interesting. The other host is Pat Sajak: pat - pat a child? sajak - &quot;say little boy, can you give me directions to ...&quot; [get in the van you are] [hi]jack[ed]? &lt;&lt;--- Say - Jacking -- hijacking by social engineering.</p>
<p>Maybe it\'s something directly, maybe not, but what I do know is that the world administrators like to put reinforcement ideas out in seemingly innocuous settings.</p>',

           Interesting, the Old Vic Tunnels - "art tunnels" taken over by

           </strong>
           - a company catering to children's footwear needs, who converted the sketchy Old Vic Tunnels into a playground place for children to play and interact.
