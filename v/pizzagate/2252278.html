             Freddie Starr is an English comedian who became famous in the early 1970s. He is also an impressionist and singer. In 2011 he was a contestant on I'm A Celebrity and in October 2012 he denied claims that he groped a girl of 14 in Jimmy Savile’s dressing room. Comic Freddie Starr 'flees to Spain' owing £1million legal bill. Australian-born Rolf Harris is a former children's entertainer, artist and convicted paedophile. He was known for playing unusual instruments including the wobble-board and once painted a portrait of the Queen. He was arrested under Operation Yewtree and later found guilty of 12 historic sex attacks on girls as young as seven. Police officers indulge in simulated sex in order to be trendy and demonstrate his multi-cultural credentials during the Caribbean inspired Notting Hill carnival, Parents' horror as prankster dressed as convicted paedophile Rolf Harris and holding 'I love Jimmy Savile' poster WINS carnival fancy dress prize. British police fails to stop street crime, rapes, moslem kidnapping drug gangs, rather focuses on "hate speech". Amnesty International is arguing that the 1970's pedophile scandal at the Kincora Boys Home in Ireland that was reportedly known to local authorities as well as to leading MI5 and MI6 agents should allow the charges of victims Gary Hoy, Richard Kerr and Clint Massey to be included as a significant element in the Jimmy Savile pedophile investigation. In England there were Rotherham pedophile islamic gangs, thousnads of people raped, it has been suggested that since pedophilia is an accepted practice in the Muslim Ummah along with child marriage and incest, its tolerance and eventual legalization is being used to help with the Islamization of the west and also to herald the introduction of sharia law. What kind of corruption connects to Latin Americas? During a familial succession unique in Latin America, backed by the gangster-like National Guard (Guardia Nacional), essentially a private army, plus dependable financial and military support from the U.S. government, the triad dominated Nicaragua from 1936 to 1979, monopolizing nearly every industry and natural resource in the country, from railroads to the skin trade, while looting it from the peaks of its volcanoes to the dirt floors of its poorest farmers. In Italy, the Weinstein scandal has been front-page news ever since it broke because Italian actress Asia Argento was one of the main, named accusers in an expose by The New Yorker.Her accusation of rape generated a hostile backlash at home, with Italian newspaper editorials and commentary accusing her of creating trouble. But the scandal has taken on new life with accusations by 10 women that an Italian television and film director, Fausto Brizzi, molested them. An investigative TV show reported initial accusations without naming the director last month, but in a follow-up report Sunday named Brizzi. He has strenuously denied having non-consensual sex. In South Africa, former member of parliament Jennifer Ferguson came forward to allege she was raped in 1993 by Danny Jordaan, president of the country’s soccer association. Jordaan denied the accusation. The founder of Montreal’s renowned “Just for Laughs” comedy festival recently stepped down as president of the organization following allegations from at least nine women he either sexually harassed or sexually assaulted them. In Peru, this year’s beauty pageant to select the country’s candidate for the Miss Universe competition was a surprise venue for denouncing gender-based violence against women. Instead of citing their body measurements, as is customary, each of the 23 contestants recounted frightening statistics about the mistreatment of women in the South American nation. Twenty people have now made allegations of inappropriate behaviour against Kevin Spacey, the majority from his time as the Old Vic’s artistic director. Fourteen of the allegations are so serious that complainants have been advised to go to the police.
            </p>
            <p>
             Managers at the Old Vic say they are sorry they did not create an environment in which people felt they could speak out if they were receiving unwanted attention. This failure has been put down to a “cult of personality” around the actor. Speaking at Cheltenham Literature Festival, Jeremy said that as a dad of two young daughters he finds Savile's actions 'completely disgusting.'
            </p>
            <p>
             The veteran presenter, who has worked on the Newsnight programme had been asked by one of the audience: 'If you had been in charge of Newsnight last year what would you have done with the Jimmy Savile story?
            </p>
            <p>
             Jeremy replied: 'This is a complete and utter nightmare.
            </p>
            <p>
             'The fact that a person was using his BBC prestige and maybe even BBC dressing rooms to attack young children I find completely disgusting as a father of two young daughters.
            </p>
            <p>
             'I cannot believe that it happened for such a sustained period that we may be looking at one of the most serious predatory paedophiles in criminal history - and he was on our doorstep. I find it disgusting.'
            </p>
            <p>
             Culture Secretary Maria Miller will answer an urgent question in the Commons this afternoon about the BBC’s investigation into Savile, officials confirmed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Meanwhile, a Tory MP has called for the removal of all references to Savile in public places and for him to be moved to an anonymous grave.
            </p>
            <p>
             Alec Shelbrooke, MP for Elmet and Rothwell, said in a series of posts on Twitter that anyone 'found wanting' by a full, independent investigation should be prosecuted 'no matter how famous' they are.
            </p>
            <p>
             The calls come amid fresh allegations Savile paid to cover up alleged sex attacks on underage girls while manager of a dance hall in the 1950s.
            </p>
            <p>
             Former doorman Dennis Lemmon, 80, who was a door supervisor at the Mecca Locarno Ballroom in Leeds during the late 1950s while Savile was manager, said he was told he 'paid off' families to escape criminal charges of interfering with young girls.
