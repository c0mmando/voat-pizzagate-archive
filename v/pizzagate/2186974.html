            Holy shit, it's happening even more.  The Washington Freaking Post (yeah, where Podesta now works) just posted an overview of Weinstein's 30 year reign of abuse:

           <p>
            <strong>
             "He was violent toward women and men, and his abuse came in many forms — from screaming and berating to character assassination and nonconsensual advances. His behavior was both an open secret and a secret ritual."
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            SECRET RITUAL?!?  I swear, they know Pizzagate is coming so they are letting it out more, DRIP-DRIP-DRIP.

              , I actually thought of you and smiled when I saw that the WaPo fuckers included thst line in their story.  I highly, highly encourage you to watch Judge Jeanine Pirro's Opening Statement from tonight online.  It's not posted yet, or else I would link to it.  She came right out and said Weinstein and adult victims is just the tip.of the iceberg.  She said there's much more to become exposed, and it leads to pedophilia and child trafficking at the highest levels of Hollywood and beyond.   SHE WAS PISSED, SO PISSED OFF!
             </p>
             <p>
              Music to our ears, kid.  Stay upbeat.  Stay positive.  It's happening.  It's happening.
             </p>
             <p>
              We're heading outta town tomorrow so no internet for a day or more.  But I'll catch up in the week and I hope to see more good news here.   Take care.

            This is a recent interview here in UK on Channel 4 - Killary Clinton probably raging inside as it sounds like, although the interviewer is obviously a Trump hater, it was not a PRE-SCRIPTED interview! haha like she is used too.  He did ask more than any American Host would have, but wish he had asked about Haiti, intimidating her beloved Bills victims, pizzagate etc., His question 'What is going on?' my answer, is she is still lying about not knowing about Weinstein, duh......you dozy man!  Hilarious that she still believes the 'polls' after their prediction of her winning being 98% hahahaha - I think he was such a bias interviewer calling Pres.Trump a misogynist all the time.  The access Hollywood tape was the ONLY one they could find that they have to go on and on about this tape where he said it was locker room talk! To prove this, which is never mentioned, as soon as he got off the coach, see how his locker room talk stopped......did he grab her? NO it was Billy Bush that was plotting and goading him on, so he could get Trump on camera.  But obviously the reason Trump did not follow through with groping the woman was because it was only LOCKER ROOM TALK! Hillary Clinton on Weinstein, Trump's threat to world peace and losing (Extended interview) -

             Of course, it was locker room talk. It's ridiculous to equate stupid talk with raping someone. The two things don't even belong in the same sentence. And the thing is that Trump was talking with a man so it's not even harassment.

              Have you seen the sick picture they have on the front of The Week? looks like for release on 20 October 2017 - The ones standing behind Weinstein should be Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton, NOT Trump! They look worse and worse every day and their deception is blatant now! (at 2 minutes) -

               They're just giving themselves away and setting themselves up for ruin and shame ... and prison time! PedoWood should have never gotten into the political arena. Now they're stuck with all the crap they put in print and look like the hypocrites we knew them to be.
              </p>
              <p>
               PedoWood is falling down around those perv's ears! Oh, and did you read Kayla Jones' tweet. It was about how they ply them with sex, drugs, etc. She said that they do it to get blackmail on them. Isn't that exactly what we've been talking about? Think we did a pretty effective job in piecing things together and everyone should take time out to congratulate themselves for figuring this out!

            I admire the courage and FIGHT this woman is showing. She has been kept quiet to protect that man?
 that slime of human flesh.
I hope this helps other men and women who have been harmed to speak up and clear these people off the face of the earth.

             In her movie Planet Terror - a semi spoof of the 80's sexplotation horror - she is a victim of rape as well as deadly infection that gets her leg amputated. Instead of an artificial leg she attaches a rapid fire machine gun - turning weakness into strength. Throghout the film you notice that her acting suggested that she actually went through rape and god knows what else. Her acting was too convincing. Now I know.

               I'm basing it on other women making rape reports, and the investigation being quashed. One victim got him on tape.

               McGowan took a settlement and signed a non-disclosure agreement. If she sued and settled, chances are there was a police report. Usually it's criminal and then civil. This could be different, in that, she went the civil route first, but I do not know that.

            Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Samsung, HTC, Foxconn, Ashton Kutcher, Guy Oseary, Peter Thiel, Mark Cuban, and many more are all playing a key role in the bigger agenda that leads to Global Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast enfoced by AI and Community Policing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anti-trust died with corruption long ago and has enabled the rapid growth and power consolidation that enables this agenda.

            Bezos and company are hiding a lot more than anyone knows. Their plan is to rape and enslave the entire world. This is the secret deception of Sustainability (Satan's Ability).
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine, Wisconsin (near Amazon and Foxconn) is the "root", model and key to the real Truth.

             Not surprising that Verizon and Comcast are making tens of billions every year from internet porn ....
and continue to try to move pornography into mainstream movies and TV shoes.
The most disgusting thing about these kinds of things is when they put very adult dialogue and 
punch lines in the mouths' of young children.
What's the end purpose other than to suggest that kids are adults and to sexualize them.

              Correct - it is a systematic dismantling of all morals, family values, right and wrong, good and evil, gender and sexuality, race and nationality, religion, and conscience. From chaos comes dependency. They create the problem to push their solution. When they say it takes a village to raise a child, they really are saying the village owns your children and they use media, churches, groups and institutions to corrupt the minds and turn people against each other so they cannot see the true enemy.
             </p>

              This is a race between AI and the Truth. We are all slaves to the system until we Save ourselves with the Truth. The "root" of all Truth is in Racine, Wisconsin.
             </p>
             <p>
              The end goal is Transhumanism and Eternal Enslavement with the Mark of the Beast enforced by AI and Community Policing (where they turn family, friends and neighbirs against each other to force everyone to accept the Mark).

              Yes!  And today, Friday the 13th Level3 telecommunications is being bought by CenturyLink...70% of Level3 traffic is reported to be porn, so this makes me think they are consolidating the internet lines for manageability of CP.

             I have a feeling you're correct. They couldn't do it overnight, but that's what the many tentacles of the octopus have been working towards. The election of Trump really threw a spanner in the works.

             , ya hit the nail right in the head again, as usual.  But hell, you're a blacksmith.  It's what you do.  I am staying optimistic that the Weinstein story is only the tip of the iceberg, just the first of the series of DRIP-DRIP-DRIPs that are going to lead straight back to where we started a year ago:  at Pizzagate!   Do you notice how in all the media reports people are referring to the Harvey Weinstein sexual predation as "AN OPEN SECRET"?  All the reports call it an open secret.  I think they're priming the pump so that we will get used to that phrase, which leads to the documentary, "AN OPEN SECRET" (seen here -
             <a href="https://youtu.be/4eeGX4SlF1s">
              https://youtu.be/4eeGX4SlF1s)
             </a>
             ).  That leads to pedophilia, which leads to luciferian pedophilia, which leads us back to pizzagate.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know about all y'all, but I am fucking loving the implosion of Hollywood and all these pieces of shit.

               I'm not sure if this is the uncut one or not.  I will look around to see if there are any longer versions online (which would have more in them than the version I posted) and I'll get back to you, kid.  I'm glad you're LOVING this whole thing, too.  OMG, it's like we finally got a little break here.  I love how the phrase, "other older men" keeps getting thrown around in various discussions, to confirm that Harvey Weinstein is not the only one.  I also love how people are saying that what Weinstein did to these adult female actresses is not the only bad stuff that he did.  It's quite clear that there are hints of far more disturbing allegations to be uncovered, i.e., the PIZZAGATE stuff that's driven us all nuts and frustrated us.  I think that's why people are commenting on who remained SILENT and who has refused to return DONATIONS from Weinstein so far.   I think the bad guys are being taunted, and I can  only imagine the fear they are feeling 'cause it's all about to be exposed.  I think (though I don't know for sure) that the public is being gently desensitized so that when the news of the pedophilia and dead children hits people will already know what pieces of shit were involved.  I predict Weinstein will be "suicided," one way or another, by the time the big news hits, and I think there are many more names to come out.   So am I loving this?  Fuck yeah.  I want to see them all put out of the business of hurting innocent people.

                thank you, and I love this whole comment.  yes, we are already seeing allegations of HW harassing a 17 year old, and Angelina Jolie saying it happened to her "in her youth." I really hope the whole fucking tower of evil comes crashing down.  honestly, I don't feel 100% certain it will, but we are getting closer and closer.  justice for all the victims and survivors!  TRUTH ALWAYS WINS IN THE END.  best to you.  can't wait for the real party we'll have when we watch them all go down.

                 .  BTW, OMG, I hope that's not your phone number, lol.  I'm sure it's not.  Anyway, just wanted to say thanks for reading all that.  Damn, I was in a talkative mood today.  But I'm hyped up, just thoroughly enjoying watching the sex crimes of the scum in Hollywood get exposed, and having an even better time watching them all turn on each other.  I am busy with work but I took a little break to catch up on my own life a bit today, and part of that was watching some of the news shows discuss this.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I swear, old Ronan Farrow has really come through with his one-two punch.  First, he wrote a compelling and very damning piece to add to the story of the Weinstein crimes.  Then, in an unexpected (but outstanding twist), he gave the second punch by throwing NBC (his freaking employer, no less) under the bus for refusing to run the story.  Ronan Farrow is a very good soul, and I applaud him for being brave enough to do what he's doing, because the dominoes are falling and we know where it's leading.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm looking forward to the day,

                 , when even more of the bad stuff is exposed, and names are named, and indictments are filed.  I will be ecstatic, and I'll be picturing all of us, in our own little worlds, having a little moment of joy that the bad guys didn't win.  I'll always stay optimistic and prayerful.  It's October.  It's a high-activity time for those who follow the dark stuff.  So there are still lots of humans suffering out there, I'm sure, and I won't stop being prayerful and vigilant until it all gets exposed, God willing. . . .
                </p>
                <p>
                 Have a great weekend and thanks again for your optimistic and informative posts.

            God I hate Jeff Bezos and Amazon.  I believe that They are planning to demand employees get micro chips at their new plants.   He is one of THEM.

             In Minneapolis there was a bookstore called Amazon. It was a small bookstore but really cool- the country's first feminist bookstore, started in the '70s. It was a small, local store, and content to be just that. When Amazon the online store came on the scene, they sued this little tiny store for its name, which it had first. The store in Minneapolis won, but the cost of the lawsuit was too much, and it ended up closing down. Amazon is a greedy, greedy bastard.

              I totally agree on the name calling.  He is trying to open small stores to kill mom and pop type bookstores.  And people are dumb enough to buy the cheapest item.  Little do they know that the takeover is not just about books.  Next it will be little mini marts. They are opening these little refrigerated kiosks.  Don't ask me about them because I don't want to even know, I will do without or wait.  WAIT.  It has become a 4 letter word. so has FAST.

             I never liked him either. I mean, think about it ... how could he afford to keep Amazon up and running during all those years he was losing money. Somebody with very deep pockets had to be funding him while he operated at a loss. And he drove how many companies out of business when he was playing the "Gee, I'm losing money, but I still have money" game. Had to be financed by somebody.

              He got a 600M $$$ contract with the CIA to manage their Cloud Program.  That's a nice piece of change.  Could set some one up pretty well.  He bought Whole Foods too and now he gets to control their Whole Kids Dept.  Edit:  He drove those companies out of bus. because they wanted him to.  At least that's my take.

               I read a book by Ralph Epperstein (from Amazon) 'The Unseen Hand' and in it he breaks down the concept of free market without regulation - how a company can operate at a loss to send copeting companies broke - while being funded by a rogue Gov. Element which brings us to - Fascism = Big Gov in cahoots with Big Business.

                And everybody loves deregulation.  They have people flummoxed and brain washed. Why people are dumb enough to believe that people making big money are thinking of their best interest is beyond me.  AND that is exactly why they want to dumb us down.  So they can't understand how they are robbing them blind.

                  Either Trump is really stupid for being on TV with him, or he is letting Kissy think he will have his way and pull the rug out from under him.  Do I really believe that, I don't know but the other reason is one I don't like.

                    That is why we must keep fighting.  Spreading the word.  Wisconsin Is Corrupt has told me we must Pressure Trump to Clean Up Racine.  Pressure.  We must let him know what we want him to do.  Or he will not be President again.  Pressure for Power.
