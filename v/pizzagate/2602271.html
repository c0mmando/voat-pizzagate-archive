<p>Spectrum News NY1 captured &quot;jarring&quot; footage of a number of young girls being ushered to and from the building that houses the Cayuga Centers in Harlem around 12:45 a.m. Wednesday, after a tipster told reporters that &quot;kids separated from their parents along the southern U.S. border would be brought there,&quot; said anchor Josh Robin, who was on the scene.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has confirmed that more than 70 children who were separated from their parents at the border are now being housed in New York state. People familiar with the situation told NY1 that the Cayuga Centers are helping to care for such kids, including by placing them in foster care. A woman who was with the girls seen in the video &quot;emphatically denied they had been separated from their parents.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We want to be very careful,&quot; Robin said. &quot;We don\'t know for sure the situation … We can\'t say for sure what my sources have told me, that [these girls] have been brought from the southern border.&quot; You can watch the footage below. Jeva Lange</p>

            "a tipster" sounds like typical leftist msm BS.

           <p>
            The problem with stories like this is they are being twisted or outright manufactured in order to point the finger at Trump. Now if Trump is involved thats a very worrying thing. However the fact these stories need to be taken with a huge pinch of salt on first viewing makes me wonder what is the truth they might be hiding.

              The news media does not want anything to be shown unless it can be attributed to Trump.  What explanation is there for this?  Strange.  Since this will reflect badly on Cuomo or DeBlasio there is Utter Silence.  Shh.

            There have also been reports that migrant children will be taken to Los Angeles, and that the Pentagon is arranging for 20,000 children to be housed on military bases in the US. This all seems quite strange.
