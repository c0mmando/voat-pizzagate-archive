            So, I think this is a great post, organ trafficking being a possible motive for human/child trafficking, Jamaica being close to Haiti; as allegations pop up we should be on top of them and discuss them.
           </p>
           <p>
            However I don't think "Dr" Turban X presents any information to back up his theory. To allege organ trafficking you would need some dead bodies with organs missing, wouldn't you? In the case he talks about, a picture of a woman/girl with neck chopped/cut, his only evidence is blood in the chest area. He's honest enough to say he doesn't even know if she was cut there, but imagines that organs were removed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some people are just gullible and believe anything they hear/read. Others are more cynical: they believe the end justifies the means (Alinsky-style) and that creating a buzz about a Jamaican doctor who's seen organ harvesting is good for the pizzagate cause. (I wish both kinds would just fuck off and find something else to do with their spare time). I hope I don't read here that we've proved there's organ harvesting in Jamaica.

            Here is why this video is viral in Jamaica:
           </p>
           <p>
            "5 Days, 4 Beheadings - Fourth decapitation in a week stuns nation
Nation reels from yet another decapitation"
           </p>
           <p>
            So victims are a 37-year old male, 18-year old male, and mother and daughter.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Nation-reels-from-yet-another-decapitation_9287118">
             http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Nation-reels-from-yet-another-decapitation_9287118
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The Deputy Police Commissioner is quoted:
           </p>
           <p>
            '"I wouldn't call it a trend, there are three separate incidents. Whether or not that indicates a trend, I wouldn't want to stretch it there yet," he said, noting that the most recent cases are not the first instances of beheadings in Jamaica, listing St James, St Mary, and St Thomas as parishes in which this cold-blooded method of slaughtering human beings has been used before.'
           </p>
           <p>
            It's easy to see why people are upset and open to the organ harvesting explanation. However I fail to see how beheading would be an intrinsic part of an organ snatch.

            I will listen again. I believe he is a Medic. Maybe he had suspicions for a while and then something clicked when he realized the rape victims still had their pants on. I think it's happening more than once. I know he's in Jamaica . I don't want to get into the details of why or how I know that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can try to relay more questions to him. It seems he's quite upset. And I know, when I am upset I am not always as clear as I could be. When he said "those abroad" he wasn't referring to himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            I did hear he was called "doctor" - And he does know there are Jamaicans involved in the scheme.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought the timing of it was interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact there was a group arrested and only one killed ties in with the info George Webb gave to the extent Webb said the victims were taken live, as hostages, and then transported. The purpose of this is that they are taken to a holding area near to a hospital, kept alive so that their DNA and blood type could be tested for compatibility with the recipeint, and then they are killed as needed - so their bodies would be fresh. The heart is only viable for one hour - so Webb contended. And from what I recall of the info from Webb, the heart is the most valuable.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do know they thieve for other organs.
           </p>
           <p>
            I recall Webb explaining that they transport them out of the country, to be closer to where they will be used.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will listen to Webb again to double check.

            Jamaica Informant Organ Harvesting Witness &amp; Warning
Please download and save ASAP

           <p>
            How does this relate to Pizzagate?
           </p>
           <p>
            George Webb has made a series of videos over 109 days: Here's # 108 from yesterday -
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqcLQNpdM30YouTube">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqcLQNpdM30YouTube
            </a>
            -
           </p>
           <p>
            "Day 108 - DynCorp Harvest, Killing Is Great Business, Part 1"
           </p>
           <p>
            describing the details around the large operations which consist of a criminal gang liaison with top government officials and administrators. Webb describes the "Rat Lines" wherein the organs and living humans are brought to market for their body parts.
           </p>
           <p>
            The witness in Jamaica, who is a Medic, backs up Webb. He says that it is not an "inside job" though some Jamaicans may be working for the operation. He says the money and the organs are from richer countries where people can afford to pay high prices for organs. He says that his people are being used because they are thought of as "3rd World" and that the murders are claimed to be a result of rape.
           </p>
           <p>
            He realization came when the bodies of woman he found had their pants on , but their heads cut off. He reasoned that if it was really rape they would not be mutilated and , obviously, would show signs of sexual assault. What rapist puts the pants back on the victim after a rape/ murder?
           </p>
           <p>
            Webb has been saying that he uses Haiti as an example but that the same operation goes on in other countries with the same M.O. "Modus Operandi " used over and over.
           </p>
           <p>
            Webb connects these large Industrial scale businesses of mining human organs to the Clinton Foundation and various revolving - door [with government offices] Corporations.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is suspicion/ speculation that the Pizza joints, such as the one with all the creepy art in D.C, ,where Obama and Clinton staged fund raising events, were connected with this very same business.

            Why do you say this guy is a doctor? Because he's wearing a white t-shirt and has a stethoscope? He makes no such claim; YouTube comment says he is a medical professional.
           </p>
           <p>
            So his claim is someone sent him a picture of a body of a young girl in a building. Her neck was cut and her chest was bloody. He says "I could not see if her chest was cut". However his main point is her pants were on, so it couldn't be a rape. So it must be organ harvesting!
           </p>
           <p>
            He also says the police arrested some people and killed one, no real details.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jamaica's a left side driving country and he's sitting on the left, inconsistent but not impossible. He does say "those of us who are living abroad" might find his story more plausible, so he might be abroad.
           </p>
           <p>
            He says a body is worth a million U$. Heart $200K, liver $200-500. (How does he know these prices? From looking at a picture?) Gizmodo has heart $119, liver $157K.

            I'm not saying it doesn't happen, I'm saying this video isn't proof of much, it's just some guy talking on YouTube (orginally Facebook).

            Couldn't catch his name sounds like "Turban X" or "Turbanex"? (Not

             "Turban X" was correct; he's a reggae musician not an M.D. and he has no inside information; his theory is speculation based on all the organ trafficking going on in the world. Actually Jamaica has been plagued with a series of gruesome head chopping murders and this is his theory for them.

            This is organ harvesting for a profit. The end goal is transplant. So this must be happening since transplants became a reality and logistics permitted the transportation of organs.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree we are blinder than ever though. With all the psyops around, we have to be very determined to overcome the disinformation, even if little by little.
