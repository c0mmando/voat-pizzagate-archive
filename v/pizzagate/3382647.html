             Cargometrics was launched in 2010 as a provider of shipping data, but the company has since then developed into a quantitative hedge fund. As such, it relies on algorithms to analyze large swaths of trade data to find investment opportunities which others might not see. It uses information from a wide range of sources, including satellite data about ships' movements, commodity prices and energy consumption, which are combined in an effort to spot lucrative patterns in global trade....

             In recent years Boston-based Cargometrics has caused quite a stir in the US shipping circles. One reason is the cooperation with Maersk Tankers, which will test the tool Simtankers starting from July.
             <strong>
              The shipping company has also invested in the fund alongside prominent business people such as former Google Chairman Eric Schmidt.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Investors include prominent names such as .. shipping magnate Idan Ofer.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Cargometrics is also somewhat shrouded in mystery, as the fund keeps its cards close to its chest. The ultimate goal is to create "full transparency over the supply chain," and use this to achieve higher returns than the competitors – or "to generate alpha."

            The UK Daily Mail has added "Epstein's consort" to their repertoire of almost respectable descriptions of her, along with socialite, madame and Epstein's pimp or procurer. Still no mention of kidnapper, international trafficker of children or all around incredible scumball. Imagine if this were some peasant person of the lower castes. The Daily Mail would be leading the mob with torches and pitchforks and call for a good old fashioned burning at the stake.

             Yes!  She’s married to The Turtle. Her father left her the biz after his death. Some of the ships were caught with large amount of drugs on board. So Mitch is now owner as well.

             The East India Company never died......it just changed names. These are very old ports. Barbados was an early 17th century English sugarcane plantation Island. This was the early origin of the African "chattel" slave system, later exported to the Carolinas and beyond. The white gold was an early economic engine for the English crown and rising merchant class. The Drax brothers and Myddeltons had early plantations there.

             Here is what one of the Drax descendants is up to currently:

             "Sweeping through this field of poppies, gardener Hannah Taylor enjoys a remarkable display of the flowers in a field in Dorset today.
            </p>
            <p>
             The striking display of colour was on show at an estate owned by a Conservative MP Richard Drax who has given up his land to grow the flowers for the NHS.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the hot dry spring, alongside the weekend downpour has resulted in the bumper blooming of the crop, which will now be turned into morphine."

              The Sugar Trade in the West Indies and Brazil Between 1492 and 1700
             </p>
             <p>
              "The European discovery and colonization of Madeira and the Canary Islands would prove fateful precedents for the new world, because the plantation system and colonial governments instituted on these islands became models for the great sugar plantations in the new world.2 Since sugar cane had been introduced to Madeira and the Canaries after their colonization during the last half of the fifteenth century, the techniques of sugar production, exploitation of labor, and economic organization developed on these islands were easily exported to the new world.3 Ultimately, the adoption of these production techniques and the system of colonial government from the Atlantic islands, with the institution of slavery, made sugar production the most profitable cultivation in either the Americas or Europe."
             </p>
             <p>
              "By the middle of the seventeenth century the Brazilian sugar industry had begun to expand rapidly with support of capital from the Dutch East India Company, which had seized Pernambuco from the Portuguese in 1630, and the Dutch importation of slaves from equatorial Africa."
             </p>
             <p>
              "However, the 1660 the focus of sugar production began to shift from Brazil to Barbados and other islands of the West Indies."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Surviving evidence shows that despite increases in production, Brazil was not able to keep the sugar refineries in Amsterdam adequately supplied, forcing the Dutch refiners to look elsewhere for the product.11 Barbados, which had been developing the sugar industry under the leadership of the Englishman John Drax, proved to be a perfect complement. Drax, who had been a student of Portuguese and Dutch production methods and organization in Pernambuco, adapted sugar production to the limited resources of the islands and proved that, despite their relatively small size, the West Indies were capable of producing significant amounts of muscovado, or raw sugar."

             <p>
              "The division of the New World by the Pope ignored the claims of the rest of the European powers to the New World. England, France, and Holland all had either sent explorers to the New World, or simply wanted a piece of it. They felt they needed colonies to both supply them with raw imports and to provide a market for their industrial output. In 1630, the Dutch West India Company sent a fleet to attempt to conquer the city of Recife, located at the northeastern edge of Brazil. Jewish soldiers and explorers were among the Dutch on this successful mission. The new Dutch territory was renamed New Holland. As in Holland, religious freedom was proclaimed.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1636, a synagogue was built for the "Holy Congregation" in Recife. Jews began arriving from Poland, Turkey, and Hungary as well as more from Spain and Portugal. In 1642, a large group of
             </p>
             <p>
              Jews arrived from Amsterdam. In this group were Rabbi Isaac Aboab de Fonseca and Cantor Moses de Aguilar. The population of Recife reached a high point in 1645, with 50% of the white population being Jewish.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Jews who had settled early on in Brazil were the landowners and sugar barons. Those arriving later became involved in trade. Brazilian Jews formed an overseas trading network with Jews still
             </p>
             <p>
              in Amsterdam, forming partnerships to bring supplies to Brazil. Jews even became successful slave traders. In 1645, a Jew was granted permission by the West India Company to practice law.
             </p>
             <p>
              The New Holland Supreme Court refused to accept his license, but the Jewish community in Amsterdam interceded on his behalf and he was eventually allowed to practice law in New Holland. The Christian businessmen were jealous of the success of the Jews, particularly in the lucrative slave trade, and more than once petitioned the government to limit Jewish trading practice. The government refused to take action: the business generated by the Jews was too important to the economy of the colony to be hindered in any way."

                What we see now has historical pattern. Some of the old bloodlines are still in play. Slavery never went away. It just moved and went more underground. The truth is, the only way to amass huge fortunes is to steal labor. Catering to human vice and addictions is always profitable. The proceeds are used to buy power to keep the system rolling. This is the NWO.

             Why would a woman, alleged to be part of a large sex-trafficking operation that includes sex with the victims themselves see in a tech guy who tracks and measures sea-borne trade in real time?

             I’m fascinated with this.  Really fascinated that this guy has created a way to track tankers and ocean traffic in real time.  It takes millions and millions of data points and he managed to do that.  He also partnered with 2 other companies

             Before you think I’m all tin foil hat here, I’m not quite doing that.  The investors in this company like Google, Renaissance Technologies, Paul Tudor Jones and Isarael’s Idan Ofer, kind of make me what to look harder.

            I'm wondering whether they are trying to mislead the public about her whereabouts.

           <p>
            I can't imagine that she didn't flee the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            But if she should -still be in the US, why doesn't she get arrested - they must have found pics and footage of her when she was abusing the girls. They already found cp on her computer.

             Maybe she will magically commit suicide too lol. Plastic surgeries cost nothing for these people, getting a brand new passports i.e new identity should also be no problem. Then they can keep abusing somewhere else. Happy days for those monsters. Barr will show his real face soon enough and i pray he shows us he’s on our side.

              He has shown his real face already. Shortly before he recused himself from the old Florida case, the federal prosecutors refused to agree to a reopening of the case. Funny that he worked for the law firm that represented Epstein in Florida.

               Personally I can’t blame every employee at that law firm for what the leaders decided to do but recusing himself was already fishy to me. I guess I really wanna believe that he will do something to put things right again but my hopes are faint. I agree with you, it doesn’t look good.
