<p>&quot;They are victims of a multi-billion-dollar <strong>international business</strong> that traffics <strong>hundreds of thousands</strong> of women a year.&quot;</p>
<p>This Frontline program looked at human trafficking involving the Ukraine, Moldova (the poorest country in Europe) and Turkey. Trafficked women were taken to Turkey to either work there, or be passed on to other traffickers. The program mentions that they could end up anywhere in the world within just a few days. It only looks at trafficked adult women and never mentions trafficked children. It says that women trafficked to Europe go for the most, up to $80,000. And Turkey is key to trafficking since it\'s easy for people to slip in there without proper identification papers, and from there they can go to anywhere in Europe. Some quotes from the program:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ANNOUNCER: These women have been torn from their lives, taken from their families and sold into slavery. They are victims of a multi-billion-dollar international business that traffics hundreds of thousands of women a year.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: FRONTLINE also follows one man who’s determined to get his wife back before she’s lost for good to the world of the traffickers. It’s an extraordinary journey that raises tough questions about governments around the world largely indifferent to the traffickers’ abuses.</p>
<p>TANIA, Trafficked to Turkey: [through interpreter] I hadn’t encountered much evil in my life. I thought I’d find at least one kind person, or that one of those pimps would set me free.</p>
<p>NARRATOR: Odessa, Ukraine, a port town on the Black Sea known for its nightlife and its beautiful women. Under the old Soviet Union, it was a center of organized crime. Now Odessa has become a major hub for the global sex trade...</p>
<p>RIC ESTHER BIENSTOCK: The secret service said that she runs a legitimate business as a cover, and she basically takes women from Moldova and Ukraine to work as domestics in Turkey. And amongst these women are some younger women who she sells to traffickers and pimps in Turkey...</p>
<p>NARRATOR: Turkey has become one of the largest markets for women trafficked from Ukraine and the old Soviet Bloc. Its lax visa requirements make it an easy port of entry to Europe and the Middle East for traffickers like Olga.</p>
<p>RIC ESTHER BIENSTOCK: She got through customs with absolutely no problem. The traffickers who transport these women have a very easy time of it. Because the women know that they’re going to be working illegally in the country that they’re going to, they actually help the trafficker by lying to the customs officials...</p>
<p>VICTOR MALAREK, Author, The New Global Sex Trade: These women are being trafficked to the West. In the United States, they figure 20,000, 25,000 a year. But Europe is the major destination, Germany, upwards of 80,000, 40,000, 50,000 in the Netherlands, Spain and Italy and Turkey. All of these countries are getting trafficked women. We have laws in every country on the planet that say you can’t abduct people, you can’t kidnap, you can’t force them into prostitution, you can’t assault them. the laws are there, but they’re not being enforced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the program\'s conclusion, a man convicted of human trafficking in the Ukraine is given 5 years of probation by the judge.</p>
