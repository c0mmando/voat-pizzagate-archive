<p>On October 21st, the Daily Mail published this story about the Bullington club at Oxford: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4996374/Bullingdon-Club-members-escorted-site-college.html">The moment Bullingdon Club members are kicked out of the Oxford college where they have their annual photograph as watching students jeer them and play the Benny Hill theme tune</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oxford University\'s Bullingdon Club were escorted from Christ Church College</p>
<p>They were attempting to recreate a modern-day version of <strong>famous \'87 picture</strong>*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The accompanying video used the Benny Hill theme which was noted in their article title.</p>
<p>One day  later we have: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5005273/Hazel-O-Connor-says-Benny-Hill-forced-her.html">\'Benny Hill offered me a job in return for sexual favours\': Eighties punk star claims comedian told her she\'d \'have to look after him\' if she wanted to be on his show</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'I was disgusted and was getting ready to leave when he tried to snog me. I pushed him away and got out of there.\' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems a bit of a non-story.  So what else is going on?</p>
<p>Her  story: <a href="http://nightflight.com/breaking-glass-hazel-oconnors-true-life-story-will-tear-your-heart-out/">http://nightflight.com/breaking-glass-hazel-oconnors-true-life-story-will-tear-your-heart-out/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1975, O’Connor also made her film debut in a raunchy 43-minute “sex comedy” called Girls Come First, which was the second of a trilogy of movies about a character named Alan Street (played by John Hammill), a middle-aged struggling artist who is hired by a sex magazine’s publisher to paint erotic paintings of naked models. In the film, the artist moves into the publisher’s studio flat, where various mostly topless models throw themselves at him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm, not exactly shy and retiring is she?  So I went looking for more information on this film Girls Come First.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Girls Come First’s producer and the mastermind behind the Alan Street trilogy was one of British sexploitation’s true wild cards, David Hamilton Grant.  </p>
<p>Grant is also said to have reduced Deep Throat director Gerard Damiano to a nervous wreck during the space of one afternoon. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, I google Grant\'s name:</p>

<p><strong>It is a safe bet that the video facilities were used to record sex acts for the then lucrative international paedophile video market</strong>- remember this was the brainchild of Spartacus. This aspect involved video distributor and drug-dealer, David Hamilton Grant, who was eventually murdered in a suspected contract killing in 1991. </p>

<p>Someone\'s sending messages me thinks.</p>

            Benny Hill being a sexual predator wouldn't surprise me. His show was really all sort of making sexual predatory behavior something to laugh at, any way.

              In real life his sex life was always a sketchy, speculative area, and conjecture was high that he was either a closet homosexual or some marauding devotee of the dirty mac. In the 20-odd years that Kirkland knew Benny, he didn’t have one serious girlfriend, offering the explanation that women wanted to mother him, “maybe give him a cuddle and laugh at his jokes, but they didn’t very often want to sleep with him”. Benny often took ladyfriends away with him on foreign trips, but they were usually disappointed that his idea of a perfect night in Paris would involve sitting in the hotel room watching French TV in search of comedy ideas.

               Benny Hill is long dead and the sexual abuse accusation against him is quite minor.  The woman who accuses him has a very colourful past and as I noted was introduced to the film industry by a filmmaker who seems to have been a pornographer and possibly filmed the pedophiles at the notorious London pedophile haunt Elm Guest House.  I believe that the elite pedophile rings are currently putting out stories in the news which are accusing dead celebrities of abuse but are really serving as warnings to people not to 'out' them.
