<p>A few days ago, I posted about Peter Strzok and backgrounds of his immediate family members.
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2362778">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2362778</a></p>
<p>So, I dug a little deeper on 2 of the family members - Peter P. Strzok Sr. (father) and Father Jim Strzok (uncle).</p>
<p>PETER P STRZOK, SR.
As reported in my prior post, a 2016 NC newspaper article featured Strzok Sr.  In 1965 he was an Army engineer captain in Iran.  One of his jobs was to accept civic action schools being built from funds accrued from sales by Iran of food aid provided by the US.  Since 1980 Strzok has worked at village levels in over 13 countries in West Africa.
<a href="http://www.fayobserver.com/d8027ffd-e2a6-5ef0-be77-c43f22fb5fa6.html">http://www.fayobserver.com/d8027ffd-e2a6-5ef0-be77-c43f22fb5fa6.html</a></p>
<p>Strzok Sr. also worked with Catholic Relief Services as a director, &quot;dealing directly with the struggling farm families in the impoverished African nation of Upper Volta&quot; where he completed a 3 year term.  He was also once assigned in Haiti where one goal was to &quot;relieve the infant mortality rate.&quot;
<a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/24gh.png">http://i.magaimg.net/img/24gh.png</a></p>
<p>There are also 2 registered entities that appear with Strzok Sr.\'s name attached - an incorporation and an organization, which based on my research, led essentially to nowhere.</p>
<p>The first one is Econeem, Inc., a VA Domestic Corp. filed on July 13, 2005.  Registered Agent is Thomas D. Weaver - Salem, VA.  The 3 principals on record are Peter P. Strzok - President; Michael J. Strzok - VP; and Thomas D. Weaver - CFO/SEC/TREAS

<p>Other than that, the only other thing I found was a company called &quot;Eco-Neem,&quot; a registered organic insecticide company.

<p>The second entity is &quot;Agency to Facilitate the Growth of Rural Organizations,&quot; where Peter P. Strzok is listed as President.<br />

<p>I could find only one article from 2013 focusing on Strzok Sr. and this organization.  The article states that for 30 years, he had traveled repeatedly to West Africa as its president.

<p>FATHER JIM STRZOK
is a Jesuit priest in Wisconsin who has certainly been a busy man.  He supervised the construction of Ocer Campion Jesuit School in Gulu, Uganda; a new Peace Institute and International Relations College at Hekima Jesuit College in Nairobi; two new guest dormitories at Mwangaza Jesuit Retreat Home in Kenya; and was involved in the restoration of a school in Wair, Sudan and the building of a new school in Dodoma, Tazmania.</p>
<p>Father Jim is a member of Rotary International and a collaborator with Good Neighbors micro- lending program to generate needs-based tuitions for academically gifted girls to continue their education.

            In regards to Jesuits and their "medical care" of the children of India: tl:dr is that they pretended to be giving children medical and took control of the situation. Then they just let the children die. Did they start the illness themselves as a form of genocide? I don't know. I have not dug that deep.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The German Steinmetz, alluding to this, says:
             <strong>
              "They insinuate themselves as physicians into the houses of the Indians; draw a wet cloth over the head and forehead of the sick person,
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             2 Steinmetz, Vol. Ill, p. 474. Citing.the Jesuit Fathers De Bourges and Martin. 3 Ibid., p. 489.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              even when at the point of death; mutter privately to themselves the baptism service; and think they have made one Christian more, who is immediately added to the list."
             </strong>
             The Jesuit De Bourges is represented by him as saying:
             <strong>
              "When the children are in danger of death, our practice is to baptize them without asking the permission of their parents, which would certainly be refused.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The Catechists and the private Christians are well acquainted with the formula of baptism, and they confer it on these dying children, under the pretext of giving them medicine ;" that is, by that kind of "pious fraud" which, according to the Jesuits, promotes "the greater glory of God."
             </strong>
             Another Jesuit father, whose experience in India enabled him to speak advisedly, mentions one woman " whose knowledge of the pulse and of the symptoms of approaching death was so unerring, that of more than ten thousand children whom she had herself baptized, not more than two escaped death."
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             The number of such baptisms during a famine in 1737 are alleged by still another Jesuit to have been " upwards of 12,000." And he supplements this statement by saying that "it was rare, in any place where there were neophytes, for a single heathen child to die unbaptized." Looking over this whole field of Jesuit operations, and contemplating the demoralizing influences of the Jesuits in India, this same German historian feels himself warranted in saying that "every Jesuit who entered within these unholy bounds, bid adieu to principle and truth—all became perjured impostors, and the lives of all ever afterwards were but one long, persevering, toilsome LIE.
