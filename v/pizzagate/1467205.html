            I bet Dahmer was a junior member of this same group we are investigating. He probably just got too sloppy so they let him go down.

            Yeah I think the officers simply thought it was two gay lovers fighting. There are people who think Dahmer killed Adam Walsh, John Walsh's son. Google opperman report frustrated witness to hear about it.

            I've investigated that case enough to know that the officers were just ACTUALLY racist and homophobic douchebags. Audio exists of them calling into dispatch laughing while talking about the "asian guy returned to his gay boyfriend". It actually was really huge when the audio broke. Big protests and demonstrations in Milwaukee. Even worse: Dahmer had actually been sent to jail for sexually assaulting the victim's BROTHER! However, it was well known that Dahmer could talk his way through anything. Smooth operator, just like Podesta, I reckon.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A source who heard the tapes told the newspaper the officers, who were called to the scene by a woman who had seen Dahmer and the boy, referred to the incident as "boy-boy" trouble and said they wanted to return to the station house for "delousing." That term is an inside joke used by officers when talking about people they consider unsavory, the newspaper said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Milwaukee Sentinel also reported Wednesday Dahmer was shocked when investigators told him the 14-year-old Laotian boy was the brother of a youth Dahmer sexually assaulted in 1988. Dahmer was on probation for the assault conviction.
