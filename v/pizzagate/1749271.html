            My mom always raised
Me saying: "the second generation accepts what the first generation laughs at"
 You think they don't know that? Look at Friends... the first really popular
Show with a main homosexual storyline...follow the entertainment line from there and the cultural acceptance levels.
I loved
Friends.
We had gay marriage within 15 years.

            And the new movie 'Brimstone' starring Guy Pierce, Dakota Fanning and (Games of Thrones' John Snow) Kit Harington is also full of Pizzagate related innuendos : Pedophilia, (Christian preacher deflowers his own daughter), abortion (mid-wife decides to crack a baby' skull in cold blood (in delivery) in order to save the mother's life, the antagonist's right eye is injured (illuminati symbol), sex slavery (the heroin is sold to a brothel owner who forces her into a life of sex slavery, after strangling a man on a farm, the heroin's ally decides to dismember the victim and feed him to the pigs! and so much more... Disgusting movie.

            I watched the whole season. It's not what I'd even begin to call
            <em>
             hilarious
            </em>
            , but it had a couple of mildly funny moments. I can't say that this stupid show "normalizes" cannibalism, seeing that is was largely a stomach-turning parade of abnormal, lowbrow comedy, relying on graphic displays of ripping out human internal organs, mutilated human body parts, gallons of vomit, sex with a "living cadaver"... and a bit of mildly clever but forgettable dialogue, delivered via Drew Barrymore (who I now, and will forever, associate with death and dismemberment)...
            <strong>
             BUT
            </strong>
            , what one person (me) finds repulsive, and unfunny, is another person's idea of great comedy. Zombie, flesh-eating-gore-porn is obviously popular entertainment, but I don't think this mess has a chance of continuing to a second season... but who knows? We skipped the commercials, so I don't know who sponsored it. IMDb rates
            <strong>
             <em>
              <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5580540/">
               Santa Clarita Diet
              </a>
             </em>
            </strong>
            a 7.8. I rate this show a zero-point waste of my time, and not pizzagate.

            It's a dark comedy. I'll get you the definition of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Black comedy or dark comedy is a comic style that makes light of subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo.
           </p>
           <p>
            AKA a human who develops zombie like tendencies and needs to eat other humans in order to live, the only problem is she is fully aware of it and her husband knows about her situation so what happens? They have to find a way to keep her alive but through "legal" means. The taboo is the fact that yes it's cannibalism in the sense that she is still a talking person but she is technically zombified, but see going by this logic you would have to say every zombie movie supports cannibalism because because it's human eating other humans.
           </p>
           <p>
            First understand what it means to make a Dark Comedy before assuming the worse of it, and man, Mrs. Doubtfire? You seriously think Robin Williams dressed up like a woman in an attempt to later normalize transgender issues? You ever here the term androgynous or cross-dressers? Sorry to disappoint but people been having sex identity issues for a long time it's just now that it's reaching the light of society now because the media feels they can exploit it for their own personal gains along with politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to Mrs. Doubtfire though, Robin Williams' character was an unwilling cross-dresser in this situation, it was never about his wanting to be a woman, it was about him doing anything to be with his kids because the Mother wouldn't allow him to be with them because of his lack of a job. The humor comes from how he holds a job, to watch his kids but he can't outright admit it's him because of how he's dressed. But he did what he did because he loved his kids and wanted a way of being with them without losing them. It's more about the flaws of a justice system that would side with the mother rather than the man in many situation because she's the one that gave birth to the children even though pregnancy takes 2 to happen.

             Just because it has a name doesn't mean it can't be used as a medium for propaganda.  We could dismiss allegations of CNN being propaganda by categorizing it as news.  Categorization is neutral.  It doesn't deny or support a claim that someone is trying to push a message.

             "subjects that are generally considered serious or taboo". Exactly, normalizing means precisely to stop becoming a taboo and therefore become "normal". Abortion was a taboo 50 years ago, homosexuality was a taboo 30 years ago, transexuality was a taboo 20 years ago. Are they a taboo anymore? No. Negating the effect the media and movies have had in normalizing them would be naive. But now they can't normalize pedophilia and cannibalism because of what exactly?

            I watched it and it pissed me off. Someone has put together a very strong team of  actors and writers to push a sick agenda.
The overall theme is massive service to self: literally consuming others to further yourself and avoid death.
This message is all very slickly wrapped up and presented and pointed more at Gen z. The kids in the show are very strong.
Make no mistake the evil behind this is very well organised

            No question there "was" a big attempt to normalize satanism, canabalism, and pedophilia.  Shows out now were in production at or around the election.

            I have Netflix and had no idea when we saw the new show. Watched two episodes and it was so gross, bizzare, over the top, unnecessary awful. We could not watch anymore.

             What it is suppose to accomplish is for you to not really realize what it is doing.  It is subliminal.  This is meant to pull in the young.  The very impressionable.  That is why it is a cartoon, animated if you will.  Animated Dark Comedies are meant as just that.  Also, if Soros bought Netflix, that is another red flag.

             I wouldn't call it hilarious, but I also didn't have the same immediate reaction that most people here seem to - just seemed like an oddly edgy zombie comedy. Upon further examination and reflection, however, I agree that the show seems to be promoting the idea of service to self over everything... but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's an attempt to normalize or promote cannibalism.

             I watched it too and I found it to be hilarious as well, but I DO see it as part of all the "normalizing bizzare and perverted behaviour" stuff the film industry spits out these days anyway. Making the urge to eat a human being look like something funny is a very good way to normalize it, in my opinion...
            </p>

             If you enjoy watching this anyway, go on, but you should be aware of the manipulation going on.

             I don't understand why some are saying this is not normalizing.  It is done subliminally.  That is the point.  They know kids and younger people are watching Neftlix.  Soros buying Netflix is also a red flag.  This is a perfect vehicle to brainwash those young brains.  Oh, yeah. I don't like it, but you know, if that's what people want or need, it's none of my business.

              They have been doing this since at least Obama got in office. I never connected it to his administration at the time but I notice inappropriate sexual content in children's songs, dance moves, and music. The media has a hidden agenda and we have tonne aware of what they are up to!

               Yes, we have become tone deaf, but at least now the membership of voat have woken up.  This is disgusting at best.  We must wake up our friends with children and grand children.
