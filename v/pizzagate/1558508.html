<p><em>&quot;From factories and brothels to farms and mines, <strong>millions</strong> of men, women, and children in the United States and around the world are exploited for their bodies and their labor.&quot;</em> </p>

<p><em>&quot;This past fiscal year, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice provided more than $60 million to community-based organizations and task forces to assist human trafficking victims, and since the beginning of my Administration, we have nearly tripled the number of victims connected to services.</em>&quot;   -   <strong>FollowdaMoney, follow the kids!</strong>   - </p>
<p><em>&quot;I call upon businesses, national and community organizations, families, and all Americans to recognize the vital role we must play in ending all forms of slavery and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.&quot;</em> <strong>PG Bandwagon?</strong></p>

<p>&quot;DHS created the Blue Campaign in 2010 to serve as the Department’s unified voice to combat human trafficking. By prioritizing the fight against human trafficking and improving our coordination across the Department on this important issue, we embarked on a concerted effort to raise public consciousness of human trafficking, protect victims, and bring perpetrators to justice.&quot; </p>
<p><em>&quot;January 11 is the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/blue-campaign">Blue Campaign’s</a> &quot;Wear Blue Day&quot;, a day where we can all pledge our solidarity with victims of human trafficking and raise awareness about, and work to end, this heinous crime.&quot;</em>   -   Not commenting on effectiveness of this strategy, but <strong>could we possibly check pics/twitter/social to see if any officials opted to wear just blue on 11 Jan 17 possibly signalling commitment?</strong> </p>

<p><em>&quot;#EndTrafficking isn’t just a hashtag -– it’s the very real objective behind National Human Trafficking Prevention Month.&quot;</em> <strong>Twitter Bandwagon ?</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;Even the mansions of the affluent can be the scene of human trafficking when domestic workers are forced to work excessive hours with little or no pay.</em>&quot; - the affluent probably isn’t a PG mention seeing that this is about foreign policy right?</p>
<p><em>&quot;For the Department of State and the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), the goal to #EndTrafficking is yet another way to serve both the United States and humanity at large.&quot;</em>   -  yet another way? hmm, some rules above (in the article) it states:   - <em>&quot;this fight is a priority of our foreign policy</em>&quot;  -  funny choice of framing things if you ask me...</p>
<p><em>&quot;By better identifying how traffickers use force, fraud, or coercion to trap their victims, we might have a better grasp on how to prevent this crime from happening in the first place. &quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;DSS (Diplomatic Security Service) special agents work in 275 U.S. embassies and consulates in 170 foreign countries, and we are frequently at the epicenter of multi-national investigations, including those involving human trafficking.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;A crucial part of the DSS human trafficking effort is ensuring victims receive support and assistance. DSS is able to provide help through the DSS Victims’ Resource Advocacy Program (VRAP)&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Some investigations result in federal indictments, jail terms, and stiff financial penalties. In other cases, victims are removed from the trafficking situation and primarily want assistance getting home to their families.&quot;</em> - so getting back to family in some cases is more important than achieving justice? - </p>

<p><em>&quot;targeting a problem with an estimated <strong>20 million victims</strong> in every corner of the world.&quot;</em>   -  20 Million?, ok that clarifies Obama\'s <em>&quot;millions&quot;</em> statement earlier..</p>
<p><em>&quot;I have also found strong partners in Congress, where many Members from both parties are leaders on this important issue.&quot;</em>  - yes this is bi-partisan!   -</p>
<p><em>&quot;Just last month, following a long collaboration with congressional partners, the President signed into law a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 that authorizes State Department funding to be used for grants that support transformational programs to reduce the prevalence of modern slavery.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>messing up the timeline here but I found this one very interesting…</strong></p>
<p><strong>2017-01-04 Department of Defense</strong> <a href="http://archive.is/49mQq">published a article</a> by Cheryl Pellerin, reporting on \'a recent DoD news interview\' with Wade Shen a program manager in <strong>DARPA</strong>\'s Information Innovation\'s Office talking about project <strong>MEMEX</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;the program, called Memex, is designed to help law enforcement officers and others perform online investigations to hunt down human traffickers.&quot;</em> link to memex site <a href="http://archive.is/1VoqW">http://archive.is/1VoqW</a></p>
<p><em>“Our goal is to understand the footprint of human trafficking in online spaces, whether that be the dark web or the open web,”</em></p>
<p><em>“Victims of sex trafficking are often sold as prostitutes online, and a number of websites are the advertising point where people who want to buy and people who are selling can exchange information, or make deals. “ That\'s What we\'re looking for,”</em></p>
<p><em>“If we could do that,” he said, “we could … generate leads for investigators so they wouldn’t have to sift through millions of ads in order to find the small number of ads that are associated with trafficking. So that\'s what we did.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Since the beginning of the program, we\'ve had a strong relationship with the district attorney of New York, but they\'re not the only user of the technology. Over time, we have engaged with many different law enforcement agencies, including 26 in the United Kingdom, the district attorney of San Francisco, and a number of others,”</em></p>
<p><em>“there have been hundreds of arrests and other convictions by a variety of law enforcement agencies in the United States and abroad.”</em> - due to memex as claimed</p>
<p><em>”When Shen’s team started the program, one of the things they realized was that the cost of people in these spaces, <strong>the cost of slaves, is essentially zero</strong>, he added.”</em></p>
<p><em>“That means our lives are essentially worthless in some sense, and that just seems wrong,”</em></p>',

            Somehow I wonder how hard the ones in charge of all these Depts. will really push hard to spoil all their own fun and for their pals as well.  The ones below and under them may try to get a few things done, but their bosses will be putting the stick in the spokes.

              Italy - WOW, I outlined the borders and just the entire country seems so be PACKED with trafficking - surrounding areas (balkan) show heat as well, but the yellow intensity seems to line up with the borders. the area of Turin/Milan in the top left seems the hotbed, as well as Rome/the Vatican in the middle. Guess there have been links established between Italy &amp; pedo (Vatican &amp; Berlusconi) &amp; the odd
