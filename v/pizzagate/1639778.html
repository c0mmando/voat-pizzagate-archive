            Makes you wonder more and more about Dianna....  I'm sure there are theories spinning, already about her death with credibility out there.  Perhaps we should be researching those names and working up leads.

            The British royals are rotten to the core. That's what centuries of inbreeding will do I suppose.

             Don't know what the protocol is in the world of the Royal Elite, since he is a Bishop he cannot be Knighted?  I propose that the Pedophile Friends of the Royals have been Knighted.  Sir Richard Branson, Sir Elton John, there are many others.  Was Ball one of his old hunting buddies?  You know, the hunters that hunted those children that are part of Fiona Barnett's account to the Court of Brussels?  I am sick of their being pardoned for defiling our children and killing as well.  This must come out.  We must not be afraid to talk of it.  I do not care what people say about me. We are the people the children have been waiting for.    Prince Charles is a murdering rapist. Do not be afraid.  Say it over and over.

              Prince Charles learned his raping, and mirdering of children from his disgusting parents. Look into the claims from Canada and other countries saying that decades ago the royal couple would take kids out of orphanages and they would never return. In many of these places mass graves of children have later been discovered. They are sick, sick, sick all of them! We need to stop idolizing nasty people!

               I heartily agree with everything you say.  Lord Mountbatten was another rapist.  Lord Lady Sir Dame and all that other crap.  Who cares,  I will boycott the Grammys and when the time comes the Oscars.  I have not watched for years for they are a bunch of over-sexed brainwashed robots.  Edit:  Lady Diana knew too much and like the others did not approve of raping children.

                 I read the other day (and if someone knows where please let me know) about how the Illuminati or Elite are doing something with the MK Ultra or Project Monarch robots by impregnating them with twins (or something like that), notice that the Clooneys just announced they are having twins and so are Beyonce and Jay Z.  What a kwinkie-dink.  Hmmmm.  If you think this is a coincidence, wake up.  Remember the big fund raiser for Hillary?  The reward for your donation was sitting with Amal and George at the Event. Also, we know about the connection  that Lady B and Hubby have with the Obamas.  I am going to research this gene pregnancy stuff.  Help me out if you can.  I just ready so much sometimes, but I do know I read about it.

            A predatory bishop who had links to Prince Charles has been freed from prison halfway through his sentence for sex offences. Peter Ball, described as a ‘monster’ by his victims, served only 16 months for grooming and molesting aspiring novice monks. One victim committed suicide while others have suffered long-lasting trauma.
           </p>
           <p>
            Survivors condemned the early release of the 84-year-old former Bishop of Lewes and Gloucester. He was jailed for 32 months in 2015 for offences against 18 teenagers and young men between 1977 and 1992, but was allowed out on licence at the halfway point of his sentence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Richard Scorer, an abuse lawyer at Slater and Gordon who represented some of Ball’s victims, said his early release after ‘a gross and systematic abuse of trust spanning decades’ was ‘an affront to justice’.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ball was first investigated in 1992 but escaped with a caution. It emerged later that an unnamed royal was among Establishment figures who had written in support of Ball at the time.

           </p>
           <p>
            After his caution, Ball was provided with a Duchy of Cornwall home by Prince Charles. Ball counted Charles as a ‘loyal friend’.
In 2012 police reopened their investigation after new allegations against Ball.
           </p>
           <p>
            After his jailing, a spokesman for Charles denied that the prince had intervened in the judicial process on his behalf in 1992 but failed to deny there had been a letter in support of Ball. Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, most prisoners can be released at the halfway point of their sentence.
