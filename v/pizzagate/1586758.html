<p>Quite a lot of people here on VOAT seem to think that it is just &quot;piping&quot;, but that is not what is on the picture.</p>
<p>Here is an example of real piping:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_(fluid_conveyance)#/media/File:Encanamento.JPG">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_(fluid_conveyance)#/media/File:Encanamento.JPG</a></p>
<p>Notice the straight lines, the narrow ditch and that nobody works with a jackhammer outside the ditch.</p>
<p>At Pegasus they dug these ditches rather randomly (did not care to cut the concrete but instead just smashed it).
Also, look at the first picture:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/aiiUE">http://archive.is/aiiUE</a></p>
<p>From the wall you can clearly see that this whole is located behind the guy with the jackhammer, therefore the ditch does not just go to the door, but seems to go along the wall as well. Therefore we not only have the Y-shaped ditch in the center of the room but another ditch along the wall as well. That\'s just too many ditches for piping.
(BTW, does anybody know what a &quot;pop-up&quot; is in that context?)</p>
<p>Also: Note that the guy with the jackhammer has already broken up the whole left area. No need to do that for piping. Then, in the foreground, the concrete seems to have been removed already.</p>
<p>So I think it is safe to say that the whole floor was completely removed.</p>
<p>The question is: What did JA construct there?</p>
<p>Hypothesis 1: Killroom, as shown here:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/ambitjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/freezerkillroom.png">https://i0.wp.com/ambitjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/freezerkillroom.png</a></p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was posted after the construction pics, thus JA could be showing off the result of all that hard work</li>
<li>Happened before: Marc Dutroux and others have dug secret &quot;extensions&quot; to their basements</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doesn\'t seem to be the ideal place for <s>occult ceremonies</s>modern art, etc.</li>
<li>When talking to Ryan O\'Neill, JA was very concerned about Pegasus, but not really about the killroom (IIRC he wrote &quot;you can keep your killroom-stuff&quot;)</li>
<li>Why would you need a cooler in the first place is questionable</li>
<li>And if it\'s intended as a cooler for temporary storage for bodies it is far too large.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hypothesis 2: Tunnel to some other building / DC underground system</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seems a bit farfetched for me</li>
<li>No need to remove the whole floor to connect to a tunnel</li>
</ul>
<p>Hypothesis 3: Just piping</p>
<p>Of course JA could have had some piping need and have decided for whatever reason to also replace the floor, maybe because it was damaged or he didn\'t want to have some &quot;scars&quot; on the floor after the pipes were replaced.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The concrete floor does not seem to be damaged in any way, so there would be no need to replace it</li>
<li>If you look at how seedy, slimy and dirty Comet Ping Pong is (where for example I have seen pictures of damaged parts of the floor) JA does not seem to be the type of person who replaces the whole floor to fix a crack in it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hypothesis 4: Marc Dutroux-style dungeon</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedos have dug secret extensions to their basements many times before, can happen again.</li>
<li>Makes sense that JA is so scared about Pegasus</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>After thinking about it for a while I no longer think that the cooler-&quot;killroom&quot; as posted on his instagram is relevant at all. It does not seem to fit the whole occultist theme, the cooling system is redundant and JA does not seem very concerned about it.
But the whole operation at Pegasus seems to be relevant - much more so than whatever happens at Comet Ping Pong.
IMO at Comet Ping Pong they keep it mostly legal while the really crazy stuff happens at Pegasus (and/or &quot;the farm&quot;).</p>
<p>So what did he construct at Pegasus? Is there anything I missed about Pegasus?</p>',

            I never thought the killroom was located at Pegasus Museum. I think the refrigerated unit is at the farm they always talk about (perhaps Jamie T's farm), or another one.

            I agree that the killroom is a dead end. I think its just a sick joke between friends. Being in the restaurant biz for a long time and have heard cooks and chefs that were genuinely good people refer to a dark basement as the "rape room". Just being cheeky amongst themselves. Plus I saw that JA commented kill room on his friends dark back room. I legitimately believe JA was just shopping for new walk in coolers for the restaurant. There are so many other avenues to pursue and this thing is so much bigger than James and his shitty little pizza shop

            There isn't a shred of evidence except simple chronology that the #killroom is directly related to the construction at Pegasus. But there are strong indications that it cannot be.
           </p>
           <p>
            The kind of ground work in the pictures does not fit a walk-in freezer. The #killroom freezer looks anything but new. And subsequent investigation into Pegasus, its layout, location and likely function makes a walk-in freezer there unlikely.

              There is a shower head...so there was plumbing already there AND the shop was there...so why the need to tear up everything and build in 2014 on the ground floor besides his "museum" on the top floor?

            Well, just him being JA is enough to think he might have a Kill Room, but we need proof.  When he went off the deep end over the pictures of Pegasus Museum being shown and threatening the poster that was an alarm to me.  Very suspicious.

             Exactly.

            <p>
             Also - whatever he did there is very hard to remove / cover up / restore to how it was before.

             This is serious construction work that involved at least 3 people and several tons of material.

            <p>
             If (hopefully) the police starts an investigation, they will find something there.

              Somehow there must be a way to get them to investigate.  I heard they were looking into the case because of his threat to the person that posted the pictures of the Kill Room.  I cannot believe that they have not seen the pictures.  Why has JA not been called in and questioned?  Has he?  If not, why not?  Something must be done about this.  It is highly suspect.
