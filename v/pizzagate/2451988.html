            This goes towards showing how disaster adoptions are a thing. That theme would make a good post, especially if there is a reasonable way to estimate how many of those adoptions could be nefarious.

            "Leading the way was the Obama administration, which responded to the crisis, and to the pleas of prospective adoptive parents and the lawmakers assisting them, by lifting visa requirements for children in the process of being adopted by Americans."
           </p>
           <p>
            Have we forgotten about Obama's flood of illegal "UNACOMPANIED CHILDREN" into this country?
           </p>
           <p>
            “In recent weeks, we’ve seen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive at the border, brought here and to other countries by smugglers and traffickers,” Obama said.
But the number of unaccompanied children — specifically from the Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — has been rising steadily since fiscal year 2012,  as we wrote in a June 27 article, and the administration late last year projected a significant spike for this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, 2014.
In fiscal year 2012, the administration was initially caught off guard by a surge of illegal border crossings by children. In its FY2012 report to Congress, HHS said there was “a rapid, unanticipated, and unprecedented increase in UAC referrals from DHS.” In a separate report on its activity in FY2012, the Office of Refugee Resettlement said it served “a total of 13,625 children for the year — more than double FY2011, and far exceeding the 8,200 projected.”
Referrals nearly doubled again in FY2013. ORR’s annual report for FY2013 said the UAC program “continued to experience increasing referrals.” The report said, “There were 24,668 UAC placed in care, as compared to 13,625 UAC in FY12. The annual average prior to the influx was 6,700 UAC.”
By the end of fiscal year 2013, the administration projected the number of unaccompanied children referred to the ORR for placement would more than double to 60,000."
