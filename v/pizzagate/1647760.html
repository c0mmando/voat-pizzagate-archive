            I promised to keep this updated and I will for anyone following:
           </p>
           <p>
            Today, the Union Leader is reporting that on Jan 30th the state filed a tax lien on Thomas Katsiantonis.  He apparantly owes almost 500k in back taxes.
           </p>
           <p>
            At face value it seems this story may have been mistakenly attributed to Pizzagate, but I'm not convinced we have learned all there is to know about this situation.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              The state AG still will not comment on the nature of the investigation.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The search warrants involved also included Zoey's Pizza, which is not owned by Mr. Katsiantonis. (IMO the biggest reason to think there is more to the story)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              What type of pizza place(or two)  is grossing $5million a year?  NH has a 9%meals tax and he owes 500k for the time frame between Jan 2013 and Jan 2014?  I've been to all 3 of the dumps that are being investigated and would be surprised if all of them combined came anywhere close to 5 million. Since he doesnt own Zoey's, that means 2 pizza shops in run down areas of a run down city are somehow grossing $5million that we know about?(he's committing evasion so there's probably money you can't account for as well) I call shenanigans on that based on knowing this city and these restaurants first hand.

            "While Katsiantonis owns a Grand Slam Pizza on Mammoth Road, he sold a similarly named pizza restaurant on South Main Street about 10 years ago, said George Kostakis, who purchased it from Katsiantonis.
           </p>
           <p>
            He stressed that Katsiantonis remains a friend"

            a few more tiny pieces of tealeaves swirling around in the cup.....with no visible focus, no potential "total solar eclipse" that would magically force the.... who, exactly?   ....to do or say..... what exactly?
           </p>
           <p>
            This movement is in big danger of getting washed away from EVER getting central-staged, by the first next piece of disastrous news that actually has a central focus.  EG, Oroville going all the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            I strongly appreciate the desire to make the world a safer place for kids. But I don't foresee any denouement which would "stamp out polio forever" to use a sort-of apropos analogy. Hence, I am currently theorizing that the west will actually slowly become a safer place for kids - but it won't particularly get noticed. It certainly will not stamp out the desire to rentseek by being an "advocate for children".   As long as those guys solicit contributions, people will assume that there is some small problem which is mostly under control.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just some off-the-wall thinking.....
           </p>
           <p>
            This movement needs some alinsky-ite thinking. first off, there has to be an identifiable goal A "smoking gun" moment. Without that, people will drift off to the next Big Thing..

            I am very familiar with Dean Kamen. I'm surprised you didn't mention his FIRST organization considering its proximity to children. I guess anything is possible, but having met him and being very familiar with his work, I would find it hard to believe he is involved in pizzagate, but he is very influential in the city and most likely knows the Alderman. I personally feel he is a good man, but I've been proven wrong before.

            Sealing the search warrant and citing an "unnamed federal agency" makes it seem like there could be something else! Let's hope they release more info soon.

             My first thought on seeing it was, "hmm pizza place, Dem politicians, media reports giving off a vibe of hiding or covering something up? yeah I better tell someone who cares before all of it disappears" I figure if some someone here finds it and does some research magic something more might come up in time. I'll update when I see more info.
