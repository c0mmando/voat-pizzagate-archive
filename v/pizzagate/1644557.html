            It appears the mother's name is Grace Kellie because she commented in the YT thread.  This isn't an anomaly it happens every single day. I've seen plenty of these types of videos, here's another  where a 5 yr old is being taken from Kansas, the woman narrating is a well known advocate in that state who helps parents who are unjustly having their children removed by CPS..

            What I find is that people don't want to know. The kids talked about in this interview lived just a few miles from me.  Area high school. Just a few weeks ago 3 girls from my area went missing over a weekend.  I know one girl got rescued in Austin from this bad ass special forces group

            but I never heard a thing about the other girls.  People have no problem sharing a missing child pic, but don't want to engage in any conversations about what is really going on.  I'm a parent of a 14 yr old girl and 12 year old boy so I understand it is terrifying to think about and we believe it can never happen and would rather believe that somehow the missing kid did something wrong or simply ran away.  You try to be vigilant, yet not so overprotective you damage the growth of your child.  Just have to keep showing people the truth without being so overwhelming that they tune you out or block you.

            ive lived in houston for a long time.  unfortunately this city is really bad with human trafficking.  maybe it has something to do that were the most diverse city in the country?  who knows.  regardless it sucks.

            Children aren't only lured you also have CPS and law enforcement forcefully removing them, ever day in every state.  Here's a video of one that just happened last week where the children are traumatized from being ripped from their mother.

            No...I was just in Houston...here is the thing...in Houston, the center of homosexual wealth and business ownership is located in the lower Westheimer/Montrose area....so if one was going to investigate young boys being trafficked, this is the area/business owners to look at.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have never really considered it from this angle, but I will tell you that as far as the club scene goes, especially at that time regarding gay establishments, and potential young boy trafficking...3 names come to mind...Number's (club with prominent homosexual owners), Rich's (very popular gay club with hetero night on Thursdays), and the Record Rack (Indie record shop that was plugged into the gay community).  Might be interesting to see if the owners have connection to any known players revealed recently...another predominantly homosexual male and very successful business in this area are large flower shops.
           </p>
           <p>
            Side note:  Houston is strange because of all the oil money...commonly referred to as "white trash with cash"....J. Howard Marshall was hanging out in a seedy titty bar named GiGi's Cabaret when he met/married Anna Nicole Smith....point is, you just never know where this stuff starts.

            We need a hack of law enforcement agencies exposing the corruption.  Their computer systems I would think are not of the most secure level. CopLeaks.   Anyone hooked up with hackers?

            HPD is a strange organization.  The rank and file officers are generally pretty cool and honest, but it is corrupt at the top.  Generally because Houston has Progressive mayors due to the city center's voting power...couple this with Texas CPS being corrupt and that is where the problems lay.

            Here is a fascinating story about a dude enslaving young boys that eventually revolted and killed him...the mansion was creepy...very large with a bowling alley and huge open area in the center, basically a mirror image with the bedrooms on the ends.  Seabrook is also kinda strange...lots of prohibition era speak easy's at the time due to the port which then evolved to a seedy biker hangout, and is now a touristy hot-spot with roller coasters and shit....

              I went into it twice before it was bulldozed...it was a rite of passage to get into it and explore it without the cops busting you...it had a REALLY dark feel to it.  You could literally feel that some bad shit had happened there.  La Porte?  You and I are rivals and that's all I'm going to say about that!   And let's hear it for Moses Lake!

                  Yeah, Kemah had flavor back then...I'll go old school on you...I knew the original owners of Jerry's Pier 8 and Rachel's...they were characters. Jerry was Rachel's daughter and died young from pancreatic cancer.  Rachel's was one of the speak easy's during Prohibition I mentioned.   I kid you not, she drank a case of Pearl light A DAY until she was in her 70's and made it to 80 years old.  Damn flu got her.   She probably shouldn't have quit drinking.
EDIT:  The traffic sucks there now, which makes me avoid the place unless we are going to fish at Moses or eat at Sushi Coast, which is one of the best kept restaurant secrets in the area IMO...

            This has been hoing on too long.  See the documentary boys for sale which is from the 80's and talks extensively about houston and how cops, judges, politicians etc are involved.

            With the Sandusky back in the news I think we all need to come together here and understand there is a pattern.  People charged with enforcing the law are often compromised.    Another good thread on here that points out another thing we need to understand - major MSM coverage of child abuse busts seem to just fade away.  How many went to jail?, what happened to the kids? Little to no follow up.  Beginning to think the big buts covered by MSM are just for show - maybe a few go to jail.  Show is to lull the public back to sleep and think our children are being protected.

             George Webb has tied all of it together. Lots of top cops involved bc they get kickbacks. Lesser cops are brought in through classic brownstone ops.

              lots of people have tied it together.  Yet here we are and it is still a problem and it is not going to just stop.  We can research all we like but if we expect LE etc to do anything well that seems magical thinking.  So how are we going to get action on this?

               We need to take back control of the media.  Then we can take back control of our federal offices.  then they can rain death on those below.  Local politics is dangerous, but you may be able to get away with some limited action.  Better build intel and word of mouth to the trusted and let the gossip spread that go to the papers.  Get FBI to investigate.  Hopefully Sessions will sink in some excellent control over the FBI.

            One has merely to google DC Metro Police trafficking, to see that it is clear a lot of police departments are in on this. Fresno? Oakland? Every time you turn around.

              They went through a few police chiefs because it seemed everyone was involved in either trafficking or accepting favors from the trafficked girls.

            I watched a documentary that was made back in the early 80's and it centered around Houston.  Which at that time had a prevalence of child trafficking, and HUGE teenage-gay prostitution scene.  It centered around young teens that were stolen or had run away from across the country, and many of whom ended up in Houston. These young boys were often forced into, or had to turn to gay prostitution to survive.
           </p>
           <p>
            The filmmakers had several good sources and witnesses, all of who had said there were very powerful people involved in the scene as Johns.
           </p>
           <p>
            Houston PD was not at all interested in solving the underage prostitution problem back then.

             I can tell you why...illegals...the majority of underage prostitution in Houston is centered around illegals.  The age of consent in meheeco is 12.   This is centered around what is known as "Pony Bars"...patrons buy 7oz beers called "Coronitas" for exorbitant amounts and get to dance with underage prostitutes..if they like them, they can take them to shacks located on premises for an extra fee.  Houston is a sanctuary city...hence this shit gets ignored until it becomes inconvenient.  Plus, there is the backpage underage prostitute scene...which for some reason tends to involve mostly black pimps.
            </p>
            <p>
             Funny story regarding Pony Bars:  I asked my former brother in-law (Ft. Bend EMT) what his most common call was...he replied "Chicken Breath"...I responded with "Wut?"...so it goes something like this...illegal alien Pablo gets paid in cash every Friday and goes to the Pony Bar to dance with and maybe have sex with a 15 year old hooker....he needs to unwind.  When drunk Pablo gets home with no money, Maria lays into him, because she needs money for tortillas and shit.  Pablo is macho and don't take no lip...smacks her around a bit and what not.  Maria then hyperventilates.   Pablo realizes this is the mother of his 6 children, who are now all crying in Spanish...so he calls 911.  EMT's arrive and ask what is going on...to which Pablo replies "She can't breath (no E)"...which sounds amazingly like Chicken Breath....
