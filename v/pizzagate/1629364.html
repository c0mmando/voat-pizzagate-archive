            I have some similar concerns.  But basing your argument on your Bu Boo's testimony is more flawed than others hoping that FBIanon is real.   She seems ignorant of WikiLeaks and many other sources.  Further, she seems to have zero concern or knowledge of pedophilia and trafficking as a national problem.  'Situated professionally' means to me she is about 70 working in the evidence basement and has no clue what is going on.
And she also suggested we put in a 'public records request'.  If she meant FOIA she should have said it.  It is about as convincing as calling the Bureau 'the Bu'  which I have never heard even though I know retired FBI agents.  (Don't ask me to ask them anything because they are hateful human beings, most def not good guys).
So, AreWeSure, you have to use the same integrity in making your arguments that you use in attacking other peoples' posts.

            "So we shall which one of these was closer to the truth"........I see your point AreWeSure but let's step back a second. You refuse to watch "Clinton Cash" or any of the 108 George Webb videos. You refuse to even entertain the possibility the Clinton Foundation has broken the law.
           </p>
           <p>
            You could argue the Clintons won't ever be CONVICTED. But you could easily come up with 10 flagrant high crimes and misdemeanors. There's potential Money Laundering, Pay to Play(a.k.a. bribery), human trafficking etc etc. With all that YOU WON'T ADMIT THERE IS EVEN ONE PIECE OF EVIDENCE POINTING TO A CRIME.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is that? It's bizarre to be honest. You've got people like Jeffrey Sachs who's about as objective as you could get saying the Clinton Foundation is up to no good. I believe his words were "It's bad, real bad.". That's not good when you've got a world renown professor of economics from Columbia saying multiple crimes have taken place and you can't come up with even ONE piece of evidence?

            Yeah no shit, we are aware of how criminal investigations and cases work. What we also know is that when law enforcement agencies know that they will be backed up by the highest levels of our government and moving forward won't cause them to risk their careers and lives, this shit will break wide open!

            There's no basis for a warrant.  Or as the visitor put it .
            <em>
             There is no reasonable suspicion in pizzagate because its very foundational evidence is baseless
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been asking people for a while now, what is the probable cause you would use to get a warrant.  How would you articulate that?    So far no takers.
           </p>
           <p>
            To me pizzagate is podesta/alefantis.  What's crime occurred?  What the evidence that would support that crime.  I don't think people understand how weak and arbitrary this evidence is.  That's why people are so eager to bring other things into it.  Norway! The Masons! Cannibalism! Owls!
So no.  I don't think the police should arbitrarily be arresting people based on message board theorizing.

             You've got to understand what AreWeSure means when he says "its very foundational evidence is baseless". He means baseless because old rich white people like the Sandlers and metro-sexual Instagram friends like "dr.nwo" are both incapable of committing crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             So for example "dr.nwo" added a comment to a picture about a pizza party: "Haitian special with extra-cheese". We don't know when the comment was made which is important b/c if it was before Pizzagate broke it means the "Haitian special" isn't what you think it is.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why is AreWeSure certain that "dr.nwo" is a pizzagater and not a friend of JA? Well that's a good question I've asked of AreWeSure and he's yet to reply.
            </p>
            <p>
             He doesn't reply a lot when he's called out on evidence of wrong-doing. Doubt it? Ask him if there's even one tidbit of evidence pointing to a Clinton Foundation crime.

            Eva,

           <p>
            unfortunately Trump (his motive and blundering aside) is the only hope the US  has at addressing any of this, as the pedo/balckmailing goes throughout all levels of our government on both political sides. We do have some encouraging reasons to believe that pederasty and CP is being addressed, and only despair if it is not.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reasons are:
           </p>
           <p>
            Trumps's outsider status
           </p>
           <p>
            The support of FBIanon / Comey's reopening of the email investigation
           </p>
           <p>
            Panic and scrubbing by the MSM and establishment
           </p>
           <p>
            Deaths of informants
           </p>
           <p>
            Recent rash of CP arrests &amp; silence on current Clinton Foundation investigation
           </p>
           <p>
            So, we here have no control over what happens, but we (I) feel that every valuable contribution and new person who becomes aware is progress and pressure toward our goal. Thanks for your contributions, too.

            If we assume that Prince, Jones, the NYPD and others are not liars, and that they have seen the "insurance files", I think it is safe to say there is an investigation which has been underway for a long time.

              Yes we have.  I pulled an article at random, but I have read dozens that say the same:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department’s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co- conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              From:
              <a href="http://archive.is/AmR6j">
               Archived True Pundit
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              If we do not see the drop from the FBI, we will know that Comey or Deputy McCabe (whose wife received $675,000 in campaign donations from Clintons) is dragging their feet.

               There's no way NYPD Chief was involved in that article.   If they wanted to rock the boat, they would go to actual and influential media of which there are plenty in NYC.
