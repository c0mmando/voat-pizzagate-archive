<p>Trump\'s own ex-wife has even claimed he assaulted her in the past. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is Jill Harth, who filed a lawsuit in 1997 claiming Trump groped her, propositioned her, and forcibly took her into her daughter\'s bedroom in an attempt to sleep with her. <strong>Or Trump’s own wife, Ivana, who stated in a 1993 deposition that he had raped her.</strong></p>
<p>Ivana later issued a statement, provided by Trump\'s lawyers, saying she didn\'t mean the term in a &quot;criminal sense.&quot; But the encounter, laid out in the 1993 book &quot;Lost Tycoon,&quot; is undeniably violent and forceful.</p>
<p>&quot;[Trump] rips off her clothes and unzips his pants,&quot; author Harry Hunt writes. &quot;Then he jams his penis inside her for the first time in 16 months. Ivana is terrified. This is not lovemaking. This is not romantic sex. This is a violent assault.&quot;</p>
<p>Trump dismissed the account as false, and said it was written by &quot;an unattractive guy who is a vindictive and jealous person.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would take a very long post to highlight each and every Trump related sexual abuse case, but if need be I will update and edit this post throughout the night, to highlight the fact that he is not only a false icon for us, but he <em>himself</em> is potentially involved in the stuff we are trying to expose. </p>
<p>Do not look to political demagogues like Trump to save us. We need to take the fight to the masses and wake them up ourselves. If anybody has anything else to ass to this argument, post in the comments.</p>',

            research post, but merely you spewing your opinions. We require every major claim be sourced with links to supporting evidence and remove those that don't. So: here's your 24 Hour warning flair, as well as my official notice that your disregard for our subverse rules is now becoming a pattern, which will lead to your being banned from posting here.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to bitch about Trump and your obsession with "political demagogues", go do it in

            </a>
            . We are focused here on the sexual abuse of kids by the elite, of which there has never been any credible evidence presented by anyone that Trump is involved in. Human traffickers have been busted in the thousands since he took office, and he's got a task force to combat it and several executive orders. He's attempting to build a wall that will make it 100x harder for cross-border trafficking to occur. So you need to come up with some evidence to support the "lackadaisical approach" you posit, or this post will be deleted.

            Look... this is just a hit job on Trump.... If anyone thinks that a billionaire playboy doesn't put aggressive moves on women they are just plain stupid. I don't believe Trump would fuck a 12 year old when he could fuck an 18 year old. I think he probably did try and bang a maid or assistant or two as any man with a decent level of testosterone would. it makes him an asshole not a rapist. Epstien was very selective of who he let in on his penchant for little kids. That is why the list of people to testify against him was so short. I am sure he hinted to Trump but Trump probably said"I don't wanna know" which makes him kind of an asshole... but again not a rapist...

            Now Bill clinton on the other hand looks and acts like the kind of perv ho would love to be on a room with epstein and a few 12 year olds and watch each other get blown....
           </p>
           <p>
            as for him raping his wife.. he probably was just taking what he felt he had paid for a BILLION times over and she was bogarting the pussy.
           </p>
           <p>
            He should have just had a hot girl come in and fuck him on the marital bed with that bitch wife laying their in horror.
           </p>
           <p>
            It wasn't rape he was using her for a cum dumpster to let her know she was nothing but a hole to him due to her bitchy behavior.

             I don't know whether this story is true or not.

             What I do know is that you're actually defending violent behaviour.

             It's not a "hit job", most people here are aware of Trump's relationship with Epstein.

             This political deflection to crimes on the left and "Whataboutism" is getting old.

             If any politician on the Left were implicated in what I posted, a lot of people here would jump all over it. Don't pick favorites. There i a clear link here worth considering.
