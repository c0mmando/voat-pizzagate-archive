<p>recent news report out of Somalia recounts the journey of a woman and her two children who traveled to Egypt, most likely being trafficked by the East African version of a coyote who shuttles refugees and migrants from sub-saharan African to Europe.  By one account, the woman was unable to pay the traffickers so they turned to another way to extract value from their human cargo.  All three were murdered and sliced open, their livers and kidneys harvested for retail sale on the black market</p>
<p>While ISIS is well known to be involved in human trafficking, there have long been allegations that the group engages in organ trafficking as well, however hard evidence has not been forthcoming.  With large numbers of civilian hostages held by ISIS in Tal Afar and Raqqa, some have speculated that the terrorist group sells organs to wealthy Gulf State Arabs who need kidneys.</p>
<p>what do you think?  worthwhile to wake the masses?</p>
<p>will accept all comments, all suggestions </p>
<p>Mods....Yea, I know the rules, but I get 24 hrs right?</p>',

            The hospital in which young Alfie Evans died (possibly murdered, as he was given 4 separate injections in quick succession by a nurse before his respiratory system suddenly shut down) was busted for harvesting children's organs:

            In the Irish Free State, with virtually no laws or regulations in place, the organs of dead children have been fair game for quite some time (and with the recent child murder referendum in the Godless cesspit that I once regarded as my homeland, the modern day temples to Moloch known as abortion clinics which will spring up in its wake stand to make a killing, both figuratively and literally):

             there were articles from here where nurses hasten the death of organ donors with shots of something
            </p>
            <p>
             with young children they have to go size of children, think once kids get to 100 lbs their organs can be used in adults, at that weight they can take adult dose medicine
            </p>
            <p>
             but the young ones its size
            </p>
            <p>
             will write down laws regarding children and organ donating

            To awaken people, it needs to be televised.  On the major networks,  regular broadcasting is interrupted, the  awakening video of all times plays, and it remains on automatic rerun.  Is that even remotely possible?

              The original links that went with above Steemit article, and were later removed, have been archived. I'll see if I can track them down.
Not sure why they were removed. If I remember correctly, Webb never documented his info. That was always my problem with him. I thought v4vapid did a brilliant research job. I think the trail leading to Jacksonville is accurate.

              <p>
               Thanks, haven't even gotten to his work yet
              </p>
              <p>
               theres so much out there, Why is this not being addressed?  where are the protests
              </p>
              <p>
               it's so ugly, so sad, Immigration has some BAD stories
              </p>
              <p>
               to prey on poor and desperate people like they are doing is just horrible
              </p>
              <p>
               and when I think of why they are running, there are some Politicians I'd like to see tied to poles in public places
              </p>
              <p>
               whats difficult is finding stuff that specify Children, but they are out there
              </p>
              <p>
               only thing keeps us going on this is the Children and we want it stopped
              </p>
              <p>
               There are 3 of us :)
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank You again for links, will take whatever you can send
              </p>
              <p>
               getting a handle on it, at least how to break it down
              </p>
              <p>
               also working on Haiti for some friends, she trying to wake a group up before Trump comes out with the truth down there
              </p>
              <p>
               I feed them links and they go for it, figure Haiti would be good, and hopefully it will turn the vote in that city
              </p>
              <p>
               they have it easier than I do, friends don't need links, they have cred and that's all they need, but if someone does ask, they have it :)
              </p>
              <p>
               illegal organ trafficking, and disappearing blacks seem to be getting them to wake up :)
              </p>
              <p>
               so anything you can send, I promise I will make use of it
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks

             I think every " police action" isn't that what they called Vietnam? anyways every country we went into after that, they grabbed organs
            </p>
            <p>
             every country that had upheavel, organs were grabbed
            </p>
            <p>
             Bosnia? so many
            </p>
            <p>
             most grabbed up I assume positive blood, wonder how they grab up the negative ones?
            </p>
            <p>
             not easy as getting positives
            </p>
            <p>
             just found articles they now have machines that keep organs warm and blood running
            </p>
            <p>
             amazing what I finding, never took the time before

           <p>
            if I can come up with a solid, impeccable post, probaly posts,  with no names, except maybe those that have been busted, that would be in links provided,
           </p>
           <p>
            answering as many questions that would come up,
           </p>
           <p>
            would you be willing to make a vid on it?
           </p>
           <p>
            started with the Mexico post and realized this could wake a lot of people up, link in above post
           </p>
           <p>
            it will take some time to make it strong, news media seems to stay away from this subject
           </p>
           <p>
            look it all over, comments, is this something you would be interested in doing a vid about?
           </p>
           <p>
            don't mean to put you on spot, and there is a lot of work to do, if you want, you can watch and wait, I ok with that
           </p>
           <p>
            would take any help or advice you can give

             <p>
              have friend who's group is pushing her to do vids, might take you up on that

              I just got idea yesterday
             </p>
             <p>
              right now, looking for good articles
             </p>
             <p>
              so not sure how long, have some great people here, said they would help gather info
             </p>
             <p>
              had to gather what transplanting about, old and new ways, actually fascinating
             </p>
             <p>
              finding a lot in immigration
             </p>
             <p>
              this is so heartbreaking
             </p>
             <p>
              have to see what info I can find, then divide and conquer :)
             </p>
             <p>
              if you almost ready, you can inbox me and I can give you what I have on a certain subject
             </p>
             <p>
              a lot of stuff with Haiti, articles that go back to 2010
             </p>
             <p>
              If you need just holler, but it might take me awhile,
             </p>
             <p>
              did you know they have machines now to keep organ warm and alive now?
             </p>
             <p>
              you have different times between for different organs, so some of these organs are being sold for different reasons, theres rituals, and education, but need to find what else
             </p>
             <p>
              going to cover as much as I can
             </p>
             <p>
              as I said, gather now and divide and conquer :)

              How about a "gingerbread boy" serial comic? He's always trying to escape "helpful" adults WHO WANT TO EAT HIM.
Each adventure would take him to trafficking hot spots like Haiti, Kosovo, Asia. Wherever he goes, people are plotting to eat him. Gingy makes McGiver-like escapes. Story background gives clues about the REAL trafficking business. This could be a SERIAL MEME. Both kids and adults love comics. For a change, LET'S USE ART TO EXPOSE THEM!

             just reminded me that it will come out about Haiti, have to to pull this off in parts, gradual like you say
            </p>
            <p>
             have to remember, there are people that have no idea what going on, and I don't want to name names either, want people to get use to that its even happening
            </p>
            <p>
             we need shock value too, that's the hard part, just the 2 links I found hit hard, can you figure a breakdown, or what would be best to start off with?

            there must be a tissue match for organ transplants. it was rumored that China was putting live prisoners thru tissue analysis so they could provide a ready match after they were executed.   There is more to this than plopping a heart or kidney into a freezer. We. need to take care so we dont look foolish.

             in Mexico post it was stated that they had blood info on the kids at the school
            </p>
            <p>
             course as was also stated in comments, those DNA tests have everything they need

             glad to hear from you, you advice is valued here
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't want to name names yet, just want to get it out there that this is going on
            </p>
            <p>
             something solid, simple
            </p>
            <p>
             people hear Clinton, Silsby or whoever they will shut down and not listen
            </p>
            <p>
             maybe we can include other reasons for child organ trafficking
            </p>
            <p>
             that would have to be researched
            </p>
            <p>
             If good articles name names, so be it, as with the Knights Templers in Mexico, but I want to stay clear of big names at this time, it will doom before its even off the ground

              Let's not forget (and this ALWAYS bothers me) that ALL babies born in hospitals undergo PKU testing. Two different samples of blood are taken and checked for a number of genetic abnormalities. There have been lawsuits from parents because the companies performing the tests were not destroying the samples afterward but instead using them for other things, including selling them 😬

             <p>
              This is an overview of one of the lawsuits, but I had also read about a lawsuit regarding the company in Oregon that services the west coast. It sounded similar.
             </p>
             <p>
              Pretty scary to think these companies are holding on to the genetic info of every child born. I do not trust that this isn't being used for nefarious reasons!

            my nephew donated a kidney to his sister and it was  side by side operations. Organs dont live very long after removal. To be taken seriously we need to be informed as to how the traffickers are able to deliver a viable product.

             You are wise to doubt the sincerity of the clintons regarding their battle against AIDS since BC was involved in shipping HIV and hepatitis tainted blood from the Arkansas prison system to a pharmaceutical company in Canada. Innocent people were ultimately infected with the diseases! Oh, and they KNEW the blood was likely tainted and that pharmaceutical companies had chosen to no longer accept plasma from prisons, so they were deceptive and disguised that the blood was coming from a prison.

            I have a theory,  here in akron ohio we have a muncipial airport where lifeflights to Cleveland Clinic mainly.  The ambulance company is owned by a group of doctors.  This area has many overdoses and is #5 in human trafficking. 
Another theory is the VA and US prison system.  Im a vet and the VA almost killed me so I went searching for the mortality rates it ended with the CDC  emailing me back with this statement "we do not know the VA mortality rates because they will not release the info,  also the same for the US prison system"  thats not word for word but the gist of it. 
I made sure I have an advanced directive and the VA knows I have people who care about me. 
Think about it 350,000 vets died waiting to get care in 2015.
Sorry for typos phone typing ugh

             I've spoken of this.  I can only point, but not plan.  Starts with the satellite teleports/head-end tunr-arounds.  Inject truth there.  Hit 5-10MM audience on EMS interrupt.

              You sound like you know what you're talking about, but you might as well be speaking Latin to me. I honestly believe this is the only way and I think this was what the movie "They Live" was trying to tell us in a roundabout way.

              This is my only suggestion. I talk about the organ harvesting face-to-face with people I know and with strangers. Their faces glaze over and they change the topic. I really don't know what else to do besides suggest hacking the Mockingbird media.

                I hear you, and boots on the ground is what's needed. I don't think writing to politicians would do much good until there's a mass demonstration outside their offices, Times Square, or Rockefeller Center. One way to get the word out is to create address labels with words such as Stop Child Sex Trafficking, Research Laura Silsby, Haiti Hates the Clintons, Elites Harvest Organs, and various hashtags, then stick them on bathroom walls, gas pumps, and other places people will see them and can immediately search the terms on their phones.

                 do you think it would be best to leave out people, silsby, Clintons and just stick with this is happening until we can people to listen?
                </p>
                <p>
                 we can do who's responsible by names later, you talk Clinton and trafficking and there goes the glaze :)
                </p>
                <p>
                 we might even hold off naming UN and NGO's for a bit
                </p>
                <p>
                 get word out that this is happening to children
                </p>
                <p>
                 word it where they have to ask questions, hint but don't say
                </p>
                <p>
                 think that would get more people to listen at first
                </p>
                <p>
                 we could embarrass the people that protest things while children are being murdered for their organs

                  Maybe it would be best to leave out Clinton, but I think Silsby and others who don't have obvious names would be perfect because people have a natural curiosity to find out about people they don't know. Maybe have something like 'Research Silsby #33children'. We need to have hashtags connecting things in order to keep the most vital info together in order to funnel everyone to the proper info and not Snopes. It may be good to direct them to particular CDAN blinds because a lot of people follow this website already, and it will add weight to the info and make them look more deeply, and Snopes doesn't have shit on CDAN.

               I always read comments :)

               thinking back on how this started, how it has spread, not as much as we like, but we can see people speaking out in comments
              </p>
              <p>
               I know there are some that don't like Q, but how did that come about?

               and if we specify Children, which all of us are about, how can we be totally ignored

                Commenting in articles is great as long as you protect your identity. So many places have gotten rid of comments for just this reason and FB is so strongly linked to commenting sections, you really don't want to have someone friend you, then find out who you're friends with and where you hang out. Just be careful! I'll see what else I can think of. There has to be a way to get the word out and avoid direct confrontation and ensure safety at all angles. I've been gang stalked already. It's not fun and makes you very paranoid. If this happens, never react and act as though the person is invisible, and leave the area if you have to. They're relentless and it will never be the same person harassing you, so you don't really know who to look for when you're out.

                 theres ways around that, what worries me is how to get around key words that signal FB or whatever
                </p>
                <p>
                 me and friends been working on it, lol, they have had their share of time outs, but it has worked in their favor
                </p>
                <p>
                 people see they are being censored :)

                <p>
                 I have never trusted a lot of people, been here for over a year, watched everyone's posts and comments
                </p>
                <p>
                 some can come up with different names but you know who they are no matter how they change things
                </p>
                <p>
                 those with multiple names says a lot to me
                </p>
                <p>
                 those with nothing but negatives, tell ya why they are here
                </p>
                <p>
                 been watching people since I a kid
                </p>
                <p>

                  Hmmm... I don't know of any way to get a hold of groups without posting, except maybe to find out through FB when and where they're meeting, then show up and just happen to start talking to them. Another way to get through to people on a more subtle level would be to go to libraries and leave info in higher level books that you know will be checked out often. Maybe print up the artwork in Tony's Podesta's house and leave it in the more popular art history books reminding people that the art people like reflects who they are inside. Print up Comet Ping Pong Instagram photos and leave the info in Italian and pizza cookbooks. Because of how libraries are laid out with all the shelves, it's easy to avoid cameras and take in book bags full of the info you're going to bomb the books with without looking suspicious.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I like the way your mind works, but to pull this off, I need to do it str8 up

                    There's a bunch of info about children being smuggled for organ harvesting, but if you leave out big names, people won't get it. If you don't want to mention names, the only way to make things 'click' is to combine the organ harvesting with info about how young blood transfusions reverse the aging process.

                      Of course, and it is a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation, but everybody has different triggers and seeing as this is a blanket operation, you really won't know which info worked because you really can't ever do a survey. Just try to get as close to the target as possible and hope for the best.

           </p>
           <p>
            According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, roughly 800,000 children are reported missing each year in the United States -- that's roughly 2,000 per day.

             note: about 1/3 are double reports of run-aways and they eventually come back home...but the other 2/3 don't and never bubble up again on things like taxes, insurance billing, E-verify to get jobs, schools...etc...   I want to know where close to 1/2 a million bodies are going each year....

              Don't limit yourself.  Organ donation may not be the answer.  That's a lot of organ donar operations.  So much so that I don't think the two numbers add up.  For instance:  there are only 17,000 people in the us waiting for a new liver.   That doesn't even come close to livers from 500,000 kids yearly.
             </p>
             <p>
              Source: How many people are on the waiting list for a liver transplant?
All liver transplant candidates in the United States must be listed with UNOS before a donor liver can be allocated. Currently there are nearly 17,000 people waiting for a liver transplant in the United States.

             All the organs are unfortunately, not just for transplant... These people perform incredibly insideous rituals with or under the direct supervision of inscrutable "beings". We are a food source and then some... S.R.A. and all the forms of trafficking are just the tip of the iceberg.

              This needs to be addressed, but how do you put it, where people would believe it?

              have to remember how they worked the Satan Scare in the 80's
             </p>
             <p>
              to me it's an important part, but I don't want to scare people off with something they don't know about or they cant understand
             </p>
             <p>
              there would have to be history told on that
             </p>
             <p>
              how can that be slipped in to grab attention, for people to ask questions?

                Think about the sci-fi in Hollywood re freezing organs.  That was decades ago.  Q is saying Bourne narrative Deep Dream is real.  I'm pretty sure there are organ harvesting "kits" out there.  Organ-specific.

              Who is to say these trafficked/stolen children aren't taken to a medical facility to have their organs removed? I have no doubt there is technology and methods of being able to transport organs, but they could just as easily transport a kid to where the organs are needed.
             </p>
             <p>
              They fly kids around on airplanes for sex trafficking as we learned through the Franklin Case so what would stop them from still doing that?

              I know that they are air lifted from one hospital to another and it's a race against the clock. One false move and the whole thing is ruined. Maybe that's only for heart transplants and kidneys are different. I certainly would not want a kidney taken out of someone that's  not in a sterile environment in a third world country. Think about it.

               Yes and no
Back in the day they didn’t even cross match tissue.  People weren’t guaranteed life just a new organ.  Taking out the organ can be sloppy / clean.  They just want the money

               Thank You

               The reason Organ Trafficking is so big money is because there's not enough donors
              </p>
              <p>
               supply and demand
              </p>
              <p>
               do you transplanted organs only last maybe 5-6 yrs at most?
              </p>
              <p>
               then they need another transplant
              </p>
              <p>
               and because there are not enough, only the rich can get at them
              </p>
              <p>
               sad but true
              </p>
              <p>
               on another note, does your name come from the dance style that was featured in John Newman's Love me Again?

                Yes very sad, especially how fear can drive a man to do horrible things, the darkening of ones heart. Only if they knew the flower of life, the world would be such a more joyful place.

                No... I only dance to the music of life or try to, but somewhere inside me does think that name is written in the stars.
