<p>COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum..</p>
<p>There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a \'uncontrolled forum.\'</p>
<p>Technique #1 - \'FORUM SLIDING\'</p>
<p>If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by \'forum sliding.\' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to \'age.\' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a \'forum slide.\' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a \'forum slide\' and \'flush\' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then \'replying\' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting \'slides\' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.</p>
<p>Technique #2 - \'CONSENSUS CRACKING\'</p>
<p>A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at www.abovetopsecret.com) is \'consensus cracking.\' To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger \'evidence\' or disinformation in your favour is slowly \'seeded in.\' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then \'abort\' the consensus cracking by initiating a \'forum slide.\'</p>
<p>Technique #3 - \'TOPIC DILUTION\'</p>
<p>Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a \'RESOURCE BURN.\' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a \'gossip mode.\' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to \'drive in the wedge.\' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.</p>
<p>Technique #4 - \'INFORMATION COLLECTION\'</p>
<p>Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a \'show you mine so me yours\' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your \'favourite weapon\' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite \'technique of operation.\' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.</p>
<p>Technique #5 - \'ANGER TROLLING\'</p>
<p>Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to \'stage\' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to \'lead\' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you \'do not care what the authorities think!!\' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution.</p>
<p>Technique #6 - \'GAINING FULL CONTROL\'</p>
<p>It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the \'ultimate victory\' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a \'honey pot\' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ.</p>

            I agree that operatives can use those techniques, but being aware of them doesn't prevent them from being effective. A slide is a slide and deletion is deletion.

            Another example of a tactic used is when shills use multiple accounts to control the narrative and perception and use Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) by calling something "silly" and a "crazy post" when in fact they are trying to get people looking away from the evidence that ALL those at CIA Stratfor are NAMBLA members...

            I know, there are a lot of people here investing a lot of time looking for real evidence and loose connections are going to have to come up before they can be verified or debunked. Its just the process. Making sure that wrong info or false accusations are not perpetuated is just as important in uncovering the truth. The wiki has a list of debunked leads... The problem with this investigation is that the actual evidence is likely to be CP which we cannot browse, or an actual statements of guilt which is not likely (unless illegally hacked) everything else is a building of circumstantial evidence.

             I just noticed that all the current posts are being down voated equally, so that kind of defeats the purpose, and doesn't work to bury anything. What an Idiot.

             Do some good research and post it, that will get you upvoats fastest. I recommend finding Freed0mFighters 5 posts from around Christmas that had about 40 real CF leads that needing digging. I'm not seeing a lot of follow up on that, and I have been watching the Kay Griggs videos (which I posted a link to) and will be back to digging soon....

              Hi thanks for the advice. I'm only about 3 voats off. I decided to get them organically but once I got to about 96 I got excited!!
             </p>
             <p>
              My personal research is tied up in connecting the European cases to the ones from the US.  I'm looking into the
              <a href="http://hampsteadcoverup.com/">
               http://hampsteadcoverup.com/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              It's actually the most shocking evidence connecting ritual child abuse and satanism. It's worth looking into but deeply disturbing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Keep fighting the good fight

            Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression
           </p>
           <p>
            Strong, credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down a government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense, other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques depends heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token opposition party.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Dummy up. If it’s not reported, if it’s not news, it didn’t happen.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Wax indignant. This is also known as the “How dare you?” gambit.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Characterize the charges as “rumors” or, better yet, “wild rumors.” If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through “rumors.” (If they tend to believe the “rumors” it must be because they are simply “paranoid” or “hysterical.”)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or plant false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Call the skeptics names like “conspiracy theorist,” “nutcase,” “ranter,” “kook,” “crackpot,” and, of course, “rumor monger.” Be sure, too, to use heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when characterizing their charges and defending the “more reasonable” government and its defenders. You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned. For insurance, set up your own “skeptics” to shoot down.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money (compared to over-compensated adherents to the government line who, presumably, are not).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Dismiss the charges as “old news.”
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Come half-clean. This is also known as “confession and avoidance” or “taking the limited hangout route.” This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal “mistakes.” This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken. With effective damage control, the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge skeptics to carefully limited markets.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster “suicide” note was forged, they would have reported it. They haven’t reported it so there is no such evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press who would report the leak.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely. E.g. If Foster was murdered, who did it and why?
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or publicizing distractions.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them. This is sometimes referred to as “bump and run” reporting.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Baldly and brazenly lie. A favorite way of doing this is to attribute the “facts” furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous, source.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, have your own stooges “expose” scandals and champion popular causes. Their job is to pre-empt real opponents and to play 99-yard football. A variation is to pay rich people for the job who will pretend to spend their own money.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Flood the Internet with agents. This is the answer to the question, “What could possibly motivate a person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news groups defending the government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics?” Don t the authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines, radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical letters and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio talk shows would be control enough, but, obviously, it is not.

            that was a crazy post, and anyone at reddit who believes it has more problems than pizzagate. Let's just assume that it will get any other people looking at Stratfor and thinking why does Stratfor even exisit??

             Open discussion  is the only way we can as a group discern truth. Please use your mod powers wisely and let the conversation happen. Serious contributors can handle the shills on their own, they dont need handholding. Yes we will get some stuff 100% wrong, but facts will build, truth will out, and only in that way can we ever achieve even a foothold on the playing field.

             I know, this post is guilty of that, isn't it. I have it at pizzagatewhatever too, but I think that its important for us to know how to discriminate the information and the comments, I don't expect this post to sit here long, but if if helps a few people in a short time, thats ok too

               its okay, I don't respect myself either. Mods chose to let this stay, don't know why, probably because nobody reads /whatever/ and the shills have been on overtime

                Yeah, that makes sense. I think that the mods have given up on encouraging the use of those forums. I noticed that a lot of posts have been supported by the mods, even though they don't contribute evidence to specifics about the investigation. It's no wonder that some members are accusing the mods of being shills.

                I think that the truth is that 99.999% of the people here are useful idiots, because of their stubbornness and lack of experience in the important things.

                By the way, you've earned a bit more respect from me by being honest about yourself.

               With pizzagate it's partially no. 3 and partially that there is a fuck ton of circumstantial evidence. It's hard to discern sometimes.
              </p>
              <p>
               This body of evidence should be in front of a judge or a legal team. It's unfortunate that the public even have to investigate this

                It absolutely is insane that our government is so corrupt. We need a grand jury and a massive class action lawsuit for RICO and Treason. but I'm not a lawyer.

            This is part of the reason we need a constantly updated "top 25 most vital findings" thread or something like that to keep those things in the light and also to make a solid case.
