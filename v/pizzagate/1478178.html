<p>There seems to be an organization central to all the finds that we have been uncovering over the past few weeks. One which links Laura Silsby, James Alefantis, David Brock, other individuals that I loosely refer to as the “DC Group” as well as others.</p>
<p>I. The NCMEC
What is the NCMEC?
This organization is the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). See their web page here:
The NCMEC website says “In January 1984 NCMEC was incorporated by private individuals as a non profit corporation to serve as a national resource center and clearinghouse on issues related to missing and sexually exploited children.”
The term “private corporation” is key here. They do not have government oversight. This means they act as gate-keeper for the government to deal with child porn material without any oversight over what they’re doing, and law enforcement cannot get involved without them giving a go ahead.
NCMEC haven’t exactly been responsible in this oversight free role they are given either. They are in the middle of a law suit over their handling of child pornography constituting a violation of the Fourth Amendment:
The details of the suit are as follows: AOL maintains a database of hash values assigned to images classified as child abuse so that they are more easily identified/tracked. AOL was simply sending NCMEC the images without bothering to open them and verify the contents. So NCMEC was violating the right to protection from undue searches and seizures by opening what AOL sent. Notice how in this instance, only NCMEC was aware of what the photo actually was (and think about how that could be used to keep a lid on information).
The NCMEC is significant mainly because of the oddly large number of connections it has. They appear to have some strong ties to Hollywood: Brian Cranston has been involved with them in the past and helped to make educational resources for them:</p>
<p>II. NCMEC Connections to Silsby and the “DC Group”
Especially interesting is that the NCMEC has connections to both stories I have previously run concerning child sex trafficking.
A. Laura Silsby
Since being arrested in Haiti for trying to steal 33 children and getting let off the hook with the help of the Clinton’s, Silsby has moved on to inappropriately continue to work in the anti-human trafficking sector. Silsby moved to Idaho and adoped the last name Gayler.
Silsby has moved on to work for a company called AlertSense which works with a number of US states on their alert systems, which include Amber Alerts.
Here is a local info webpage showing her working for AlertSense, as well as AlertSense’s main webpage showing that Silsby works on their Executive Team. Why would they let a woman convicted of trafficking children anywhere near systems that dealt with Amber Alerts?
And here is a less academic source covering Silsby’s move from a Haitian prison to AlertSense:
So how does this relate to the NCMEC? They are in charge of the Amber Alert program:</p>
<p>III. NCMEC Connection to Alefantis/Brock
A. James Alefantis/David Brock/the “DC Group” Connections to Jeff Koons
Remember how James Alefantis posted an “art” piece by Jeff Koons showing him having sex with what is purportedly his pornstar wife?
It turns out that Jeff Koons is more to Alefantis than an artist he admires. To begin with, Koons is very involved with the DC/East Coast art scene.
Here on page 10 both Alefantis and Koons are mentioned as being involved in the DC art scene for example:
But none of these circumstantial bits of evidence are as important as the discovery that Correct the Record paid Jeff Koons $50,000 according to their SEC filing, seen here on page 9:
Correct the Record is run by David Brock, who is in a relationship with James Alefantis. Here is a link confirming this and showing them caught up with another individual in some kind of blackmail love triangle
Here is a photo of Brock on Alefantis\' Instagram:
B. Jeff Koons Work Connections to the NCMEC How is the connection to Koons Important? Koons is a board member of the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC). You can find an admission of that fact on his own web page:
The ICMEC was founded in 1998 by none other than the NCMEC:</p>
<p>IV. NCMEC Connections to Thorn and Hollywood
A. What is Thorn?
The NCMEC investigation arose while I was looking in to an organization called Thorn. Thorn: Digital Defenders of Children (previously known as DNA) was founded by Hollywood personalities Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore. Wikipedia mentions that several other Hollywood stars support Thorn, and Brian Cranston (who also has worked with the NCMEC) has sponsored an event for them recently:
One of the main services Thorn provides is creation of product (termed “SpotLight” and “Solis” for use on the clear and dark net respectively) that help with API, software which sifts through the material. It does this sifting by scanning the hash symbols which were previously mentioned in this post (relevant to the case which landed the NCMEC in hot water for violating the Fourth Amendment). Thorn was involved with the creation of this hash symbol identification system.
Despite Thorns claim’s about the effectiveness of their software, they have only identified 6,325 victims and 2,186 traffickers. These numbers are quite a paltry drop in the pond when you consider the fact that over 800,000 children are reported missing each year
B. Thorn\'s Connection to the NCMEC
Thorn doesn’t just sell products to “help” combat child trafficking though, they also facilitate a meeting of various companies’ tech advisors in what is known as the Thorn Tech Task Force. Members of the Task Force include Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Dropbox, Yahoo, Instagram, Tumblr, Imgur and Pinterest (many of whom were caught favoring the Clintons in the recent election). Officially, Thorn merely provides this guideline for the Task Force and doesn’t take an official role.
Once the various representatives in the task force go back to work, they collaborate closely with the NCMEC. And they are working with the very hash system that got the NCMEC in hot water for Fourth Amendment violations.
Again, when their hash sharing system catches an image, it is shared only between the companies and the NCMEC. And the recent lawsuit the NCMEC is embroiled in indicates that the companies don’t even look at flagged images themselves. Think about how this could absolve them of liability while also ensuring that no one other than the NCMEC was able to view or access the flagged images.
The NCMEC, ICMEC and Thorn all need to be placed under more intense scrutiny and investigation given Thorn’s work with the NCMEC and the NCMEC’s association with AlertSense (where Silsby works) and Koons, who has associations with David Brock and his partner James Alefantis.</p>',

            It's a similar story with the charity Voices for American Children (HRC was the first president of the board for the one in Arkansas,
            <a href="https://www.4americaschildren.org/">
             here's a link to the national website

             Look at their logo
            </a>
            , personally it's the most suspicious one I've seen yet (makes me think of pizza and occult rituals).  Similarly strange is it's very very poorly optimized for search engines, it comes up 3rd if you search "Voices for America's Children" exactly, it's almost as if the owner of the site is trying to hide it...

             As of December 31, 2013, NCIC contained 84,136 active missing person records.  Juveniles under the age of 18 account for 33,849 (40.2 %) of the records and 9,706 (11.5 %) were for juveniles between the ages of 18 and 20. *
            </p>
            <p>
             During 2013, 627,911 missing person records were entered into NCIC, a decrease of 5.1% from the 661,593 records entered in 2012.  Missing Person records cleared or canceled during the same period totaled 630,990.  Reasons for these removals include:  a law enforcement agency located the subject, the individual returned home, or the record had to be removed by the entering agency due to a determination that the record is invalid.

            I would like to point out that because of the low number of convictions in these pedo cases, 'they' are likely 'co-opting' networks. Remember: any network of pedos they find can be completely controlled.   They can pick and choose people to prosecute as their value matters to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            And for obedience, what would they reward them with?

            Seriously, out of all the pizzagate stuff, this is my go to mind fuck arguement. How does a sane rational person answer this question? Why is a lady who was caught(no, convicted, right?) taking 30+ kids from Haiti, get a job with ANYTHING TO DO WITH children?

             I am so tired of the "art" excuse being used to promote perversion. Perverts should not be allowed around children, that's like alcoholics in a bar. This is common sense.

                I wish that I could answer that for you.
               </p>
               <p>
                I just assume that billionaires don't feel the crunch, when they donate a million, so I don't understand why they donate chump change like that. I just assume that they donate for a simple bribe.
               </p>
               <p>
                On the surface, according to the narrative, they are donating to a wonderful foundation that does a huge amount of charitable work. For example, when it comes to helping Katrina victims, the Gulf Of Mexico Victims, or Haiti victims, then you can be sure that a million bucks can make a difference to the victims, but not to the billionaires.
               </p>
               <p>
                However, I'm sure that the motives are much more sinister. I'm no expert, but I think that the key is to look at the dates, and then see if there is a correlation to an event. Since they have often donated in the past, we can guess that all donations will have correlating events. These events should form a pattern.
               </p>
               <p>
                Does anybody have a list of donations coming out of Saudi Arabia to the Clinton Foundation...or any foundation, for that matter?

             Then their computers should have obvious signs of them marketing their product. To do this they would probably go through a middle man. Whats the best livestock to sell that gets the best price?

             <p>
              By broadcasting frequent public alerts, descriptions and other vital information in the crucial first hours after a child abduction, the Arizona AMBER Alert can enlist large numbers of citizens in an effort to recover the child as soon as possible.
              <strong>
               AMBER Alert notifications are supported by the AlertSense AMBER Alert Web Based System and the Emergency Alert System (EAS).

             Hey, guys! I think that somebody needs to make an infographic showing the connections and a rough timeline. This is too tough to digest for mere mortals like me.

            <p>
             If somebody does that, then would you be willing to confirm the accuracy of the infographic with respect to your findings, OP?

             Whelp... boys and girls, this is what i like to call a doozie. I mean, the connections and framework are in place.  IF the Clinton's wanted to traffick kids they had access to plenty of areas where they could take kids, disaster areas, war zones, schools, orphanages  and they had there people in place everywhere there needed to be to make it look like they were doing every thing they could to help kids while simultaneously syphoning them into a massive, undetectable system of government sactioned sex trafficking.  I mean, we can't prove the crimes occurred, but opportunity? I mean...
