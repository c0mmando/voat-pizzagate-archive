<p>Brazilian Slavery</p>
<p>&quot;Brazil had the largest slave population in the world, substantially larger than the United States. The Portuguese who settled Brazil needed labor to work the large estates and mines in their new Brazilian colony. They turned to slavery which became central to the colonial economy. It was particularly important in the mining and sugar cane sectors. Slavery was also the mainstay in the Caribbean islands with economies centered on sugar. Estimates suggest that about 35 percent of captured Africans involved in the Atlantic slave trade were transported to Brazil. Estimates suggest that more than 3 million Africans reached Brazil, although precise numbers do not exist. Brazil had begun to turn to slavery in the 15th century as explorers began moving along the coast of Africa. With the discovery of the Americas, the Portuguese attempted to enslave the Native American population as well. This did not prove successful. The Native Americans died in large numbers, both because of slave rading, mistreatment, and the lack of resistance to European diseases. The Portuguese found captured Africans to be a valuable trading commodity as Europeans began to settle the Caribbean islands. They also began transporting Africans to their Brazilian colony.&quot;</p>
<p>Founding of Brazil</p>
<p>&quot;The Portuguese when they founded their Brazilisn colony, like the Spanish, attempted to enslave Native Americans. Unlike the Craribbean islands, the Native Americans in Brazil could flee to the interior where the Portuguese could not reach them, although slaving raids were conducted up the Amazon. Native Americans who did not flee were decimated by the European diseases the Portuguese carried.

<p>The Portuguese and the African Slave Trade</p>
<p>&quot;The Portuguese begun to turn to African slavery in the 15th century as explorers began moving south along the coast of Africa, looking for a route ast to th Indies and China. In the process they essentilly invented the Atlantic slave trade as part of the voyages of discovery. It was not the beginning of the Africa slave trade. This was ib=nventedvby the Arabs in the Indian Ocean (8th century). Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal sent a trading expedition to Africa, to explore the little known continent (1441). The Portuguese found captured Africans to be a valuable trading commodity as Europeans began to settle the Caribbean islands. They also began transporting Africans to their Brazilian colony. They were less suseptable for genetic reasons to both tropical and European diseases. Africans from various regions were transported to Brazil from various regions in increasingly large numbers as the colony developed. Large numbers came from the developing Portuguese colonies in Africa, but were not limited to those regions. Ther were slaves from both the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coast. Atkantic-coast slaves came from Cape Vert (a transhipment point) and southern Africa such as Angola. Slaves also campe from the Indian Ocean coast, especially Mozambique. Of course many slaves came from the interior and and were only shipped from the two coasts. A cargo of 235 captive Africans was brought to Lagos in Portugal. The Portuguese began using enslaved Africans on sugar plantations in Madeira, a Portuguese island off the west coast of Africa (1460). It was the Portuguese who built the first slave fort, meaning a fotified positions where cptive Africans could be held for transport-- Elmina Castle (1481). It was located along the coast of what is now Ghana. That area became known as not only the Gold Coast, but also the slave coast. Elmina Castle became the headquarters of the Portuguese slave traders. As large numbers of captive Africans began to be transported, Portugal was the major purveor. Portugal held the asiento (contract) to supply the Spanish colonies with slaves. This meant that as well as supplying Brazilian plantations, the Portuguese were supplying Spanish plantations in the Caribbean. This was before the Sugar Boom and massive numbers of slaves were transported. Other countries began entering the lucrative eterprise. Evebtually the Portuguese would transport some 4.7 million captive Africans for slavery in the New World. &quot;</p>

           <p>
            Slavery had a huge impact on religious beliefs in Brazil:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In  the  2010  census,  64.6  percent  of  Brazilians claimed  to  belong  to  the  Roman  Catholic  Church,  but with a declining tendency over the last three decades. A growing number of Brazilians belong to one of  the  numerous  Evangelical  Churches  (22.2  percent in 2010 with a rising tendency). In sum, nearly 90 percent of Brazilians claim to belong to a Christian  Church.  The  remaining  10  percent  are  spread  between Spiritists (2 percent), adherents to an Afro-Brazilian religion (0.3 percent), agnostics or atheists (8 percent), and members of another religion, such 
as Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, or Buddhism. These numbers, however, do not represent all practitioners of  Spiritist  or  Afro-Brazilian  religions  since  many  people avoid being identified with an Afro-Brazilian tradition, despite the fact that the religions have been legalised.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So we usually think of it as a Catholic country, yet:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Chesnut estimates that half of all Brazilians have visited an Umbanda centre at least once, usually during a personal crisis and that 15–20 percent of Brazilians (app. 30 million) practise Umbanda  or  one  of  the  other  Afro-Brazilian  religions regularly ... Especially Umbanda has  the  image  of  being  a  provider  of  physical  and
             <br/>
             spiritual healing services, which leads to the estimation that many more Brazilians attend regularly Umbanda rituals without considering themselves to be members of the religion.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Besides Umbanda and Candomblé, there's also Spiritism:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             On the other side of the continuum is Spiritism, also called Kardecism. It is based on the ideas of the French schoolteacher Hyppolyte Léon Denizard Rivail (1804–1869), who published numerous books under his alias Allan Kardec, containing what he described as messages from the spirits. Shortly after their publication, his books arrived in Brazil where his teaching gained much attention. It offered those living at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th  century  an  alternative  spirituality  that  lacked  the negative connotations of the Afro-Brazilian religions. While the practice of Afro-Brazilian religions was  regarded  as  black  magic,  and  was  legally  rstricted until the 1970s (Maggie 1986), Kardecism and its numerous variations under the label espiritismo were socially and legally tolerated.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is the background to Joao de Deus. Brazilians open to spiritual possession akin to Haitian voodoo, some of those spirit entities actually tricksters, or evil we might say.

              According to Jewish authorities:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Jews first arrived in Brazil in the mid-15th century; today, the Jewish population is approximately 120,000 - the tenth largest Jewish community in the world. Although they make up around half of one percent of Brazil's population, the Jewish community is very active in several aspects of Brazilian society. According Professor Anita Novinsky, a specialist on the Jews at the University of Sao Paulo, "Brazil was made by the Jews.""

             <p>
              I have an acquaintance who is descended from these Sephardi Brazilian plantation owners. Her parents immigrated to the U.S. to escape a worsening political/economic situation in Brazil. They keep up with jewish relatives and friends. They were of the "Sephardi-priveledged" class and continue to do quite well for themselves in the U.S. This group is no different than the former "white" slave owners in the U.S. The culture is similar. Perhaps that is why they sometimes intermarried.....

This is quite interesting. I also just recently began a genealogical search of my family, and could not help but see the possibility that many of my fellow Puerto Ricans may in fact have some Jewish ancestry from Crypto Jews who came to settle inland, generally in the mountainous areas in order to worship freely. It was these who generally were come to be known as "Jibaros". Also, from what I can remember, is that as a child growing up in Puerto Rico, to have celebrated a feast akin to the feast of tabernacles, where we stayed in tents by the beach in order to enjoy the company of one anotherand enjoy the beauty of our land.."

              Yes, according to this source the percentage of those who claim Judaism as their religion is negligible. Could identify as just secular Jewish, perhaps many are in the 8% agnostic atheist. Conversos could have continued as Conversos.
             </p>
             <p>
              That philo-semitic source has:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               When the Inquisition in Portugal took hold in 1497, Jews fled to places throughout the world, including Brazil. They arrived in Brazil primarily as New Christians or Conversos (Jews converted to Christianity), but many secretly practiced Judaism and began a colonization drive to settle on the land. Despite continued persecution by the Brazilian Inquisition, the New Christians successfully established sugar plantations and mills
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              My understanding is that back then Jews in Spain and Portugal were told they must become Christians or leave. Kind of harsh in modern terms perhaps but those were the times of absolute monarchic rule and no church-state separation. The Conversos nominally converted but 'many secretly practiced Judaism' as it here admits. The Inquisitions were designed to root out fake Christians. I find "New Christians" a misnomer. Also they imported slaves for their sugar plantations.

            I think you need to look for the link between 'John' and the CIA. Then there's the Portuguese connection with António Guterres of the United Nations.  Inner City Press has been shouting from the rooftops about him for ages now.  Then there's the Portuguese bank Banco Espírito Santo and their whole corruption history and links the City of London, the Vatican and with the Hampstead case.  Don't forget  the Algarve and the McCanns.  And where is it that Madonna is living lately with her adopted children?  Just sayin...

            Good thread. I think it is important to understand how these families that still trade in the profane art of trafficking in illicit substances, people and guns were able to get so rich and stay so rich. Having a general understanding of the geopolitical climate of the other nations involved in the coming New World Order turnover demands such knowledge  especially considering a potential dick-tater just took over in Brazil, sooner or later I have a feeling this is going to reflect on Bolosonaro in some way, someones going to start digging into his connections or if none use it heavily against the opposition.

             "Brazil’s new environment minister, Ricardo Salles, has suspended all partnerships and agreements with non-governmental organizations for 90 days, in a move that was described as “a war against NGOs”.
            </p>
            <p>
             Announcing the move, Salles said the three-month suspension was to allow a re-evaluation of such partnerships, but civil society organizations described the move as a blatant and illegal attack on the environment and those working to protect it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Salles, appointed by the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and hand-picked by the agro-business caucus, has previously described global warming as a “secondary issue” and dismissed fines for environmental crimes as “ideological”."

               Tibet and 21st Century Water Wars
How will the Tibetan Plateau determine the course of Asia’s future?
              </p>
              <p>
               "In the latter context, the Tibetan Plateau stands out. Strategically located between the two Asian giants, China and India, the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings have come to represent Asia’s most critical 21st century battleground.
              </p>
              <p>
               Potentially, they may also be the world’s battleground.
              </p>
              <p>
               The narrative of this century and of Asia will be written, to a very large extent, in terms of what is the “hottest geopolitical issue” — water security.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Tibetan Plateau extends from the Hindu Kush in central Afghanistan, through Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan and onto the borders of Myanmar.
              </p>
              <p>
               The geopolitical significance of Tibet has been tremendous historically, too. It was invaded by Britain in 1904 for that reason.
              </p>
              <p>
               Forty-five years later China’s Liberation occurred and, almost immediately afterwards, the People’s Liberation Army annexed Tibet in 1950-51.
              </p>
              <p>
               For Mao Zedong, the strategic importance of Tibet was clear. It was fundamental to national security. The Tibetan Plateau acts as a major buffer zone and provides China with leverage over almost the entire Eurasian continent.
              </p>
              <p>
               From a national security point of view, the vast barriers of the Tibetan Plateau shield China’s internal populace in the east from military aggression originating from the west."

Economic Sectors
           </p>
           <p>
            "Slavery in Brazil is strongly associated withb plantation agriculture, especially the sugar industry. Slavery became particularly important in the mining and sugar cane sectors. use the working conditions in both sectors were not conusive for free labor. The sugar industry was the most important at it was here that most of Brazil's slaves were employed. Slavery was also the mainstay in the Caribbean islands with economies centered on sugar. The Portuguese who settled Brazil needed labor if they were to develop large estates and mines in their new Brazilian colony. They turned to sugar and slavery which became central to the colonial economy. Slaves were set to the back-breaking task of digging large trenches using hoes. They then planted the cane in the trenches and used bare hands to spread manure for fertilizer. Cutting the matured can was another major effort requiring manual labor. Brazil became the world's largest producer of sugar. The sugar industry began on the Caribbean islands. The Dutch helped bring it to Brazil. Eventually the huge Brazilian estates increased production to the point that it brought down sugar prives, affected the profitability of production on the Caribbean sugar islands. Some Brazilian planters began to turmn tp coffee (1830s). This was at the time of the Great Bahia Slave Revolt (1835). It was at the very last phase of slavery in Brazil as pressure from abroad was beginning to move Brazil toward emancipation. Rubber plantations appeared in the late-19th century. By this time, Brazil had ended slavery. Native Americans, however, experienced slave-like conditions a msany of these plantations. "

            Emancipation
           </p>
           <p>
            "Brazil continued as a monarchy for several decades before a republic was finally proclaimed (1889). Brazil was a major desination of the Atlantic slave trade. Brazil justs out into the Atlantic and was thus a much shorter run for the slavers. Brazil had the largest slave population in the world, substantially larger than the United States. Pedro II was a ruler of conservative mindset. He came to see slavery, despite its economic importance to Brazil as inherently evil. Pedro began a series of measures liberating Brazilian slaves. He was posed to entirely abolish slavery. His measures against slavery met oposition from major landowners and the military, the leadership of which was drawn from the landed elite. The Emperor was on a trip to Europe when his daughter, Princess Isabel serving as regent, issued a decree abolishing slavery (May 13, 1888). This essentially did away for the last bastion of slavery, although forced labor cotinued for some time, in the Western Hemishere and ended what remained of the the African slave trade. Princess Isabella's decree is known as the Golden Law. It was widely praised in Europe. Abolishing slavery was the last major action taken by the Brazilian royal family. Brazil proved to be the last Western Hemisphere country to abolish slavery."

            Impact
           </p>
           <p>
            "Slavery has a huge impact on Brazil. It affected both the economy and the ethnic make up of the Brazilian population. The importation of such a large number of Africans into a colony with such a small number of Portuguese, profoundly affected the ethnic ballance. The level of Africam imports also meant thsat unlike North America, Africam culture was not largely wiped out and thus had a significant impsct on Brazilian culture (food, music, dance and religious practices). This is especiuallt the case in Rio and the northwast where many of the slaves were concentrated."

The Sugar Boom (17th century)
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Portuguese brought sugar cane to Brazil early in the colonial period, but the sugar industry developed slowly. It was a relatively new crop to the Europeans and it was a labor-intensive crop. This proved a problem because the Native Americans the Portuguese attempted to enslave did not prove suitable. Sugar would prove central to Brazilian economy aswell as to the history of Brazilian slavery. It was sugar that made Brzilian plantations really profitable and this fueled the demand for the large numbers of slaves needed to work them. The settlers first tried to enslave the Natives to work the developing plantations. The Native Americans proved unsuitable, primarily because the died in large numbers when exposed to European diseases. As a result, the settlers began to turn to Africans. The Portuguese ha begun to trade in captive Africanas, albeit in small numbers, as they began moving south down the coast of Africa (15th century). The first Brazilian sugar plantation was operating very early in the colonial era (1518). The industry grew very rapidly. Martim Afonso de SousaThe founded the first colony(1532). One report suggests that Santa Catalina Island had some 800 operating sugar cane mills (1540). The Brazilian sugar industry boomed and the colony became Europe's main supplier of sugar. Sugar at the time did not come from the Caribbean in any quantity. Until this the Arabs had been the main supplier, but a astronomical prices making it a luxury for the nobility and wealthier merchants. Brazil changed this. With the large quanities of Brazilian sugar reaching Europe at more reasonable prices, a much larger market began to grow. And Brazil, especially the northern coast, privided virtually perfect conditions for raising sugarcane........The Portuguese became leaders in the Atlantic slave trade and the major destination was Brazil. Over a third of all the slaves tranported to the Americas were landed in Brazil, the great majority to work on the sugar plantations. "

            Dutch Era (1630-54)
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Dutch incursions into Brazil proved the greatest threat to the Portuguese. The Portuguese became involved with the Hapsburg attmpt to supress the Reformation in Germany and the related rebellion of the Dutch. A succession crisis in Portugal led to a personal union under the Habsburg rule after the War of the Portuguese Succession, Spanish King Philip II of Spain thus controlled Portugal as part of the Iberian Union (1580). This meant that Portugal and Brazil became involved in the Dutch War of Independence (1581-1648). Philip II prohibited trade with the Dutch (1581). The Dutch were at a disadvantage in land warfare with the Spanish, but their expanding naval fleet gave them the ability to strike at the colonies. The result was the Dutch–Portuguese War (1602-61). The War was waged by the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company against the Portuguese Empire.... The Dutch also attacked the Portuguese African possessions. This was an attmpt to seize control of the profitable slave trade which at the time was dominated by the Portuguese. Elmina and other Portuguese Gold Coast trade posts were taken and Luanda was put to siege. As a result, the flow of West African slaves was interupted and from this point most Brazilian slaves were imorted from southern Africa....The Dutch controlled northern Brazil for more than two decades. One impact of their presence was a boost to the sugar industry, a hugely valuable commodity at the time. The economics of sugar meant that it became the leading crop in Brazil. Dutch investors commited considerable funds. This was coordinated through the Dutch West India Company.......The greatest victor may have been the English who benefitted by the decades long war between its two main rivals in the Far East. The Dutch were ultimately forced to relinquish control of northern Brazil (1654). The principal result of the Dutch experience in Brazil was that when they were finally expelled, they brought sugar industry technology to the Caribbean. And this meant that the Portuguese in Brazil no longer dominated the sugar trade. "  NOTE: Sephardic Jews who were expelled from Portugal and Spain during the Inquisition fled to Holland (Dutch) America and the Caribbean, including Jamaica. The resulting hatred of Spain and Portugal led the refugees to ally with the Dutch and English against them. The Sephardi in Holland eventually were the major investors in the Dutch West India company. Large numbers migrated to the American Dutch colony of New Holland (New York).
Many also took their sugar cane plantation technology to the English controlled island of Barbados and set up sugar plantations and labor supply with the DRAX brothers.

            Colonial Brazil (17th and 18th centururies)
           </p>
           <p>
            "Colonial Brazil developed the largest slave population in the world, substantially larger than that of the United States. The Portuguese who settled Brazil needed labor to work the large estates and mines in their new Brazilian colony. They turned to slavery which became central to the colonial economy. It was particularly important in the mining and sugar cane sectors. Slavery was also the mainstay in the Caribbean islands with economies centered on sugar. Estimates suggest that about 35 percent of captured Africans involved in the Atlantic slave trade were transported to Brazil. Estimates suggest that more than 3 million Africans reached Brazil, although precise numbers do not exist. Slavery was widely practiced. Brazilians of all classes owned slaves. Slaves were not only owned by upper and middle-class Brazilians, but also by lower-class Brazilians. There were even slaves who owned other slaves. And even though Brazil had the largest slave poplation in the world, the numbers of people impacted are much larger than commonly portrayed. Brazilian sugar plantations were essentially death camps. If the demographic impact of the massive death toll at the sugar plantations are computed the numbers would be staggering. "
           </p>
           <p>
            "One historian estimsates about 3.6 million Africans transported to Brazil. [Taunay]. He estimated that most were brough to brazil in he 18th ad 19th century: 0.1 million (16th century), 0.6 million (17th cenury), 1.3 million (18th century), and 1.6 million (19th century). The level of slave shipments during the 19th century is notable given the fact that the Royal Navy was engaged in a major campaign to end the slave trade at the time. About 40 percent of the estimated 11 million Africans transported in the Atlantic slave trade went to Brazil."

             A descendant of the sugar baron Drax family is now growing OPIUM POPPIES on his Dorset England estate (built from Barbados sugar money) :

            <p>
             'No this isn't Afghanistan: Stunning field of opium poppies that is actually in DORSET
            </p>
            <p>
             The striking display of colour was on show at an estate owned by a Conservative MP Richard Drax who has given up his land to grow the flowers for the NHS.  And the hot dry spring, alongside the weekend downpour has resulted in the bumper blooming of the crop, which will now be turned into morphine....Mr Drax’s estate is one of more than 30 sites across the country where the opium poppies, which are more commonly associated with Aghanistan, are now being grown."
            </p>
            <p>
             "A pharmaceutical company will then harvest the poppy heads in order to produce the pain-killing drugs."
