It got worse as more came forward, others from Kuper Island as well as other schools, with more stories of the dentist chair. I leave it to this good audience to connect the dots between our Elite in Washington and Palm Beach with convicted pedophile and child trafficker Jeffery Epstein, and the stories and testimonies I bore witness to about the dentist chair in the basement of Kuper Island.

             This was so sad, but I knew I had to finish it. I have always felt broken about what happened in this country and what we did to the Native Americans.  You must read the last reply in the comments, for it shows that some will never understand.  Michael says that it was not a genocide but he explains it as a type of culturing of a tribe that may have been behind. He is a brainwashed idiot.  One of those people that cannot admit what horrible things our and his ancestors did to these and others.  Things will not change if this type of thinking doesn't die. We must also not allow our history books to be rewritten.  They want our children to not understand and know what happened here way before they were born.  The past will again be repeated if we do not face it.
