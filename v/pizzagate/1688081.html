I have listened to it almost daily, for whatever reason, I have simply not put the album down, it was compelling to me and I could never take it out of my cd player in my car It is the only album I have listened to since I started my study. I never thought much about it until today. Today, the pieces fell together for me and I feel that they were sending a message with this album. I believe that the album as a whole is message about child abuse. I am going to only analyze &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; here, but I feel that if you read through the lyrics with &quot;pizzagate mind&quot; you will find that the entire album is riddled with remarks all phrasing back to destruction of innocence and ritual/sadistic abuse. By some stroke of luck I have found a tweet that ties this song directly to pizzagate possibly exposing the outter edges of what could be an interesting research project for my fellow investigators. </p>
<p>Monkey Wrench [1997]</p>
<p>The intro lyric &quot;What have we done with innocence? It disappeared with time, it never made much sense ,Adolescent resident, Wasting another night on planning my revenge&quot; followed by &quot;one in ten&quot; lyric repeated again and again. I was reviewing lyric analysis of this song and no one can seem to figure out why he sings this line. I have never heard the phrase &quot;One in Ten&quot; as an iconic phrase, so I googled it, and what did I find?</p>
<p><a href="http://onenten.org">http://onenten.org</a> decide for yourself </p>
<p>From their about: &quot;one•n•ten envisions a world where all LGBTQ youth and young adults are embraced for who they are, actively engaged in their communities, and empowered to lead.&quot;</p>
<p>The focus on the youth here is what concerns me and in correlation to the &quot;Adolescent resident&quot; line, I feel that this is substantial in creating a lead.</p>
<p>From wikipedia: &quot;One In Ten was co-founded by Barry Becker, Mark Betchkal, Matthew Cibellis and Keith Clark, gay residents of Washington, D.C.[4] The four began meeting in 1990, and founded One In Ten as the parent organization for Reel Affirmations.[5] The four sought the advice and input of Frameline, then the largest LGBT gay film festival in the U.S.[4] With financial and administrative assistance from Frameline, the first Reel Affirmations film festival opened on October 11, 1991.&quot; Founded in 91, six years before the song was written.</p>
<p>Their old site is now gone &quot;oneinten.org&quot; and replaced by the one above. </p>
<p>The rest of the song reads like the story of a child who is deeply abused </p>
<p>Don\'t want to be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I\'d rather leave than suffer this
I\'ll never be your monkey wrench</p>
<p>One last thing before I quit
I never wanted any more than I could fit
Into my head
I still remember every single word you said
And all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still there\'s one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I\'m free</p>
<p>Reminds me of the abuse from the &quot;skippy&quot; videos [whether they are real or fake], imagine the torment of being in that kind of situation. </p>
<p>I began to dig into the names of the founders of &quot;one in ten&quot; and found a twitter feed for Matthew Cibellis, below you will find a tweet of his that I believe completely ties this song to pizzagate:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgjar.co/jar/oHKdGHyXBEGbjsqRf332RQ.PNG">https://i.imgjar.co/jar/oHKdGHyXBEGbjsqRf332RQ.PNG</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I believe that this is a potential lead and I ask for help in digging further on these four men: One In Ten founders: Barry Becker, Mark Betchkal, Matthew Cibellis and Keith Clark and further connections to pizzagate</li>
</ul>
<p>My research so far:
Where\'s Barry? Well, it looks like he may be found in Pheonix, AZ, home of one-n-ten youth center according to their website [Our Youth Center is open Monday-Friday from 4:00 p.m.-8:00 p.m., and is located at: 3660 N. 3rd St. | Phoenix, AZ 85012. one•n•ten staff are available Monday-Friday for resource hours by appointment 2:00 p.m.-4:00 p.m. ], and if this is him, he is a lawyer <a href="http://pview.findlaw.com/view/2243615_1">http://pview.findlaw.com/view/2243615_1</a> I cannot confirm whether or not this is him, but I would say based on location correlation, I feel fairly confident that it is.</p>
<p>More evidence to support Foo Fighters involvement in pizzagate [taylor hawkins, who joined Foo Fighters in 1997, when monkey wrench was written, however, there are no claims as to his involvement with the song. He states strongly that human trafficking is happening in the US]:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gqYMalntLY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gqYMalntLY</a></p>
<p>TL;DR I think that Foo Fighters was sending a message a long time ago about human/child trafficking in correlation to an LGBT Youth Organization and one of the founding members of that organization is found referencing pizzagate here: <a href="https://i.imgjar.co/jar/oHKdGHyXBEGbjsqRf332RQ.PNG">https://i.imgjar.co/jar/oHKdGHyXBEGbjsqRf332RQ.PNG</a> and that Taylor Hawkins who joined Foo Fighters just as the song was made is found speaking out against human trafficking here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gqYMalntLY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gqYMalntLY</a></p>
<p>Personally, I don\'t know what to make of this information, I don\'t know if it is controlled opp/globalist signalling or an early resistance. The coincidences were just too much to ignore.</p>',

            Over analysing will just mess up your head. No matter how well intentioned. Grohl was in a hardcore band 'Scream' which was signed to Ian McKaye's label Dischord records in the '80s. Dischord also had signed Sex Stains (she being in previous Riot Grrl Dischord signed bands). Reason being they're all part of an old hardcore punk community and Dischord will only put out music from DC. Lots of crap weird art-punk bands on Dischord. The only link to DC and Grohl is the band Scream and he wasn't in there very long either. Maybe a year. I know lots of Dischord musicians were friends of Jimmy Comet on Instagram such as Brian Baker from the band(s) Minor Threat, Dag Nasty and Bad Religion. Doesn't mean he's a paedophile, they just very insular in DC's punk scene.

            As yourself, i recently found kyself stuck on the "one in ten" lyric...i am amazed. It seems like we have been guided by the same voice but, you listened to it and followed it out. I literally had this conversation with my wife less than a month ago.

             its synonymous with "chill out" imho. cept suggestive of mental illness not rage or being loud and ranty or something..... you gotta be some kinda person to think you are being sincere by notifying someone that they are sounding similar to one in the "early stages of schizophrenia" 
is that really for you to decide from your computer screen?
 im not agreeing with his opinion, i dont care to dissect lyrics i dont like.. for me the foo fighters is as open and closed as dave grohl being a member of nirvana and kurt cobain on the last album covers his eye and if u reverse the photo has the twin towers with a plane on his shirt. so illuminati confirmed. kurt dies with how much dope in his system, and dave goes on to be an integral part of mainstream music henceforth, moving from drummer to front man. all the famous know about the pedophilia so thats all i gotta know. oh yeah and he wore a dress its all clear as day hes scum fuck him.  this dude could fo sho be onto something doe
often i am guided to research things which a few days later are featured on youtube channels i follow. obscure things, regularly. am i schizophrenic?
            </p>
            <p>
             i may be coming across as offended. im not and i apologize if coming across that way, i just think commenting on a persons mental state from across a keyboard is mighty presumptuous. whether or not hes imagining things doesnt really give any of us the right to speculate on that. its fucking bullshit, really. and i dont mean to sound offended bc im not. just pretty out there to feel compelled to say to someone. would you say that to a stranger who was saying this shit? id be like "tell me more i believe u, they all know shit. but i want some good proof"
            </p>
            <p>
             just because a persons delivery or presentation is off does not mean they are suffering from schizophrenia

            Last night it was Pussy Riot, which turned out to be based on a completely wrong conclusion. Now it's Foo Fighters?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The rest of the song reads like the story of a child who is deeply abused
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Um, no, it doesn't. It's clearly a story about someone in a bad relationship, as has been proclaimed by many musical sources for a long time. In what way is an adult a child's "monkey wrench"? That implies the child controls the adult.
           </p>
           <p>
            More lyrics that have nothing to do with children:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             One last thing before I quit
I never wanted any more than I could fit into my head
I still remember every single word you said
And all the shit that somehow came along with it
Still there's one thing that comforts me
Since I was always caged and now I'm free
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Is he remembering the words of a child? Children typically don't have much to say that's particularly memorable, nor is there much "shit" that goes along with children's talk. Additionally, how is someone "caged" by a child?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I began to dig into the names of the founders of "one in ten" and found a twitter feed for Matthew Cibellis, below you will find a tweet of his that I believe completely ties this song to pizzagate:
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Um...nothing in what you posted mentions Foo Fighters or the song, so where is the connection?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             He states strongly that human trafficking is happening in the US]:
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            ...because that's a fact that everyone in our government admits is true. It's not a bombshell. Remember that HRC and Podesta and the rest of the slime are involved in organizations that "combat human trafficking". It's been a pet celebrity cause for the longest time, but very little focus is ever on the United States because the scale in places like Europe and China dwarf our issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            These hyperanalyses of pop culture items reek to me of disinformation and I'd really like to see less of them wasting our time. Stop trying to find the wacky but interesting "hidden symbols" and KEEP FOLLOWING THE MONEY. That's the shit that will get indictments.

            Have you ever written a song? If you had you'd realize that coming up with phraseology is more important than clearly communicating. Songs are rarely messages but rather moods that the author wants to artistically encapsulate. It's cryptic, but that's the art, it isn't meant to be deciphered.

            I'm still digesting your post, but in the meantime, consider this:
A band called Skid Row released an album called "Slave to the grind" in 1991. There's a song on there called "In a darkened room", which is clearly about child abuse.
Have a listen:
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNPu58Sprkk">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNPu58Sprkk
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe some of these artists have been trying to draw our attention to this shit for a long time...
           </p>
           <p>
            edit: if any of you like metal or hard rock, try the whole album. Its actually quite good.

            Although I hate to think this is an unbelievably fantastic find on your part, DangerzoneNeo I think you've found something. It's the Comet tweet that sealed the deal for me. Maybe it's a wonderful coincidence that foo fighters led you here and they are innocent. OneinTen I have a strong feeling is a stand alone red flag worthy of investigation.
