            This is how I know that pedophiles run all aspects of our society. This is how the man who wrote this piece described Kathy's father violently raping her:
"she once again fell prey to a sexual attack at the hands of her biological father"
See how "She fell prey". Her fault. They don't even mention the father as the attacker, she fell prey to him, as if she did it to herself. Not, "Kathy's father violently raped her again". Which is what happened. Nope, "she fell prey" so that's on her.
           </p>
           <p>
            I once read an article about infant porn and the journalist said, "authorities found pornography where children as young as 6 months old were performing sexual acts on adults". um, exqueeze me? 6 month olds only know how to sleep and shit. They can't "perform" anything, literally. they only just know how to hold their heads up on the necks. They literally do nothing else. Notice that language though it was the infants performing on the rapists, not the other way around.

            I just read this obituary and realized it just happened in 2015. Almost vomited. The statistics of someone pouring gasoline on themselves and lighting a fire to death is extremely rare across the world even in very poor countries. It is barbaric and extreme even if one is suicidal. Very rare. If this was not investigated thoroughly as a possible homicide at least until all facts are known red flags should be popping off.

            WELL WELL WELL, why am I not surprised?  Dem. Whip STENY H. HOYER - Who sent the PIZZA to the office of Scalise as a 'good will gesture' (

            )  turns out to be one of the people listed on the Legislative Branch of Commissioners for **THE SEX TRADE: TRAFFICKING OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES   **https://www.csce.gov/sites/helsinkicommission.house.gov/files/The%20Sex%20Trade-%20Trafficking%20of%20Women%20and%20Children%20in%20Europe%20and%20the%20U.S..pdf  -  I think he know exactly what message he was sending when he sent over the pizza for everyone in the office of the Republicans!  I think he needs more looking into.
Additionally hen I typed into google  'STENY HOYER AND SEX TRAFFICKING' THIS ARTICLE CAME UP:

              Possibly a connection to pedogate if this is Steve De Blasio (arrested for child pron) with Steny H Hoyer of J Maryland? Not sure if there is a connection but if it is De Blasio, and Hoyer has worked there 30 years there could well be something more.

            I haven't been able to find anything about two deaths, but what I did find is scary as hell.

             Wanda Ashley Stock, 17, had only been living with James Hodgkinson, 66, and his wife for a few months when the teen doused herself with gasoline and burned to death, the Daily Beast reported.

            Who the hell would douse themselves in gasoline, and light themselves on fire? I would like to find an autopsy report, and/or a death certificate for this poor girl.
           </p>
           <p>
            The article then goes on to explain a second teen the family took in, who was later removed after allegations of abuse. I wonder if we could find that person. I would also like to thank OP for bringing this to our attention. We have the power and the opportunity to verify, and even expand upon a lot of information in cases like these. The autopsy report and death certificate should be well within the means of any motivated individual to acquire. I will see what I can do.

              After some more reading through the comments here, it appears the second girl died from a heroin overdose, possibly in Colorado, after being adopted by Hodgkinsons' neighbors. The suicide by fire still seems like the best avenue to research. I have never heard of anyone lighting themselves on fire with the intention of suicide. I'd like to know how a coroner could justify that as a suicide.

                You would think if she was already in a car, it would of been easy enough to drive off a cliff or something. I found a pretty morbid graph representing

                 methods of suicide

            Just as good -- if not better -- case could be made that the "shooting" was for GUN CONTROL, a FF to ensure that the House's gun legislation FAILS. (And, unlike the OP, I'm not abusing this forum to spam MY ARTICLES.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The House hearing that was scheduled was CANCELED because of this "shooting." Proposed legislation was to ease restrictions on SILENCERS, etc. Now it is doomed to fail.

            MY PREDICTION: Rep. Scalise, from Louisiana, the state known as "Sportsman's Paradise," will become the MALE COUNTERPART TO GABRIELLE GIFFORDS. He will do a 180 and suddenly be "pro gun control." He was only "shot in the leg," not "the head" like she was, so his ACTING JOB will be much easier than hers.

            This is the part that I found disturbing. I think the writer was hinting abut how abusive the foster parents without mentioning them by name.
           </p>
           <p>
            'Foster care is supposed to be foster parenting. Parenting is supporting the physical, emotional, social, financial and intellectual development of a child from infancy to adulthood. Foster care is not supposed to be belittling, the child is not supposed to be your free worker bee.'
           </p>
           <p>
            So who were her foster parents?
           </p>
           <p>
            "Then in December 2002, the Hodgkinsons assumed legal guardianship for their 12-year-old great-niece, Cathy Lynn Putnam.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cathy’s biological parents’ rights had been revoked, and she had been in foster care or with the Hodgkinsons since she was 4 years old. Her name was eventually changed to Cathy Hodgkinson.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, in the couple’s last annual report regarding the girl, they said she was returned to state custody on July 7, 2006; court documents did not state why the judge took that action.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a court document filed on Dec. 26, 2006, the Hodgkinsons wrote: “Since then His Honor has seen fit to award guardianship of Cathy to our next-door neighbors, which is a quite stressful and uncomfortable situation for our family.”

            If Kaine told him to do the shooting, and one of the capital police was also in on it (ensuring the shooter dies), you'd have a sealed murder.

            Thanks for the links. I wonder if anyone in the MSM will point out that this SOB told his neighbors he was going to Virginia to protest and looks like he took his rifle with him. I think he had more in mind then protesting from the start.

            I can't rule out MK-Ultra. Either way, CIA is very likely behind this. Either they're getting more and more obvious because they believe they can always get away with this, or else at least some of us are catching on.

              The story is still there, but it's been edited.  It's the one where the link says "More here" in the OP. It wasn't archived.  I just archived it in case it gets edited further, but it has been changed.  Darn it, I should have archived it when I grabbed the image.  You can see the original URL at the top of the image, and it matches what's still there. But the story has been revised.  You can see the part in the image where it says, "This also happened - because that's what you do when someone gets assassinated, you send pizza. And newspapers cover it too, because news about pizza is as important as news about political assassinations."

              I wonder if it is further proof that Trump foiled their plan by sending his doctor over to check on Scalise. I know it confirms to me the importance of archiving as soon as you find something.  For a while, I was just going through and archiving everything that hadn't already been archived, but I got tired of doing it.  Then Pizzabot was taking care of it, but I guess that's ended.

            this guy was all about taxes from 2008-2012, read his letters to the paper...during obama years.... no doubt bernie's platform would appeal to someone with those thoughts.... but i don't see the link to hating all republicans, dems are in on this too and are also very rich, his letters are very detailed and appear obsessive.... an easy mark for someone looking to dig deeper and find something to control him with, the best con men work with your own faults to scam you, that's why it's a CONFIDENCE game.

             It was a FF / psyop.  Probably for GUN CONTROL, and they couldn't resist throwing in some crumbs for PizzaGaters while they were at it.

            Here is Paul Begley with a guest. I love Paul Begley. He's a pastor who talks about bible prophesy and knows about all this Illuminati evilness going on. Most of his videos he makes he is hilarious. He's always saying "Are you serious?!" Lol. He makes short videos all day and posts them on YouTube. Anyway, this video is from yesterday and his guest talks about why he thinks the shooter was under MKUltra. I enjoyed it.

            MK Ultra involved in Virginia shootings?

            If you click on the link that is suppsed to be the 'evidence' that he was a bernie guy, it's a broken link, and nothing else which is supposedly evidence is linked...of course.

            Yeah and what teenage girl decides to commit suicide by pouring gasoline on herself and lighting herself on fire? That would be the most painful way to go!

            This smells like three day old fish.  I have a feeling this is all  concocted tom-foolery.  I just heard that Federal Investigators are checking into his social media.  Hmm.  We shall see what they come up with.  Remember when we heard that Hillary &amp; Co.  cooked up the bogus polling places?  Well, there were all kinds of people paid off to do her dirty work.  I wonder if they planted bogus Bernie people here and there to help with their plan. There was that guy named Utretsky that came from the DNC and was recommended to work for Bernie.  Now  as I say this is My Own Opinion.  I put nothing past these Dirty Crooks.  Nothing.

            St. Louis, Missouri and Racine, Wisconsin, like other cities in Nebraska and Pennsylvania are hubs for Pizzagate activities and massive corruption. Timothy Dolan the only hope for an American Pope was moved from St. Louis to Milwaukee in order to cover up Pizzagate scandals linked to the Catholic church. He was then rewarded with a promotion to Archbishop.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are afraid of everyone learning the real truth of what is going on in cities like St. Louis and Racine. These events will only escalate as they become more desperate to cover up, intimidate and retaliate against those who know the real truth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that Racine and other hubs are Sanctuary cities, children can go missing without anyone noticing. They control all of the foster programs, homeless programs, drug programs, schools, day cares, and family organizations. They pretend to care and establish programs to help fight the epidemic of trafficking and abuse only to be able to control it.

                  Here is this as well.“Disparate resources are used to protect from the disruption an attack on government could cause,” said John S. Czwartacki, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget. “However, I won’t reveal those protective measures here. Bad guys read The Times, too.”   NO you are not paranoid. You are Amazing!  And this is starting to look like a well orchestrated plan, but we are some very smart researchers.

                    I am so pumped up about the people on here.  How we may have different views about our politics, but can still come together to dig up the truth.  For dig we must, and deep.  They have buried the truth deep down in that rabbit hole.  Thanks Guys!

                  Not paranoid. Esp given who is in charge of msm. On a side note, I was curious about this: "plainclothes United States Capitol Police are sitting there in a black S.U.V." If you watch that video they've been airing, it's bizarre how long the whole event took, how many shots he took, the lag in time between shots - seemed to go on forever. If cops were there, why was he allowed to go on for that long. It seemed suspicious to me before I knew they were there all along, now even more so.

             Yeah, and there are other lies about him too that they want to spread.  He is getting off on the pedo stuff because no one ones to touch that.  But yet they are spreading lies about him being a Bernie Bro.  That came from CNN. The Master Liars.  I am already being attacked by a shill to CTR on my comment about how on my local news they reported that a Bernie leader for Illinois said they have no record of him even having volunteered in his own state.  Hmm.  So he traveled to other states but had no time for his own area even?  Who do I think is Lying? Well not the one that is on here lying every day.  Remember, their main objective right now is to divide us.

               Sorry, we must agree to disagree.  I believe that they have pushed this to the limit. I can't believe anything they come up with, for most of it has been a pack of lies.

              I called him out as a pedo and got shut down hard by a few voaters (then of course MF removed it). When something gets pushback around here it makes me ask why. Minus the bogus excuses ("won't be taken seriously" etc - that line might have worked 4 months ago but we already know we aren't taken seriously and not sure any of us have anything to prove to the masses). Anyway, aside from his pedo good-looks, it's clear there's a pedo angle that we're expected to ignore.

                 since they seem to be focusing on technical ideas more. But one could talk to cantsleepawink &amp; sturdygirl about it.

                <p>
                 Or maybe some of the people who tend to find stuff ahead of the pack could set up a new, censorship free sub? And ban the guys who are always trying to box in the discussions in this sub?

               Yeah, I agree.  I also think Bernie is going along with the supporter stuff because he knows he has to.  I heard it with my own ears that they have no record of him volunteering in his own state.  They have set up a really good smoke screen supported by CNN and their CTR  hacks. They took down his facebook page pronto and that is a really big red flag to me.  Again, this does not smell right and stinks like three day old fish.   We should all dig into these manufactured lies and I wonder if the really bad stuff about him was scrubbed, you know like the descriptions of what he did in exact terms to those girls.  I wonder if those articles might have revealed other things they did not want us to know.  I just don't trust them.  We know what side the MSM is on.

            A "drug overdose" and a "suicide"? This guy went with the easiest ways to bury his rapist evidence. And they say "at least" because they likely can't find some of his other foster kids.

              Now where is the proof that she set herself on fire?  Could he and his wife have killed her and then set her on fire?  I put nothing past this sick guy.  These pedos/abusers know all the tricks.  It seems since they can't even find the other foster children why would they have bothered to check who really did what.

               I'm not sure I agree here
Yes she set herself on fire.   But she came to the home with emotional damage
It's is highly unlikely she set herself ablaze for one incident.  Does that make sense?  She was a child hi risk

                Even high risk kids don't set themselves on fire... Self immolation is an existential act of defiance. It is so heavy... Never ignore it.

                I was just talking about this with someone. IF it was a suicide then choosing such a violent way to go had to come down to her own feelings about her body, most likely because she had been abused.
               </p>
               <p>
                Either way though, it all comes down to destroying that poor girls body to hide something completely fucked up.
