<p>In this Oct. 25, 2017, photo acquired by The Associated Press, George Nader poses backstage with President Donald Trump at a Republican fundraiser in Dallas. Nader, a convicted pedophile, was told by the Secret Service that he could not meet the president. His business partner, Elliott Broidy, helped him secure this photo with the president.189K contribution greased the wheels.Nader is a strong lobbyist for the UAE and Saudi Arabia  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-ol-enter-the-fray-how-much-does-a-convicted-pedophile-have-1527028600-htmlstory.html">http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-ol-enter-the-fray-how-much-does-a-convicted-pedophile-have-1527028600-htmlstory.html</a></p>
<p>Broidy misspelled the name , ran a security check under Vader instead of Nader:</p>
<p>&quot;Broidy drafted an email to Trump\'s chief of staff, John Kelly, asking him to intervene on behalf of his friend, whom he oddly called \'George Vader\' - a misnomer that appears elsewhere in the emails.
\'One of my companies does deep vetting for the US government,\' he wrote. \'We ran all data bases including FBI and Interpol and found no issues with regard to Mr. Vader.\' <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5754955/The-princes-president-fortune-seekers.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5754955/The-princes-president-fortune-seekers.html</a> </p>
<p>A George Nader was convicted by Prague\'s Municipal Court of 10 cases of sexually abusing minors and sentenced to a one-year prison term in May 2003, court spokeswoman Marketa Puci told The Associated Press on Wednesday. She said the crimes occurred between 1999 and 2002. She said Nader served time in a Prague prison, though it isn\'t clear how much. He was then ordered expelled. 
Puci said Nader was convicted of &quot;moral corruption of minors, sexual abuse and impairing morals,&quot; after abusing underage boys. </p>
<p>In one case, Nader requested oral sex from a 14-year-old boy in a room at the Hilton Hotel in Prague, Puci said. After the boy refused, Nader masturbated in front of him and paid him 2,000 koruna — worth about $100 today, she said. 
The verdict cites other examples of Nader providing money, jewelry, cellphones, clothes and accommodation for sexual services. The AP was able to see a copy of the verdict, which gives Nader\'s birthdate as May 15, 1959.</p>
<p>Nader was separately accused in Washington, D.C., of child pornography infractions in 1985, but those charges were later dropped. A criminal docket sheet obtained by the AP shows the same birthdate for Nader. </p>
<p>Two people with knowledge of the case confirmed it involved the same Nader now cooperating with Mueller. 
Many of Nader\'s former contacts and onetime friends have noted in recent weeks how they lost touch with him in the early 2000s. 
Nader had worked in recent times as an adviser to bin Zayed, one of the most powerful men in the Middle East, according to people who know Nader. The questioning of Nader in the Mueller probe suggests possible interest in UAE relations with Trump\'s transition team or his administration. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/a-witness-cooperating-with-mueller-is-a-convicted-pedophile-2018-3">https://www.businessinsider.com/a-witness-cooperating-with-mueller-is-a-convicted-pedophile-2018-3</a></p>
<p>Nader\'s connections with Trump confidants include Elliott Broidy, a top Republican fundraiser who co-hosted a Tuesday night event attended by the president in Beverly Hills, California. Broidy\'s wife is a former senior executive of 20th Century Fox.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, several media organizations, including the AP, obtained emails belonging to Broidy, a California-based venture capitalist and the Republican National Committee\'s deputy finance chairman. They show Broidy emailing Nader with a summary of Broidy\'s talks with Kushner and Trump in the White House in October 2017, touching on matters including the UAE\'s bitter dispute with fellow Persian Gulf country Qatar. </p>

            <p>
             Nader received a six-month sentence from a federal court in Northern Virginia
in 1991 on a felony charge of transporting sexually explicit materials in foreign commerce, according to the newly released records and to prison records POLITICO obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.
U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton also imposed a $2,000 fine on Nader, the
Details of the Virginia case have not been previously reported,
            </p>
            <p>
             but it was known that Nader faced a similar charge in federal court in Washington in 1985 involving allegations of importing from the Netherlands magazines depicting nude boys. A judge dismissed those charges after ruling that the search warrant issued for Nader’s home was invalid.

           <p>
            In the comments the name change is also mentioned Nader to Vader and someone mentions aka Darth Vader.   They ask at they end of the article why the Secret Service ignored the orders.  Good Question.

             When I first learned that Nader had been stopped upon arrival at Dulles and relieved of his electronic devices I couldn't help but wonder whether the FBI might have found any kiddie porn. And, the next thing we know, Nader is said to be cooperating fully.
Speculation, but it could be that Mueller has him by the balls, so to speak. I hope so, because I want Mueller to get everything out of him.
            </p>
            <p>
             FYI this article about Nader’s criminal catalogue: www.aljazeera.com/…
. . . He was not placed on the sex offender's registry in Virginia because the state's laws require two or more convictions of possession of child pornography before an offender's name is added to the list.

              ROMFL.  In Virginia.  Well that should explain it all.  Probably really hard to get two convictions of CP in Va.  Or at least depending on who you are.  Or what color.
