<p>The key information Pizzagate researchers need to dig into is:</p>
<p>As mentioned, we have found some data on the fact she has run adoptions through her court numbering in the hundreds of thousands, yet the population of Fort Smith, Arkansas is about 80,000 people.</p>
<p>^^^There were databanks that had all this info from a totally different site called Hack Forums and is now on a private board there.^^^</p>
<p>Also it would be fairly easy to find a paper trail, I would imagine, since that\'s probably how the databank was reached.</p>
<p>Also she accepts cases illegally by letting certain thugs (who work for BelClin) slip through the system to protect the thugs and to let them go after anyone wanting their own civil rights to visit their own mother.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The time of the Harrisons filing that perjury-filled lawsuit, was filed in May. Coming off of the March 20th date when they committed assault and battery. In the standards of issuing a PRO, the 30 day window was long closed but for some reason (i.e. corruption) they were able to come after (their victim) while playing the victim and get a court date well after the 30 day window was closed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The corrupt judge could have dismissed it as A. they don\'t take cases based on what people say on facebook. But in this case they somehow took it while never investigating the actual facdebook page as they would have found nothing there to go on and that the Harrisons forge things like texts from Belinga and forge facebook posts with some site they use. Meanwhile the screenshots we have are genuine. B. The judge never asked about the clusterfuck of the police report. How is it when they even stated they saw injuries but none on the Harrisons while claiming there was mutual combat based on what a &quot;bystander&quot; said? C. There are phone records that can prove the police were called before Harrison called them. The victim called the police first! Then the psychopathic phone call from Gerald Harrison acting his act. That corrupt judge never once investigated that either. Nor did the corrupt advocate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So their &quot;proof&quot; was non-existent because they lied. They lied about their victim being some big fighter while they were projecting. They lied about anything on facebook even remotely threatening them when victims have blocked them and their alternate accounts. They lied about some &quot;sugar gas tank&quot; threat when that never happened either and in court that even got stricken because it was hearsay. All was an excuse to drag innocent people to a kangaroo court and they threw everything at the wall hoping something would stick.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So in short, they got a PRO to keep the witness away, based on many lies and no proof and somehow got through that 30 day window. All courtesy of a corrupt judge who took orders from Belinga\'s hired maintenance because he works for Belinga and Belinga is directly connected to Clintons and Obama.</p>
<p>Conclusion, Belinga owns half of the authority and agencies in Fort Smith via the Clintons. AKA BelClin, Belcorp, Trinity and other properties they\'ve owned for decades. Belinga isn\'t the real landlord. Bill and Hillary Clinton are.</p>
<p>Belinga is part of their drug cartel. Do you wanna know how this traces back to Spiderweb? A John Deer tractor company whose owner originates from Mena, Arkansas.</p>
<p>The paper trail does indeed lead back the Clintons. The Harrisons know Belinga has this power as a mob member of the Clintons. When money is in play, they simply showed they\'re okay with hurting whoever they can to get some money. There is no loyalty to anyone and Harrisons are evil. Both of them.</p>
<p>It was only after all this shit, that the research went into high gear and this data was found about the judge and her obscene amount of children being adopted through that little court. A city of only around 80,000 people while adoptions numbering in the hundreds of thousands slipped through Blatt\'s court with her signature to ship kids in from all over the world to God knows where - and none of these children are adopted by any family living in Fort Smith. Where did they go?</p>
<p>So you see, it was a greedy henchman named Belinga who came in 2013 to secure all the properties of the former owner Chuck Leggitt to begin a high ranking cartel via properties Clinton had acquired and to turn into havens for drug and child trafficking while maintaining what would look like a legit business. This Belinga was even rushed through medical school to get a practicing license so he would have access to the drug supply that would be needed to start a new wave of crime since the Trinity prospects had dwindled out. All Trinity properties that were once nice areas are all crime-ridden and desolate. Drug havens and crack crashouts.</p>
<p>It was all uncovered because Belinga would NOT listen to the tenants who were assaulted or witnessed the assault, and kept his thugs in place because he gets free work from a psychopath who is all too willing to work for free just so he can have this unlawful &quot;power&quot; over other people (the tenants) and he got this corrupt judge to kiss his thug\'s ass. That\'s how all this came to light.</p>
<p>Had the greedy Belidiot never allowed this of his &quot;hired help&quot; well, none of this would have been discovered. At least by us. But they all wanted these violent trailer trash Harrisons to have whatever they wanted to have their asses kissed by the judge, the police, everyone and they got their way. All for those two pieces of shit that wanted power and control over someone and a family.</p>
<p>That\'s how all this came to light.</p>
<p>And there\'s even more...but I\'ll close here for now.</p>',

            I am a Trump fan to a certain extent, at the moment, as always.  I know who to talk to for evidence against the Clinton's. I spent nickles when I did not have a dime on this project. Give me a call Trump.

             The Clintons have way less power now than they did before. All the power riding on this atrocity now is literally run by a couple of psychopaths named Harrison and Belinga. That's who owns all the authority through fear and intimidation and through the money that supposed to flood in.

               Oh I know. It's way less than you think, though. There's a reason they're called the 1% and the only thing that gives them power is deception and lies. But that 1% has never trained to lie their way out of the coming wrath. Or exposure. Like I said; you're giving them too much credit.

                 Not giving Obamination too much credit. Look up Steve-Felix Belinga and you'll see he's just one of many that the nigger clown got into places to best benefit the drug and human trafficking enterprise. And these niggers always get low IQ white trash thugs to make all lives they come in contact with a living hell.

                   I don't doubt it, but it's a friend of mine that has been victimized brutally by this regime set up in Fort Smith. My interest in this is that she gets justice. She was brutally attacked. Then her mom was basically taken hostage. Her mom's rights as a tenant was stripped without any legality or cause. Then they were dragged to court by the CORRUPT advocate, P.A. named Erin Callous, and a very corrupt judge and all were doing this for this "landlord"

                    O.K. I do not know anything about that. I am not from Arkansas. I did go out there to find out what was going on in Mena. Hatfield Trucking was trucking logs with contraband inside from some sources. Train that is. Once they got de Mexican truckers in there they got it out by truck. Coke, and crystal meth. Everyone there knows everything, and are still too afraid to speak out due the e unfortunate incidents.

                     In the situation I have described is that they're not just moving drugs now, they're moving human slaves. The key to staying under the radar is the buy up properties and have them run by the same traffickers and these demonic slimes have foundations of their own, all the money going into these foundations come from the buyers (donations) but in order to launder the money, the maintenance and upkeep of properties gets nicely tucked away as that. Although he's not paying a cent for maintenance but by materials maybe. But for an actual professional to do the work? No. It's totally free. How to keep someone working for you for free? Offer them a unit to live in, and let them terrorize tenants. In a psychopath who loves power and to bully this is a dream job.

                     And Clinton's other properties all over Fort Smith are run down, drug infested nightmares where the upkeep is pretty much non-existent.

                       You have two trailer dwelling trash who are so narcissistic and full of themselves that they think they can make it be against the law to expose anything about themselves and their precious boss, child trafficker Belinga. But mostly the psychotics just think they own everything now because of a maintenance job and can censor anyone now. Read the May entries in the pastebin link.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       What you have here is a psychotic bully, two of them, actually. And what the head of the snake did in this life of hell he's made for everyone else is to have someone assaulted - his OWN family member means than nothing to this psychotic Harrison and he planned for the assault to happen. He made sure it would get carried through and he blabbed about it going to happen before it did, he was really excisted that someone was going to be beaten within an inch of their life and he saw to it that it would happen and his mommywife carried out the deed
                       <em>
                        as was planned
                       </em>
                       !
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Then he went about taking everything he could away from his victim, everything that she loved, and dumped those innocent lives in some dark place where there was allegedly "a body of water" but abandonment is abandonment and he'll get abandoned entirely when full judgement by karma finally kicks his ass. But he made sure that she would lose as much as he could possibly rip from her.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Then he threatened more injury and death on her and then he had the fucking nerve to go to some court clown and claim she was this big, bad monster. Everything they accused her of - they DID to her and to her mom! The coward fat blob of brat who needs a protector mommywife claimed that he was afraid of her! All that ranting he did and the lies he told only to try to come off as Billy Badass when he said he was a fighter (another 'tell one lie' then tell another!) They sat there and lied through their teeth, then attacked her character! The projection of those psychotics is staggering! They got all their methods from the Demoncratic playbook alright. But their M.O. is to play victim while literally victimizing others and this corrupt judge and advocate should be forever shamed and ruined for all eyes to see! They allowed an obvious bully do that to innocent people all because of this Belinga guy.

                         The language I'm using has nothing to do with it. It's just me saying it like it is. I want those victims to finally have justice that's been denied to them for so long.

                         I mean the corrupt judge is the one who flew into a RAGE over something my friend's mom did which was an innocent gesture of gratefulness to get a continuance, that bitch just flew right into a hissy fit. But let Belinga's thugs snicker and make under the breath comments to insult my friend and her mom and then looked for ANY excuse to blow up over a word that that corrupt judge has allowed by the thugs whose assholes she publicly licks.

                          I am not talking about the cursing. I am talking about the fact that if you said that to anyone on the street, they would walk away from you like you are crazy. Your writing style is rambling and incomprehensible to me. I read it and am left wondering who, what, where, and why. I am not sure what a mommywife is also.

                           Did you ever read the pastebin pages? It would clear up a lot of things for you. The reason it sounds rambling to you is because you haven't read that. It's like I put the links that explain what I'm talking about, but if you haven't read it, then it'd be like you reading what I'm saying in the middle of the book, and then blaming me for what I relate, because you didn't read the beginning.

                            I am from the South. We actually shoot people that threaten us. Sometimes just in the ear, or the big toe. It is probably a different culture you live in up there.

                       I REALLY hope so! Because her network of criminal slimebags need to be taken down pronto! That includes the police, attorneys, managers and lowly maintenance psychos that are part of her network. They'll destroy lives for a tiny bit of that money.

                       Clinton never seemed to draw the line between taking money for her "services" as one would pay a lawyer, and her "public" service.

                   Well this particular asshole is an Obama elitist and he wants to eat flesh prepared for him. Too much of a coward to actually do the killing himself but...on that note, I refer to the character of Gus Fring from Breaking Bad. He'd slice a throat himself as long as there's no consequences or retribution. If you catch my meaning.

              Haha yes I noticed that but that FB account is susp because she opened an account in 2017 and a new one in 2018 and Then there’s the little girl who she says is her daughter that has cancer yet there is no info on the cancer or what she went through . It just shows her posing in pictures with her little hairless daughter  ( from chemo I suppose ) . It just stuck out to me . I’ll delete it so not to confuse anyone .

            Thanks for the info. It was a good read, even the GA comments. However, I'm having trouble connecting the dots. Could you list the sources for these allegations, especially the lawsuit in the first couple of paragraphs?

             In 2009 the mother moved into this place called Tremont Circle. Then owned by a guy named Leggitt. For years there was peace and quiet, then 2013 came along and this Obama thug named Belinga was put in as a maintenance guy of all these properties. Working as a doctor at Mercy hospital during the day. The reason there was still, at this time, peace and quiet was because Gerald Harrison Jr. and his violent bigfoot wife had not been able to do anything to anyone at these properties. But this changed in 2018 when Belinga made him the maintenance. From then, this chaos unfolded. Without going into detail of what the Harrisons are, suffice it to say that they are unhinged psychopaths.

            </p>
            <p>
             During the years 2009 - 2013 the Harrisons were living in a trailer in Oklahoma, they really are trailer trash. Drug addicts and horribly violent people. They use their fists in place of talking and the psycho Jr uses his mouth for screaming and yelling and then has his wife do the actual battery for him. He's went through about 9 other spouses before finding someone who was willing to be a physical threat to anyone who opposes him. Especially when he has many enemies and has had plans to beat up those around the family that have denied him money in the past. He's a meth addict and has done nothing with his life but cause chaos, damage and all around shit for anyone unfortunate enough to have even had to deal with him. He is not human. He is, like his Sasquatch wife, a monster. He got out of a

             </a>
             in 2010 by snitching on a drug lord he ran with, who was the lesser violent of the gang. Jr should have stayed in prison imo.

              This is him
             </a>
             . This is what Belinga has subjected all these tenants to. And why? Free maintenance. The psychopath Harrison/Jinks are willing to work for free to keep control over this woman and keep her daughter away. The same daughter that would repeatedly say no to Harrison whenever he asked for money. Grudge.
            </p>
            <p>
             So you have a basic idea of where this is coming from.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now let's discuss Belidiot.
            </p>
            <p>
             A dumber than a bag of rocks shit fuck for brains. A lousy doctor with 90% negative reviews, had basically been kicked out of Mercy hospital and resigned on August 1st this year. Resigned with an "effective immediately" and by witness accounts of him and how he conducted himself, he was a lousy ass doctor and they were going to kick him out. Also other tenants of the Belcorp, LLC properties has stated that Belinga told them he was just the maintenance. Belcorp has not paid any taxes in over a year.
            </p>
            <p>
             A mere 15 days later he sets up a foundation! What is it with these Clinton fuckers? Foundations must be the go-to to launger money! I'm telling you.
            </p>
            <p>
             So this Leggitt sold everything to this Belcorp. Owned by the Clintons but run by Steve-Felix Belinga who operates as the "maintenance" for this Belcorp. BelClin is also his pet LLC but is also owned by the Clintons. BelClin is a combination of the names Belinga and Clinton.

             There's no way to actually contact the real LLC owners, just managers and other minions but Hillary Clinton and Obama both own all these LLC's. The electronic trail goes right back to them. Which is a different database than what you can see here.

             August 15th, 2018. Just 15 days after he's pretty kicked out of Mercy hospital, he gets a stint at some heart center on Jenny Lind and sets up a foundation?
            </p>
            <p>
             I gave all this info up front to show how this connects the dots.
            </p>
            <p>
             Psychopath Gerald Harrison brings on this frivilous lawsuit victimizing the victim that he and his wife had already assaulted and the victim had gotten an order against them back in March. When one of her friends uncovered the blog where it showed that Belinga had a PRO against him in 2017, the psycho Harrison Jr. wanted to avenge Belinga and get revenge for him on those that uncovered this info. It's actually a mutual friend of ours named Andrea Ledin (check facebook posts) and there you'll see her May entries of what was uncovered. Since the psychos are stalking everyone connected with the victim, they saw that and flew into a rage and threatened serious injury to the victim, something like breaking her jaw with a baseball bat. This is what was uncovered regarding Belinga and Harrisons went over to the victim's mother's house and barged in and threatened all of that - because of what was posted by Ledin on facebook. I told you, they're fucking psycho. But then they got the idea, either by their own psychosis or from Belinga to file this frivilous PRO against the victim. This was all revenge pure and simple. There are the dots that connect these events.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was only after all this that the judge and everyone involved in the kissing of Harrison's asses that all this intel was discovered.

            Adoptions through corrupt courts. No big deal. Ha! Great post. I wonder if anyone has researched this statistic in all courts. Number of adoptions versus local population. There has got to be a baseline that allows abnormalities to show through numbers alone.
