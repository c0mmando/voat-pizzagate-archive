<p>These brothers are serious behind-the-scenes players in the US political world. These are the people who operate at a deeper level than the politicians and entertainment types that are easier to investigate.</p>
<p>They\'re the &quot;men-behind-the-curtain&quot; who &quot;pay to play&quot; with bribery fronts like the Clinton Foundation, get rewards from congressmen they have in their pockets (like government sugar subsidies,) and are involved in some seriously nasty stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Note that at the deeper levels, people don\'t care about false choices like left/right, Republican/Democrat, liberal/conservative. Those labels exist as distractions for the &quot;little people&quot; to box-in their thinking and prevent them from looking into what is really going on.</strong></p>
<p>These guys cover their bets by making campaign donations to both parties: Alfonso Fanjul donates heavily to the Democrats (and has made huge contributions to the Clinton Foundation,) and he even managed Bill Clinton\'s presidential campaign in the state of Florida in 1992. Another one of the brothers donates heavily to the Republicans and has worked on their campaigns.</p>
<p>Here are some interesting quotes:</p>

<p>&quot;<em>The Fanjuls are formidable adversaries. They control about 40 percent of Florida’s sugar crop, and last year they made contributions to 31 political candidates, giving more than any other sugar power.

<p>&quot;<em>The President</em> (Clinton) <em>told her he no longer felt right about their intimate relationship, and had to put a stop to it.… At one point during their conversation the President had a call from a sugar grower in Florida whose name, according to Ms. Lewinsky, was something like “Fanuli.. . .

<p>These guys are so well known for their corruption, that they inspired a book in 1993: <em>Striptease</em> by famous Florida author Carl Hiaasen.</p>
<p>What is notable, though, is their involvement with the Clinton Foundation and their huge farmland and resort interests in the Dominican Republic, which shares a border with Haiti. When these guys say &quot;Jump&quot; to Dominican politicians or law enforcement, those guys say &quot;How High?&quot;</p>
<p>Also: both airports in the Dominican Republic are privately owned, one by the Fanjul brothers, and the Clintons are personal friends of both sets of owners:</p>

            for the leads from his post above.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have split them up to summarize below:
           </p>
           <p>
            Fanjuls own Caso de Campo in Dominican republic. 
it was there that Senator MeneNdez waa honey potted and subsequently black mailed. 
much worse happens there as the resort is a law unto itself. (
            <em>
             seems to me that the whole of the Dominican Republic may be that.
            </em>
            )
           </p>
           <p>
            Think customs can tell the difference between cocaine and sugar on pallets in containers??  doubt it. 
(
            <em>
             Fanjuls involved in the cocaine trade? Well, they are linked to Bill Clinton who infamously protected the CIA's cocaine movements at Mena Ariport in Arkansas when he was Governor. They won a whole airport in the Dominican Republic. They seem to own a private airstrip in Florida. What do you think?
            </em>
            )

            the family is Jesuit black nobilty. Pepe has a signed photo og Pope benedict on his desk at 
their ranch in yhe everglades that he flies to im his huey from PBI airport.

            Freedom from punishment for child sex traffickers in the Dominican Republic, home to vast Fanjul-related enterprises, and which as you mentioned
            <strong>
             shares a border with Haiti (2017 article):
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              "Child sex tourists do 'dirty business' with impunity in Dominican Republic"
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Children in the Dominican Republic are preyed upon by foreigners who visit the island to have sex with youngsters but few sex tourists are punished, a United Nations expert said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maud de Boer-Buquicchio, the U.N. special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, said the Dominican Republic is a child sex tourism hotspot.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              “The people who go there for that purpose know that they can do this in relative impunity. That it’s easy to get access to children,”
             </strong>
             she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation following her first visit to the Caribbean nation last month.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              “Tourists say, ‘well it’s easy there, why not.'”

              In my opinion it does not help that MSM sometimes refers to Haiti as an "island nation."
             </p>
             <p>
              Collins dictionary defines "island nation" as:  "a country that is entirely made up of one or more islands," and it is not in Webster's nor Cambridge.  Used more broadly the phrase makes sense, but it's a little misleading that MSM doesn't seem to mention the DR's proximity very often.

            awesome start.. i've been lurking for sometime but i am,lets say, an insider in palm beach. i have moved in similar circles and am aware of a great deal of palm beach gossip. The fanjuls r members of a Club roght next to trumps mar a lago called Palm Beach Bath and tennis club. this club is the epicenter of old money and are Trumps nemesis' as they denied him membership and thus legitimacy in Palm Beach society. Andres fanjuls daughter married the step son of the mayor. Her husband may pr may not b the boss of cosa nostra on the east coast, depending who u ask. Fanjuls own caso de campo in Dominican republic. it was there that senator menedez waa honey potted and subsequently black mailed. much worse happens there as the resory is a law unto itself.  Think customs can tell the difference between cocaine and sugar on palletes in containers?? doubt it. we always joked about their name meaning go fuck yourself ( in the ass). its an ode to sodomy, which is satans sex.. the family is jesuit black nobilty. Pepe has a signed photo og Pope benedict on his desk at their ranch in yhe everglades that he flies to im his huey from Pbi airport. dig into the palm beach bath and tennis club. that is the real swamp.. brook shiels mom is a member.. we all know how early she got put into the game. Duponts, morgans, flaglers, vanderbilts.. Google House of Munn. that will show u the nexus of The establishment. Founders of planned parenthood... u will have a field day digging..
 God Speed...

              anyone that moves in high circles rubs shoulders with unsavory types.. my take is that all the right evil people hate him, he must be doing something right. he has been waiting for his time to serve up the coldest dish of revenge against the families at the Bath and Tennis who are supposedly protestant but have since a long time been infiltrated by Jesuit. I actually think that Executive order on dec..21st will eventually target them. Look up the  conflict trump had with town of Palm beach over his American flag being against code.. he called their bluff. its in the record that the american aristocracy was against a man who wanted to be extra patriotic.. so much for lotalty to the country that made them rich. It was a brilliamt troll

                Whenever you look into these people who are part of families that operate "behind the curtain" at deeper levels than the politicians and celebrities, you seem to find Jesuit involvement.

                this whole pizzagate thing originates with John Podesta. he is a proffessor at Jesuit Georgetown anf attends a jesuit catholic church.. the Jesuits are the intellegence soldiers of the antichrist papacy and counter reformation inquisitors. Himmler modelled the SS on the jesuit order and hitler called him " our Ignatius of Loyola.. Loyolas spiritual exercises are a template for mk ultra brainwashing..

                  Thank you I will read those.  Once again we're on the same wavelength as Gaspard II de Coligny is my favorite person in history and I know the Council of Trent happened during his time.  I have never read the Anathemas, though.  Very helpful -

                   he was betrayed during the st Bartholomews day massacre. Catherine de medici order it at the behest of her jesuit confessor.. 100 years later louis 14 would do the same, revoking the edict of nantes , which led to the slaughter of between 300 and 500 thousand hugenots and the diaspora of another 500 thousand. that brain drain led dotectly to the conditions that fomented yhe revolution a 100 years later.. its all connected to the papal whore and her vicious adherents.. ive got a ton on info to drop.. keep an eye out because im about to really expose the real deep state
