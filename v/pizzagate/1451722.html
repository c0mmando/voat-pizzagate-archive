<h1>Besta Pizza</h1>
<ul>
<li>Besta Pizza is is 2 or 3 doors down from Comet Pizza. Map: ( <a href="https://sli.mg/lziXTY">https://sli.mg/lziXTY</a> )</li>
<li>Besta Pizza is owned by Andrew Kline through Uptown Pizza LLC ( <a href="http://supforums.com/thread/96371913/politics/digging-for-owners-of-besta-pizza.html">http://supforums.com/thread/96371913/politics/digging-for-owners-of-besta-pizza.html</a> )</li>

<li>There were rumours that there were two different Andrew Kline\'s but the above link does convince me they are the same person.</li>
<li>Besta Pizza had a logo with a pedo symbol ( <a href="https://sli.mg/Qzs3q2">https://sli.mg/Qzs3q2</a> )</li>
<li>After the pizzagate investigation started Besta changed their logo ( only could find reddit link )</li>
<li>Besta means Beast in Portuguese ( <a href="https://translate.google.ca/?num=50&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=o76&amp;channel=fs&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=tw-ob#pt/en/besta">https://translate.google.ca/?num=50&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=o76&amp;channel=fs&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;client=tw-ob#pt/en/besta</a> )</li>
<li>Some of the underground work is done at Besta Pizza with no permit ( <a href="https://i.sli.mg/yUcOlu.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/yUcOlu.jpg</a> )</li>
<li>I read that there is a rumour that Besta is in CP competition with Comet but why would they both be doing underground work.</li>
<li><em>I think Besta Pizza could be more fleshed out.</em></li>
<li><em>There is a submission on a company called Besta World Group Inc which is linked to another ping pong place in London but someone will have to help me undestand the linkages</em> ( <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1449130">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1449130</a> )</li>
