<pre><code>There\'s an extremely serious dump of emails that came from Wikileaks exposing Hillary Clinton for ordering top US Diplomats to steal the DNA and passwords from United Nations leadership.
</code></pre>

<p>The stunning email comes from the account of Hillary Clinton that used the address </p>
<p>&quot; Below is the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) which released the email from Hillary Clinton, which references both Wikileaks, Julian Assange, and an article which had called for Hillary Clinton\'s resignation over the 2009 spying scandal ordered at the hands of Hillary Rodham Clinton towards the UN while she was Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Clinton Email by Red Pill on Scribd</p>
<p>Hillary Rodham Clinton is quite possibly the most corrupt Secretary of State in American history, and no doubt the most corrupt politician to ever walk the face of the earth.</p>
<p>America truly dodged a bullet by avoiding the election of this wicked witch, and thanks to the newest tweet from Wikileaks dumping this story into the laps of the general public, they can be reminded just how corrupt the entire Obama regime actually was.</p>
<p>A 2009 article from The Guardian was also referenced in the Wikileaks tweet, which discussed the spying orders from Hillary Clinton against the-Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, as well as several members of the UN’s permanent Security Council of the United Kingdom, France, China, and Russia.</p>
<p>The top-secret intelligence campaign was ordered directly from Hillary Clinton and had at the time infuriated members of the UN, only to now be brought to light yet again by Wikileaks with the inclusion of the email from Hillary Clinton\'s private server.</p>
<p>The Guardian writes:</p>
<p>”It called for detailed biometric information &quot;on key UN officials, to include undersecretaries, heads of specialised agencies and their chief advisers, top SYG [secretary general] aides, heads of peace operations and political field missions, including force commanders&quot; as well as intelligence on Ban\'s &quot;management and decision-making style and his influence on the secretariat&quot;. A parallel intelligence directive sent to diplomats in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi said biometric data included DNA, fingerprints and iris scans.”</p>
<p>”Washington also wanted credit card numbers, email addresses, phone, fax and pager numbers and even frequent-flyer account numbers for UN figures and &quot;biographic and biometric information on UN Security Council permanent representatives&quot;.”</p>
<p>”The secret &quot;national human intelligence collection directive&quot; was sent to US missions at the UN in New York, Vienna and Rome; 33 embassies and consulates, including those in London, Paris, and Moscow.”</p>
<p>”The operation targeted at the UN appears to have involved all of Washington\'s main intelligence agencies. The CIA\'s clandestine service, the US Secret Service and the FBI were included in the &quot;reporting and collection needs&quot; cable alongside the state department under the heading &quot;collection requirements and tasking&quot;.”</p>
<p>So much for the whole “Russian collusion” and “Russian interference” narratives, when this further implicates the American intelligence community in literally attempting to steal the DNA and biometrics of members of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>What a time to be alive, as the “Deep State” continues to be exposed.</p>
<p>The audacity of this woman is beyond disturbing and it\'s as if with each passing day we find out that yes, she\'s even viler than we initially believed, despite doubting that a person could possibly be any more corrupt.</p>
<p>Thanks, Wikileaks. 100% accuracy rating still remains in-tact</p>',

            I believe there is steganography used in several messages. For example, in #4322, it looks like a party invitation, but there are odd ways of shaping the sentences. #17992 has some odd numbers. Looks like it works with counting the words or the syllabus.

            As noted in the three or four other posts about this
           </p>
           <p>
            This is not a state department policy. It's a National intelligence directive based on the president's executive order.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's based in the national intellgence priorities set forth by the Director of National Intelligence dating back to 2004 and still in place today.
           </p>
           <p>
            State Department cables have the Secretary of State's name on them. In this case, the person sending this cable is the acting head of the operations bureau of State's INR, the INtel and Research bureau passing along a presidential directive. A policy like this is often debated at the National Security Council.

              Maybe  DNA is also useful for brownstoning ops .... there must be plenty of DNA 'left behind'. Or for Epstein island ....  lots of blackmail material if DNA matches kiddies used in ops.

              If a UN diplomat turns on you and you'd like to switch him out, you could have him framed for a crime. And fingerprints, eyescans, voice recordings, etc can be used to gain access to restricted buildings, rooms, etc, etc.

             <p>
              The better question would be, why on earth wouldn't you collect their DNA?

             With her there is always an ulterior motive.  Just throw out the wildest idea and then research it.  Research is always important, not just wild ideas.  But yes, what you propose, is a possibility.  They certainly have secret places.

            People forget that State is part of the Intelligence Community (IC).  Diplomats are often spies.  Not the ambassadors.  Most of them are idiots.

              This is completely false.  Um, do you think the Secretary of State has more power that the President? Do you think only one person signs off on foreign weapons sales?
              <em>
               Rex Tillerson can just say let Saudi Arabia

              Anything they want off the lot?
             </p>
             <p>
              Arm sales are an instrument of US foreign policy and occur according to laws set by Congress. There's an inter-agency process about approving foreign arms sales.  Congress must be notified of sales over a certain dollar value and can block these arms sales by passing legislation or pass resolutions condemning the sale.  State and DOD handle the details, but the State Department is acting on behalf of the President when they approve a sale.
             </p>
             <p>
              <code>
               The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM) oversees most government-to-government arms transfers and the commercial export licensing of U.S.-origin defense equipment and technologies, consistent with the Arms Export Control Act, the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and other statutory authorities and relevant international agreements.
              </code>
             </p>
             <p>
              The specific unit that looks into all this is Office of Regional Security and Arms Transfers
             </p>
             <p>
              The process is first a country must send a formal request.
             </p>
             <p>
              This request is reviewed by the government....is the country on approved for this type of Sale, etc
             </p>
             <p>
              Congress has to be notified for big sales.  The notification limit is higher for NATO members and close allies. :
              <em>
               The submission by the Department of State (on behalf of the President) of a preliminary or
informal notification of a prospective major arms sale 20 calendar days before the executive
branch takes further formal action.
              </em>
             </p>
             <p>
              That arms sale pay to pay is a whole lotta bullshit, it only works if you don't understand the above process and think one person approves US arms sales AND if you cherry pick the evidence.
             </p>
             <p>
              Ireland gave a big, big donation and its arms sales went down 33%
Algeria gave a small donation and its arm sales went up 400%
Morocco gave a big donation and its arm sales stayed the same.
Brunei gave the same as Algeria and its arms sales plunged 80%
             </p>
             <p>
              It's almost like the donations to the Clinton Foundation had no effect at all on US foreign policy.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the type of deceptive bullshit politicos can get anyway with when people don't understand the details of how something actually works.   Most everybody does not know how uranium is licensed or how the CFIUS board works or how arm sales get approved, so they have the complete jump on people and can frame routine actions into a scandal.

                “Foreign Military Sales are one of two methods through which a country can purchase new military equipment from the United States; the other is Direct Commercial Sales, which are managed by PM/DDTC. FMS is a government-to-government program through which the U.S. Government sells conventional military weapons, equipment, and services to allied and friendly nations to assist them in meeting their legitimate defense requirements. Although the Department of Defense, through the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), is responsible for implementing individual FMS cases,
                <strong>
                 the Department of State must first review and approve them.
                </strong>
                DSCA forwards all FMS cases to PM/RSAT, which is responsible for ensuring that they are properly reviewed within the Department for consistency with U.S. foreign policy and national security objectives. In close coordination with other Department bureaus and offices, PM/RSAT officers provide recommendations to PM leadership on whether to approve the potential sale of military equipment to foreign governments through FMS.”

             170715772 # Intel agencies have a habit of collecting DNA, finger prints and other specific identifiers like, obviously, voice recordings and eye scans.
Why? They can be used for hundreds of different things.
            </p>
            <p>
             If a UN diplomat turns on you and you'd like to switch him out, you could have him framed for a crime. And fingerprints, eyescans, voice recordings, etc can be used to gain access to restricted buildings, rooms, etc, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             The better question would be, why on earth wouldn't you collect their DNA?"
