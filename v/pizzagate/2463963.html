            GAGA'S BAIT AND SWITCH
"Kids like Rodemeyer moved Gaga, 29, to establish the Born This Way Foundation, a nonprofit determined to show disenfranchised teens they weren’t alone -- the pop star herself had struggled with depression."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Born This Way first sponsored the Born Brave Bus Tour, a pop-up resource center that drew 150,000 visitors in two years. But more recently, the foundation has SHIFTED ITS FOCUS to peer support and preventive initiatives, including research on YOUTH AND MENTAL HEALTH in a partnership with the YALE CENTER FOR EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE, and in a forthcoming collaboration with the Elton John AIDS Foundation, which will be announced soon."

             KEEP YOUR EYE ON BRIDGEPORT CONN. PUBLIC SCHOOLS
RULER SCHOOL: Supported by the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence
             <a href="http://ei.yale.edu/school/bridgeport-public-schools-district/">

             "Bridgeport Public Schools is a school district headquartered in Bridgeport Connecticut, and is comprised of 30 elementary schools, three comprehensive high schools, two alternative programs and an inter-district vocational aquaculture school. The system has about 23,000 students, making the Bridgeport Public Schools the second largest school system in Connecticut"

             WHAT IS A RULER SCHOOL?
             <a href="http://ei.yale.edu/ruler/ruler-overview/">
              http://ei.yale.edu/ruler/ruler-overview/
             </a>
             "How RULER Becomes an Integral and Enduring Part of Your School or District
RULER is an acronym that stands for Recognizing, Understanding, Labeling, Expressing and Regulating emotions."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Phase 1 (1 year)* – The Anchors of Emotional Intelligence
This first phase grounds teachers, staff, students, and families in the Anchors of Emotional Intelligence. These fundamental RULER tools enhance individuals’ ability to understand and regulate their own emotions and to consider and empathize with how others are feeling. The Anchors also foster the kind of healthy emotional climate essential to personal growth.
Phase 2 (1 year)* – The Feeling Words Curriculum
The second phase enables teachers to integrate RULER into a wide range of subject areas, ensuring that emotional intelligence is woven into the content of every class and throughout each student’s school day. The Feeling Words Curriculum that teachers learn to use is tailored to specific grade levels and aligned with the Common Core.
Phase 3 (ongoing) — Lasting results
RULER creates a self-perpetuating program by training teachers and other staff to become RULER Trainers who then teach the rest of the school what they’ve learned. As teachers are trained, they in turn teach their students, and as new teachers arrive, RULER Trainers teach them.
To ensure lasting success, RULER also supports RULER Trainers with ongoing feedback, advanced training, and an online community where participants from around the world compare notes, participate in webinars, watch videos, and stay up-to-date on the latest program enhancements."

             "Gaga said BTWF chose to partner with Yale because of Brackett’s expertise in emotional intelligence. Through the partnership, BTWF leaders hoped to jointly conduct research on the mental well-being of today’s youth, Gaga said. The partnership’s research gives greater value to input from adolescents than previous studies have done, Gaga said."

             "The Center applies the results of its research to classrooms through the RULER program, which trains teachers and uses classroom tools to teach emotional intelligence, said Miriam Schroers, the Center’s director of communications. Schroers added that data show RULER improves such education quality benchmarks as academic performance and teacher attrition. RULER is now in several hundreds of schools, including the entire public school district in Bridgeport, Connecticut."

              COMMON CORE IS A COMPUTERIZED VERSION OF THE "Outcome Based Education" of the '70's - 90's. It is based on BLOOM'S TAXONOMY OF EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES: AFFECTIVE AND COGNITIVE DOMAIN. Bloom's family came to the U.S. from THE SOVIET UNION. He infiltrated the American public school system with a COMMUNIST BASED testing system!
Not only do they test for academics (cognitive domain), but also for ATTITUDES, VALUES, AND BELIEFS! (affective domain).

                A CRITIQUE OF TAXONOMY: AFFECTIVE DOMAIN
"As a means of providing such unity to the various affective objectives they were considering for inclusion in their taxonomy, the Affective Domain authors elected to employ the concept of "internalization" as their central regulative device. Objectives then could be systematically organized along a hierarchiel continuum according to the degree that a learner could be said to have internalized attitudes, values, or affective responses. For theses writers, this concept appeared suitable not only because it permitted the construction of a "meaningful continuum," but also because it was compatible with certain theories of how affective learning takes place and it was consistent with the behavioral point of view. (p. 28) Thus, they probably felt that as long as they confined the content of their affective categories to descriptions of behavioral phenomena their affective taxonomy would rest on a reasonably secure methodological foundation. Upon close inspection, however, this does seem to be the case."
               </p>
               <p>
                "In speaking of internalization as growth, they assert that external or environmental control progressively yields to internal control so that, in the case of acquiring affective responses, there is a gradual decrease of the former and increase of the latter. (p. 80) External control is successively replaced by internal con- trol. However, when we attempt to find out explicitly what con- stitutes these controls, the entire matter begins to take on a distinctly different form. Although there is considerable discus- sion of individuals responding to stimuli, that which is described as being internalized and is said to control behavior is not con- sidered to be a stimulus source. Instead, it appears to be a value or set of values. Values, the authors say, are successively internalized by the learner. (p. 85) As the internalization process unfolds, these values are absorbed more and more into an indi- vidual's internal controlling structure. (pp. 27-28) At the outset of the process, they merely capture the student's attention while at the end they are accepted into his interrelated view of the world. (p. 83)
From this it is diiticult not to get the impression that the authors are saying that the process of internalization begins when a given value is selected from someplace exterior to the surface of the organism and then is gradually brought into its interior. Their heavy reliance upon psychoanalytic theory, as an aid in explaining their position, further supports this. They assert that the major aspect of internalization is the process of incorporating something within one's mind or body. (p. 29) To internalize values, they indicate, is to incorporate, as one's own various moral standards. (p. 89)"

            Of course it is laying the ground.  All these hot teachers getting busted fucking young teens, you think it's by accident?  Either one of the SSRI side effects causes this; or whomever they were owned by were given instructions to make them do this.  No 15 year old boy with a raging boner is going to resist that.  None.  All in an attempt to normalize, pre-condition, condition...

            LADY GAG ME WITH A SPOON GAGA may possibly and allegedly also be connected to the death of Lina Morgana.  Her family denies that she committed suicide by jumping off the Crown Plaza Hotel.  Here is a former thread about Lina Morgana's death

              Yeah why would she pick a name like that?  What  does it even mean?  When I first saw her I said to my husband, she is so ugly she gags me. That's when it started.

            I'll admit....I like her music and videos.  The cinematography, makeup, special effects are superb.  Regardless, I wouldn't be surprised if Gaga was born a dude.  The DS took care of her.

             i like her in small doses, one of the few pop artists with any real talent. but gaga is definitely aware of the horrible trap she's fallen into - she made a song/video about trying to escape the illuminati satanic system, but i can't remember the name of it. the entire vid is about this attempt, and sadly ends where she realizes that she cannot escape. i feel anything she's doing now is probably her genuinely trying to do some good to compensate for this, but you know tptb are going to use and exploit anything she does for their own agenda, unfortunately.

              I don't know. The woman has done some blatantly satanic things on stage. If she wants to disavow all that, fine! Great! I'm all for that. But she hasn't apologized for any of that. She's done her time on stage, she's tired, and she's made a ton of people money and wants to take it easier, that's all. There is more than one way for her to skin the cat and please her handlers.

            I loved this video. The narrator is SMART. He explains how Lady Gaga is morphing from a promoter of Satanic imagery (she's bored with that now) to a promoter of child indoctrination. Basically a lot of feel good, love yourself, follow your heart, nothing is wrong no matter how "out there". Of course the unspoken truth is that it's all about encouraging children to embrace homosexuality and transgender lifestyles. How many more kids will grow up confused and do themselves lasting harm because nobody stopped them from following the pied piper? The numbers of children that identify as gay and trans are growing because it has become entrenched in the media. Kids learn from what they see. Kids experiment. Pedophiles love this chaos.

             Well  said-these "ideas" are being  PROGRAMMED   into  youth, because these are developmental stages where personality and social norms are learned and  incorporated into the person-
these public charades are more   damaging than heavy drugs and these  people need  to  be 'dealt with,"

             the number of kids identifiying as gay and trans are growing because society has become more accepting of it and they don't have to live tortured lives in the closet or be beat up, bullied, or worse - murdered just for being who they are. kids grow up confused because they have shitty parents that guilt trip them if they don't fit into the mold their backwards parents want for them. thank God (the real God, not of the bible) and also my parents for accepting my brother for who he is as well as my dear friends for the amazing people they have grown up to be.

              Nobody is advocating for murder of gay or transgender people here. I don't think anyone hates them. What we hate is that there is a growing movement to encourage it to the detriment of society at large. I would ask you if you think it is okay to administer hormone blocking drugs to little children when they are so young they can't know the difference. That is not love. That is abuse.

              "thank God (the real God, not of the bible)"
Who is this "God" of whom you speak? How do you know he/she/it/they is/are real? How do you know what he/she/it/they think/s?
My next door neighbor gave birth to her gay brother's son and allowed he and his gay partner to adopt the baby. She did this twice. Do you think it would be OK for the children to meet their birth mother?

            Speaking specifically on your use of the term NWO, I'm copying a pasting a comment I just made on another post:
           </p>
           <p>
            We NEED a NWO. The current world order is shit. The elites have inverted things so that you guys fight against what we actually need. The Old World Order is what is currently in place and what you should fear. We've got millions homeless, plus people without access to food, water, medicine, etc. This isn't working. I'll say it again - we NEED a NWO, and they've got everyone so twisted around thinking it's a bad thing. THINK. Use common sense. You guys say we need to get the elites out of power....that means we need a NWO!

              Never said anything to promote satanism; that would be the CURRENT world order. You know, the people CURRENTLY in power do that. Those people need to go. I think we can agree on that, no? Which means we need a NWO.

             The "New World Order" is actually an historical term. IT IS ALREADY HERE. It has been here since Queen Elizabeth l allowed certain merchants and nobility to invest in what would become THE BRITISH EAST INDIA COMPANY. This private corporate/monarchy union became the economic engine for the revival of the pagan ROMAN EMPIRE in THE NEW WORLD. Drug and slave trafficking was an integral part of this economy. The Illuminati Masons even gave it a Latin name: NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM ("new order of the ages.") This is prominently displayed on our $1.00 Federal Reserve Note.

              Lol! I think you're onto something! Although honestly we just need to rebrand the whole thing and get people on the same page as far as Old World Order (aka current shitty world order) and New World Order, and what they really mean. I think a shift in perspective would do this sub some good.

                  Don't rely on POTUS for anything; he's a false savior. Elites will never arrest one of their own unless it serves them, and Trump is definitely an elite. "Be the change you wish to see." Although droning him does sound like fun....hmmm....

                   You're wrong.  Elites don't communicate in the language of Patriot Americans. Trump speaks of the people.  Show me one "elite" who speaks like Trump.

                   Trump is not a savior and he isn't false.  Trump is a leader.  A very strong leader with a message that resonates with 60% of this country.  That message emboldens Patriots to rise up.

                    Trump is a billionaire, so yes, he's an elite. Capitalism is what makes elites - they get most of the money, while the rest of us struggle. Why would he get rid of a system that he benefits from? Take your blinders off.

                     There is rich and there is elite.  If your point of view is a basement apartment and leftovers in the fridge, than everyone is an elite.  Trump is not part of the Cabal. Sure he's rich.  He deserves every cent he's earned.  If you make billion dollar buildings in NYC you are going to come across the Swinesteins and Epsteins of the world.  That doesn't make one a pedo.

                      So the only requirements to be an elite in your mind are to be rich, consume adrenochrome, screw little kids, and practice cannibalism? Interesting definition.

                       In political and sociological theory, the elite (French élite, from Latin eligere) are a small group of powerful people who hold a disproportionate amount of wealth, privilege, political power, or skill in a society.

                      He definitely has a disproportionate amount of wealth and privilege. One could also argue he has a disproportionate amount of political power as well with him being president, but I could see arguments against that as well.

                       Use "elite" in the proper context.  I'm not falling into the trap of debating Latin roots and etymology.  Trump isn't part of the club.  Are you in or out?  Or are you just going to parse words all night?

                        I used a baseline definition of elites to show you that Trump is, by definition, an elite, and elites will not shit where they sleep. You cannot seriously expect him to do anything to change the status quo. You can ignore facts when they're laid out in front of you, but I'm not going to.

                         Son, I've been at this game too long to be thrown off by red herrings.  You aren't peeling anyone off from the herd.

                         Anyone with basic analytical abilities can look at the OSINT and see there is change happening.  I think you are a bit too late to the game to capitalize on the Omnibus shock.  CoE are gonna rebuild.

                          Where? I've seen the same articles as you - "massive arrests" but amazingly no names ever listed. And you believe that? Maybe it's time to consider the idea that you're gullible. Same with sealed indictments. All to appease the sheep, no proof needed. Trump is our guy, yes! Idiot.

                           I got it now....you're AWS butt buddy.  Go search "pedophile arrests".  I think you will get your answer.  More pedos arrested since POTUS has been in office than the previous 8 years under PedObama rule.

                             Try signing up for a "human trafficking" news feed.  That way you can get 5-20 articles sent to you daily providing the details of daily pedo arrests.  I'm glad you are such a critical thinker....

                              I'm not saying the articles aren't there. I'm pointing out the same thing others have pointed out - that many articles have sensationalist headlines like "1800 pedophiles arrested in massive bust" but no names are ever mentioned. Do you always blindly believe what you're told? You probably believe in Q too, don't you? Obviously I'm not the one who has issues with critical thinking.

                                Same to you and your cognitive dissonance. We can both use big words to describe bias. That doesn't change the facts that you're ignoring. There is no proof anything is happening. Stop blindly following false saviors, they'll get you nowhere.
