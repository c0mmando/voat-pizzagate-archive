<p>Stuart R. Grabois was the first prosecutor and I\'m having a hell of a time finding info on his background

btw, Vance Sr graduated Yale in 1942, went on to craft the law creating NASA, Deputy Defense Secretary, came back from &quot;retirement&quot; bc he was asked by EU to help broker a deal to settle the Bosnian conflict along with David Owen (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Owen">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Owen))</a>))

            They found the guy guilty but he's a patsy. Etan Patz murder will never be solved. I am certain he was sold to satanists in New York and he was sacrificed as part of a satanic ritual. The poor parents are happy a guy was found guilty but he's the wrong guy and he's the second guy to be found guilty. The crime will never be solved it's tragic. Very sad. The parents will suffer until their dying days.
