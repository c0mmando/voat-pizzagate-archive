<p>I find it really weird that so few people here seem to have even considered the possibility that there could be an \'elite\' pedophile ring operating in Washington, given that these type of operations among politicians and other high profile people have been exposed over and over again in various countries, including in the US in the 80s (The Franklin Scandal). Or why so few people here seem to have found it strange that the news media immediately \'debunked\' this as \'fake news,\' when fake news is an article that has been written about a completely false story and made to look like a real story. Pizzagate isn\'t that, it started with Wikileaks emails and went from there, and an enormous amount of evidence has been uncovered since then. It really isn\'t some Trump-supporting alt-right nut job conspiracy theory at all. There are people of all different political persuasions working on it. It has utterly thrown me to see the dishonesty of the media about this. For a start, no one ever claimed that a ring was being run out of Comet Ping Pong\'s basement. People were concerned by pictures shared on the instagram of this \'kid friendly\' restaurant that were disturbing, overtly sexual (e.g. naked people having sex on a pizza, two men fellating another man with a tactfully positioned pizza slice, and the prevalence of pedophile symbols&amp;slang on their social media and on nearby restaurants. </p>
<p>That\'s how it started, but it\'s nothing compared to what\'s been discovered since. Everyone reading this, just think for a moment and acknowledge that it is at least possible that there is some kind of organised pedophilia going on in the US establishment, as there was in Norway (Nov 2016) Belgium (Dutroux affair), Australia (Fiona barnet), UK(Savile, westminster) etc. Given that this is about children, shouldn\'t you at least check it out? <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Main_Page">http://pizzagate.wiki/Main_Page</a></p>

            Well written! Thank you for sharing. I think I've used up my "controversial FB post" allotment for the next few months, or I'd post this. My friends didn't even acknowledge the Ben Swann video I shared, though I have a hunch FB shadow banned it from showing in their feeds.
