           <p>
            Hi there,
           </p>
           <p>
            When a little child, I was fond of Uncle Scrooge magazine; the French one, called Picsou Magazine, because I live in Europe. With nostalgia, I bought old editions, when something attracted my attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the end of the monthly magazine, there are two pages dedicated to answer the reader's questions. Readers (kids) can send pictures, and there are always funny.
           </p>
           <p>
            The owners of the magazine display as well postal adresses of the stars of the moment, celebrities, on the same page.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other day, when reading the answers guven to the kids by the magazine, I found out that, if you read their answer on a special way, another message appear.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have not been able to decipher this stuff, because it seems very hardcore stuff. Actually, it seems to work by permuting words and / or the syllabus.
           </p>
           <p>
            The adresses of the stars at the bottom of the page contain many numbers, and it seems to be the code to decipher the answers.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            As well, by browsing the Wikileaks Macron emails, I found out a message that SEEMS to use the similar concept. It is the message 63627.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I am writing you because you are a community dedicated against the bad people hurting kids, and I found out those things.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those things are openly available, so it could have been any person finding those stuff.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe you will find other texts that use this kind of crypto stuff. Maybe there are in the Clinton emails.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I am really disgusted by the messages that lie in the answers given to the kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you!
           </p>

            The HSBC links to money laundering and James Comey. Some one needs to drop red pills on the HSBC scandal and James Comey's links to HSBC i think we've got multiple crimes here and we need to drop red pills on James Comey's time with HSBC and HSBC's links with crimes like money laundering and all the possible Clinton Foundation links to money laundering, James Comey, HSBC, and how they all connect to each other.

             I think I remember before Trump won the Presidency that James Comey and his brother worked to money launder through the HSBC by creating 1,000s of fake accounts depositing the limited $ amounts to be under the radar then pocketing it themselves.  I have looked everywhere for this youtube video but cannot find it - it was posted around August  2016 +/- by MLordandGod

            Re the 'Burma' email, is it, I wonder, a coincidence that both the Clinton Foundation and the Podesta Group show up in a country described as, "Primarily a source and transit country for human trafficking..."

            Reminder that there were no 'known pedophile code words' in the podesta emails. Also in the decades worth of emails John Podesta only ever wrote the word pizza
            <em>
             once
            </em>
            . If you believe the pizzagate theories then you have poor critical thinking skills and are a part of a witch-hunt.

              The burden of proof is on
              <em>
               you
              </em>
              to back up a claim. What claim are you making about the handkerchief email?
             </p>
             <p>
              My comment was simply pointing out that the claim made often around here when pizzagate first started was made with
              <strong>
               zero
              </strong>
              evidence. Can we agree that there are no 'known pedophile code words' in the emails or is that a claim you would like to make? If you do make that claim please back up that claim with evidence. *Also the key word is 'known'. It was widely believed here that the code words were known to the FBI. I have never seen evidence of this.

               the handkerchief email is nonsensical in the literal. That means it is code for something. Prima Facie evidence of Code
              </p>
              <p>
               what is it code for?
              </p>
              <p>
               thats something that needs to be proven in a court of Law
              </p>
              <p>
               But as a concerned citizen i can point out the vast number of associations between pizza and the sexual fetishisation of children as so publicly broadcast on Alefantis's instagram, a restaurant Podesta frequents as a regular Democrat fundraising venue 
i can point out the vast web of personal associations of Podesta and the Clintons to known and convicted paedophiles like Epstein and Hastert
i can ponder the offer of children for 'entertainment' waiting in an associates pool
i can demonstrate evidence that Podesta's taste in artwork includes cannibalism and his brothers house is RIFE with child sexualised and bondage imagery
i can show you the Madeleine Mccann identikit persons of interest with a striking similarity
              </p>
              <p>
               So if Podesta wants this all to go away, why doesnt HE come out and tell us what a pizza related map is ?
              </p>
              <p>
               the fact that he hasnt ........
              </p>
              <p>
               I have the freedom of speech to say i suspect on the availability of evidence a strong likelihood that Podesta is a paedophile. There is no burden you can place on me that takes that freedom away, and the rest is up to Law enforcement - if it is not corrupted by the paedophile network - to investigate, and if appropriate, prosecute
              </p>

                Burden of proof isn't just a legal term but is a logical concept. If I were to make the claim that
                <em>
                 you
                </em>
                were a pedophile the burden is on
                <em>
                 me
                </em>
                to provide evidence that shows that and not on you to somehow negate it. I hope it's obvious why that is the case.

               <p>
                This is poor reasoning. You say that because you do not understand then that makes it code? A code is communication whose meaning is meant to be hidden to everyone but the intended receiver. If I were to go through your comments and mark things that I didn't understand the meaning of would those examples be prima facie evidence of code? No.
               </p>
               <p>
                Let me show you why. One explanation for the 'pizza related map' is that she is simply referring to a handkerchief
                <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QkbP2Qx.jpg">
                 like this one
                </a>
                . Was she referring to a handkerchief with a pizza and map design on it? Maybe. It's difficult to say because the email is contextless. Is it appropriate to say that because you don't understand the meaning of this contextless email that it must be code? Obviously not. My explanation that she is referring to a design on the handkerchief is orders of magnitude more probable because it is more common place than coded language.
               </p>
               <p>
                And think about this, the 'pizza related map' code never appears again in the decades worth of emails. If it were code known to them and used by them why don't they ever use it again? Maybe that was a slip up and they don't usually communicate the code through emails. But if that is true it doesn't help your case to have to assume that these code words are unusual in the only evidence you have.
               </p>
               <p>
                You then go on to talk about how there is so much evidence for pizzagate. But this is a
                <em>
                 classic
                </em>
                mark of conspiracy theories. Whenever I push against a pizzagate claim people
                <em>
                 always
                </em>
                scurry away from the claim and talk about the 'mountain of evidence'. This is poor reasoning again. You are getting distracted by the
                <em>
                 amount
                </em>
                of superficial evidence to see that each individual part is shit. The evidence is so superficial and and so tenuously connected to some other piece of 'evidence' that it barely holds together as coherent. An inch deep and a mile wide applies here.
               </p>
               <p>
                And you give me all this evidence after I asked "What claim are you making about the handkerchief email?". To which your reply was simply that it was obvious that it was code. This is what I'm talking about when I say pizzagaters have poor critical thinking, and I don't mean that to be an insult but to try and shake you free of it.

                 and your second point is effectively similar
                </p>
                <p>
                 does the handkerchief email have an innocent explanation?  I dont rule it out. But I dont see Podesta taking any opportunities to explain these innocent explanations, either.
                </p>
                <p>
                 do we have a video of podesta in the act? No. So what - once again , I am not a prosecutor in a Court of Law. The standard of evidence required of ME is to only demonstrate a concern worthy of investigation
                </p>
                <p>
                 The fact that Podesta remains friendly with convicted Denis Hastert AFTER his conviction (youd think a man of public standing would distance himself from such an abhorrent criminal) combined with an email saying children will be available for his entertainment in a pool - and that lady Tamarra Luzatto being busted with a website offering nude picture of her granddaughter IS A CONCERN
                </p>
                <p>
                 a concern worthy of investigation
                </p>
                <p>
                 I dont believe the whole suite of pizzagate evidence is all accurate, salient. For example I have reason to believe the $65k hotdog email from Obama DOES have an innocent explanation

                  that would all be evidence of a crime.  But who is the 'he' in that comment? If you were to accuse a specific person then you would need
                  <em>
                   evidence
                  </em>
                  that that person did it. What ties that person to the crime?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If your point is that there is clearly a crime pizzagaters haven't shown anything like that either. You all make specific accusations of the most heinous crimes on individual people who are then harassed. That is *
                  <em>
                   totally
                  </em>
                  inappropriate. WAKE UP. STOP THIS.

                   so the claim im  making about the handkerchief email is that it MAY be related to human trafficking / paedophilia, and as there are numerous other swirling issues that similarly MAY be paedophilia related, it is a MATTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY for authorities to investigate whether there is fire behind all this smoke

             Since you have obviously taken the time to confirm this yourself to make such a hold statement, a link to your mountains of research would be nice. Also, as a good comp to test your methodology in determining this so called 'fact,' please refer to my many many previous posts and let me know EXACTLY how you are able to see that I am or am not, a black belt. When you can accurately define my status, I will listen. Until then, you are just another game player. We're here to investigate. Not play.

              No, the burden of proof is on those that make the claim. If I made the claim that you were a black belt the burden is on
              <strong>
               me
              </strong>
              to provide the evidence that shows that. Considering that we are talking about heinous crimes of child abuse the bar for evidence to make
              <em>
               any
              </em>
              kind of accusation relating to such serious accusations is obviously extremely high.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have researched the claims myself and have asked this community specifically about the code words in two separate posts
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1511391">
               [link]
              </a>
              . They came up with no evidence toward their claim and subsequently a mod erased a mention of them being 'known pedophile code words' in the executive summary.
             </p>
             <p>
              So the burden is on
              <em>
               you
              </em>
              to provide
              <em>
               me
              </em>
              with the mountains of research.

                Thank you for the reply, although I would still like to hear from the person I was asking. But the things you listed aren't evidence they are just assertions. You say "pizza related map (definitely code, likely pedo)" but where is the evidence for this claim? If you are making a claim that is as serious as child abuse you should have sufficient evidence to back that claim up. This is my problem with pizzagaters is that they jump to conclusions based on
                <em>
                 extremely
                </em>
                superficial evidence. Does the wording in that email sound suspicious to you? Then say that and leave it at that. But you say it is 'definitely code, likely pedo', where is the evidence for this then?

                 My research brought me to the memoirs of an NYPD police officer, the statements of Shia LeBouf’s dad and an undercover FBI investigation in NAMBLA. I’m sorry, I don’t have time to link these things for you here: I’m at work. I am sure that these things have been discussed on voat, which means you can use the voat search features (however, I don’t know how to use well).
                </p>
                <p>
                 The point of my comment was, that you can follow from the premise that you are reading a code... dig into similar language found elsewhere and connect the statements to a pedo subculture. You are right to be skeptical. Don’t take the anger seriously. This platform is always under attack, and everyone here is angry and frustrated about these crimes.

            This guy James Comey needs to be jailed
           </p>
           <p>
            From 2001 to 2005 there was an ongoing investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Grand Jury had been empaneled.
           </p>
           <p>
            Governments from around the world had donated to the “Charity”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet, from 2001 to 2003 none of those “Donations” to the Clinton Foundation were declared.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hmmm, now you would think that an honest investigator would be able to figure this out.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess who took over this investigation in 2002?
           </p>
           <p>
            Bet you can’t guess.
           </p>
           <p>
            No other than James “Wassup Homey” Comey.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess who was transferred in to the Internal Revenue Service to run the Tax Exemption Branch of the IRS?
           </p>
           <p>
            Your friend and mine, our favorite person in the whole world if you are a Tea Party Member, Pro-Life or a True the Vote supporter……. ding, ding, ding, ding Lois “Be on The Look Out” (BOLO) Lerner.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?
           </p>
           <p>
            It gets better, well not really, but I am sure this is all just a series of strange coincidences, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess who ran the Tax Division inside the Department of Injustice from 2001 to 2005?
           </p>
           <p>
            No other than the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Rod Rosenstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, that’s interesting, isn’t it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess who was the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation during this timeframe???
           </p>
           <p>
            I know, it’s a miracle, just a coincidence, just an anomaly in statistics and chances, Robert Mueller.
           </p>
           <p>
            What do all four casting characters have in common?
           </p>
           <p>
            They all were briefed and/or were front line investigators into the Clinton Foundation Investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that’s just a coincidence, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok, lets chalk the last one up to mere chance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let’s fast forward to 2009, shall we? James “Wassup Homey” Comey leaves the Justice Department to go and cash-in at Lockheed Martin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary Clinton is running the State Department, on her own personal email server by the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Uranium One “issue” comes to the attention of the Hildabeast.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like all good public servants do, you know looking out for America’s best interest, she decides to support the decision and approve the sale of 20% of US Uranium to no other than, the Russians.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now you would think that this is a fairly straight up deal, except it wasn’t, the People got absolutely nothing out of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, prior to the sales approval, no other than Arkansas Bill goes to Moscow, gets paid 500K for a one hour speech then meets with Vladimir Putin at his home for a few hours.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok, no big deal right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, not so fast, the FBI had a mole inside the money laundering and bribery scheme.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess who was the FBI Director during this timeframe?
           </p>
           <p>
            Yep, Robert Mueller.
           </p>
           <p>
            He even delivered a Uranium Sample to Moscow in 2009.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess who was handling that case within the Justice Department out of the US Attorney’s Office in Maryland.
           </p>
           <p>
            No other than, Rod Rosenstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess what happened to the informant?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Department of Justice placed a GAG order on him and threatened to lock him up if he spoke out about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting, huh?
           </p>
           <p>
            How does 20% of the most strategic asset of the United States of America end up in Russian hands when the FBI has an informant, a mole providing inside information to the FBI on the criminal enterprise?
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess what happened soon after the sale was approved?
           </p>
           <p>
            ~145 million dollars in “donations” made their way into the Clinton Foundation from entities directly connected to the Uranium One deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess who was still at the Internal Revenue Service working the Charitable Division?
           </p>
           <p>
            No other than, Lois “BOLO” Lerner.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting, huh?
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok, that’s all just another series of coincidences, nothing to see here, right?
           </p>
           <p>
            Let’s fast forward to 2015. Due to a series of tragic events in Benghazi and after the 9 “investigations” the House, Senate and at State Department, Trey Gowdy who was running the 10th investigation as Chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi discovers that the Hildabeast ran the State Department on a unclassified, unauthorized, outlaw personal email server.
           </p>
           <p>
            He also discovered that none of those emails had been turned over when she departed her “Public Service” as Secretary of State which was required by law.
           </p>
           <p>
            He also discovered that there was Top Secret information contained within her personally archived email.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will spare you the State Departments cover up, the nostrums they floated, the delay tactics that were employed and the outright lies that were spewed forth from the necks of the Kerry State Department, we shall leave it with this…… they did everything humanly possible to cover for the Hildabeast.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now this is amazing, guess who became FBI Director in 2013?
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess who secured 17 no bid contracts for his employer with the State Department and was rewarded with a six million dollar thank you present when he departed his employer.
           </p>
           <p>
            No other than James “Wassup Homey” Comey.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amazing how all those no-bids just went right through at State, huh?
           </p>
           <p>
            Now he is the FBI Director in charge of the “Clinton Email Investigation” after of course his FBI Investigates the Lois Lerner “Matter” at the Internal Revenue Service and exonerates her.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nope couldn’t find any crimes there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you guess what happened next?
           </p>
           <p>
            In April 2016, James “Wassup Homey” Comey drafts an exoneration letter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile the DOJ is handing out immunity deals like candy.
           </p>
           <p>
            They didn’t even convene a Grand Jury. Like a lightning bolt of statistical impossibility, like a miracle from God himself, like the true “Gangsta” Homey is, James steps out into the cameras of an awaiting press conference on July the 8th of 2016, and exonerates the Hildabeast from any wrongdoing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Can you see the pattern?
           </p>
           <p>
            I could go on, Rosenstein becomes Asst. Attorney General, Comey gets fired based upon a letter by Rosenstein, Comey leaks government information to the press, Mueller is assigned to the Russian Investigation sham by Rosenstein to provide cover for decades of malfeasance within the FBI and DOJ and the story continues.
           </p>
           <p>
            FISA Abuse, political espionage..... pick a crime, any crime, chances are...... this group and a few others did it.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the same players.
           </p>
           <p>
            All compromised and conflicted.
           </p>
           <p>
            All working fervently to NOT go to jail themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            All connected in one way or another to the Clinton's.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are like battery acid, they corrode and corrupt everything they touch.
           </p>
           <p>
            How many lives have these two destroyed?
           </p>
           <p>
            It cannot be numbered.
           </p>
           <p>
            Incest, it’s Incestuous
           </p>
           <p>
            As of this writing, the Clinton Foundation, in its 20+ years of operation of being the largest International Charity Fraud in the history of mankind, has never been audited by the Internal Revenue Service.
           </p>
           <p>
            NOTE: Not mentioned in this article is that Rosenstein's wife is a major lawyer for Clinton they specialize in fighting all FOIA request so that the public doesn't get to see the nefarious actions of their clients.

               I carefully held the mouse down, and dragged like you said, and it worked like a charm. Amazing technology. Will post it all around the web, because you gave permission to post it (all around the web).

              I'm banned from posting comments on 4chan and reddit and cant fit it all on facebook and twitter and refuse to ever use twitter and face book so you have my permission to lift and post on 4chan and reddit and try to squeeze it on face book and twitter. Just open 2 pages and carefully hold the mouse down and drag and high light it in blue or what ever color and lift and paste and you post it your self.

              you have to be my Dimitri because i am like Reznov. My injured hand means i can no longer hold my rifle. So you have to take my sniper rifle, and watch the road. Just like Call Of Duty: World At War. My ban from posting comments on reddit and 4chan means i am cut off but you can post for me. You can be my Dimitri and i can be like Reznov.

              I'm not sure how it relates to child sexual exploitation but anything to hit and attack the elite and some of the child sexual exploiters. I'm attacking the swamp any way i can the same as you pizzagator's so i am helping you all and doing gods work at the same time. But i'm going to try to attack the cabal elite NWO over some thing else that has nothing to do with child sexual exploitation. It has nothing to do with politics well it seems to to an extent. What i'm really trying to do is attack the NWO elite cabal in the wallet, the pocket book, the bank account, the source, the power, their money, wealth, and greed. Try to attack the money and wealth. You fight for the children and that's noble and effective but i want to try and hit the bastards for their greed. You protect the kids but i go after wealth, greed, and white collar criminals.
