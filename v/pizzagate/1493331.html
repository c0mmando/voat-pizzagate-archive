<p>Firstly, he tries to correct him by saying &quot;<em>they were near her face</em>&quot; (implying she wasn\'t chewing on the money) which is a BLATANT LIE, attempting to downplay or dismiss any crude or possibly sexual connotation that one could get from the image. You can click the link above to the picture, and you can see for yourself that the money is CLEARLY inside the child\'s mouth and that she is biting on it. James is being brazenly disingenuous here.</p>
<p>Then he continues to stumble on his answer &quot;<em>it was a funny, we</em>- [sounds like he was going to say &quot;weird&quot; but stopped himself], <em>it was a joke <strong><em>about me</em></strong> going to Europe and bringing euros, you know, the Jay-Z reference</em>&quot;. This is ANOTHER LIE, because if you read his comments on the Instagram picture he writes &quot;<em>#carisjames loves spending euros</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>#carisjames loves being in europe, spending euros</em>&quot;, there\'s absolutely no mention of himself going to Europe.</p>
<p>When the interviewer responds that he isn\'t aware of the Jay-Z reference, instead of simply explaining the reference, James gives a smug smirk, shrugs his shoulders and changes the subject back to the other picture of the child taped to the table. This seems like a very odd and unusual reaction to me. Why isn\'t he trying to explain what this obscure Jay-Z reference is, if indeed there is a reference and this is just a misunderstanding? What is the joke we are missing?</p>
<p>So I tried to do my own research to find out what this hidden Jay-Z reference of &quot;going to Europe and bringing euros&quot; is. Is it this 2 second cut from <a href="https://youtu.be/0O3USgkwiJA?t=52">a Jay-Z music video from 3 years prior to the post</a> where he is flicking through a stack of euros? The only other potential Jay-Z reference to euros I can find is in his Tom Ford lyrics: &quot;<em>Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass, Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass, Spent all my euros, On tuxes and weird clothes, I party with weirdoes</em>&quot;. However, this explanation makes even less sense than the video would.</p>
<p>When you look at the Instagram picture, are these the first things you think of? Actually, would they even be in the first hundred things you think of?</p>
<p>Let\'s give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that it really just was an extremely obscure joke. Why is no one laughing at the joke in the Instagram comments? Why is he not commenting to explain how the joke relates to Jay-Z (somehow)? Are all his followers massive Jay-Z fans that are all aware of this vague reference? How is it even a funny reference to begin with?</p>
<p>I\'m not a Jay-Z fan, so if I\'m missing an obvious &quot;going to europe and bringing euros&quot; or &quot;euros in your mouth&quot; reference that makes sense, please correct me, but I\'m pretty sure his entire excuse was complete bullshit because he couldn\'t muster a real, logical, innocent explanation for the picture. I think Alefantis is the weak link in the entire Pizzagate conspiracy. The fact that he lied THREE TIMES (unless someone can explain this Jay-Z reference), in one answer speaks volumes. You simply don\'t lie about these things, or try to mislead people, if you are truly innocent.</p>',

            this answer at 1:56

           stood out to me, when he tries to explain
           <a href="https://i.sli.mg/ZuVzcG.png">
            the Instagram picture of the baby chewing on money in it's mouth.
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Firstly, he tries to correct him by saying "
           <em>
            they were near her face
           </em>
           " (implying she wasn't chewing on the money) which is a BLATANT LIE, attempting to downplay or dismiss any crude or possibly sexual connotation that one could get from the image. You can click the link above to the picture, and you can see for yourself that the money is CLEARLY inside the child's mouth and that she is biting on it. James is being brazenly disingenuous here.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then he continues to stumble on his answer "
           <em>
            it was a funny, we
           </em>
           - [sounds like he was going to say "weird" but stopped himself],
           <em>
            it was a joke
            <strong>
             <em>
              about me
             </em>
            </strong>
            going to Europe and bringing euros, you know, the Jay-Z reference
           </em>
           ". This is ANOTHER LIE, because if you read his comments on the Instagram picture he writes "
           <em>
            #carisjames loves spending euros

           " and "
           <em>
            #carisjames loves being in europe, spending euros
           </em>
           ", there's absolutely no mention of himself going to Europe.
          </p>
          <p>

           So I tried to do my own research to find out what this hidden Jay-Z reference of "going to Europe and bringing euros" is. Is it this 2 second cut from
           <a href="https://youtu.be/0O3USgkwiJA?t=52">
            a Jay-Z music video from 3 years prior to the post
           </a>
           where he is flicking through a stack of euros? The only other potential Jay-Z reference to euros I can find is in his Tom Ford lyrics: "
           <em>
            Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass, Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass, Spent all my euros, On tuxes and weird clothes, I party with weirdoes
           </em>
           ". However, this explanation makes even less sense than the video would.
          </p>
          <p>
           When you look at the Instagram picture, are these the first things you think of? Actually, would they even be in the first hundred things you think of?
          </p>
          <p>

            However, the reason for my post was really trying to show that we could make &gt;200 posts about little white lies that he's told. Every single thing he says will be a lie.

            Understandable you have this reaction, but there is actually some solid leads we can all be researching, involve yourself more and you'll find out what those are.

            EXACTLY... did you see on Kelly File how he said the words "Falseeeeee eetttties"... he like couldn't say it right and it immediately became apparent that he is lying b/c when someone is guilty of something when they say the word to clear them of guilt, they are actually thinking of all the guilty acts they did so therefore he stumbled on the words that clear him of guilt.

            That interview was cringeworthy. Can't believe he agreed to go on camera, he does not come off well under pressure. It should be obvious to just about anyone that he's got something to hide.

            If you follow these links that I've already researched from #Pizzagate you will unequivocally come to the same view as other investigators that there is a MASSIVE coverup of epic proportions of a child pedophilia ring.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it for a second. Jerry Sandusky who raped numerous kids at Penn State was involved with a child advocacy group called the "Second Mile" - he was charged with 45 counts of pedophilic sexual abuse. Penn State was able to keep this a secret for DECADES!.... not 1 or 2 years.... DECADES. Just as the Catholic Church was able to keep the rape of countless boys a secret for more than 50 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyways, to my point, Jim Steyer, who is implicated in the Podesta emails has the SAME fact pattern as Jerry Sandusky.
           </p>
           <p>
            Podesta email linking Jim and John using the codeword "Walnut Sauce" which in pedohilic rings means children of color and orgy:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Go ahead and google Jim Steyer to see what his day job is:
           </p>
           <p>
            James Pearson "Jim" Steyer is an American child advocate

           </p>
           <p>
            Now follow these links from that infamous #killroom photo that Comet Pizza posted on their instagram account here:
            <a href="https://i.sli.mg/86mWlT.png">
             https://i.sli.mg/86mWlT.png
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, when you click the link above you'll see a comment from insta user "nilaylawson" and she says "Just rinse it off when you're done".
           </p>
           <p>
            If you go to her instagram account here:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BNh-8ETj85R/?taken-by=nilaylawson">
             https://www.instagram.com/p/BNh-8ETj85R/?taken-by=nilaylawson
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            You'll come upon a photo that is handwritten and it says
           </p>
           <p>
            "Three young coconuts on an ornate tray on a hardwood floor in a dark room with a Roman vase lurking in the background"
           </p>
           <p>
            At this point.... it really doesn't get any clearer as to the imagery she is describing, knowing that she is already making some sort of strangely sadistic comment on the Comet photo.
           </p>
           <p>
            They obviously use code words and not the actual word of 3 children laying on a tray, so as not to arouse suspicion... but it's obvious to any thinking person.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardless, if you're still not convinced, I've dug even further. Now if you click on a user that comments on her photo named nomunomunomunomunomu (nomu is japanese for "to drink").... you'll find this sadistic photo of a child tied, bound, and gagged in nothing but his underwear.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/whBGVxQ3m0/?taken-by=nomunomunomunomunomu">
             https://www.instagram.com/p/whBGVxQ3m0/?taken-by=nomunomunomunomunomu
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The title of the photo is "#artshow #tonight! 1912 3rd street starts at 8 featuring a bound and gagged
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/jerrysaltz">
             @jerrysaltz
            </a>
            " (1912 3rd street is a house address, sort of a strange place for an art show)
           </p>
           <p>
            If you even try to click on Jerry Saltz's instagram... good luck - it is very obvious this sick guy is a pedophilia satanic worshipper. This guy won a Pulitzer prize for his disgusting taste in art.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's all plain and open for anyone to see.
           </p>
           <p>
            P.S. The Comet Pizza owner is referenced as being "Brock's boyfriend" (yes, THE David Brock) in one email from Podesta. He is clearly a homosexual and he closes some of his emails to John Podesta with "Xoxo"... sort of strange that he writes this way to a man who is supposedly married if you ask me.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30428">
             https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/30428
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The truly strange part is that James Alefantis (Comet Pizza owner) is emailing John Podesta at 10:37 PM (a full hour after Comet is closed) on a Thursday night when the restaurant is closed and asking if he is coming over to Comet (the subject line). Why in the world would they meet after hours at the restaurant?

            The most disturbing part is how blatantly obvious they are about all of this. CPP's avatar on instagram is a bust of Antonius. Antonius is famously known to be the 14 year old male lover of Roman Emperor, Hadrian.... his favorite as a matter of fact:

           <p>
            Out of the BILLIONS and BILLIONS and literally infinite number of images, he happened to choose an image that represents what Pedos clammer and dream about!?!?!?!
           </p>
           <p>
            The image has been verified to be exactly Antonius... check out this video and fast forward to 8:20

            It's from a Kanye West song called "Gone" from the late registration album. Here is the wiki for that album:

            CTRL+F finds Jay-Z's name 13 times in it. I really think this angle is bunk. He likely just said the wrong artist. I did as well, in my original comment. I'm not a shill, check my history.

             Yeah this is what he was referring to, but the fact that he mixes up Kanye with Jay-Z and makes no reference in the Instagram post itself makes me think he's fibbing.

            I do not see the lie here. Is it because the "in the mouth" - "near the mouth" thing. Does that even matter? He depicted it from memory and was trying to make it less weird. Not a lie.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, he did not go to Europe because it is not mentioned in the comments? What logic is that?

            There's no evidence that CPP has a basement.  A different restaurant he owns called Bucks a few doors down has a basement.   Remember CPP has been an operating resturant for like 10 years, thousands of people have been in that building, customers, ex-employees, utility workers, etc.  Also it was a different restaurant in the same building for a long time.  Someone would have come forward with real evidence of a basement by now.

             The basement is a distraction by Aefantis. There were some hunches that evil activity took place in the basement...just an idea, not some foundational aspect to what we have found. Early on, I believed CPP to be the transactional site, with the activity itself being off-site (possibly down the block at places like Buck's or Bestas). It is easy for a guilty person to cast doubt by pointing to an aspect of the claims that he knows to be wrong (no basement at CPP). It does not remove all of the other findings, many of which are fact-based (instagrams, band posters, pedo-centered videos; money flows; other properties; Williamsport, PA "killroom")...

             I think it's been mostly proven that CPP does not have a basement, that being said I believe it does have a door to next door which does as well as very possibly even probably a path through to bucks and besta, which besta is proven to have a basement and bucks is rumored.

            You're not missing anything. He's a sociopath. These ridiculous lies he keeps getting caught up in reflect the ridiculous facade hes presenting. It wasn't ONE disturbing instagram. It was dozens. -Does he have a 'Jay-Z' reference for all of those?

             How many pictures did he have in his account? Do you know? Does it matter?
Let me answer it for you: it does.
            </p>
            <p>
             If these were half the pictures of the account, it would be more weird than if those were 15 besides 1000 other.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just like the other artist that people here tried to link to Pizzagate by choosing 4 sexual images, and 1 with a child on lap with sticky paper closed eyes out of literally 500 other images and even that 1 image was probably not meant to celebrate child abuse. Artists do not need to paint decorative or beautiful things. Some even say, they shouldn't.

            It's from a Kanye West song called "Gone" from the late registration album. Here is the wiki for that album:

            CTRL+F finds Jay-Z's name 13 times in it. I really think this angle is bunk. He likely just said the wrong artist. I did as well, in my original comment. I'm not a shill, check my history.

            <p>
             So I tried to do my own research to find out what this hidden Jay-Z reference of "going to Europe and bringing euros" is. Is it this 2 second cut from a Jay-Z music video from 3 years prior to the postYouTube where he is flicking through a stack of euros? The only other potential Jay-Z reference to euros I can find is in his Tom Ford lyrics: "Clap for a nigga with his rapping ass, Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping ass, Spent all my euros, On tuxes and weird clothes, I party with weirdoes". However, this explanation makes even less sense than the video would.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Does "blue magic" mean euros?  That's the name of the song. I don't get the reference either..

            True. #carisjames vs separate hashtags, is a possessive. I would be freaking out if I had a baby that a very sex explicit oriented male, was labelling as such or all over the public web.

            This child is missing, until brought forward and the parents. It is important to call out the lies, as even in the one psychology book that labels and defines, evil people.
           </p>
           <p>
            The book IS called, "People of the Lie.," They choose evil, they constantly lie, they constantly prey on doing any crime they can, they constantly cover up and work.in groups.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, media and elite are saying citizens are lying. So, it's even legal defense to the case and libel. He clearly can't keep up with all the lies and actions he did, and he is grasping as slipping, including Freudian slips.
           </p>
           <p>
            If others are not interested in the psychological components of evils that lie; plenty other threads. Things do not get solved in a box, but by free flow investigation. Investigations are not pretty and perfect, they are rough, works in progress.
           </p>
           <p>
            Solving cases does not happen by control the narrative, but by finding connections, series of events, contexts, players involved, locations, try to use law like child right cps law must investigate or is a felony each day, and catching in the act, finding potential survivers, and more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any that care of the kids is legit and is a pie  of the puzzle game hat makes senses at various times.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unity worldwide is needed and numbers do matter, to demand case investigated, safety, and outnumber. Jumping on people is red flag, sado maso tendencies in degrees, which pedo, do act like, as habit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only ones that should be bosses around and outcasted are ones that harm. Rest of civilization should be able to pop their corn, however they choose if it does not harm and intent is not I'll intended.
           </p>
           <p>
            Evils, work.in solid groups as it benefits their deviance, cover-up, provides access and networks. It's like playing a professional football team, and playing at one, I'll prepped with no unity, strategy, plans, etc. Not wise at all...and they surely do expect the masses do be as they have psych social media induced; divided and drama queens vs focused, efficient, unified.

              Are you sure about that. Is that just what Alefontitus said, or were the parents and child and Identifications proven in person and paperwork? There are also, more than one child/ infant in the photos, and those kids welfare check.is just as relevant.

               The child Caris has been identified on this board.  Not by JA.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ohter children have been identified too, but I remember the discussion of Caris.  They had updated pictures of her from the family's social media.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the larger picture, there is absolutely no missing child associated with Comet Ping Pong.
              </p>
              <p>
               This conspiracy is still in search of an actual crime.    The Madeline McCann case is a useful comparison.  When she went missing it was a giant uproar and a huge news story.  We don't have that with Comet.  We have pictures of kids on Instagram and people imagining scenarios.

                As they have been reported to cps, regardless if they adhere to law and welfare check the kids; they are legally still considered a case. That's not imaginary, that's the cps law. Fact they have not welfare checked the kids; is only daily additional felonies by cps giving unequal impunity that citizens do not get.

             I've been saying this to friends and family who I've been educating on pizzagate. The people I'm affiliated with are very much "people behavior oriented" for lack of a better term. We analyzed everything on what we know about Alefantis. He's liar. Something I also want to point out about his lies and all the lies of the Elite for that matter is that:
            </p>
            <p>
             This is what worries us all and really brings it all home. The mere fact that these people have any affiliation, any thought, even just to joke about, to give their worship to Moloch (Molech) is something that tells all of us that this is for real. Moloch is something that is NOT common knowledge. They've specifically chosen Moloch in many references that have been documented over the years. He is a god used to sacrifice Children. He's also the ONLY god in the bible that God said, "If you worship him you are to be put to death." The other false gods mentioned he only said, "Turn away from them. Stop worshiping the disgusting thing." These people have gone out of their way to choose Moloch. I've been researching the Elites following Moloch for three years. Ever since I saw Alex Jones infiltrate Bohemian Grove. Then when the Podesta e-mails were released and I saw Moloch being mentioned I knew this was all for real. To me, Moloch is the answer to all the riddles, aside from Marina and her spirit cooking which further ties it all together. This all rings true the certain text "Money is at the ROOT of all evil." I don't care what you believe here, but there is a lesson from this.  In Matthew 9:8,9 it says that Satan showed Jesus ALL the Kingdoms of the world and said to him, "All these things I will give you if you fall down and do an act of worship to me."
These Elites are the ones who control the world. And all their doing is shifting around their money and they make there money in anyway they can. War, organized crime, child trafficking. And at the root, they give their worship to Moloch. This is why that telling verse says "money is at the root of all evil." The elites have been given the kingdoms of the world and they've fallen down and done their act of worship and are continuing their act of worship.
Alefantis is affiliated with those people and he is "from his father, the Devil, and wishes to do the DESIRES of his father. That one was a murderer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of the lie."

              Yes..!!! We are our habits, which stem from thoughts. Even a building, starts with a thought. When ones get away with crimes, they become bolder. Also, the defiance prey drive of the forgone genital, or serial killers ENJOYS the attn and shock.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many serial killers have boldly sent rhymes and codes to investigators, reporters, surviving victims and families as their ego needs that attention and thrills.
             </p>
             <p>
              The more you know the prey drive prototype, and he more you can find, strategize and even promote safety for investigating and victims.
             </p>
             <p>
              Their chosen mind programs are not of the norm. Prey drive is a constant, as is self ego feeding their "needs." Lie, masks, role play, chameleon charm, give ones confusion and misleadings are some of their many ",tools of the trade."

            I immediately interpreted "they were near her face" as meaning that was the reason that she was chewing on them. Like that she hadn't been posed with money in her mouth but she just started chewing on them because kids do that and they thought it was funny so they took a picture.  I don't really see what the lie is.

             I took it this way as well. I do not think  it is a lie so much as watching the way he spins something.
            </p>
            <p>
             In two sentences you stated your explanation and it is completely reasonable. Why is he unable to do the same?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why does it turn into a Jay z thing? Why Euros? Do people set out to recreate song lyrics using babies?
            </p>
            <p>
             Cash is the dirtiest thing. Just think of how many people have touched that money and now the baby, with an immature immune system, has it in her mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit: I just remembered this. When I was in high school I had a part time job as a cashier. I worked with several girls my age at this job. Within a month, We all developed warts on our fingers. Went to my doctor and was told that the strain of HPV that causes finger warts lives on money for months. We all had them removed and some just went away on their own. Not a big deal to a teen or adult but think of what that can do to a child. Stupid thing to allow a toddler to put rancid money in their mouth. No person would allow a puppy to chew on something it shouldn' t chew on but this idiot thinks it is funny to let a kid do it?
            </p>
            <p>
             Granted kids out everythi n near them in their mouth. It is just part of being a kid but this was cleary staged for the photo and not just something the kid on her hands on. I am not a parent but I cannot tell you the amount of times I had taken things from my friend's children before they stuck it in their mouths. One thing if it is an accident or they grab something she your back is turned but it is quite another when you allow them to do it for an Instagram post. Teething rings exist for a reason.

            It's a little odd, but it might be an inside joke or something like that. He's godfather of Caris, apparently. He's a friend of her parents.

            I actually know one of her mothers former bodyguards, and he had a video out about how Tina Knowles would constantly pray to a God that he had never heard of. He mentioned Moloch several times when I talked to him about this. Those rumors about them are actually somewhat true.

            It only discredits our investigation, when talk of A-list celebrities is mentioned, what the fuck are newcomers going to think?! I do not mean to seem arrogant about this, however I am concerned about what's happening here. There are children being abused at the hands of these sicko's, but yet we're discussing absolute BULLSHIT that's already been discussed a hundred times over.

            YES he's a fucking liar, YES you're going to find various holes in his perspective of these events because HE IS lying.

           <p>
            That's the whole point of this fucking sub. Come on people. Stop posting shit. Start investigating real leads.

            I am a Jay Z fan and I got it right away TBH. That doesn't take anything away from the fact that the child is front and center, over and over again in these pictures. It's significant.

             Well, then we know you're a shill because it wasn't even a JZ quote.. Alefantis misspoke it was a Kanye West song that he was trying to refer to as a cover.  And  he totally showed what a liar he is because if this were some kind of an inside joke you would think he wouldn't get the artist wrong.  ha ha

              That's hardly a scientific analysis. It's from a Kanye West song called "Gone" from the late registration album. Here is the wiki for that album:

              The reference to the song. Sometimes when people who listen to rap are talking, myself included, they'll toss in some lyrics. It's kind of a "flow" thing. You bring up the famous rap song and it kind of lends the "flow" or goodness of that song to whatever it is you said. You also convey that you are kind of in-the-know about urban music, particularly, ideally, good urban music.

                It's not my fault you don't understand this. I'm not a shill. I just like rap and have for a very long time. Pizzagate is 100% real. This lead isn't. If you go around saying it is, you'll make us look like morons to a vast number of people who randomly belt out lyrics throughout their day. Many artsy people are like this. Go on and do whatever you want though. My response was rock solid.

               (ie, the recent past before pizzagate) are there literally zero tweets about "jayz euro"?  Are you saying that hundreds of millions of twitter users aren't "in-the-know about urban music"??

So what if you flip a couple words
I could triple that in birds
Open your mind you see the circus in the sky
I'm Ringling brothers Barnum and Bailey with the pies
No matter how you slice it I'm your motherfucking guy
Just like a B-Boy with 360 waves
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige.
Whether writers are par, whether powder the jar
Whip it around, it still comes back hard.
So easily do I w-h-i-p
My repetition with wrists will bring you kilo biggers.
I got Creole C.O. bitches 
For my niggas who slipped, became prisoners
Trees taped to the visitors
You already know what the business is
Unnecessary commissary, boy we live this shit
Niggas wanna bring the 80s back
It's okay with me, that's where they made me at
Except I don't write on the wall
I write my name in the history books, 
Hustling in the hall (hustling in the hall)
Nah, I don't spin on my head
I spin work in the pots so I can spend my bread
               </p>
               <p>
                And I'm getting it, I'm getting it
I ain't talking about it, I'm living it
I'm getting it, straight getting it
Get get get it boy

Fighting the life stay your course,

Get it boy

                It's '87 state of mind that I'm in (mind that I'm in)
In my prime, so for that time, I'm Rakim (I'm Rakim)
If it wasn't for the crime that I was in
But I wouldn't be the guy whose rhymes it is that I'm in (that I'm in)
No pain, no profit, P I repeat if you show me where the pot is (pot is)
Cherry M3's with the top back (top back)
Red and green G's all on my hat
North beach leathers, matching Gucci sweater
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain
Can't you tell that I came from the dope game
Blame Reagan for making me into a monster
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra
I ran contraband that they sponsored
Before this rhyming stuff we was in concert

Baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books
Rockstar, look, way before the bars my picture was getting took
Feds, they like wack rappers, 
Tried as they may, couldn't get me on the hook
D.A. wanna indict me
Cause fish scales in my veins like a pisces
The pyrex pot, rolled up my sleeves
Turn one into two like a Siamese
Twin when it end, I'm a stand as a man 
Never dying or admiring these
Last of a dying breed, so let the champagne pop
I partied for a while now I'm back to the block

            I never considered #carisjames was Caris and James. Assumed it was the kids name Caris James. I think his comment about spending Euros is just an explanation to mr_scott_cummings asking what? It could be Scott Cummings isn't familiar with the Euro currency. I want to know who "his" is referring to. His money. I also notice mr_scott_cummings as a new/another account in the comments called scummimgs. Its also possible comments have been deleted after JimmyComet replied to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's clearly in Germany and Alefantis owns a restaurant there. This picture isn't one that bothers me all that much. Just him and the kid again though. No parents.

             Caris is a girl called Caris Cummings. Her name is NOT Caris James. James probably comes from James Alefantis himself.

             I figured that Caris was really a boy dressed like girl and "his money" means Caris earned the money, so it's his. If you notice his/her undereyes have greenish circles, which makes me think he/she was just anally raped, it is the beginning of "panda eyes", which are the bags Caris he/she would later develope. The baby also has the coloboma iris condition which leads me to think James Alefantis fetched a premium fee pimping her out in London and probably made the trip special so royalty or elite could have access to her. And he got nicely wrapped stacks of money for the service, probably from an organized royal slush fund.

              Interesting theory that Caris is really a boy. I think its obviously Caris in the chickenlovers photo but we're meant to think chicken refers to young boys. Then that comment about it being "his money". So you could be right. George Soros also appears to have coloboma just like Maddie McCain had. Something else about eyes, when you look at photos of Caris James over time the bags under her eyes get bigger and bigger. Clearly not getting enough sleep.

               And yeah, there is another time Alefantis refered to Caris as "SheBaby" as in "SheMale" I guess.

            Well, if those two "investigators" who got the interview would have known what they were doing, they could have stopped him right there and confronted him with the child having the money in her mouth. And the Jay-Z reference was BS, but since Kanye mentioned Jay-Z and Beyonce, those two should be looked into.

             "I store the tomatoes in the basement" (2015)..."there is no basement" (currently). He is using a half-truth (maybe CPP has no basement while Buck's does) to try to discredit and redirect. The idea of a basement at CPP was never a critical element. Some thought that this might be where the crimes happen. I think that CPP was actually a transactional front (to buy/sell CP and kids), with the nasty deeds done elsewhere, including possibly right on that block. This would explain the need to have a password-protected portion of the restaurant website that showed massively-large (video) files in early investigation. This would explain the padlock on the computer room door. It also explains the changed story for the false flag...no shots fired...he fired shots into the ground...he fired shots into the locked door...he shot into the computer. That last piece was necessary to remove the evidence as the computer was the on-site smoking gun.

             Since he is not going to admit to anything, until he does, anything he says should be considered trivial. Anything but hard evidence is just potential attention, psychopaths feed off, whether positive or negative.

              Any time people talk, they reveal information. Even lies and inconsistencies reveal information. Statement analysts are trained to read between the lines and the lies and by analyzing the words people choose, down to the smallest details that seem insignificant to casual observers, and find some truths embedded within the lies.

            I think #carisjames means Caris (the girl) and James (himself). It's a little odd but I couldn't find another meaning. So maybe he went to Europe with the girl (don't know why), and let her put dirty money in her mouth so he could post in his instagram to show off to his pedo friends.
About Jay-Z, maybe he thought the others would "get" the reference, and they didn't. It's also odd.

              We have to investigate if the parents of the child went to europe with him. It's a little odd a mother would let some guy put money in the mouth of her baby to take some photo. Money is dirty and could transmit bacteria to the baby's mouth.

            Yeah it was blatant bullshit, good catch. He posted the photo and didn't comment on it at all at first, like just put it out there like here is a baby with money it's mouth, then someone
            <em>
             else
            </em>
            commented on it first (hisnameisandye) to crack a joke about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also when izzettefolger tries to joke that it is their money, jimmycomet corrects them to say "that's his money" but isn't referring to the baby, the "SHE" baby, and then ignores izzettefolger to signal two other people like "just saying" to get their attention at what he said about how it's "his" money whoever that was referring to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whole thing is incoherent and makes no sense unless it's to someone watching who knows what jimmycomet is really going on about. And looks like jimmycomet had nothing to say about it at all originally, again just put out the photo and then someone else noticed and commented, and then suddenly jimmycomet is all like oh yeah let's make it a big joke since people are noticing this.
