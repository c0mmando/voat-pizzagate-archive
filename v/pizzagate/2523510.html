<p>In 2000, The Bridgespan Group was created to work with non-profits and to facilitate pro-bono work for staff. [<a href="https://www.bridgespan.org/about-us/our-funders">Looking at their funders I would say that they are another organisation that needs further scrutiny.</a>]</p>
<p>Bain &amp; Company also maintains an in-house social impact practice, and pleaded in 2015 to invest $1 billion in pro bono consulting by 2025.[36][37] This practice is built upon different pillars, including social and economic development, climate change, education, and local community development. Organizations that Bain has supported through pro-bono work include <strong>UNHCR, the World Childhood Foundation and Teach for America.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bain &amp; Company is known for being secretive. The firm is sometimes referred to as the &quot;KGB of Consulting.&quot;</strong> Clients are given codenames. Employees must sign nondisclosure contracts, promising not to reveal client names, and are required to adhere to a &quot;code of confidentiality.&quot;</p>

             McKinsey &amp; Company Starts Its Own Version of Bain’s Bridgespan
            </strong>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The announcement that Helene Gayle, the retiring CEO of CARE, was going to be inaugural CEO of the McKinsey Social Initiative struck us as noteworthy for reasons that other press outlets really haven’t covered.
            </p>
            <p>
             Gayle is certainly an accomplished professional, having run CARE since 2006, and before that serving the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation as its director of HIV/AIDS programs.
            </p>
            <p>
             One interesting dimension of the story is the huge McKinsey operation, with $8 billion in annual sales in 2013, forming its own nonprofit consulting firm, as MSI will be. McKinsey has long had a social sector practice, at one time headed by Lynn Taliento, and many McKinsey &amp; Company alumni have had major direct impacts on the nonprofit world. Notable McKinsey alums include Luis Ubiñas, until recently the president and CEO of the Ford Foundation; Sir Ronald Cohen, the British venture capitalist who is a huge promoter of social enterprise tools and techniques such as Social Impact Bonds; Bill Drayton, the founder and chair of Ashoka; Jim Collins, author of Good to Great (and a past contributor to the pages of the Nonprofit Quarterly); Jay Coen Gilbert, co-founder of the B Lab that certifies “B Corporations”; Chelsea Clinton, most recently taking a leadership role in what is now the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation; Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the current HHS Secretary, previously a vice president of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and president and CEO of the Walmart Foundation; and economist Peter Orszag, head of OMB under President Obama and previously with the Brookings Institution.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Chronicle of Philanthropy suggests that the McKinsey Social Initiative will start life with a $70 million capital infusion from McKinsey &amp; Company plus access to 25 of its consultants to work on MSI projects and advice from 10 McKinsey partners. The Chronicle piece implied that MSI has also started off with a $15 million infusion from USAID—if that’s so, it had to have been in the works when Raj Shah, a former Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation official, was still USAID administrator—and $3.2 million from Walmart

              Yes, interesting, isn't it? What struck me as a bit odd - so the Swedish Royal Family made sure that Crown Princess Victoria would never be again be alone in a room with the guy - but the groping didn't have any other consequences?
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean, they are the Royal Family! Why not exclude him from events? He seems to have been a notorious harrasser, why didn't they care, even when a member of their own family was groped by him?
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't know, but I guess it must have been an open secret in Sweden how he (mis)behaved.

               Yes, open secret. It's ok to be a predator if you are a liberal predator. The culture/ liberal elite and the royals are the biggest hypocrites... They don't care about sexual abuse, when it's committed by their own.

               I don't often take Daily Mail articles like that at face value only.  Timing of articles can be important and sometimes I get the impression that stories are placed for very particular audiences.  The #metoo movement is mentioned as well. I also think that sometimes that movement is used to cover deeper stories.

                Remember that Princess Victoria suffered from anorexia when she was younger? She was sent to NYC for a year or so, and recovered. I'm not saying that everyone who is anorexic has experienced sexual abuse, but this came to my mind when I read that her family didn't call the guy who groped her out.
               </p>

                Makes you wonder whether she might have experienced sicker stuff when she was a teenager, by someone else.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             A skilful manager or leader will give employees something more inspiring to think about in place of fear. “When people are fearful,” Maccoby writes, “they may comply, but they don’t take the initiative. You will never drive out all fear from hierarchical organisations. People are wary of bosses who can hurt them. But by increasing fear you will squash any chance of creating a learning organisation.”

             As borders become more porous, identities more mingled and ideas more diffuse, organisations are communicating with audiences in new markets and regions. Many are politically complex, volatile, and at varying stages of development. Nevertheless, the basics of campaigning remain, whether undertaken in London, Luanda or Lahore. Here are 10 practical tips to those seeking to influence in more unconventional places..

             Our universities, the cradle of our technological and intellectual future, have become overwhelmed by Comintern-style New Age "Political Correctness." With the collapse of the Soviet Union, our campuses now represent the largest concentration of Marxist dogma in the world.

             Adorno was younger than Benjamin, and as aggressive as the older man was passive. Born Teodoro Wiesengrund-Adorno to a Corsican family, he was taught the piano at an early age by an aunt who lived with the family and had been the concert accompanist to the international opera star Adelina Patti. It was generally thought that Theodor would become a professional musician, and he studied with Bernard Sekles, Paul Hindemith's teacher. However, in 1918, while still a gymnasium student, Adorno met Siegfried Kracauer. Kracauer was part of a Kantian-Zionist salon which met at the house of Rabbi Nehemiah Nobel in Frankfurt; other members of the Nobel circle included philosopher Martin Buber, writer Franz Rosenzweig, and two students, Leo Lowenthal and Erich Fromm. Kracauer, Lowenthal, and Fromm would join the I.S.R. two decades later. Adorno engaged Kracauer to tutor him in the philosophy of Kant; Kracauer also introduced him to the writings of Lukacs and to Walter Benjamin, who was around the Nobel clique.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ultimately, five volumes were produced for this study over the course of the late 1940's; the most important was the last, The Authoritarian Personality, by Adorno, with the help of three Berkeley, California social psychologists.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the 1930's Erich Fromm had devised a questionnaire to be used to analyze German workers pychoanalytically as "authoritarian," "revolutionary" or "ambivalent." The heart of Adorno's study was, once again, Fromm's psychoanalytic scale, but with the positive end changed from a "revolutionary personality," to a "democratic personality," in order to make things more palatable for a postwar audience.

             Discussion of women's civil rights was forced into being just another "liberation cult," complete with bra-burning and other, sometimes openly Astarte-style, rituals; a review of Kate Millet's Sexual Politics (1970) and Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch (1971), demonstrates their complete reliance on Marcuse, Fromm, Reich, and other Freudian extremists.

Dan is a former member of a yoga cult who for some time has worked as a psychotherapist in New York. He is well known for the help he has given to former cult members over the years. He is also the author Traumatic Narcissism, a fine book, which is of particular use to therapists.

             Biophilia – A synopsis of the concept as presented in Erich Fromm’s ‘The Heart of Man’
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Fromm is searching for the essence of mankind, the characteristic that defines humans.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Man is confronted with the frightening conflict of being a prisoner of nature, yet being free in his thoughts; being part of nature, and yet to be as it were a freak of nature; being neither here nor there. Human self-awareness has made man a stranger in the world, separate, lonely, and frightened” (Fromm, 1964, p. 117).
            </p>
            <p>
             Fromm explores humans’ ‘Genius for Good and Evil’ and our regressive and progressive paths by investigating the dimensions of narcissism (benign-malignant), necrophilia-biophilia and incestuous ties (absent – incestuous symbiosis). In their malignant or destructive expressions, he calls these three concepts the syndrome of decay. This syndrome encompasses all tendencies directed against life and finds its expression in necrophilia, narcissism, and incest. I have always been particularly interested in his concept of biophilia. Hence, I summarised the key aspects of biophilia, as well as its opposite necrophila, below.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Interestingly, Fromm also had something to say about knowledge management: ‘Briefly then, intellectualization, quantification, abstractification, bureaucratization, and reification – the very characteristics of modern industrial society, when applied to people rather than to things, are not the principles of life but those of mechanics. People living in such systems become indifferent to life and even attracted to death‘ (Fromm, 1964, p. 59).
