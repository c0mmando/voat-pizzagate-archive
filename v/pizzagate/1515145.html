           I found a post about this on Free Republic and followed it to SFGate. More evidence that political elites are tinged with proximity to pedophilia even if not directly involved. The news report is about  Enrique Pearce, a political consultant in San Francisco, who has pleaded guilty to child pornography charges.

            Yes, and that way you can see how after decades of this, almost all layers of government, from law enforcement, to the courts, intelligence services, elected officials etc, could be infiltrated, as well as the media. And that also explains how it is covered up so well, because they all cover for each other and lie for each other and call on higher-ups to stop investigations going further. There must have been so many investigations into all this that just got stopped - the people trying to investigate get treated appallingly, lose their jobs, get discredited, moved around, threatened etc. I heard an interview with a British police detective whistleblower talking about how they do this in the UK police force - he had been investigating child prostitution in London and realised these kids were all coming from state run care homes, but he got taken off the case and when he tried to push it got threatened and then issued with disciplinary procedures etc. And he mentioned another woman at another force that the same thing had happened to.

            I wonder when it started, how long ago, and in which places. There are rumours that the royal families in Europe are involved, and the Pope. I don't know whether that's true, but my mind is totally open to everything now. I suppose it could have started within monarchies and the Catholic and Anglican churches, and then as people revolted and democracies became the norm, the monarchs that were still in place and the aristocracy just started by employing people or recommending certain people for certain positions, as they still had a lot of influence, even if they didn't have legal or legitimate power anymore. And perhaps it started from that, and has gradually made its way round the world, culminating in the last 30 years.

            This is a very good example of confirmation bias.  Our brains aren't perfect and haven't several ways of fooling us.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">
             Confirmation bias
            </a>
            is one of them.    If you research a prior belief and find more examples of exactly the thing you are looking for, it tends to confirm the belief.  But you are not looking randomly or with proportion.  For example, what percentage of pedophiles are connected with politics?  Let's say it's X%.   Is that higher or lower than the percentage of the general population involved in Politics?

             The late Maxwell Maltz (1889 - 1975), a plastic surgeon who helped pioneer 20th century self-help books genre, described something similar in his 1960 classic, Psychocybernetics.  He postulated one could use the phenomenon to attract positive things to one’s life, using the rather material example of a red sports car. You decide you want one, just thinking about it will cause you to see red sports cars everywhere… He also pointed out you attract negative things into your life in the same way.

             I’m not really certain of confirmation bias re: pedophilia among the elites and  the political class, but maybe I don‘t completely grasp the concept.. I think if I ran across a headline about rampant pedophilia in the Pinestraw Basketweavers Association, it would grab my attention.  If a headline about pedophilia in the elite/political class catches my eye, I don’t quite see how my prior acquaintance with it  is bias… When I visit Free Republic, Pizzagate is only one subject I’m attuned to (and I haven’t found a lot about it there).
            </p>
            <p>
             I’ll read the Wikipedia entry on Confirmation Bias, though. Thanks for the link. If it is something that could weaken the investigation or taint discoveries, I’d like to know more about it.

              There's an emerging body of neuroscience/psychology that is discovering we are less rational that we think we are.  Confirmation bias is a way we can fool ourselves.  It's trick our brain plays on us.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's a book called Thinking Fast/Thinking Slow that covers this.   Read the book reviews for the general gist.   We have a "gut level/instict based" level of thinking.......*What was that sound?  Tiger?  Run! *and a deeper thinking self, How many quarters are in $17.50 and $22.75?  And sometimes if we don't check ourselves, the fast thinking is running the show.

            Good first post.  Upvoats for you.  Stick to journalistic basics, like who, what, where, when, and why do I care?  Use some form of citations - APA, Chicago, Turabian, etc.  (Personally, I prefer APA).

             Lots to learn… But necessary to protect the data that’s getting disappeared elsewhere, it seems.  I did search the term “Pearce” before posting, and nothing  came up.   After posting here, I went back and read some of the news reports that appeared in the Google search index.  Apparently, this case caused quite a stir in San Francisco when it broke. Also, the name of Pearce’s lawyer, Eileen Burke, sounds faintly familiar, but maybe that’s at least partially explainable by my being an old broad and an internet junkie…  it’s not an unusual name.

            And please don't forget Lamar Alexander's 'chief of staff' no pun.....busted big time. He had such a thing going on the work computers in the senate office I asked when he had time for his senate work tax dollars pay for? Then they said he committed suicide in his parents home during the investigations.

I spoke to the FBI about some of this crap, and response was not enough money in the world to investigate it all. The recourse for citizens is not to reelect them. But they do....with the help and cover up from the media. Don't forget Deborah Jean Palfrey. ...R.I.P.

           <p>
            ST. PETERSBURG — Mayor-elect Rick Kriseman didn't look far when he added four more key appointments to his staff Thursday.
He reached back to his time in the Florida House in picking Kevin King to be his chief of staff and David Flintom to direct the mayor's action center. Both are former legislative aides.
Benjamin Kirby will be his communications director, and Jessica Eilerman will be Kriseman's small-business liaison.
King, 34, has worked closely with Kriseman for more than a decade: six years while Kriseman was on the City Council and another six when Kriseman was in the Florida House. During that time, King has been dogged by questions about his 2001 arrest stemming from accusations he propositioned a teenage girl to have sex.
           </p>
           <p>
            The case has since been expunged from court files and its outcome could not be determined.
Based on the Times' account of his arrest then, King was 22 and working as a substitute teacher for Pinellas County Schools.
           </p>
           <p>
            Investigators accused him of sending messages to two female students, ages 14 and 15, trying to get them to skip school and drink beer with him. Police said King also asked the 14-year-old to perform a sex act on him.
           </p>
           <p>
            The 14-year-old's mother found a sexual proposition in the girl's email and went to police, a report said. Neither girl actually went with King.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was charged with three felonies: one count of computer solicitation to commit a lewd and lascivious act, and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He was released from the Pinellas County Jail after posting $5,500 bail. The school district fired him a day later.
           </p>
           <p>
            On Thursday, King declined to speak about the allegations or provide copies of records, but said multiple times he was not convicted.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It was resolved favorably," said King, who is married and has a young son. "The judge decided to seal the case. I never let it define my life."
           </p>
           <p>
            He added: "I don't think this should be any concern. I've worked for taxpayers for many years."
           </p>
           <p>
            Kriseman, a defense lawyer, said King could not have had the case expunged if he was convicted of any crime. He said he is comfortable with King and never asked to see any records that King might have about the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            He stressed that taxpayers should not be concerned.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I am very excited about the quality of the people I have," he said. "I am very comfortable with Kevin."
In a statement he released about the four appointments, Kriseman said of King: "Kevin is the natural choice to lead my office, ensure cohesion and help turn my vision into action and then reality. I've seen him in action for more than a decade and trust that he'll be the effective chief of staff that a strong-mayor form of government deserves."
           </p>
           <p>
            Kriseman takes office Jan. 2. Mayor Bill Foster did not have a chief of staff position.
           </p>
           <p>
            King first started working for Kriseman in 2003 when he was running for re-election to the City Council. From 2006 to 2012, he served as Kriseman's senior legislative assistant in the Florida House, overseeing policy agenda and communications strategy.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2005, King managed Darden Rice's unsuccessful bid for a City Council seat. He also directed the Florida Democratic Party's House Victory operation in 2008.
           </p>
           <p>
            More recently, King, a 2002 graduate of the University of South Florida St. Petersburg, advised Kriseman during the mayoral race while working as a consultant to a statewide nonprofit.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the primary campaign, mayoral candidate Kathleen Ford questioned Kriseman's integrity for having King as a confidant.
           </p>
           <p>
            The issue also surfaced in 2009.
           </p>
           <p>
            King filed a police report in August 2009 after he and Kriseman received an anonymous postcard calling him a "child predator."

            Giuliani Event Aide Quits Over Sex, Theft Charges
Miami Herald 
Posted: 03/28/2008 2:44 am EDT Updated: 05/25/2011 12:15 pm EDT
           </p>
           <p>
            An organizer for a Rudy Giuliani presidential event plans to step down amid revelations of his arrests for allegedly extorting an FSU student in a sex case and his conviction for dealing in stolen state computers.
Barry S. Edwards, 45, told The Miami Herald that the charges against him were ''old news'' --- and were 'unfounded' in the student sex case -- but he nevertheless thought it would be best to withdraw from the Pinellas County Republican Party fundraiser because ``I'm not relevant and I shouldn't be the story.'' [...]
The two criminal incidents involving Edwards were unrelated, and occurred within months of each other in 1998.
According to a Florida State University arrest affidavit: Edwards was first charged after a 19-year-old FSU political science intern claimed Edwards, then an adjunct professor, plied him with beers, trolled briefly for prostitutes, watched ''heterosexual'' pornography and then exhorted him to masturbate in a game.
The intern said Edwards threatened him with bad grades if he didn't ''get into it.'' He declined to press charges. Edwards said the claims were ''lies'' but he didn't ''want to revisit it.'' Edwards was fired from FSU.

            Lobbies and corps are a big area if needed research, and nonprofits, public health care in USA and us- aid, orphans, state wards, instititutions, nursing homes, medical/pharmaceutical/psych industrial complex, food industries, and more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Guarantee, obamacare corps and entities , connect to Clinton Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            These sloppy ones are like fall guys.
           </p>
           <p>
            Following money, grants, donations, stocks, shell corps, board directors ( including conflicts of interests).
           </p>
           <p>
            Two senators to contact that are trying to get the OIG full report of the other high govt guy that was busted. Only info is he left job in May 2016.
           </p>
           <p>
            Aside: did you know that many poor/ black counties have absentee ballot politicians that keep getting in office, that do not even reside in the county. Many gentrification and corporate agendas of sports stadiums and condos. Eatonville Mayor was just found in corruption. Three major corp industries there, one a huge mental institution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mental, medical, institutions, nursing hones, drug rehabs, teen camps , juvie centers, etc are very corporate contract, board of directors, affiliated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sanford had political orgie news, right before Traybon and then it disappeared. DA, Ashton in Orange county was caught on porn websites, now brushed under covers as usual and in still in his job. He was the prosecutor for Casey Anthony.
           </p>
           <p>
            Each state has a lot of data to dig up. Each governor is on contracts with the industry corp and OIG of HHS or related OIG dept.
           </p>
           <p>
            OIG and DOJ are both oversight arms, pass the buck as crimes and violations are set up to be divided between both entities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Each state has various govt entities of oversight and rights protection that also are purposely set up in a divided infrastructure, and calls to report violations, will easily show ones that " pass the buck," systemic habit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Disability Rights is a fed funded entity in each state. It is a direct arm to the DOP.
           </p>
           <p>
            HHS, AHCA, CMS, DHShave local, stare, regional, and federal offices, than oversight is to be by OIG of HHS and other ones, PLUS, DOP, plus various stare oversights entities that also have federal offices and Oversight Member Boards.
           </p>
           <p>
            Knowing the infrastructures is key. Each entity is not just on contracts, but have long pages of laws to adhere to, job title roles, each staff has mandatory training and must sign a contract that includes to MANDATE report any violations given by recipients, citizens, and reporting peers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even lowest staff at local levels have the mandate to not just report, but fix and stop any harm and violation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet, systemic corruption is habit. All the same, goes with court systems, industrial prison complex, public school industry, everything.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet, the corruption keeps occurring. On OIG and other sites, small crimes are aggressively pursued,but not the larger ones. OIG is not even releasing the da busted for pedo porn, that two Midwest senators have been trying to access the full OIG report to no avail.
           </p>
           <p>
            OIG has been covering up Obamacare largest frauds for over eight years, including Rick Scott in Texas and FL, various states, and with Obamacare corps, such as Logisticare.
           </p>
           <p>
            Victims in any govt program can call and paper trail every related entity, to no avail. Takes years of time and costs, and its always a dead end and often filled with retaliation, denting the multi protections to citizens/ recipients in each entity. A lot of the laws and job roles, corporate mandates are on their websites, or under other Dept's and fed grant sites.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its a systemic habit, and could be a endless TV show of calls and letters to govt and corp entities, for regardless of dept or program it is same story: mind game, argue, deny, innacurate complaints, mandate report not done, complaints destroyed, pass the buck, cover up, add more violations, often intimidate/harass.
           </p>
           <p>
            Systemic govt is not set up to service and solve problems. Is a front to many shady things, and the fall guy happens, then Americana forget as all continues, escalates and more program fronts created, such as the Climate one of Obama/Podesta/many corps.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lawyer did an investigation report and wrote a book on the Climate front. A Podesta pal, sent the investigation report to Podesta as an attachment. Forget lawyers name at moment , Charles ---found he is actually on Twitter. Boy, is his investigation report and book, a gift of major accurate investigations. It's a great blueprint to see how each system, program, dept set up with corps to carry on their multi agendas of profiteer and "so much more."
           </p>
           <p>
            The more you read the laws, mandates, folliw money, corps, and all, including victims that tried to be heard, can investigate and catch fed violations on tape, that are supposed to lead to ones losing jobs, corps losing contracts, federal.prison and fines.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedogate would be weakened, by getting many in jail from their other fed violations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fbianon kept stressing the various programs in medical, food, corps, public lfare, etc and connect corps to Clinton Foundation. Next step is connect to Obamacare, Obama Foundation, every program.dept, veteran scandal and more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its a huge web, all connected by 1/3 on a triangle of network connections of people and entities.
           </p>
           <p>
            The huge web has had n ease to grow as apathy and denial, and voices ignored. Conveniently, victims of systems are not allowed legal status of whistleblower, as if victims cannot be survivor advocates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Erin Brokavich is stated to have had a hard path of advocacy, yet victims, I hired, sick, blocked med necessity, children stolen, me talk routed, arrested and such; gave it wayyyy harder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Answers are all over to dig up. Weakening the infrastructure via record and bust other fed violations is also key.

            Welcome and thanks for sharing. I'm no expert either 'round here. But you will notice folks prefer if you archive everything (the link) and then post the archived link so people don't give ad revenue or page views to various sites. Also, in case of removal.

             I don't think it's a coincidence they're being treated as one offs. No honor amongst child rapists. If it protects the cabal, they'll throw your ass on a slab and rip your heart out with a sacrificial blade and then have an orgy in your blood.

             I don't doubt this in the slightest.

              Completely agree. After seeing how many people throughout gov't have been caught and prosecuted, there's no question they're just the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Pedos are littered throughout our institutions protecting one another. Sickening.

            listing almost 50 government officials convicted of cp charges? I like to shove it in the faces of unbelievers, along with Operation Flicker. I agree, one result of pizzagate is that this is being brought to light,  and that we all see the media trying to cover it up.

             Indeed. And Pearce's case illustrates that it's not only politicians and people like the "49th most influential person in D.C." or whatever it was ... it's any of their satellites. I'm not saying any of the pol's mentioned in the article are likely guilty of possessing CP or worse ... But if a story were to break reporting that one or more of them are, it wouldn't surprise me.

              Yeah it's as though the higher-ups make sure they pull up other like-minded individuals after them on the career ladder, and surround themselves with similar sick freaks. I guess that makes sense in that it gives them fall-guys if anything does get out, and it makes it so that they are much less likely to be discovered accidentally by the people they work with, because the people they work with already know and are in on it.

               It makes me think of the shieks with their eunuchs. Castration didn't just to keep the enuchs off the women in the harem. It also limited their ambitions in general. Today, having perverts as underlings and aides accomplishes the same thing. Stay loyal, perv, and you'll get money and the "right" to indulge your twist more-or-less undisturbed. Get upitty or be disloyal, though, and get tossed aside and exposed.
