            They are a truly despicable club that has quite obviously been operating as a pedophile to get for decades.  They have links to Saville, Madeline McCanns father worked with them and which I found out yesterday was most disturbing, they also have ties to Haiti.

            "a bit of fun for the Victim"   That is so totally expected from a Narcissist.  I find it odd that quite a few have died prior to revelations.  How many and how far ahead?  If some suspected being outed they could have taken the coward's way out.  20 years is Way Too Short.  Evidently this was a ring.  The numbers and Victims are Astounding.  Historical Sexual Abuse, reminds me of Cardinal Pell.  This is HUGE.

              Oh, well, I guess the number has maybe been moved up to 500.  WTH is their idea of a Pedo Ring?  AND do they get to move the goalpost when it suits THEM?  Utterly evil beyond words.  The numbers are unbelievable. and 340 teams?  It's an Epidemic.

            Here's more detail on Celtic's seedy past.  Allegedly, even legendary Celtic manager Jock Stein was involved in covering up the abuse.

             I think paedophilia is widespread in soccer and what the media reports on are psyops to make it look like something is being done. I also think money laundering and organ trafficking ratlines use soccer as a cover. The mass migration agenda gets good PR from the game too.

            There was a football couch at my high school who invited the football boys over to his house for pizza and coke.   Everyone at school thought it was hilarious and even the boys did themselves.  The football coach was not a pedo, but it is strange how easy it would be to get close to children.   All you have to do is work near them and all these opportunities open up.   DISGUSTING!   I was thinking why is it always football coaches? But of course I know.   Anything to get close to kids.

             My phycology teacher in High School got fired for being a pedo. He was the one everyone loved yet I saw him as so fake. He would have girls sitting on his desk and always around hugging him. He would make comments like when you're old enough you guys can drink with me, he was a douche and a fake nice guy who was really sarcastic. He full out admitted he was dating an 18 year old girl and he was in his 40's. Got fired for having a relationship with a 15 year old student that everyone heard about but he was not arrested. These bastards infiltrate everything.
