<h2><em>The victim, who was called Allison to protect her identity, told The Mirror she was forced to take her child to visit her alleged abuser.</em></h2>
<h2><em>She said: “I was forced to take my child to a contact centre to see my abuser, where I had to sit across from him.</em></h2>
<h2><em>&quot;Despite the fact I’d repeatedly tried to tell police and social services what was going on, the court allowed him to see my child.</em></h2>

<p>&quot;I was told I would be held in contempt and arrested if I didn’t take him to the contact centre.”</p>

<p>Allison was targeted in the 1980s, and says police, social workers and even a GP failed to listen to her.</p>
<p>She gave birth to her child when she 15 and was forced to leave school over fears she was “setting a bad example”.</p>
<p>She fell pregnant again at 17 and had an abortion, but she does not know if the father was her original abuser or another one of the sex gang rapists.</p>
<p>The mum claims she tried to tell police about 30 times but they did not intervene.</p>
<p>The alleged abuser was never convicted of rape or any sexual offence in relation to her, but was later jailed for money laundering.</p>
<p>He sought access to the child when it was three and contact stopped when the kid was seven.</p>
<p>West Mercia Police’s Assistant Chief Constable Martin Evans told The Mirror that in Allison’s case it is understandable that it has had a “long-lasting impact” on her, but police knowledge of child sex abuse “has moved on a long way”.</p>
<p>Shropshire Council, in charge of Telford social services at the time, did not comment.</p>
<p>The victim has spoken out to back the campaign to stop men from getting access to children conceived through rape.</p>

            women do not believe in absolute truths or objective meanings of words, that's why "I believe (self-described) victims" is a slogan they'll mindlessly support.
           </p>
           <p>
            this was always a truism of Western thought, which is why feminists had to invent their own dumbshit theories:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Traditional ethics has a "male" orientated convention in which moral reasoning is viewed through a framework of rules, rights, universality, and impartiality and becomes the standard of a society. The "female" approaches to moral reasoning emphasizes relationships, responsibilities, particularity, and partiality
            </p>

            keep deflecting responsibility for your own teen-slut daughters hanging out on the streets with SHITSKINS selling their bodies, i'm sure that will help a lot.

              We see it in the streets all the time the white firls are waiting in bus stops in boob tubes and mini skirts at 7 for their paki lover boys and niggers.
The white women put them first, even before their own kids.
             </p>
             <p>
              They are the worlds biggest group of whores.
I can’t defend them, as I know they are up for it. If you tried to intervene they’d have you arrested and call you a racist. I’m surprised that they even have the audacity to cry rape. And they only do when it suits them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Billions of little white girls have been fucking pakis and niggers in primary school here this decade, and they even have more coloured kids than white kids. They ain’t white women, they’re coloureds women.
             </p>
             <p>
              They chose the coloureds over us, and enforced it on us, expecting us to pay and then even expecting us to white knight for them.
             </p>
             <p>
              I wouldn’t piss on one if it was on fire.
             </p>
             <p>
              They’ve been fulleing the pornography and the rape gangs for generations.
They are as evil as it gets.
             </p>
             <p>
              I’m ashamed of “white” women.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hey, when I go to my community Center it’s all white women and niggers, and white girls and pakis.
Not white people...
They did this to us on purpose. And they’re surprised we don’t come running when they cry wolf?
             </p>
             <p>
              Evil cunts the lot of them.
They have destroyed our country from within, and turned Britian into Pakistan and Africa. They chose the coloureds law over ours. They should be made to live by their laws not ours. They aren’t welcome here.
             </p>
             <p>
              A global sell out by white women since the 70’s
Interacial child prostitutes, that’s even what the police called them before all the bleeding hearts made them intervene.
             </p>
             <p>
              They’ve got legalised brothels all over the place, and kids in all the bus stops.
It was the white women in powers plan, it still is. They’re replacing us.
They sided with our natural enemies
             </p>
             <p>
              No other races women do this to such an extent.
             </p>
             <p>
              Even the young white girls kill white boys nowadays and don’t even get punished for it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Evil cunts the lot of them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sorry, speaking from experience.
I won’t buy the bullshit. They’ve destroyed so many communities and places here for they’re evil gain.
