<p>Remember when parents didn’t think it was a good idea for their children to see other naked adults? Yeah, that was back when people were close-minded and homophobic. Now, Pride events across the country feature simulated sex acts, public nudity, and a wide variety of other weird fetishes—and Canada’s public broadcaster, funded by the taxpayers, published a helpful list of tips for for parents taking their kids  to the outdoor strip show.</p>
<p>For example, the CBC finds it important that parents “be open-minded.” After all, some kids might find it initially weird:</p>
<p>Your kids will probably see boobs and penises. There will bodies of all shapes, sizes and in all states of undress. For parents like Ian Duncan, dad to 3-year-old Carson, this is all part of the appeal. “We’re not body shamers,” he says. “It all feeds into my son’s emotional intelligence and sexual development. And it’s never too early to think about that.” Consider the experience as a great opportunity for some interesting discussion. Explain what you’re seeing, and be ready for questions.</p>
<p>You read that correctly. Our public broadcaster thinks that children under the age of five seeing drag queens waving their genitals is “a great opportunity for some interesting discussion.” Some parents are apparently concerned with the sexual development of their three-year-olds, which they have concluded will be furthered by being exposed to adult men simulating sex with each other in bondage gear. Somehow, public acts of gross indecency that would have once been condemned across the board by people of every political persuasion are now something you should consider taking your kids to:</p>
<p>Julie and Angela Burnett are mums to two busy boys under two — almost 2-year-old Liam and 4-month-old Ben — and they live about an hour’s drive from the city. “Despite the effort of loading up the car with baby and toddler essentials, we always attend because it instills a sense of pride in our children and our family as a whole,” they say. “I want our boys to broaden their sense of what a family is and to be reassured that ours is just as special and important as all the other types of families they see. Pride gives them that.” After all, whether your family is part of the LGBT community or not, who doesn’t want to raise children that grow up to be thoughtful and open-minded allies? Happy Pride!</p>
<p>Just to recap: Canada’s public broadcaster, which is funded by the taxpayers, is advising parents to take their children to an event where they admit the children will see the genitals of adult men. For some reason, this is not considered child abuse, and is not considered creepy. Rather, the penises of Gay Pride revelers are now supposed to be interesting discussion opportunities for little kids who need to be sexually developed and open-minded.</p>

<p>Normalizing naked gay people in front of kids is child abuse in my opinion.  Pizzagate related? Of course it is, if you can\'t see that more and more pedophiles are destroying our countries and ruining the innocence of little kids than your a hard hearted immoral pervert who will be judged along with the pedos and pervs.</p>',

            CBC is crap. I have listened to it everyday while working until i had enough. They had on this program where they tell kids written stories of gay sex of harry potter characters and the host or talking head had no issues with it instead making it sound accetable and happy like the gay pride stuff. I am watching people on fb not paying attention other then sports or bathroom selfies or anti trump stuff. Its all zombie like minds hording the planet decouring the minds and innocence of our future. We have to fight now. We have to rise. The thing is when i do, rainbow bending over trudau passed a law called bill 89 that enforces the protection of equity rights of gays and that the govt can take away your children for homophobe stuff. Im aboriginal and seeing what is going on accelerating we are headed to hell. The image looks happy and colourful yet in the inside its shit. People cannot see what i see and i am always talking about it even on fb. Only few likes vs someone post about who takes picture of their breakfast and how they burnt thier thumb cooking. The world is getting dumb and as a father im gonna fight for whats right and continue the front lines of fighting pedos. To all you true voaters be aware of the mods and know the people is the only way. Not those reigning above as they like to be your masters. Power to the people.

            It's just so wrong.  I'm old enough to have lived through the beginning decades of pride.  First, it was an obscure event.  Then it gained traction with more recognition and acknowledgements, no big deal. Now, it's a bloody ideological gong show infiltrated by debauchery and perversions that were once suppressed among their ilk. Combined with an anti-white movement espousing radical demands (BLM), the lbgt crowd has morphed from an innocuous, harmless civil rights movement to full blown, extreme radical left. child grooming , social engineering program. It has gotten way out of hand and at this time it would be prudent to enact some new "laws" or regulations surrounding pride festivals in my opinion.   Dress code, or age restriction. Their pick.

            So the propaganda went to all the trouble of "explaining" to us dummies that homosexuality is not the same as pedophilia and now the disinfo truck is easing back into the Entitlement Homosexuals Reserve the Right to be Pedophiles lane. Seriously, what adult man thinks it's a good idea to expose their genitals in public? Oh, yeah, exhibitionists who used to go to jail when they flashed their junk. Now? They're normal and you have to normalize aberrant behavior to your kid because gays are so out of control that they can't keep their clothes on? How is attaining equal rights equivalent to breaking the law and establishing a new set of standards for deviants who expose themselves to children?

            Nudity isn't inherently immoral.  In many cultures throughout history in warm climates people simply wore less clothing.  But this is disgusting.

             Agreed, but this is just super gay and stupid. Gay pride events aren't about gay pride, they're about shoving depraved faggotness in your face. I have white pride but you don't see us putting on a parade.

             Yeah and go find acceptance somewhere else we don't support grown ass men and woman waving there genitalia and involving children in sexual matters here. This is not an LGBTQ or straight or race or gender issue this is a fucking nightmare issue of people involving kids in their fucked up fantasies.

            That is DISGUSTING!!  I would say, "Thank God I don't live in Canada," but I know that ultimately it will make no difference where one lives since this is a GLOBAL agenda.

            Normalization of pedophilia IS and WAS the endgame for this homo /Rainbow / gay bullcrap that has been and is being shoved down our throats.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember how upset I was when I first heard about GAY "COUPLES" adopting children.  "They'll abuse them!" was the first thing that came to mind.  It turns out I was correct.
           </p>
           <p>
            My prediction:  Some lefty wacko women will come forward and publicly state that, as mothers, they endorse lowering the age of consent because it's "good" for children!  Mark my words; it will happen.  They will also trot out homo/paid shrinks waving "studies" around (a la Kinsey) for the "scientific" support.  And, who will argue with mothers and professionals?!  I will, for one.

             Women, at ~52% of population in many places and naive in all places, are the most useful of idiots, and thats why when we take control they will never vote again.  As for the Jewish pedo supporters of state media, well, we have precedent for how to deal with them.  ONLY A MATTER OF TIME THATS WHY THEY BUYING PROPERTIES IN N.Z. AND HURRYING THE RACE WAR /MARKET CRASH
