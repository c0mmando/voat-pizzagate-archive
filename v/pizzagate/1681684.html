            Ah, so that makes my theory that he is nothing but an actor even more solid. Even his voice is an act. It literally sounds like someone trying out for a part playing a demon. I've never heard real people talk like that, but i've certainly heard that in movies portraying demons.
           </p>
           <p>
            And guess what - he never actually even claims he is being sued.

            This is complete BS. JA is not sueing AJ. He is trying to save his pussy ass because people like me have been trolling him on twitter for defending this perverts ass saying CPP is a distraction and Alefantis an innocent pizza man. I sent him about 15 tweets about JA personally just before he came out with this lame video. So have others. For some reason he can talk about Podesta but not JA. Think he may have threatened him and /or his family. I have lost complete respect for AJ after listening to him for 11 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you people really believe JA would risk having the light shine on his ass by a lawsuit? Hell now!! Esp. since I believe he could be CIA operative. AJ is full of shat. He was never on top of pizzagate and it got away without him. Now he is trying to make excuses for his ignorance on the topic by saying he is being sued. So now he does not have to discuss it.

            Alex Jones is part of the club. He is promoted on establishment news sites like Google News. He is cointelpro, a gatekeeper and has long been exposed as a half truther. The longer you folks continue to think he is part of the truth movement, and the longer you latch on to these controlled personalities like Jones And Milo, the more it shows you don't know what is going on. They are trying to scare people away from publishing anything on PG. So they are using their disinfo stooges like Jones, Milo and Seaman to go silent and persuade you that you are in danger of a lawsuit as well if you don't desist. This stuff is obvious. Stop respecting Jones for your own sake. Can you not see he is acting out a character? His acting is so over the top bad it shocks me that people find him appealing.

             Exactly. I believe this investigation is terrifying to the ruling class. There's a ton of momentum behind it and it's uncontrolled.  They are trying to derail it in every way they know how. "Circle the wagon" and all the bullshit. F*ck that! Stay the course.

            I think Alex was next on the hit list.  Flynn, Milo, Natural News, PewDiePie Jones, they want Bannon and Breitbart as well.   Globalists are PISSED!  We see behind the Oz curtain. We see your flying monkeys.

            I read recently that the Natural News owner is corrupt. I'm for organic stuff and don't use meds or junk foods etc, but I know there are misinformed and crooked people in the organic movement too.

            Any detail on what the exact allegation of the suit is? It'd be pretty stupid for it to be defamation of character.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then again, there was that bogus "menu" document they ran with. That was a pretty hard derp. I remember someone posting that on /pol/ the day that anons crashed the website of another pizza place called We, The Pizza. The fact that the site actually went down after anons started poking around created a bit of hype. Later, someone posted that image saying that they had gotten into a secret section of We, The Pizza's website, where they found that document. Suddenly, InfoWars trots it out saying that it may have come from CPP's website. Cue Joe Biggs' exit. That's to the best of my recollection, anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thinking about the way that all happened, it kind of makes me wonder. It'd be a pretty good little sabotage move: Give people exactly the kind of thing they wanted to find and fast-track it to an outlet you want to discredit. Or sue.

            One thing that has bothered me a bit about Alex Jones discussing pizzagate is that he keeps saying that the Luzzato email says that the kids will be "in the hot tub" when clearly the only thing mentioned is the pool. He even says in this video, if I'm not mistaken, that the email says the pool is closed but the hot tub will be open. I've heard of no such email. As far as I know, there is no mention of any hot tub in the Luzzato chain. So why does he keep referring to the children being in a "hot tub"?

             Yeah I noticed that too.  No it said they would be heating the pool.  Nothing about a hot tub.  Alex really dances around everything getting some details wrong.  Dear Whitehats PLEASE it's time help us!  We need arrests.

              It's like fingernails across a chalkboard every time he says that. A pool is a pool, and a pool doesn't have the sexual connotations that a hot tub does. That whole email about the Luzzatto children is strange, troubling, and disturbing when accurately described, which includes no mention of any hot tub.

               Psalm100 - Wow! This comment of yours is eerily similar to a comment I left earlier today to the same video on YouTube. The comment is as follows:
              </p>
              <p>
               "Alex is woefully under-informed and/or misinformed about nearly all of the elements of the Pizzagate investigation. Including the very important fact that Pizzagate includes, but is not limited to, Comet Ping Pong and James Elefantis. This is a crucial distinction. And every time Alex equates the entirety of Pizzagate solely with Comet Ping Pong it's like nails on a chalkboard to me. This is a monstrous distortion of facts and, in fact, Alex distorts all of the elements of this case. For instance his overly lascivious and erroneous recounting of the Obama $65k in "hot dogs and pizza" e-mail...and to a slightly lesser degree the disgusting "kids in the pool" e-mail."

            I can see only two reasonable expectations of outcome:

           <p>
            1) Alefantis sues because he/his masters know the courts are 100% in their pocket.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Alefantis sues because his masters are throwing him to the wolves and they know he will get butchered in discovery.

            Holy Disinfo Agent. This is nothing but him trying to cover his butt.
           </p>
           <p>
            At 10:55 he calls himself "the good person" because he's telling everyone Comet/Alefantis is a diversion, that we should be looking elsewhere like New York. He insinuates that the rest of us who've said bad things about the DC crowd mentioned in the Wikileaks are trying to hurt innnocent people.

              If you listen to Alex Jones long enough you will notice he sometimes lets little tidbits like this slip out for some reason. In my opinion he is controlled oppoision. That being said his show and site can dish out some good news and information you just need to be aware alex exagerates A LOT and is most likely controlled working for an agency with an agenda.

               The whole thing about a limited hangout, is the limited part - they have to produce 90% truth for the op to work. But i don't see that as a reason to support them. those truths are found elsewhere, without the need to self-censor much of what you're hearing.

             He pretty much tried to divert attention away from James Alefantis and CPP since the beginning, which made me fishy about Alex jones, and now he's being sued by James Alefantis? I feel even more fishy about both of them now.

              He didn't actually say he was being sued, did he? He didn't show the lawsuit. It didn't happen. This is a psyop to scare us all away from the DC pedos.

              If he actually cared, he would let JA sue and then he'd file for Discovery, getting any info he wants on JA. That seems to stick out as the most evident to me that something's amiss.

                I know!! Why are people refusing to hear this?? He is defending and protecting what is surely a very dangerous man!! A man that has threatened a youtube and his family lives and likely raped a former employee. And heaven knows what else he has done. Why is he doing this?? It makes no fucking sense?? Unless he has been compromised or is literally fighting for his life and being instructed on what to say. Which is interesting because in that last video he was rarely looking at us in the eyes and his body language was fidgety. Not like him at all. I just want to know what is going on. I do no accept anything at face value. Life has shown me this lesson the hard way.

                 At the end of the day, whatever the reason is, we have enough evidence to stay FAR away from him especially when it comes to pizzagate. If he wants to lie just to save his ass, let him, but don't give him an ounce of support or refer to him as anything but a disinfo agent.

            What I don't like is how he is saying that he took down his pizzagate videos because, quoting him, 'these are not 100% provable' and 'Because I can't prove it....'
           </p>
           <p>
            Start at about 3:30 and he says this around 4:20
           </p>
           <p>
            The question is how much of the stuff he regularly claims is provable? He presents this like what he reports is always 'provable' and that is dishonest to me.

             In his defense, Alex was talking about videos posted by some of his other reporters (ie, his employees).  So Alex is saying that he forced his employees to remove those videos that they had posted.

            panicroom, I second your suggestion that he "go for broke".  He has nothing to lose if they have already cut off his advertising capabilities and are suing him.  He should broadcast everything he's got and blow the whole thing out of the ballpark.  He can absolutely make this work for him and come out a hero in the history books.

            I feel sorry for Alex. He was VERY measured when discussing the creepy emails and pictures.  Getting sued is no fun but to me it shows how guilty the whole lot of them are!  I am proud of everyone's work here!  Those depositions should be fun..."And by chickenlover and hotard you meant what Mr Alefantis?"

            Attention James Alefantis, bad bluff. Now if you don't see this lawsuit through you're obviously guilty. Let's get the show going, drag out all the dirt. Will the CIA come classify your court case for you like they did with the Finders? Do you think that will work again? With all these eyes on you and your deep state buddies? Funny you let Skippy cuck you like that.

              The parallels between Alefantis and Dutroux are pretty striking, when viewed in context.

              They had charges against  Jared Foggle in record time. What is the hold up? At least search warrants could have been issued to seize everybodies computers. Now it is too late. You really think the criminal FBI will arrest anybody meaningful when the FBI itself can be traced to the ring? You all need this dissapointment to realize that democracy and justice in America are an illusion. The vile criminals control the country and the media and they do not arrest themselves. Period. Trump seems like he is one of them from where I am sitting. No arrest and most his staff are zionist, bankers, neocons and 9/11 truth deniers. Nuff said.

               I've been saying similar things, despite being originally on trumps side. But of course all the Trump MAGA fans come and downvote because it doesn't fit the narrative of how much they like trump right now. We should hold anyone and everyone accountable no matter who it is especially if they have power. I highly doubt any high level arrests will be made. I want to be wrong so bad.

            He was sort of mumbling and vague, I couldn't figure out if that folder contained documents from an official lawsuit or what. If it's true it's good news, as it will help expose them, but can you note where in the video he says the folder has a letter from Alefantis regarding a lawsuit being filed? Thanks!!

            It's an hour video - any way you could give us the TL;DR and point to a certain spot in the video? Why is he being sued? Does he show the official document? What did James say? And what does he expose about pizzagate in general? Anything new? Is Comet still innocent in his view?
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks so much if you can fill us in (I can't stand his voice for even a second, sorry).

             The first 20 minutes of the video is where Alex goes over the fact that he is being sued.  The last 40 minutes are a general coverage of issues surrounding Pizzagate, and he focuses most of his time discussing John Podesta's recent television interview. .  He doesn't give all the details of the letter, and I don't think he shows it.  But Alex does talk agbout being sued and that Alefantis sent him a letter, and that Alefantis claims that Alex has "caused him damages".

              Thank you. So he doesn't show the papers, or say who is suing or why he's being sued. He may have eluded to Alefantis suing him if we are to connect dots, however he's has exclipicity said he believes Alefantis and comet to be innocent victims of the government, which he said could have planted stuff online to make him look guilty. So Alex is probably someone James is happy with. If the powers that be decided to scare all of us from speaking out, they might pull this little psyop together. If Alex remains this vague about the suit I wil suspect shenanigans.

              I'm still not sure why anyone is impressed with his pizzagate reporting either. What has he revealed besides disinfo?
             </p>
             <p>
              Just some observations I think are important given his huge online reach coupled with his ties to CIA and Stratfor.

               funny to me that he brings up this suit when I trolled him like an OCD lunatic on twitter the night before. Telling him he should be ashamed of himself for defending this pervert. And sent him tons of info about JA he likely never saw before. He is trying to cover his pussy ass now. I don't believe any of it. Why would JA sue him if all he has ever said from the very start is that he is an innocent pizza man? To risky for JA to sue .

               Now that I've listened to Alex a few times in this video, I think it's possible that he isn't being sued YET, but that Alefantis (and maybe his lawyers) basically contacted Alex saying that if he does not cease and desist in covering certain items, that they will sue him.

                 I've been saying it all along:  An alleged piece of paper in a manilla folder and "Alex says" is NOT evidence.  Yet that doesn't stop folks from reacting and jumping onto the "JA is suing AJ" (mirrored initials, hmmm) bandwagon.

              If JA has to prove Alex caused him damages, Alex is golden. How can JA possibly do this? There was a barrage of stories, so how to separate what caused damages? And in the middle of the barrage was what JA did in posting strange pics and captioning them with vulgar, pedo-coded jargon. #killroom and #chickenlover are supposed to be good captions for a restauranteur to post? They're not going to draw negative criticism from everyone who sees them? Seems JA and his friends did more damage to themselves by acting like insensitive, malicious apes that thrive on making very rude jokes about babies.

            I like Alex Jones and his show.  I actually stopped watching him as regularly because he STOPPED talking about PizzaGate.  He has nothing to do with inflaming the scandal.  It burned without him.  They just want to shut him up because his show is watched by more people than watch CNN or read the NYTimes.  Give me a break!  Alex, if you're reading this, make this lawsuit work for you.

              You need to watch his Joe Rogan interview.  He made his case very well.  He may exaggerate on his show, but so does the MSM against conservatives and if race or liberal women or gays are involved.  What's good for the goose...

              That's what I think.  If he gave advance notice of an entire show devoted to exposes of higher up politicians, I'd be waiting with bells on, glued to my screen, eating Cheetos.

             In the video, Alex says he thinks that his recent interview with Joe Rogan is what caused "them" to go after him.  Supposedly, his interview with Joe Rogan (last month, where they discussed Pizzagate) was the most viewed podcast in history.

              Joe Rogen is a fake as well. These guys are part of the corporate media. This is all staged drama. See how Alex makes it about him and not the case? Remind you of somebody else? Rogen insults people that think Sandy Hook was staged. Rogen is a moron.

              So good I watched it twice. Never thought AJ could act or be so personable.

              I lost my shit when JR brought up the "AJ is Bill Hicks" conspiracy because that is my favorite ridiculous conspiracy, I am a huge Bill Hicks fan.

              I'm still on the fence about AJ being COINTELPRO limited-hangout type operation because of the Tavistock and Time Warner connections, but I genuinely enjoyed that podcast with him. I hope they have him on there again.

               I always thought that was a joke because anyone who believes it would have to be the dumbest person alive. There are pictures of Jones in the gym in his early twenties, and he could not look any less like Hicks if he tried.

               I watched most of Alex's interview with Joe Rogan.  I agree that it was highly entertaining, as well as some interesting substantive information covered.  What was significant about the interivew, and why the "powers that be" are threatened is because of the HUGE audience (40-50+ million downloads), and the fact that Alex is exposing Pizzagate to a more "mainstream" audience (Joe Rogan's fans).
              </p>
              <p>
               I've listened to Alex for over 10 years.  I firmly believe that Alex is controlled opposition, mainly due to his obfuscation of the fact that elite JEWS lead the globalist-NWO agenda.  That said, Alex provides good information on around 98% of the news items he covers.  I keep listening to him for the fact his show is the best I can find for a daily political news show.  He has great guests on his show, and provides top notch analysis on politics and world news.  And he is just highly entertaining, and can be very funny and even inspirational.  He dishes out a lot of good information, but with deception in some key areas.

                In other words, if he doesn't adhere to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, that old long-debunked hate screed used by every Jew-hater for the last century, he's controlled opposition?

                 Another point I think people should consider when the topic of globalist = Jew or eugenic ideas of white supremacy.... Is how the main reason a certain category of human comes to be in certain situations due to external factors rather than inherent biological differences. So a higher percentage of Jewish descent are involved in cabal activity because of the timing of world developments and location. Maybe they had slightly higher percentages of 'will to power' originally but that crediting their ethnicity as the cause of their control isn't accurate and creates an easy straw man for them to defend. Also factor of this system of control having 'selected breeding' or whatever you want to call that as well. Just an idea. I feel like it's true heh

                  Jews help themselves, and other jews. So if their dumb cousin wanted a job in the bank, and you wanted said job too, but you were more qualified, who'd get it? 
Its the same for moslems, they help their own like a good tribal group is supposed to.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  People always say only jews were allowed to be bankers, but what about the Knights Templars? Largest wealth in the world (we think) but they were attacked by other christians for that wealth, or secret shit was going down because wealthly want power. Who knows, but jews stick to their own, and will screw over anyone to get it.
                 </p>

                  Its tribal. Also greed

             Whoah!  Thanks very much.  At 7:10 in video, this guy (webmaster of NaturalNews.com) says that around 4-5 days before Google acted to de-list his website, he was contacted (by someone he says is connected to the "Deep State") and threatened to "take out Alex Jones" or else he would be destroyed.

             Wow. The purge of free speech is underway. Matt Drudge went on InfoWars a year ago and warned it was about to happen. Worth searching that interview, it's very powerful. The Elites have decided to go all in. There will be a Great Distraction coming up they will use to push their agenda while we are all focused elsewhere. Could be war. Could be a 9/11 mass casualty false flag. But something is coming.

              My guess is this;
Partial Alien disclosure, accompanied by an improved &amp; very sophisticated version of Project Blue Beam, ground zero being Antarctica. Too many holes in the dyke now, the leak is quickly becoming a flood, this will be their Hail Mary, and they hope the distance and relative inaccessibility of that continent will prevent prying eyes to see and disclose what is
              <em>

              going on down there. This will happen sooner than later if we keep the spotlight on the enemy.

               ATS is going nuts over some supposed alien pic on 4chan, and that 4chan is being slid because of it. i cant post on ATS otherwise i would let them know that is more than likely a huuuge distraction over the podestas being related.
