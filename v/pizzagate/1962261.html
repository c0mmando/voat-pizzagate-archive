            Seth Rich trained with the Israeli military (likely Intelligence) when he was a HS senior. How many American HS students have done that?
           </p>
           <p>
            Seth Rich also worked for a "non-religious" organization which encouraged support and (illegal) settlement of Israel.
           </p>
           <p>
            When will we see the death certificate? the autopsy report? video of any kind? interview with ME or attending physicians? real evidence of any kind?
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it: everything we know about the alleged "murder" is an MSM story, or "anon" sources.
           </p>
           <p>
            When will his family grieve him at least as much a family pet? When will his brother cease his duping delight?
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's recall the duplicity of the Orlando hospital, where Norman Casiano was allegedly admitted after allegedly being shot in the back four times with a sig sauer mcx and required no surgery whatsoever. The very next day he was giving multiple interviews on MSM saying that bullets went right through him and didn't damage any internal organs. Yet, people believe that this event (Pulse nightclub) was real.

            All I am saying here, is that if we are to be seriously investigating the purported death of Seth Rich, then where is any evidence of real death?

             I share your suspicions about Seth Rich murder being a Mossad school play. My question is: why fake an HRC hit? She already has conducted many hits, right? I don't see what the motivation would be?

              It's distraction, as usual. Look at all the lame VOAT posts about it--with info all form MSM or their minions. They know people ar figuring out their "conspiracies" so they give them a fake one to chew on, so they will ignore what is really happening that is of importance in the world. If you have ever seen the movie "They Live" you have seen the revelation of the method. That film was made in 1988 and shows what (((they))) are up to:

             <p>
              For what awaits us, the film "In the Shadow of Hermes" is instructive:

               Your best working theory is that Mossad invented the Seth Rich murder to distract Trump supporters with a fake conspiracy theory?
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                This seems way too complicated to be worth the hassle.
               </li>
               <li>
                The operation actually helped Trump, not vice versa, because it fueled the "Hillary is evil" narrative and did nothing to help her. If you're trying to distract someone from Hillary's real crimes, then making her look like a real criminal doesn't help much - either way she looks evil.
               </li>
               <li>
                In general, the theory does not make sense.
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               Keep in mind, I actually think that the Seth Rich murder probably was a fake Mossad haox. I just don't know why they did it. I suspect that you don't really know either.

                If you look into their operations, starting with Operation Mockingbird, you will have some idea of what I mean. It really is the matrix we are talking about here.

                Nothing about Seth Rich has led to any conviction of Hillary for anything let alone human trafficking. Hillary, Trump, etc. is all for show and they are not at all those who are in control.

                 I mentioned Trump supporters because those are the people who are interested in the Seth Rich murder (mostly), and you said that the murder was faked to distract people (presumably Trump supporters). Honestly, feel free to flesh out your theory (with specifics) because right now it doesn't make much sense to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm well aware of Operation Mockingbird and other CIA abominations, such as MK Ultra and the Phoenix Program. All of those programs typically involved an obvious motive (Air America: make money from heroin sales; Operation Mockingbird: distort the MSM in your favor; Phoenix Program: subvert Vietnamese resistance and explore mind control programs and torture). Partially or entirely faking Sandy Hook and Boston Marathon make sense because they scare up gun control legislation and erosion of system liberties, even testing their limits. There is no obvious reason why they would fake Seth Rich's murder. If you think it was done to distract from other things, then you should flesh out what you think those other things are, and how the distraction worked in a way that didn't involve more trouble/risk than it was worth.

The WH visit was their first date.

             <p>
              "He even had eyes on the ultimate D.C. prize: the White House, a place he took his girlfriend, Kelsey Mulka, on their first date.

              "I said half-jokingly, 'I want to live there,' and he just turned to me and said 'No, you will live there,' and that's just who he was," said Mulka."

             Nice catch! How has this not been caught or mentioned? That is a private meeting in the East Wing with his girlfriend Kelsey who was allegedly on the phone with him. This is the same location the bar manager of Lou's City Bar  (Joe Capone) was at in the Whitehouse four days before Seth's death.

            If that was a "botched assassination," I doubt the Clinton cabal is behind.  They've been offing people for decades and have it down pat.  They hire pros, not amateurs.  See Larry Nichols.

              Nah, they are just prepping him for the big one.  When they take him out with the big heart attack, they will all chime in he had heart-related issues.

               You don't think that they hoped to get him the first time?
              </p>
              <p>
               I would think he'd be paranoid. He was in a mental hospital at one point years ago. He was paranoid and thought people were after him. The democrats said several months ago that he was getting on their nerves and not helping them. They didn't want his help. He didn't get the point. You'd think that he would have gotten the hint by now.

             Exactly, if they wanted Seth dead, he'd be dead. Too many things don't add up. I sure hope he is in witness protection, checking Voat &amp; YT once in a while so he knows how many folks care!

                  He wasn't being sarcastic, that dude is a legit RETARD.  I don't remember many posters names but if his sticks out it's definitely not for brilliance.

             I think it was just a 4th of July party. I read that the event was canceled, which makes sense now that the Seth Rich WH log shows canceled. Still interesting that he was invited though.
