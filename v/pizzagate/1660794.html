If you go to <a href="http://www.room23thebook.com">the official website</a> and click gallery you can see pictures from the book. Photographed by L.A.-based photographer Deborah Anderson and produced by Diana Jenkins, proceeds go to the Sanela Diana Jenkins Human Rights Project at the UCLA. The photographs are of famous Hollywood celebrities in sexual poses with provocative subtitles underneath. Some of them are with dogs or in fetish situations.</p>
<p>I first heard about the rumors surrounding Diana Jenkins after reading this article:
<a href="http://jezebel.com/5892565/is-robert-downey-jr-spreading-insider-celeb-gossip-on-blogs">Is a Secret Celebrity Tattletale Actually Robert Downey Jr.?</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a FORMER personal &quot;friend&quot; of a woman named Diana Jenkins. Doubt you know her, but she\'s the Rosetta Stone of every scandal and perversion from Hwood all over the globe. She\'s an Uber-wealthy divorcee whose hubby ran UK\'s Barclay\'s bank - and she ran the Arab investors for the bank! She\'s been running a high class call girl/party-girl ring for Arabs, Wall Street, DC, Royals, and Hollywood elites. She\'s also a MAJOR philanthropist, arts supporter, political donor, and social hostess to EVERYONE. Her best Hwood pals include Sean Penn, Clive Davis, Ari Emanuel, George Clooney, Cindy Crawford, and her &quot;little pet&quot; named Hayden (Panettiere.) Diana is the connector of wealthy Arabs and Asians and Athletes with Hwood actresses/models. She also is a sick and twisted bitch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People questions the source of her money and fame as she originally fled London with no passport from Sarajevo in 1992 as a refugee from the Balkan war. She ended up getting married to a Barclays banker, the highest paid banker in London, but they separated in 2009 (or was it 2011, or was it divorce? Conflicting info.) Her husband described the marriage and the split as unconventional. She co-founded the Jenkins-Penn Haitian Relief Organization with Sean Penn after the Haiti disaster and hosts Elton John AIDS Foundation events. She also bailed out the former president of Bosnia from a London jail. She claims she was driven out of London because the elite never accepted her as one of them and she moved to California.</p>
<p>So the rumor is that these actors and actresses in the Room 23 book and others are being prostituted to high class clientele including Saudis and that Diana Jenkins is their pimp.  Here is another link, <a href="https://www.datalounge.com/thread/12775325-the-sex-trade-at-cannes-">The Sex Trade At Cannes</a></p>
<p>Please help me research this so that I can substantiate or discount these rumors.</p>',

            I've read up on the RDJ/Himmmm thing before, but didn't remember the full details. I now have one issue with it. He names Rob Reiner as a "good" person in hollywood. Hasn't he been confirmed(or alleged) to be a pedo somewhere? I can't remember where I read/heard that particular info, possibly associated with Corey Feldman.
