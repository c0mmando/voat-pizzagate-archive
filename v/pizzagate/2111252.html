            Wow, excellent information.  I will definitely read the article you linked. I knew it was political and wacked out in schools but had no idea it ran so deep.  I hope you found a better place! I hope there still are better places.

            Apparently the Freemasons set up the public school systems, I learned today.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe there are severe consequences for principals and superintendents who allow the name of public education to be "damaged" by reporting CSA?  Do most administrators belong to the secret side of clubs like Rotary?  I don't know.

             In 1920, during a special session held at Colorado Springs, Colorado, the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite drew up a comprehensive education plan for the youth of the country. The plan called for sending all children through public schools for a certain number of years, and

              recommended the careful selection of school trustees and teachers, as well as supervisors of school textbooks and libraries...

             Public education has been destroyed on purpose  to make the population more controllable.  And wages are low while frustration is high for teachers.  People with self respect leave the profession, leaving only freaks who fail upward into management.

            This article includes a link to a database they already have of some improper Texas teachers in case you want to research them.

            If such a data base were to be set up we would have to really be vigilant and careful to make sure about who gets to head that data base.  They love to be connected to agencies that make them out as the good guys.  But your idea sounds like it would help.  Yes this is a big problem and those at the top and sometimes the principals have been put in place to look the other way, maybe they are involved too. They have been infiltrated by TPTB.

             Thanks.  I found this by looking into a principal just charged with luring teen girls to a skinny dipping party.  He apparently has nothing on his background check, so no red flags went up for the Arizona district that hired him from his Texas employment history.  (pizzagatewhatever this morning).
The article above which suggests the database recommended that any teacher losing their certificate be listed, whether criminal charges are filed or not.

             I thought it is a useful article demonstrating that school districts behave similar to the Catholic church by handling molestation in house instead of reporting to the law.  They just let them go to some other district.

              Hah.  The Jesuits could possibly have designed the same behavior for the public schools as the Catholic Church.  They are in control of almost everything or I am sure insert their people into strategic places whenever needed.  This has their thumb print all over it.
