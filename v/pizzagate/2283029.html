            By the way, the lady interviewing the pizza delivering PG detective, cough, also has an interview with Robert David Steele, the spook who says everybody should get the truth and nobody should go to jail. I think you guys are being had as usual. This guys story is the way it is, accept for he was selling Trump, there are good FBI agents fighting the bad ones and said we are winning. I think that is the purpose of giving so much truth, to sell those other lies.

            I listend to the entire video, and was impressed. Until the end. He has no money, and is forced to deliver pizza's.  Yeah. Pizza's. Not a mention of the irony. And then they asked for donations to his pay pal account. He also acted confused why the FBI had all his damning evidence but was not moving on it. I know the answer but he does not? Then he said he is working with white hats on the inside. Don't know about this. But it may be all true. Or not.

            I believe him and I have heard his story before. Florida is a hotspot. It was said that many in the foster care system went missing under Jeb Bush. I have seen many stories/ads parents have written, complaining that their children were wrongfully taken, by DCF.

            Two pedophiles down voted this submission. We should probably help this investigator :) I made a meme.

            I have been following this guy for a while. There is no doubt in my mind that he is legit. I also believe he has enough audio evidence to sink the people involved. They have been calling him and threatening him. Some of these people are well known lawyers.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            They asked him the name of the judge who is involved in some court action regarding this. He told them. They called him back and taunted him and told him that they had "spoken to" the judge.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            They have buried themselves in complicity with child trafficking. They are even calling his phone using President Trump's name in order to scare him. They spoof their number and use the names of politicians to make it look like these politicians are supporting the traffickers and to scare this whistleblower.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            He took a picture of his caller id and it says Trump Org. Look at it:

           <p>
            I added the description, his website, and the video of him explaining all this to the picture. There is a female lawyer who calls him in a threatening way. She sounded drunk a couple of times, maybe, either that or she is just stupid because her behavior indicates complicity.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we should help this guy. If we make it known that pedophiles are using Trump's name to threaten people Trump's team will hopefully be compelled to act and these traffickers will go down in flames.
           </p>
           <p>
            I bet Trump would not like pedos using his name to threaten people.

             I don't know. I thought the guy looked questionable by the end of the video. He got chocked up when mentioning he didn't have enough money to go to his niece birthday because it was out of state. It looked odd and possibly an act. Then he went on about he "delivers pizzas" now. Didn't like this at all because he didn't make the connection about how ironic that is. Then he briefly touched on the Satanic angle, but mispronounced Satanic. Sounded like he said Sawtonic. Why would he do that? it is like he pronounced it so odd, that you never noticed he even brought that topic up. Slipped by you. Was like he wanted to quickly gloss over that part but had to bring it up at sime point. Those were strange things at the end of an otherwise credible looking interview. Watch the end again. Didn't like it. Everybody wants money. He chose to wear a scratchy old sweater that made him look poor. I don't know really.

            I haven't even started the video yet. I saw the name and recognize it. I've heard this guys tapes and have followed him for a while. He's awesome! He's exposing so much. I've tried posting about him here. I hope this gets the attention it deserves because this guys information is shocking. It even ties in with Caylee Anthony's murder.

            Fuckb yes, its pizzagate. Elite just realised there is too much shit out to be all covered smoothly, so they try to avoid all the blood-drinking pineal gland-shit, so they "give" us pedogate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedogate is trying to be the clever distraction.

            It seems like you have an Impulse to use the fucking "pizza gate" name as much as you possibly can...according to your post history.
           </p>
           <p>
            So apparently you didn't get the memo, But "PIzzagate" Is out.... Call it literally anything else, Is in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously. The name pizzagate is harmful. It's like you're trying to be harmful... I'm not saying you are, I'm saying it's like you;re trying to be.

             People know it as Pizzagate. Sorry but that's the way it is. The way I see it, if you bring it up as PG and someone laughs at you, then you at least have a leeway to say "let me show you why they call it PizzaGate" and then show them the Alefantis Instagram and the Podesta emails. Show them the
             <em>
              Spirit Cooking
             </em>
             email and then show them Marina Abramovich's
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ys-Lfu4Sc">
              video on YT
             </a>
             of her throwing "pig" blood around and painting on the walls. Show them
             <em>
              Heavy Breathing
             </em>
             and how they have the FBI pedo symbols in their videos, and the
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M67Tj6r5pQ">
              creepy videos of Majestic Ape.
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Or maybe show them

              his Underground "Art" Room

              Sorry, I hate voat because have to make comments like this. So I'm just seeing your reply now.

              That's the fucking point.  I Realized I need to revise my Original Feelings on the name.... BEcaues if the name wasn't so fucking bad, There's a great chance it would ahve been ignored all together... if it was named pedogate from the get go... There is a chance That It would have been ignored. So although the original intent of the name was not fulfilled, IE being a harmless, yet intriguing.... It worked. It worked because It was so fucking retarded, That The MSM could talk about an elite peodphile ring, ANd in such a callous dismissive manner.
             </p>
             <p>
              But now, moving forward, continuing to cling to the pizzagate guns, is harmful. What are you even arguing dude... You're sayin yea..&gt; lets keep calling It pizzagate, Instead of Pedogate... Like, you honestly think there is a single instance in which your message would be more soundly received if you used pizza gate instead of pedogate? Do you think theres an even a slight possibility of that being the reality of the situation?
             </p>
             <p>
              Fuck me, I don't know why I have to be a condesenidng asshole. I'm just saying... Like dude... When companies fuck up... THEY CHANGE THE NAME. And guess what..&gt; 9 out of 10.... IT FUCKING WORKS. We're all fucking sumpletons...&gt; Something as simple as few letters being removed, and A few differnt being added, Makes a huge difference. sometimes, It make the difference between, Well..&gt; everything.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sometimes it comes to the stupid fucking name....
             </p>
             <p>
              And listen... I don't think this movement if doomed regardless of how many people feel inclinded to use the shitty name...&gt; this movement Can't be stopped. Shit's Over in a nonsensical good way...
             </p>
             <p>
              But it's a shitty name. just stop using it.

             Pizza is literally the whole thing.  The entire reason this came about.  The easiest way to redpill due to elites referencing it and the ubiquity of pizza chains.  I don't think it's so much dumber-sounding than simple "govt is run by pedophiles" and certainly better than "the Cannibal Elite"

                 Bitch you haven't THOUGHT in your miserable life.  "Omg this guy's videos are great! I watch every day! Did you read [some kike slut]'s tweet today?'
                </p>
                <p>
                 You contribute nothing.  I can't believe you even address me directly that's how above you I am.

                 The reason you're more pleasant and popular is the exact same reason you are incapable of original research: YOU. ARE. A. WOMAN.  This is like that time a Mexican bitch was saying something about living in California and I was like DUDE. YOU. ARE.

                 .  Do you understand? I mean to say HOW ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT.  BY WHAT RIGHT

                   Yup you get more satisfaction from positive energy toward you rather than things like truth, progress, being right, courage, revenge etc.  That's why NONE of you cunts belong anywhere near this board.  Or in the military, politics, corporate boardrooms, and any decision-making body beyond the PTA
