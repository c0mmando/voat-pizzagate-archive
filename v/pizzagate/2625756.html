            False headline wrongly links Hillary Clinton to former government shortcomings on immigration
By Bill McCarthy on Monday, June 18th, 2018 at 4:22 p.m.
           </p>
           <p>
            One conspiratorial news website recycled a years-old Senate report in an effort to link former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to negligence by the Department of Health and Human Services between 2013 and 2015 that led to the abuse of migrant children.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Senate report admits Clinton ‘gifted’ children to human traffickers," read a June 17, 2018, headline from Your News Wire, a website with a history of peddling falsehoods online.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Your News Wire story cited 2016 articles from The New York Times and New York magazine, as well as a Jan. 28, 2016, Senate report based on an inquiry into the role of HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement in protecting unaccompanied migrant children from human trafficking and other abuses.
           </p>
           <p>
            Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The story said: "Hillary Clinton’s State Department gifted an ‘unknown number’ of children to human traffickers after refusing to run the most basic checks on these so-called ‘caregivers,’ according to a bombshell Senate report released late on Thursday and completely covered up by mainstream media."
           </p>
           <p>
            This statement is wrong or misleading in several ways — starting with its attempt to frame a Senate report from 2016 as a new and shocking release that the media ignored. Casual readers could have thought the Your News Wire story related to the recent FBI Inspector General’s report, which concerned Clinton’s use of personal emails and was released Thursday, June 14, 2018.
           </p>
           <p>
            In reality, the Senate’s findings were widely reported in 2016, and the many contemporary news stories — including an Associated Press investigation that overlapped with the Senate report — made our fact-checking job easy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Senate report said that HHS placed more than a dozen migrant children in homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced into labor.
           </p>
           <p>
            The report did not say anything about Clinton playing a role in that process.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both the Senate report and AP investigation discovered that HHS, which is responsible for finding adult sponsors to temporarily house and care for unaccompanied immigrant children pending the resolution of their immigration proceedings, neglected to comply with federal law requiring that the children be protected from human trafficking and other forms of abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            As unaccompanied children surged across the southern border toward the beginning of the decade, the department slashed several safety standards in order to quickly transfer the new arrivals from government shelters to sponsors’ homes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Caseworkers who had previously followed strict guidelines for placing children with sponsors — guidelines that required background checks, fingerprints, home studies and signed agreements to bring the children to immigration court — were instructed by agency officials in November 2013 to stop fingerprinting. Shortly after that, they were also instructed to stop requesting original copies of birth certificates, seeking personal and identifying information, or checking criminal history.
           </p>
           <p>
            The hastened process saw several children placed in households with sponsors who forced them into labor or otherwise abused them, according to the Senate and AP reports. It is unknown exactly how many of the approximately 90,000 migrant children placed into sponsor custody between 2013 and 2015 experienced trafficking or other abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            But neither report mentioned Clinton or used the term "gift" in reference to the placement of children with human traffickers.
           </p>
           <p>
            We could not find any evidence that Clinton, who led the Department of State during President Barack Obama’s first term in office, played a part in the rollback of the safety standards governing the protection of migrant children. Not only are the State Department and HHS separate executive agencies, but Clinton also stepped down as secretary of state in February 2013, months before HHS decided to stop fingerprinting in the first of many decisions that led to the children’s mistreatment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your News Wire tried implicating Clinton in an old but otherwise real Senate report. The website did not respond to a request for comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            We rate this statement False.

             YourNewsWire intentionally makes up things to be debunked, and it is then blamed on conspiracy theorist fake news. That is their purpose. Politifact is as useless as Snopes. Both sources are controlled.

              Thanks I'm aware of the former, my point including this wasn't about Hillary but the leads to mainstream news reports regarding immigrant children being shunted to traffickers &amp; abusive foster placements while there's recent indications these are still happening. When ex-CIA &amp; Secret Service agents get involved in such activities, because of past incidents, flags are raised re this present case. I did find some of the MSM articles additionally.

           <p>
            WASHINGTON — A top official with the Department of Health and Human Services told members of Congress on Thursday that the agency had lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, raising concerns they could end up in the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives.

            U.S. Placed Immigrant Children With Traffickers, Report Says
           </p>
           <p>
            By Emmarie Huetteman
Jan. 28, 2016
           </p>
           <p>
            WASHINGTON — The Department of Health and Human Services placed more than a dozen immigrant children in the custody of human traffickers after it failed to conduct background checks of caregivers, according to a Senate report released on Thursday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Examining how the federal agency processes minors who arrive at the border without a guardian, lawmakers said they found that it had not followed basic practices of child welfare agencies, like making home visits.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations opened its inquiry after law enforcement officials uncovered a human trafficking ring in Marion, Ohio, last year. At least six children were lured to the United States from Guatemala with the promise of a better life, then were made to work on egg farms. The children, as young as 14, had been in federal custody before being entrusted to the traffickers.
           </p>
           <p>
            “It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” said Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee. “But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that a U.S. government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of their abusers.” (Excerpt)

            Video Included
           </p>
           <p>
            A cellphone video shows immigrant children being led into a vacant office building in Phoenix. The defense contractor leasing the building, MVM Inc., claims publicly that it does not operate “shelters or any other type of housing for minors.”
           </p>
           <p>
            The building was leased in March by MVM, a Virginia-based defense contractor that has received contracts worth up to $248 million to transport immigrant children since 2014, records show. The company, which once provided guards for CIA facilities in Iraq, was founded by three former Secret Service agents. One of its vice presidents is a former CIA special agent and former acting director of the U.S. Marshals Service.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since MVM claims they do not operate any type of housing for immigrant children, and they have leased the building, then why are children being taken into the building.
           </p>
           <p>
            Asked whether the children were kept there overnight, the spokesperson said the building is intended to hold them for a few hours before flights but was unsure how long children actually ended up staying.
           </p>
           <p>
            So this evidently may be a temporary housing stopover while children are united with their parents or guardians.  Idk what the truth is here.  Could this be an attempt at blaming Trump and Sessions?  It says MVM signed the contract a month before Sessions took office.  There could be some shady stuff going on here.

              Yes, and the sad thing is that some never will wake up unless it all comes crashing down at once.  They are in a trance.  Filling their bellies with Craft Beer.

               . Would you be able to copypaste your comment to the body of your post?

               I'd suggest breaking down the text into paragraphs. ;-)

                I wasn't sure which comments you suggested but added two MSM articles referencing migrant children handled by the US HHS dept. being placed with traffickers. Also some links to articles about children sexually abused in govt contracted holding facilities.

              Just offhand, before I research, one of the most documented &amp; infamous cases is the CIA connected Finders cult, documented by US Customs &amp; local LE as collecting &amp; transporting children both inside &amp; outside the US, with allegations of SRA rituals &amp; sex abuse. In many recent stories on the immigrant children issue there's been headlines that over a thousand were unaccounted for, ie "missing". Other recent headline stories mentioned parents returned to home countries without their children. A second major case, the Franklin Savings conspiracy involving orphans from Boy's Town, a famous Catholic institution, were being used for sexual blackmail of Washington politicians. It was shown there was FBI intimidation of child  witnesses. So govt connections to child trafficking is virtually proven. This present incident has all the right elements as in past instances, military/intelligence contractors also have a history in sex trafficking children or being complicit in abuse, such as in the Bosnian war or boys abused by elders in Afghanistan. Do we ignore a potential occurence with all the flags only because the background details are limited? The point of PG research is to uncover evidence when questions are raised by questionable appearances. The whole immigrant children situation in the news is full of questionable practices &amp; troubling scenarios, such as young children upset from being taken from parents told to take "vitamins" that are actually psychotropic sedatives. Also children placed in foster situations without CPS type hearings, while there have been allegations some end up being trafficked. PG research here has alleged cases of children's services placing children in abusive or trafficking situations. This present story may or may not be such a scenario but the basic elements could hardly be less forboding.

               I agree that this SO pizzagate related. This is in fact systemic child abuse by those in power. Bordee agents have been caught with CP and even producing CP. There is some dark dark stuff going on behind these facilities' blacked-out windows
