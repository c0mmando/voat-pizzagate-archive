            After having a read these and being as objective as I can about the list, what I have actually studied of these terms it seems like a marketing advertisement for each of them: i.e.- missing at least half of the truth that would allow you to make an informed decision about any of them.  The Truth about all of these terms is that there is a slippery slope that is being managed/hidden by describing them in this way. I liken it to opening a door for what may seem like a new friend but having your enemy push past your new found friend, and walk in. These terms don't take into account what people that have been victims have experienced around this AT ALL. Please have a deeper look, as these terms are not really sufficiently explained from the point of view of the generational abused person or sacrifice victim. Just sayin'.

            Saved me the weeks of typing to post the same thing...
To just throw around the label of 'Satanic' or Satanism' or whatever even though there is no indication that HRC or whoever is actually Satanic beyond what the Hollywood-style reenactment of some ritual that looks more movie-like than anything might even be.
Myself, I'm Wiccan (
            <em>
             gasp
            </em>
            the horror!), and have read some of the Qur'an (have a copy of it buried on a shelf), and have helped translate a Hebrew book a friend was working on.
Depending on what you're talking about, you could, in fact, end up offending someone.
Generalizations don't help what we are trying to accomplish here... if you don't have any proof except some fourth-hand rumor that "my cousin's brother's second-cousin said he saw..." that's too sketchy to be verifiable as anything, and isn't worth much.  Now, if you have a picture or video of HRC (or anyone) at something more than a theatrical reenactment of a Hollywoodized creation of a Satanic ritual (IIRC, that was all that ritual thing in Texas was was a reenactment... actual Pagan and Satanic rituals aren't carried out on anything even approaching the scale of that Texas (think it was Texas) "ritual")... then I'm sure lots of people would be interested in seeing it... otherwise, it's idle speculation and rumors.
And, yes... that is all the whole "spirit cooking" thing is... shock art (kinda like Marilyn Manson's shock rocker thing)... just another of those freaky entertainment things.  That's all it is.

             abrahamich(the child sacrificer) actually made the statement that she/it believes art rituals are real spiritual events when performed in private settings with same minded sickos. The email chain between abrahamobich and skippy molester podesta was too casual and understanding to be anything but that of an exchange between to sick minded friends.  Wicker away and burn out my fellow creation.

              And, as for Marina Abrhamovich, that's just art.  They tend to think something that just looks like a bunch of paint splashed on a canvas is world-shatteringly deep.
It's just how they are.
What someone paints/draws/animates/whatever... if their intention is to promote child abuse, that's one thing (and, then you have to prove the child abuse aspect of it), but if they just paint a picture (or in Marina's case, do the human cake thing, which is just performance art), does that make them a child sacrificer?  Can you prove she sacrificed a child?
You can hang a label on anyone, but without evidence, it's just a label, and that label could very well destroy someone's life.
Maybe it's true, maybe it's not... hiding behind the internet and slinging unfounded accusations just to destroy someone because they threw a birthday party for someone who might have done something isn't the best road to go down.

              A person can be sick minded or just not well-read on a subject, but to just blatantly call someone/something Satanic just because it fits the Hollywoodized picture/definition is the same problem the world ran into in the weeks after 9/11 (and, no... I'm not derailing the thread by going into that one)... just because someone shouted "For Allah!" in the cockpit before the plane crashed, that doesn't actually mean they were Muslim or that they were doing whatever in Allah's name.
             </p>
             <p>
              Marina's stuff is theater, it's a theatrical performance, that's it.  She might have ties to Clinton, etc., but if you can't prove beyond what you can read too far into that she actually
              <strong>
               does
              </strong>
              sacrifice children, then all you're doing is slapping the label of Satanic/child sacrifice/cannibal on anything that fits the Hollywoodized idea of any of them.
This falls under the same heading of "because you're blonde haired and blue eyed, that means you're a Nazi"... just because you're blonde haired and blue eyed, that doesn't mean I should just slap a label on you and spread rumors around school or work about you (while I could spread those rumors that you're the "master race")... I'm a witch, my parents were hippies, dad was raised Catholic.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's such a thing as reading too much into something, also.  This ends up stretching what is read enough to fit anything you can find.  This happens all the time with random verses from the bible and pretty much any Quatrain from Nostradamus.
It's the same old "Number 23" syndrome... if all you look for is the number 23, and you focus on it, soon all you find is 23 everywhere... 23 steps to your front door, 23 seconds spent on the elevator, 23 everywhere.
You end up filtering out everything else... especially if the thing you're fixated on is something like this... child abuse and sex trafficking that extends up to the upper echelons of the government.
If you can provide evidence that they are sacrificing children to Satan or Allah or Buddha or Jesus, then I would have to agree (based on the strength of the evidence) that they are Satanic or whatever... but I want to see the evidence.
Taking things out of context and stretching things to fit a preconceived idea is  dangerous road.  How many times in the past 50 years was the world supposed to end?  Just according to the bible?  How many dictators and presidents and world rulers **could **have been a sign that the AntiChrist *had *been released?
             </p>
             <p>
              If I had posted the OP, I would have asked that the Mods (I kinda wanted the job when I first joined here, but I know what they have t o deal with, and have been a chatroom Op for too long, and know I don't have the time or the patience anymore) include a rule about don't label stuff as Satanic or whatever without "sufficient" evidence to back the claim up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Talking about "hot dogs", "playing dominoes on cheese pizza",  "whether the Lazatto kids will be in the pool" etc., etc. may very well be code for child abuse, and I'll admit the artwork at Comet Pizza is a little weird, and Marina Abrahmovich's 'art' is a little different than what most people are used to, but to claim that they are sacrificing children to Satan or all of them are doing any of the things being hung on them is like saying 'because my generation (35 YO here) was raised by hippies, we're all automatically Deadheads"... yes, I grew up listening to Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane and Black Sabbath and Moody Blues. and I've done drugs, but the two are unconnected completely.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just, do your research.  More than looking something up on Wikipedia or CNN or whatever.
You might be surprised to see what is misrepresented everyplace.
And, keep in mind what we're here for... trying to raise awareness about child abuse that extends up to the higher levels of power.
If we don't keep that fact in mind, then this becomes nothing more than a witch hunt during the 'burning times'.
