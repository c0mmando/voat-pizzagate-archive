            snippet
Twenty years ago, a US ambassador astutely observed that Guatemala had become the new southern border of the US. Today, Guatemala’s 540-mile Mexican border with 132 points of entry—vividly described by journalist Richard Pollock –is the jumping-off point for undocumented people from all over the world who want to enter the US.
           </p>
           <p>
            The underground railroad from Guatemala to the US is a well-established route. In 2014, a group of US reporters including this writer traveled to the Guatemalan border region, where we met with a “coyote” or smuggler of humans.
           </p>
           <p>
            The coyote, who called himself Juan, gave us a detailed explanation of how his business works.
           </p>
           <p>
            Juan’s people have discounts with bus companies and hotels along the two-thousand-mile route to the US border. They pay off several levels of Mexican officialdom, as well as criminal cartels, so they may move their human cargo through the country without incident and even in comfort.
           </p>
           <p>
            The trip takes four days, in air-conditioned buses and with nightly stops at hotels. Juan told us he has no trouble passing his clients across the US frontier. Indeed, he and his fellow-smugglers deliver their charges to their final destinations—all the way to addresses in New England or the Pacific Northwest, if need be.
           </p>
           <p>
            The price is about $6,000 per person—an amount that would seem prohibitive for someone running from poverty. But the coyotes, despite their fearsome reputation, are familiar and friendly faces in the communities from which refugees come. The coyotes keep contact with the people they’ve carried to the US. In this enterprise, a feeling of community prevails.
           </p>
           <p>
            The smuggling business is also popular with people from other countries. Even in 2014, before the massive exodus from Syria, authorities told us that Middle Eastern people were passing through Guatemala on their way to the US. This year, officials told us the same thing.
