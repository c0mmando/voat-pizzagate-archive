<p>Ashok and Amrita Mahbubani are included in some of the worst, seediest &quot;pizza&quot; and &quot;cooking&quot; Podesta emails. I think more scrutiny is warranted in this area than has been given to it. I apologize for throwing so many links here, but the rabbithole goes into some insane seeming places.</p>
<p>Mahbubanis in a pizza/cooking Podesta email: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/59243">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/59243</a></p>
<p>&quot;Tony, should the plan be Indian cuisine? If yes, I will send you a list of dishes we can decide on, some of which we can make in the pizza oven.. The shopping list will follow. Trust you received the Army Cook book I sent to you, by now. Warm regards Amrita&quot;</p>
<p>Ashok Mahbubani is the President and CEO of Multitronics VMI, LLC from AL, while the Mahbubani-founded EKTA foundation appears to mostly operate in Haiti. <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=79748669&amp;privcapId=47245715">http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=79748669&amp;privcapId=47245715</a> <a href="http://www.ektafoundationusa.org/main/">http://www.ektafoundationusa.org/main/</a></p>
<p>It struck me that Multitronics is located directly between Redstone Arsenal in Al (which has an airfield) and Hunstville International Airport. The location in Alabama is a comfortable flight distance from Haiti. I found this to be a glaring red flag re: trafficking, in light of what we know about obscure rural airports and smuggling when related to the Clintons. Especially if the Mahbubanis are also running a charity in Haiti.</p>

<p>The EKTA Foundation page describes the Mahbubanis as: &quot;Clinton Foundation Ambassadors:&quot; &quot; .. .the Mahbubanis chose the Clinton Global Initiative as their portal into the world of strategically targeted philanthropy. Initial commitments implemented through CGI have flowered into a broader relationship for Amrita &amp; Ashok as Ambassadors for the Clinton Foundation.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Interestingly, a search of the Clinton Foundation website for Ashok Mahbubani returns no results. The EKTA foundation does register.</p>
<p>The EKTA page describes how &quot;the Mahbubanis developed a bond with Haiti, through a family owned manufacturing business that employed 300 people there in the \'80s&quot;</p>
<p>I\'d be very interested to know what exactly that business was called. Or any other information about it.

(possible organ trafficking?) - The rabbithole here goes into all sorts of insane places. I've never seen any real focus on this. Much more information in the pastebin.

            Ashok Mahbubani //
           </p>
           <p>
            BIO. I believe this is less than a year old
           </p>
           <p>
            Ashok Mahbubani, B.Com., LLB is the Chairman and Managing Director of EKTA World.
           </p>
           <p>
            He graduated from Loyola College and began his professional career in 1973 in Madras, India with a privately owned Electronics Marketing &amp; Manufacturing company.
           </p>
           <p>
            He completed a Diploma in International Trade at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade in 1974 and rose to the position of Director of the company’s International Trade Division.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since then, Ashok has participated in the establishment and growth of family-owned businesses in India, Canada, Haiti, the US, Spain, and Mexico.
           </p>
           <p>
            In partnership with the privately owned company he worked for, he negotiated collaboration with a Japanese manufacturer to set up one of India’s first licensed manufacturing facilities for copiers, Xerographics Private Limited. Eventually, he sold XPL to one of India’s largest conglomerates, the RPG Group. In 1983, Ashok moved to Canada and joined his brother-in-law in the management of a family-owned manufacturing company, Span Manufacturing Limited, where he broadened Span’s customer base and managed its finances through its growth phase.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then, in 1987, the Mahbubanis moved the US and set up a new family-owned company, Multitronics, Inc.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1989, the company overcame competition from four other contenders in North America and secured a major contract manufacturing project at Chrysler. Multitronics became a significant supplier to Chrysler starting in Model Year 1990.
           </p>
           <p>
            Since then, the company has maintained its track-record of innovative process design for manufacturability (sic) combined with defect-free contract execution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Two decades after building a successful business foundation, Ashok &amp; Amrita Mahbubani started The EKTA Foundation in 2007 with the simple purpose of giving back.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <pre><code>  HAITI &amp; THE CLINTONS. 2007
</code></pre>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            To ensure that EKTA’s grants would make measurable impact, the Mahbubanis chose the Clinton Global Initiative as their portal into the world of strategically targeted philanthropy. Through their involvement with the manufacturing facility in Haiti, from 1984-88, the Mahbubanis came to admire and love the irrepressible spirit of the Haitian people. In 2009, they were back as part of CGI’s Haiti Action Network, to work with like-minded partner organizations in Haiti on sustainable investments in Water &amp; Sanitation, Information Technology and Education.
           </p>
           <p>
            The unifying objective of the Foundation’s commitments to action in these areas is enhancing human dignity and strength through access to knowledge. Here in the US, the Mahbubanis partnered with the Streisand Foundation as benefactor contributors to the Women’s Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai in California. They are recognized as Ambassadors of the Clinton Foundation in promoting and supporting its many world-wide initiatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, the Mahbubanis are actively engaged in a program created by Open Future Institute that promotes principled self-empowerment for students in the final two critical years of High School. The QUESTion Project™ was successfully piloted at a magnet public school in the Bronx and is now a full-term elective at several New York Department of Education schools.

                 I think it's fair to assume Mahbubani is three letter and was from the beginning. Even without the school - his bio refers to an unnamed "family business" both in India and one in Haiti. I can't find any record on it, only vague mentions of "manufacturing." That is the definition of shady bullshit. There is no record for him other than multitronics, but he's having multiple cozy dinners with the Podestas? And somehow has the money to run a "charity" out of Haiti as well? PLUS FBI anon said to watch out for a powerful wealthy Indian businessman pedo. If this doesn't fit the bill IDK what ever would.

              Are you fucking dense? Or did not read the OP? Sometimes I'm ashamed I've spent 4 months on this site/project alongside total jackasses. Even if the OP did mention "chopping and shopping" that's just as benign as the rest of the language in the thread. Is podesta a good guy? Fuck no. Is pedogate real?hell yes. Are researching these emails and trying to turn water into wine a huge waste of time,Absofuckinglutely!

              "Ashok and Amrita Mahbubani are included in some of the worst, seediest "pizza" and "cooking" Podesta emails. I think more scrutiny is warranted in this area than has been given to it. I apologize for throwing so many links here, but the rabbithole goes into some insane seeming places.

            This ^^ address (which is apparently the same as Yulista Management services as well which has weird connections including possibly Dyncorp) - is directly between the air strip at Redstone Arsenal and Huntsville International Airport. PERFECT for trafficking and military establishment all around, which unfortunately some parts of the military/ paramilitary organizations like Dyncorp have been implicated in trafficking human beings for years.

             I mentioned that email because of the mention of "chopping and shopping" with tony podesta, (TONY. PODESTA) among other things, and it was one among other emails with similarly creepy language. ... how is this not screaming shady to you?

              Not at all, even with him being creepy. It shouldn't he to you either unless you are begging it to be. Its a not at all strange way of the person saying they will go to Costco and prep the meal.

            I remember this email because it mentions the address listed at the bottom of the email. I believe the one featuring the cutout of the pope has the same address as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Google the following address in the email and utilize the "Street View" mode:
           </p>
           <p>
            6 King Georges Way  Huntsville AL 35824
           </p>
           <p>
            It might be nothing, but just another bit of information. I think an airport is right next to it as well.

             This ^^ address (which is apparently the same as Yulista Management services as well which has weird connections including possibly Dyncorp) - is directly between the air strip at Redstone Arsenal and Huntsville International Airport. PERFECT for trafficking and military establishment all around, which unfortunately some parts of the military/ paramilitary organizations like Dyncorp have been implicated in trafficking human beings for years.

             You're referring to one of two addresses listed under Ashok Mahbubani/ EKTA/ Multitronics - both are in Huntsville. The one you are talking about looks like a small house in a suburb and I don't know what to make of it.

             So. This looks big.

              When this was barely still breaking, some anon on 4chan mentioned the street view angle. Viewing the home you can see the tree formations by the body of water in the front yard as well as the three 6's around the home along with the style of it.

            Digging into the addresses, we find that they coincide with Yulista Management, so info on them follows:
           </p>
           <p>
            I am just info spamming because I have to go study for midterms i'm going to fail sorry for the mess. This was intended to turn into a 2.0 post on this topic. I think Yulista
            <em>
             MIGHT
            </em>
            link Mahbubani to dyncorp through some weird masonic group.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's all based on the addresses of multitronics and Yulista management services showing up as the same - so if someone pokes a hole in that, this theory falls apart. May be unrelated, so fair warning on half baked research here.

             I mentioned that email because of the mention of "chopping and shopping" with tony podesta, (TONY. PODESTA)

             It's not always food code words. Read the email chan for context on how creepy it is, as well as the other emails they are in.

            This is a GREAT POST, and more uf us should scan old posts.
            <br/>
            It was the end of November when Reddit shut down the sub on pizzagate and a lot of us came straight here to continue, and you can see when the people joined like me at that time.
            <br/>
            Anyway, there are a herd of new people and this post is great as he researched the old posts, which we need as a lot of information was posted here and could have been easily passed over.  Thanks for taking the time!

             Ashok and Amrita Mahbubani are included in some of the worst, seediest "pizza" and "cooking" Podesta emails. I think more scrutiny is warranted in this area than has been given to it. I apologize for throwing so many links here, but the rabbithole goes into some insane seeming places.

            I agree, 100%.
