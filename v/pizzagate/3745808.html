<h1 id="md-bidens-basement--">Bidens &quot;Basement&quot; -</h1>
<p>I saw a few interesting CoronaVirus MSM headlines containing the word \'basement\' or \'bunker\', and began to wonder if it was some sort of code. When I saw this story about Joe Biden\'s \'basement\' led campaign amidst Corona lockdown:  
</p>
<p><strong>Inside Joe Biden’s bizarre coronavirus bunker</strong> <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/inside-joe-bidens-bizarre-coronavirus-bunker/">https://www.politico.eu/article/inside-joe-bidens-bizarre-coronavirus-bunker/</a> </p>
<p>-it peaked my interest. </p>
<p>Though there wasn\'t much in the story of note, besides a quote from John Podesta, I could still feel there was a spin going on so I decided to take a look at where this Everyman Joe\'s quarantine basement was…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Washington Post reported in June 2019 that Biden owned two homes in Delaware: his primary residence, a 7,000-square-foot lakeside home in Wilmington, and a 4,800-square-foot vacation house in Rehoboth Beach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though 7,000 SF could be considered a mansion, and the &quot;Basement: Partially finished&quot; is likely not included in that figure. Meaning we could be looking at another 2/3,000 SF subterranean level. I didn’t find evidence to prove this, nor would a large basement alone be proof any of the \'creepy\' things he has been accused of here... But thats not all .</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="md-bidens-house---1209-barley-mill-rd-wilmington-de-19807">Bidens House - 1209 Barley Mill Rd Wilmington, DE 19807</h1>
<p>The Secret Service Agent assigned to his residence, however was accused, and found guilty, of raping a young girl. </p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1537225">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1537225</a></p>
<p>Other secret service men and women who were this close, have also made claims about his molestation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the source, a Secret Service agent once got suspended for a week in 2009 for shoving Biden after he cupped his girlfriend’s breast while the couple was taking a photo with him. The situation got so heated, the source told Cassandra Fairbanks, that others had to step in to prevent the agent from hitting the then-Vice President. Additionally, the agent claims that Biden would walk around the VP residence naked at night. “I mean, Stark naked… Weinstein level stuff,” he added.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And the house  has been the location of numerous call to the police and secret service.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not the first time county officers have worked with federal agents at Biden\'s 7,000-square-foot custom home, which sits on a private lake several hundred yards from Barley Mill Road. County officers, along with the Secret Service, investigated gunfire near then-Vice President Biden\'s Greenville home on Jan. 17, 2015. That shooter fired several rounds from a car speeding past the entrance to Biden\'s estate. Biden told &quot;CBS This Morning&quot; that police found four shell casings about 100 yards from his home. The Secret Service acknowledged they had no surveillance cameras facing the main road in front of Biden\'s home. No one was charged in that incident. Later that year, a report issued by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform detailed a number of failures by the Secret Service, including a 2013 incident in which four young adults went fishing in Biden\'s backyard. The individuals went undetected until a neighbor saw them and called agents.</p>

<p>Bottom line : You wouldn\'t want a creep to have a large basement, just like Miranda wouldn\'t let one live next door to a school playground - yet Joe Biden does!!!</p>

<h1 id="md-bidens-neighbor---tatnall-private-school--1501-barley-mill-road-wilmington-de">Bidens Neighbor - TATNALL PRIVATE SCHOOL -1501 Barley Mill Road Wilmington, DE</h1>
<p>Across the small lake from Biden\'s Delaware Home is Tatnall School , a 666 student private institution for children ages 3-18. Besides obviously catering to the wealthy east coast elite, this is not an ordinary school, with ordinary goal. Tatnall school seems to groom the next generation of industry leaders and politicians.  <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/45/ff/c1/45ffc1c9a08cdb50b8e49f36c2304a49.jpg">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/45/ff/c1/45ffc1c9a08cdb50b8e49f36c2304a49.jpg</a>  
</p>
<p>Joe Biden\'s grandchildren are students of Tatnall. Beau Biden\'s widowed wife (and later his brothers girlfriend) is also an alumni.</p>
<p><a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/04/30/hunter-biden-splits-from-brother-beaus-widow-hallie/">https://pagesix.com/2019/04/30/hunter-biden-splits-from-brother-beaus-widow-hallie/</a></p>
<p>Before his death, Attorney General Beau Biden helped arrest Tatnall\'s assistant Soccer Coach for DEALING CP.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daniel Cooke, 26, was arrested for child pornography after an undercover investigation by the Delaware Child Predator Task Force. Cooke, of Hockessin, Del., was the assistant junior varsity soccer coach this year.</p>
<p>&quot;Troubling isn\'t even the word,&quot; said Tony Weymouth, a parent of a Tatnall student. &quot;I can\'t even imagine. They did the best they could. You just never know who\'s going to come up with a bad record.&quot;</p>
<p>Police say they found multiple files of child pornography on Cooke\'s computers, including a video of an elementary school-age girl engaging in sexual acts with an adult man.</p>
<p>This was discovered after authorities searched Cooke\'s Michelangelo Court home yesterday.</p>
<p>“Receiving, possessing, and distributing child pornography are criminal acts that perpetuate the sexual abuse of kids and we’re working aggressively to hold offenders accountable,” Attorney General Beau Biden said in a release issued today.</p>
<p>Biden\'s children attend the school, according to multiple board members. Biden\'s spokesperson did not confirm this however. While the Attorney General\'s child predator task force arrested Cooke, the spokesman also said that if in fact Biden\'s children do attend the school, it wouldn\'t be a conflict of interest since his kids aren\'t old enough to have been coached by Cooke.</p>
<p>Cooke was arraigned today on 25 counts of dealing in child pornography.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>After his death, Tatnall School was one of the first organizations to host his commemorative foundation and NCMEC, regarding ‘online safety’. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presentation for Parents: Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children</p>
<p>On Monday, October 24, at 7 p.m. representatives from the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children will be on campus to give a presentation about internet safety. The Foundation, which partners with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), proudly continues the work of Beau Biden, who, as Attorney General, spoke to nearly 25,000 Delaware students about internet safety. The presentation will include the foundation’s NetSmartz Workshop, which covers the topics Biden thought were crucial to kids’ internet use: good digital citizenship, online safety and the dangers of cyberbullying.</p>

<p>Now still NONE of this is damning information, but it paints a possible picture that the Bidens have ties to the funding or administration of this institution.</p>
<p>Admittedly, up until this point, I was doubting any of this was anything more than a neighborhood school with local family involvement, and an incident with a lone CP coach, and Headmaster. </p>
<p>But I had enough of a hunch about Tatnall, to take one last look through some of their online publications. While flipping randomly through a Tatnall Zine from 2016, I found a featured alumni on page 32/33: </p>
<p><strong>THE ARCHITECT OF EPSTEIN ISLAND!</strong> </p>
<p><a href="https://files.catbox.moe/dts3uh.png">https://files.catbox.moe/dts3uh.png</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Architect Drex Patterson left a job at a small San Diego architecture company last June to go on his own, just as the recession hit. Patterson, who specializes in designing expensive custom homes, said his clientele is largely recession-proof. He is now at work designing four houses in San Diego and <strong>three in the Virgin Islands, where he lived and worked for 10 years</strong> before moving to San Diego 2 1/2 years ago.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, he is also working on <strong>Mitt Romneys BASEMENT EXPANSION</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plans call for demolishing the 3,009-square-foot, single-family residence at 311 Dunemere Drive and replacing it with an 11,062-square-foot, two-story structure. Architect Tony Crisafi, who is handling the design, said the raw figures are somewhat misleading. (He and Drex Patterson own La Jolla based Island Architects.) He said only 7,394 square feet of that total is gross floor area, with the remaining 3,668 square feet taken up by a basement and garage. “It isn’t anything anybody’s even going to see,” he said. <strong>“It’s a basement underground.”</strong></p>

           Before his death, Attorney General Beau Biden helped arrest Tatnall's assistant Soccer Coach for DEALING CP.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Daniel Cooke, 26, was arrested for child pornography after an undercover investigation by the Delaware Child Predator Task Force. Cooke, of Hockessin, Del., was the assistant junior varsity soccer coach this year.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Troubling isn't even the word," said Tony Weymouth, a parent of a Tatnall student. "I can't even imagine. They did the best they could. You just never know who's going to come up with a bad record."
           </p>
           <p>
            Police say they found multiple files of child pornography on Cooke's computers, including a video of an elementary school-age girl engaging in sexual acts with an adult man.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was discovered after authorities searched Cooke's Michelangelo Court home yesterday.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Receiving, possessing, and distributing child pornography are criminal acts that perpetuate the sexual abuse of kids and we’re working aggressively to hold offenders accountable,” Attorney General Beau Biden said in a release issued today.
           </p>
           <p>
            Biden's children attend the school, according to multiple board members. Biden's spokesperson did not confirm this however. While the Attorney General's child predator task force arrested Cooke, the spokesman also said that if in fact Biden's children do attend the school, it wouldn't be a conflict of interest since his kids aren't old enough to have been coached by Cooke.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cooke was arraigned today on 25 counts of dealing in child pornography.

           After his death, Tatnall School was one of the first organizations to host his commemorative foundation and NCMEC, regarding ‘online safety’.

            Presentation for Parents: Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children
           </p>
           <p>
            On Monday, October 24, at 7 p.m. representatives from the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children will be on campus to give a presentation about internet safety. The Foundation, which partners with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), proudly continues the work of Beau Biden, who, as Attorney General, spoke to nearly 25,000 Delaware students about internet safety. The presentation will include the foundation’s NetSmartz Workshop, which covers the topics Biden thought were crucial to kids’ internet use: good digital citizenship, online safety and the dangers of cyberbullying.

           Now still NONE of this is damning information, but it paints a possible picture that the Bidens have ties to the funding or administration of this institution.
          </p>
          <p>
           Admittedly, up until this point, I was doubting any of this was anything more than a neighborhood school with local family involvement, and an incident with a lone CP coach, and Headmaster.

           But I had enough of a hunch about Tatnall, to take one last look through some of their online publications. While flipping randomly through a Tatnall Zine from 2016, I found a featured alumni on page 32/33:

            Plans call for demolishing the 3,009-square-foot, single-family residence at 311 Dunemere Drive and replacing it with an 11,062-square-foot, two-story structure. Architect Tony Crisafi, who is handling the design, said the raw figures are somewhat misleading. (He and Drex Patterson own La Jolla based Island Architects.) He said only 7,394 square feet of that total is gross floor area, with the remaining 3,668 square feet taken up by a basement and garage. “It isn’t anything anybody’s even going to see,” he said.
            <strong>

             Keep in mind we found other enrollment numbers "under 700" so this could just be a coincidence, but the number of the beast always raises my brow. 666 or not the school does seem quite large in size for those numbers.

               Correct. For example this site says 614.
               <a href="https://www.niche.com/k12/the-tatnall-school-wilmington-de/">

              </p>
              <p>
               The first site with 666 enrollment also shows ~400% higher crime in Willmington. Odd Too.

              The agenda doesn't write itself. There are much more powerful people than those we are presented with. They have the power to kill celebrities and public figures and replace them with lookalikes and get their media to pass them off as the real thing.
