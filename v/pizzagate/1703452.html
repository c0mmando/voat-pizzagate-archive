            MH was apparently working on a story about CIA director John Brennan. So i'm not sure how the story became that it was pizzagate related. I do hope those making this claim will come forward with more details.

             The wording of this leads me to believe you may not have seen my last comment right before yours.   It starts "Final Thoughts" and is linked below.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is the text of an article from VG regarding this and highlighting that he was most probably doing a profile on Brennan (although this is not proven).   From CIA ===&gt; Brennan ===&gt; pizzagate is possible, but only speculation.  However AJ, hate him or not, has often broken news proved later correct that peope laughed at at the time.  That's just what you get with an AJ news item.  It's not everyone's cup of tea.   Don't worry, Hastings understands (I'm guessing) that the mysteries around his death leads people to speculate - and remember.  Hastings reputation only grows more stellar with the passing of time.

              That Alex usually gets it right has no impact on the present matter. He should not be making statements like this without backing them up with some sort of proof. Further, he has already made bogus statements about pizzagate, has admitted he is being threatened with a law suit ( ie - he won't be calling out the real perps ),  has major ties to the CIA (who killed MH), and has been found to lie and disrupt peaceful protests in the past. It is NOT OK in my book to doublecross your fellow man by working for the CIA or its offspring. I don't want my argument to be diluted - this isn't me protecting MH, this isn't me disliking AJ personally, this is just what i do in my research, and in my life, i call bullshit when i see it.

               I just thought you would like that VC article as it seems to be a lot more accuate than the AJ coverage.  So I put it there to bolster what you had been saying all along.

            FINAL THOUGHT:  I am posting this new Vigilant Citizen article on Hastings and Vault 7 in it's entirety here, as it is a complete review not only of the circumstances around Hastings death, but how Vault 7 info sheds light on how it may have probably happened as well.  It seems probable that Hastings was investigating CIA Director John Brennan just prior to his death, and there is no confirmation that he was specifically looking into pedgate, or was ever a CIA asset as Jones asserted.  As we know, pedogate and the CIA go together like death and doom, so it is possible Hastings had gotten too close to that truth as he was profiling Brennan.  Nevertheless, this is a good article to have archived here for future researchers.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Rest In Peace Mr. Michael Hastings. Even in death you are a force of light, awareness and change for the people.
            </strong>

            New Wikileaks Dump About CIA Hacking Sheds Light On the Mysterious Death of Michael Hastings

            The latest Wikileaks dump is said to be the “biggest exposure of CIA spying secrets ever”. It reveals how the agency hacks into consumer products to turn them into spying devices … and how it can even remotely take control of cars.
           </p>
           <p>
            Entitled Vault 7: CIA Hacking Tools Revealed, the latest Wikileaks dump contains tons of documents explaining how the CIA has hundreds of zero-day exploits (holes in software that are unknown to the vendor) and can hack almost any smart tv, Android phone, iPhone, or router, and, apparently, recent cars as well. Not only that, the agency can even leave the “footprint” of another entity while doing the hacking, effectively allowing them to put the blame on a foreign nation or organization. The documents state:
           </p>
           <pre><code>“The CIA had created, in effect, its “own NSA” with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.”
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Hacking into Your Products
           </p>
           <p>
            The CIA, working with British spy agency MI5, have developed a back door for a smart TV that allows government snooping while the television is turned off. And that may now include live video streaming of your living room and office. In a 2014 document detailing future and improvements to the program, CIA officials said they planned to add a feature where the Agency could capture video and video snapshots of people through their televisions. This would put the federal government and the CIA right in your family room and office.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized “zero day” exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.
Foreign Menace
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the documents, the CIA has been using the State Department consulate in Frankfurt Germany as a headquarters for hackers in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
           </p>
           <p>
            The organization has been collecting a library of attack techniques from malware produced in other states, including Russia. The CIA has the ability to use this library to misdirect attribution of hacks by leaving behind the “fingerprints” of stolen malware.
Remote Controlling Cars for “Undetectable Assassinations”
           </p>
           <p>
            Probably the most startling portion of this dump is the revelation that the CIA has gained the ability to “hack” into recent cars through their control systems. Note that we are not even talking about self-driving cars (which will certainly become 100% CIA-remote-controlled), but regular cars with computerized components (around 2011 and earlier). Why would they want to do that? To “engage in nearly undetectable assassinations”.
           </p>
           <pre><code>“As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations”
</code></pre>
           <p>
            These revelations shed a new light on the very mysterious death of journalist Michael Hastings, who lost his life after his car suddenly went out of control and crashed.
Michael Hastings
           </p>
           <p>
            Hastings was a journalist, a contributing editor to Rolling Stone and reporter for BuzzFeed. He became a vocal critic of the surveillance state during the investigation of reporters by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2013, referring to the restrictions on the freedom of the press by the Obama administration as a “war” on journalism. His last story, “Why Democrats Love to Spy On Americans”, was published by BuzzFeed on June 7. Hastings died in a fiery high-speed automobile crash on June 18, 2013, in Los Angeles, California.
           </p>
           <pre><code>On June 18, 2013, Hastings died in a single vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coupé at approximately 4:25 a.m. in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. A witness to the crash said the car seemed to be traveling at maximum speed and was creating sparks and flames before it fishtailed and crashed into a palm tree. Video from a nearby security camera purportedly shows Hastings’ vehicle speeding and bursting into flames.

Witnesses described the car’s engine being ejected 50 to 60 yards (46–55 m) from the scene. Hastings’ body was burned beyond recognition. The coroner identified the body by matching fingerprints with those the FBI had on file. Two days after the crash, the Los Angeles Police Department declared that there were no signs of foul play. The coroner’s report ruled the death to be an accident. An autopsy showed that the cause of death was massive blunt force trauma consistent with a high-speed crash.

           <p>
            A news article from 2015 actually mentioned that Hasting’s death was most like the result of a “car cyber attack”.
           </p>
           <pre><code>Former U.S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard A. Clarke said that what is known about the crash is “consistent with a car cyber attack”. He was quoted as saying “There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers — including the United States — know how to remotely seize control of a car. So if there were a cyber attack on [Hastings’] car — and I’m not saying there was, I think whoever did it would probably get away with it.”

“Hastings’ work as a thorn in the side of government and the 33-year-old journalist’s death in an unusual crash in June 2013 immediately triggered speculation. A witness reported seeing Hastings’ new silver Mercedes C250 coupe speeding down a Hollywood street before dawn when it bounced, slammed into a tree and burst into flames.

Shortly before Hastings’ death, he sent what was described as a “panicky” email to friends expressing concern that associates were being interviewed by “the Feds.” He also wrote that he was onto a big story and needed to “get off the radar for a bit.” His 2010 story for Rolling Stone in which Stanley McChrystal skewered the White House and its strategy in Afghanistan led to the general’s resignation.

The FBI denied Hastings was the target of any investigation, yet a Freedom of Information Act request later unearthed an FBI file on Hastings. Hastings also told a neighbor he thought someone had been tampering with his car. At the time of his death, he was working on an article about CIA director John Brennan.

           <p>
            According to several sources, Hasting’s last days very hectic.
           </p>
           <pre><code>“In an email to colleagues, which was copied to and released by Hastings’ friend, Army Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, Hastings said that he was “onto a big story”, that he needed to “go off the radar”, and that the FBI might interview them. WikiLeaks announced that Hastings had also contacted Jennifer Robinson, one of its lawyers, a few hours prior to the crash, and the LA Weekly reported that he was preparing new reports on the CIA at the time of his death. His widow Elise Jordan said his final story was a profile of CIA Director John O. Brennan. The FBI released a statement denying that Hastings was being investigated.

USA Today reported that in the days before his death, Hastings believed his car was being “tampered with” and that he was scared and wanted to leave town.

‘At 12:30 a.m. on the morning he died, an agitated Michael Hastings went to his neighbor and friend Jordanna Thigpen and asked to borrow her car. He said he was afraid to drive his own car, because he believed that someone had been tampering with it.

“He was scared, and he wanted to leave town,” Thigpen recalls.

But she declined, saying her car was having mechanical problems. When she woke up, Hastings was dead, his car having crashed into a tree.’

Hastings died in a single vehicle automobile crash in his Mercedes C250 Coupé at approximately 4:25 a.m. in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. A witness to the crash said the car seemed to be traveling at maximum speed and was creating sparks and flames before it fishtailed and crashed into a palm tree. Video from a nearby security camera purportedly shows Hastings’ vehicle speeding and bursting into flames. ”

             Great catch!  Thanks for that.  I'm glad to see this story growing.  We need public discourse.  Snowden was absolutely right in leaving the US.  Among many other things, this story vindicates his decision.

            Alex has become a de facto source himself, as he gained much credibility for calling the last election correctly and lately many revelations of hidden information such as Vault 7 info, shows he was correct about many things he has been saying for a long time.  The link to that is further down in this thread.  As for the nuke thing, I never heard that, perhaps you can provide a link.  He speculates sometimes, but that wasn't a major theme as far as I have heard.

            Infowars is indeed the focus of the MSM and Establishment attacks on the populist movement.  It means he is effective and doing something right.

            Voat aims to be the ultimate free speech forum, you can't even get a call for violence or vigilante justice strictly banned, so banning Alex Jones is not the kind of thing that goes on around here.   Apparently 4chan and Reddit are where the banning and censorship can be found now, most likely you could get him banned there.

            I appreciate your attempt at pushback on this.  It is not a perfectly proven case by any means at all, far from it, but it has gotten a good discussion rolling.  thanks for your input.

            I've never heard that Michael was looking into child trafficking or abuse. Did Alex expand on why he believes that? This is a completely novel claim.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Voat is going to take what Alex Jones says as solid evidence, and if those who demand a little more are the bad guys ("someone here wants this post removed") then you guys have succumbed to something I was worried about: your ve been high jacked by the internets most famous controlled opposition, and you will be laughed out of existence for this. It's how it works, and it's meant to work that way. That's what CIA Alex Jones is for.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have given you all proof that Alex actually has a Stratfor ex employee running infowars. Alex has stated that comet and Jimmy are probably innocent, and set up by the government who planted stuff online to frame them. Yet I'm ignored, and I'm the bad guy. No mention of the evidence against using Alex as a source. Instead the mod uses by request to flag this for accuracy as a chance to bash David Seaman again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alex jones father is CIA. He admitted it, as well as admitting that half his family is CIA. People, Alex jones is cointelpro and this has been known for many years. If people warning you about accepting him as the new face of pizzagate are made out to be the bad guys at Voat, this does not bode well.

             I am going to hunt through this thread for those links, because I found only one link that links to a AJ takedown here on voat which raises questions and offers a lesson in cointelpro behavior.  From what I understand, the stratfor employee was an intern, not "running" Infowars.  But so what - Stratfor can have white hats and black hats like most intelligence hangouts including Voat itself.  In the video provided in the main post above, AJ specifically discusses how intelligence became interested in his output, and came to start informing him.   I do not expect someone who delivers information on the internal war between white hat and black hat intelligence to have no contacts with intelligence - that wouldn't make any sense at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             However the semantics of that turn out, I think for many, the proof is in the pudding with AJ.  He has been on the frontline of the opposition against the global criminal network for so many years.  He probably didn't rise out of angel food cake, and he is not pure, nor is he perfect.  But he is not misleading people by championing Trump as President, or trying to shape Trump policies towards arresting globalist domination and setting the USA back on a path of economic prosperity and non-interventionist war and foreign policy.  Fighting the out of control CIA is what we are all really doing at the end of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
             The guys in the FBI or CIA countercoup that has taken place are not perfect at all, they are probably death dealers in fact with shady connections.  Stone is a major dirty tricks political operative for example.   But when you are fighting a war, and it is an information war which makes a very real difference in public action, such as the populist revolution that happened when people overturned the expected outcome by voting for Trump, you can't always be that choosy as far as who is on your side.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've run into this before here, where heavy Christian oriented pizzagators, or so they say, argue against anybody who sticks their head up for the cause - neither Seaman, Titus Frost, Robert David Steele, IIsthisgaemeofthrones, Alex Jones, Bad Guacamole, FBIAnon, Gunderson, Webb, Kutcher or anyone else is "good enough", "pure enough", "clean enough", "said the right thing enough" to stand up for pizzagate.  All of these have been accused repeatedly by those who wish to undermine the forward progress of the pedogate exposure effort of being variously disinfo, shills, out to make a buck, CoInTellPro, you name it.
             <strong>
              So the end result is we can't have any outspoken leaders because we are such a very very snow white and pure and discerning group.  Right.
             </strong>
             <strong>
              That kind of strategy gets you nowhere, nothing, and nobody.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             I listen to the message a lot more than a listen to the messenger's naysayers.   In that group above, yes, Kutcher seems suspect as a Freemason and because of how THORN is embedded with establishment corporations, so it is important to be careful of your bedfellows.   But not to the point of having no voice at all.   And of course, if we listened to every disinfo shill attack that comes around and took it as gospel, we'd be handing the opposition and easy victory.

              It's not because they have to be squeaky clean and snow white that we can't and shouldn't have 'outspoken leaders'.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's because we are on very dangerous and precarious grounds here with many individuals, institutions and organizations having a stake here.
             </p>
             <p>
              We are a huge, distributed movement, the largest collective investigation in the history of mankind into one of its most powerful, most insidious, most nefarious and possibly oldest enemies.
             </p>
             <p>
              We are at every turn at enormous risk to be manipulated, coopted and captured by the very forces we are opposing.
             </p>
             <p>
              And then as always there are the countless charlatans and sociopaths hoping to profit from our labor and make a name for themselves over the suffering of the very people we aim to protect.
             </p>
             <p>
              We don't need leaders, outspoken or not, and in fact our desire for one poses a significant risk to be exploited by our enemies.
             </p>
             <p>
              We are legion, yet on our own.

               I'm all for that!  Anon from the Scilon fight here.   However, we can't afford to be Occupy Wall St either which partially failed because of leaderless lack of direction and focused public discourse - the media took over the narrative almost unopposed in that case.
              </p>
              <p>
               There need to be speakers to the public, for lack of a better word than "leader".   Every time there is, the strategy of opposition is to pick them apart with everything and anything there is - the argument becomes that one is no good, that one is no good, that one is no good.  Turns out no one is good enough.   So as long as someone is performing and reaching clear objectives, I have to ignore what they might have said 10 years ago.

              Yes, you have to take them on a case by case basis. And take the lumps w/ the gravy. ("Chew the meat and spit out the bones.")

              I do know a lot of people who watch Alex Jones but they are not at the right point in their "discoveries" to listen to a beat-down of AJ, it would only set them back if that were to happen.

               but have you followed him throughout the election?  He was clearly one of the few viable choices for breaking news that turns out to actually be accurate.  News has to be a smorgasboard (meat, veg and carbs) these days.  I pick from a lot of places for the only balanced diet possible these days.  We all do our best at that I think.

                Yes in fact I relied on AJ a lot during the election (and RSBN), he helped Trump get elected and helped to redpill a lot of people on Trump. Even FBIanon said that he was useful.
               </p>
               <p>
                Balanced diet ... that's another great way to look at it, hadn't thought of it that way. That's exactly what I do, and try to use intuition and common sense.
               </p>
               <p>
                And ... if you don't "pick from a lot of places" I think you're going to miss out on a lot. There are a lot of idiots in the past that I've learned from, and I wouldn't change it, Heck, there's a lot of stupid inane youtube videos that I have, and still do, learn from. You just gotta grin and bear 'em, to get to the "good stuff."

               Does anyone really know?  Ironically "black and white" thinking can't really apply now. (gentle ha ha)
              </p>
              <p>
               I know in the past Stratfor were "bad guys" but I think a lot of the people fighting to save the basic structure of the US might be types I would find odious in gentler times.  I don't particularly like spies, killers, and shady operators, but some of them have a basic sense of the idea that America is really about to be lost altogether.  There is a fight going on right now.  I'm a betting type, and I'd bet there are black and white hats throughout different organizations, many of which are not showing their true affiliations either way right now.

                 If you mean Dr. Group, yes, his wife is nice too. Never actually met them though. But he's a sincere guy and genuine from what I can tell. He made us source and verify everything. And he edits ruthlessly, drove me nuts.

                 I couldn't keep writing for him as they couldn't pay enough.  I wrote this for him (below)  SSShhhhhhhhh  It's ghostwriting lol. Of course I DO NOT expect you to read it so do not feel obligated.

              Hi bopper -   I have thought about your comment and I understand Hastings was a hero to many, including me, because of being willing to speak out against The Establishment.  So the thinking goes, "he can't possibly have been a bad guy, one of them".
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               "Hastings – a vocal critic of government mass surveillance – had sent an email to colleagues and friends just 12 hours earlier, telling them he was onto a “big story” and was under investigation.  The Buzzfeed and Rolling Stone contributor, 33, wrote: “The Feds are interviewing my ‘close friends and associates’."

              So people feel that he would/could NEVER be a part of the CIA.  I disagree that it is impossible or improbable.

               Snowdon, our greatest hero in turning over to the public the truth about the underside of the government was definitely CIA.  Assange worked for law enforcement as a hacker.  Every hero doesn't hold their nose and refuse to be a part of organizations we mostly despise.  Being part of the CIA does not necessarily mean you can not heroically do something for the public.  Quite the contrary.  Manning was part of the military.

               heros in this regard are part of the government.  Hastings brought down a General almost singlehandedly.  THAT is effective.

               Thank-you, these are excellent points, I have to say I haven't looked into Hastings's alleged CIA connection till you posted this, but nothing surprises me anymore ... yes we get an image hero in our minds about certain people and we don't want to let it go ... and yeah you're right some good people do indeed come from the inside, Snowden is a good example.

               I had a client a few years ago who opened up to me that he was an NSA codebreaker during the USS Liberty fiasco and whatever he was involved in, right or wrong, he was a great guy and seemed quite patriotic. He turned me on to the book The Puzzle Palace. Anyway, just an anecdote.

            I don't know where to post this as it seems the mods are not allowing new Voat7 related threads, but Wikileaks just tweeted that only 1% of Vault7 has been released.
           </p>
           <p>
            Less than 1% means the totality of Vault #7 contains

             more than 876 100 documents

            At first I was a bit disappointed that Vault7 was not directly Pizzagate related. But it just dawn on me that the CIA is most probably behind Pizzagate aaaaannd Vault7 has the power to destroy the CIA. This means that Vault7 can expose Pizzagate. I have hope again!! ;)

            What is unexplained about a high speed crash into a pole? If you hit a pole at 100 mph and die--that's the explanation.

            The same also happened back in the 90s with our UK TV personality Jill Dando. She was about to expose VIP paedophiles and then got shot [apparently by a stalker - who was later found innocent!]. I remember this as it unfolded. She had asked the BBC bosses to present her findings via a documentary and then bam!
Here is one of many accounts [unfortunately from the Mirror] but the truth is that you could find any other sources if you want, I just posted an easily understandable one.

           <p>
            If you think about this and then remember Mr.Masspaedo and shagger of disabled children, Jimmy Saville, the plot truly thickens. Lets not forget Jill Dando who was yet another one who was 'done away' with for trying to expose the truth.

            I don't know about his wife.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do know that his fiance died in Iraq when she had her convoy ambushed. This made Hastings very dark and jaded. People say he never came back from that.
           </p>
           <p>
            After that he became very anti govt and i doubt he would willingly side with them.
           </p>
           <p>
            From Wikipedia:In 2005, Hastings began covering the Iraq War while living in NATO occupied Green Zones in Baghdad.[20] Hastings suffered the loss of his fiancée Andrea Parhamovich in 2007. A former spokeswoman for Air America, Parhamovich moved to Baghdad and began working for the National Democratic Institute. She died after her convoy was ambushed by gunmen, killing Parhamovich and her three security guards.[21] Hastings wrote a book on the incident, entitled I Lost My Love in Baghdad: A Modern War Story
           </p>
           <p>
            While writing for rolling stone, his piece the Runaway General on McCrystal, he had access to high ranking govt officials. After it was published he said he had another bigger story he was working on, people were following him, and he told people he feared for his life. Look at the official accident report you'll see he was murdered. His car doors locked, and the pedal went to the floor and locked, hosbcar was remote driven into a tree, but before impact a bomb exploded sending the engine hundreds of feet.

            This is related to Vault7/because in those files it says the CIA can hack and control cars.
           </p>
           <p>
            General McCrysyal has friends who have such technology.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was killed either as revenge for what he did to McCrystal (he got him fired, that takes balls of steel. He declared war on the deep state) or he was killed because of what hisnnext story would be.

             But there was never any indication or hints that his next story was pizzagate related. I thought it was about Patreus.
            </p>
            <p>
             He believed his life was in danger because he found someone fucking with his car in his driveway. That's when he wrote the email to his colleagues at buzzfeed saying he's going off the grid for awhile because of this. I think it was only a few hours after this email that he was murdered.

              I agree with this.  There has been no specific info that he was working on pizzagate, only speculation.  Alex Jones asserted this, but that is all, so you take him as a source, a quasi-source, or just a blow hard ha ha.  I take him as a quasi-source.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem is, Hastings wife knows, as well as maybe some of those associates of his that were being investigated right before his death.  His wife is clearly handled, so she is not speaking.   It has been stated she was CIA, I don't myself have proof of that so that is just a rumor I guess.
             </p>
             <p>
              Actually no one knows what story he was working on at all, as far as I've heard.  But still, it is good to bring all this back up again, and just go over and over it.   Lest we forget, and also, in a new climate maybe, just maybe, someone who knew what he was investigating will discuss it.  Other than Alex Jones! lol

            They were driving a rare super car, that went out of production in 2007. The spot they crashed was a popular spot for drifting cars. Driver was also a competitive racer and known petrol-head. They ran charities for earthquake victims, not child trafficking?

             Well that's all fine and good but their car also blew up. Cars do not just blow up on impact. Gasoline is rated based on its ability to resist spontaneously igniting and while an engine could get hot it's unlikely to cause an explosion. For it to cause one purely by the engine it would have to be over heated to begin with, puncture the tank, AND vaporize the fuel within the tank. And remember that we are talking about a car, like Hastings, that uses Super Unleaded. The higher the number the less likely to ignite. 
 We are also supposed to assume that someone who is a professional driver was this stupid in an area they were familiar with. It begins to stretch credulity when each piece is put together, and that's not even bringing up Haiti.

              They were driving an old supercar at high speeds - the engine would have been hot, it wasn't a normal car.

              So you're now suggesting that they planted a bomb in their car or what? We were talking about hacking.

            I don't understand, are you saying you don't think the investigation has found anything in terms of exposing a huge problem with pedophilia, human trafficking and other nefarious activities perpetrated by the people in power? Or are you saying that despite having found out so much about all this stuff, it's difficult/impossible to get the mainstream media to cover it and there haven't been enough high profile arrests yet?

            I had a similar ban.  The trip wire is when you personally berate someone.  I called a senator a "fucking idiot" because he was a fucking idiot. But, apparently, you can't say that.  With liberals you have attack the idea or happening and not the person.  Snowflakes can't handle criticism.  So, when Roger called that woman (forgot her name) a "stupid bitch" this moved the trip wire.  She was a stupid bitch, but we have to find better ways to get the message across.  Snowflakes can't handle it.  Lol.  So, since we are on Voat.co - if you are a Libtard reading this, then please go fuck yourself.  Peace :)

             there really seems to be a will to censor discussion about his death.  Someone here is trying to get this removed too.

               you asked if we could take it down as well, and ask Alex Jones about his evidence first - hardly the way things usually work on an internet forum.   however, I do hope he clarifies, but better to have the discussion at all.  Helping people remember Hasting's death is only a positive.  Many people on here who are as passionate about Hastings as you are and used to follow him were glad to see this discussion.

            Thanks for this, VB. I have been watching Alex Jones for many years. I have watched his audience, His viewership increase slowly at first and then bigger and then of course recently with the election exponentially. He certainly has taken a lot of heat for being a she'll being a sellout being whatever it is that the the trolls are saying he is or isn't. But I knew long ago didn't no matter how crazy anything he said wise the biggest service that Alex Jones has done for this country is to get millions of people to understand that's some kind of huge mega conspiracy was even possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            No those people immense heat. They knew that he was right but when they tried to shirt with people they were shut down and shut out and insulted and ridiculed. Still, they persisted. And so to me it doesn't matter if people got on board with any weird theory isn't even matter what it was, And interestingly he might has been right about all of them. So what a critical mass was finally reached at the same time all the cosmic tumblers came together it was an amazing moment here over the last year to watch all of this coming together. Because if there was not a huge swath of people who on some fundamental level Believe it or suspected that a conspiracy and cover up and evil on a massive scale was possible, none of this would be happening. Because most people still don't believe that,
           </p>
           <p>
            It is fascinating to me on Reddit various subs we're people have slowly but surely been trickling in saying oh my gosh I was one of the people who do the insulting and I really apologize you were right after all. They are stoned by the realization that they were on the wrong side for so long and actively on the wrong side for so long. What I do is I gently try to get those people to generalize that insight. I will suggest that at some point when they are ready they need to go in and look at everything else. Because it's all a scam it's all a hoax. I'm not sure where you are with all of this but even for me it has been this on folding. Because it was so long ago I suppose I have a luxury of dealing with this slowly, Whereas people that are finally waking up are going to have to deal with everything all at once.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the people waking up now we'll never be able to appreciate the contribution of those who were involved in this very early on, And I don't mean to me. I have mental and emotional and physical tools to deal with this stuff that a lot of people don't have but who were also out there early fighting the good fight. I know that you understand what I'm saying because you are an incredible researcher here and as I've said before a leader in this form and this effort. What it takes for someone to be able to dig into this hellish world is on believable. In my work, I deal with dying children and their families and parents. I have never had any problem with that. For what ever reason, I was given the gift of being able to do that. What I have always said is that I do not have the ability to deal with child abuse. I think the reason for that is because when a child is dying there is the point of no return. At that point it's more about dealing with acceptance. The trouble I have with abuse, And that doesn't even get into the torture and cannibalism and sacrifice BS, is that it may never and. Kids come in desperately abuse any many cases wind up back in those very circumstances. In any case of abuse, it damages those kids for life and murders their souls. So I'm having a lot of trouble with that particular aspect of this work and I have to leave it to others, Like you who somehow have the gift of being able to dig into the darkest corners and keep going.
           </p>

            There may be a few grammar punctuation and spelling errors in this exceedingly long and rambling post, but I'm too tired to go back and try and fix it all and my cat keeps walking around on my keyboard. So my apologies on her behalf. Thanks for all you do.

            Hastings had told people prior to his death that he was working on a story that could get him killed.

            He had told others he was being followed.

            Look at this great article explaining the crash site and where everything is. How do you crash into a tree and have the engine and transmission fky through the tree and down the street a hundred feet?

            If he was an agent for what agency? Because he took out a general. Most mockingbird agents in media are just puppets who repeat what told, they don't learn or have access to anything. More likely Hastings was a journalist who had inside sources, some he gained while writing about "The Runaway General: General McCrystal"

             Yeah, witnesses said the engine blew out before the car crashed into the tree. No skid marks.  Witnesses also saw a bright white flash before the crash.  Then the firefighters were shocked/surprised when fire intensified and violently expanded when it with doused with water. It was not a petrol fire, as petrol burns orange.  The flames were white. Foam had to be used.

              Sounds like a magnesium fire. I grew up in a mining town and my friend's Dad worked in the lab there. He used to get us some magnesium coils and we would wrap it around and burn  it  on hardwood trees like maple or oak around our pond where we played hockey til sometimes midnight or later. It's a really slow burning metal but produces a dazzling bright white light. When chunks would fall off into the snow it would crackle pop and spark like crazy and would even melt through 6'' of ice when you used enough. Interesting phenomena to say the least

             Remember, it's not as though every person working in the MSM is part of a cover up or would willingly try to deceive people. there are plenty of journalists who are themselves deceived, who genuinely believe what they're saying and think that looking seriously into things like pizzagate even for a second would be completely foolish and make them a laughing stock. If wikileaks publishes something like this and then the MSM owners/editors in chief started telling their journalists not to report it, they would all get very confused and suspicious. There's only so much they can keep a lid on before legitimate journalists start seeing through the bubble that's been created around them. I know a couple of mainstream journalists who are really decent people, they are just in an echo chamber, in many ways they are the blindest of everybody, because they think they are the ones trying to deliver truth etc.

             that is one of their favorites - turns your whole tv into a bug.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is SO laughable when the media allows and speaks for the establishment who says, "We don't bug anyone, that's preposterous."   THEY BUG ALMOST EVERYONE.

            AUTHENTIC eye witness to Michael Hastings crash; very much worth a listen.
           </p>
           <p>
            The eye witness has a Persian accent. Michael's car crashed on Highland Blvd in Hollywood, CA. That particular part of town is very Persian heavy.

            "Also cars, suggesting that the CIA may have a role in the death of Michael Hastings:
As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations." -- The Millennium Report

              You're awesome VB. I was very much saddened by Michael's killing. I read his books, Rolling Stone articles, and followed his career for years. What a beyond tragic waste of life. A young man with such curiosity and introspection. I don't know how he kept going after his first girlfriend was killed in Bagdad.

            By all accounts Walker was an extremely good driver. But it was his business partner who was driving.
           </p>
           <p>
            The dominant theory regarding the accident was that the tires hadn't been swapped out for fresh ones recently enough* and had lost important gripping ability, which caused it to skip across the road surface without traction.
           </p>
           <p>
            But in general the car was ridiculously over-powered for regular road use and the driver clearly did some kind of show-off move at the corner.
           </p>
           <p>
            *It had been brought out on the day for a charity event. And had been either in storage or in a showroom somewhere. They were leaving the function and taking it for a spin before packing it away again.

             Occam's Razor favors the theory that someone didn't know how to handle their overpowered car.

            <p>
             However, you don't have to remote into a car to hack into it. You'd merely need physical access to the car's diag port and the right equipment to fiddle with the programming in potentially dangerous ways.

            More Alex Jones BS? What is wrong with some of the people in here? He is cointelpro. He was exposed as having multiple stratfor employees on his staff. Look at the way he acts for christ sake. I am leary tof anybody who carries on about Alex Jones, Milo, Oliver or Roger Stone or any other obvious controlled opposition stars. Downvote just for the urgency about anything AJ said.

             close minded?  Obviously you have only the time to mock, but not enought time to find out for yourself if anything is different these days.   However I do understand, I also once thought it was embarrassing to retrieve information from that source.   No longer.  His coverage of the last election was spot on, and correct, when ALL the MSM were absolutely the crazy ones with misinformation, bad polling for months, disinformation and outright lies.   AJ now gets far more hits than most mainstream online outlets combined.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the original video I posted he actually does address exactly the fake news charges you are spreading with no supporting links at all.  Because obviously you are a better source and don't need to back anything up, we are just supposed to get it, cause you said so.  Those days are over.

            Don't we have threads on here about "geographically targeted messages" that could be used as communications between traffickers and their CIA handlers or whoever needed to talk covertly.  "an area affected by an emergency" sounds like Haiti again.  Or any country in a warzone where orphans are being culled and moved.

           <p>
            Basically - he may have helped develop systems that he realized were being used by covert trafficking agents, not really for intended purpose.  May have discovered accidentally because of of client requests that didn't fit the cover story of what the system was supposed to be for.   All speculation of course.

             A lot of pedocoded talk was rumored to occur on gaming servers and as Vault7 has revealed there was probably a period early on  when they hadn't infected/exploited them but caught on gained lots of Intel. I hope WL gives us more soon,

             Kennedy's plane/Hillary - I had forgotten that. Becoming Senator was the second rung in her climb to power, after First Lady.   The Kennedy family probably never saw her coming.

             I hope this whole thing explodes the CIA.   everyone can talk about this with anyone, it is not pedogate. Civilians all know we are spied on to some degree.

              Kennedy hasn't even said one way or the other if he was going to run. It was just assumed.
             </p>
             <p>
              More than likely he would have run for mayor of NYC. He had stated he wanted to start a family and being mayor would allow for him to be an active father and not have to uproot his family.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was perceived to be a threat and taken out. Fucking shitty because he didn't seem to even want the Senate seat.

               He was going to publish in his George magazine the names of the guys who killed his father in 1963 that is why they killed him there was a bomb on his plane it severed the tail of his plane and it dove into the ocean. And they knew he would eventually run for New York Senate then President. They killed him early to pave the way for Hillary and for Bush in the 2000 election.

             that's what you get with Alex.

            <p>
             You watch for the long game - most of what he has said in the past labeled so nicely as "LOLOLOL" actually has been shown to be true.
            </p>

             But take it or leave it, if you don't trust him as a source - hey at least you got a laugh today!

              I can acknowledge that most of his statements are verify-ably true, and perhaps he even offers proof once in a while as we are all required to do, but i am concerned with this particular statement and don't think it's too much to ask for a source. I followed MH like a hawk during his life, and followed Hastingsgate, arguing that indeed this was a hit and his car was wired to explode. So it is entirely ludicrous to hear suddenly that he was a govt agent. He was OUTING govt agents. He was one of us, real people.
             </p>
             <p>
              So I need anyone claiming he was not actually one of us, that he was an actor of sorts, less than honest, to offer hardcore proof. Or at least some. I know that the guy Alex just fired, the ex military guy who discovered something about pizzagate (and was let go from InfoWars the following day) claimed after MH's death to have been Michael's friend. I remember MH's family denouncing him, and that there were questions about the truth of his claims, that perhaps he and MH weren't as close as he claimed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyway, there is a lot of weird stuff going on, with i think a govt intel 5-D chess game that none of us could ever really have a handle on.
             </p>
             <p>
              But what bothers me the most is that I think Michael would consider this sacrilege. He would never work for the US govt. His wife was said to be CIA, and was meant to control him or something. This has been claimed anyway. If you see her on TV the week after his horrific death, you;ll see why. She's 100% fine and dandy. It's bad. Very unsettling to watch. And painful to think this sweet, good, honest man thought he was married to a woman in love with him. But his marriage seems to have been a lie.
             </p>
             <p>
              On today, the day the world finds out just how evil the CIA is, Alex drags Michael Hastings name through the mud by possibly insinuating he worked for/with these creeps. No matter how much they offered him, he would never work for them. He lived for, thrived on, taking the establishment by the balls and squeezing relentlessly with truth and his deep investigations, and incredible journalism.
             </p>
             <p>
              the ones who are murdered ARE THE ONES YOU CAN TRUST. He was not a govt agent, or he would be alive today like Alex Jones.

               His car was hacked, not just planted bombs right? He went through that red-light at 100 mph.

              <p>
               Then after that, seemed like it was a drone. There's varying reports also whether he was burned beyond recognition and that he was pulled out totally recognizable.

                Right. I've heard the drone theory a lot too. But I believe the source of the explosion was from his own engine. There are conflicting reports about the body too. His car seat was pitch black, I'm not sure how he wasn't as well.

               Hey I'm all for questioning, and all of your questions are valid.  The only thing I have to add right now is that I know for a fact that a lot of CIA assets are placed in the media and in journalism, so it isn't beyond the pale for Hastings to have been CIA.   Also I'll add the way his wife acted tells me, she was handled as a CIA wife could be.  A regular stellar journalists wife IMO would have been outraged at his death and wanted an investigation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, as things have progressed, Jones has become fairly mainstream at this point and also has had a LOT of vindication of many of the things he was called a nut for saying.  He has a lot of eyes on him now, so I don't think he would say that carelessly, I think he said that very purposefully in fact.
              </p>
              <p>
               Normally I'm not sure how I would have gotten a discussion about VAult 7 on this forum going without being deleted, this statement offered me a chance to do so, so I took the opportunity.  So consider it "breaking news" about Hastings that definitely gives his death a pizzagate spin that we maybe can dig further into.  Actually, maybe you should think about doing a submission about it especially if more comes out because you have that background of interest in him.  I actually saw the place his car crashed - it was a ridiculous firebomb that felled a very very old and sturdy palm tree and left blackened soot like nothing I've ever seen on a basically residential street.

                It's fine you posted this, i'm just asking if he offered proof. He did not.

                can you flag this "accuracy in question"?
               </p>
               <p>
                Just because it's possible he was a CIA asset (because some journalists are, and he was a journalist) I don't think we have evidence to make this claim about him, and I really don't think he would like this, or being represented by Alex Jones.
               </p>
               <p>
                We need to flag this until proof is brought forward. Maybe it could be removed until that happens. Maybe Alex could be contacted, and then whatever his source was needs to be evaluated as well. But right now we have a shock radio host making a wild claim. This man has an 'ex' Stratfor agent working for him, and his own father and half his family are CIA. This man thinks James and Comet are probably innocent, and says that the govt may have simply set them up by planting fake stuff on the web. He is not a reliable source. One is needed for this claim about the late Michael Hastings. Proofs

                 actually no, it is not innaccurate that Alex Jones said he was an agent.   That is what the headline states.

                  I disagree with how you've framed my sentiments, but I'll let that go. I'm not trying to shut down anything, I'm just asking for proof beyond "Alex said". I think if the title of the post was "Alex claims ..." I would never have had a problem. Does that make sense?

                    Ok I hear you. Yeah I think I could have been more clear too with my complaints. The title does read to me that it's fact, presented in AJs show, that MH is known to be a govt agent. So coming to the post to find out that it was simply mentioned, sans evidence, by AJ who is known to spread disinfo, even about pizzagate itself, makes me uneasy. I really don't think we should trust him when it comes to this delicate matter. He's given us too many reasons not to, and it's clear he's trying to not get sued. I'd rather listen to researchers/youtubers like David seaman who don't seem to mince words or skew the truth even if it upsets powerful pedos.

                     Ok I appreciate that - I am glad we are having this discussion.   If I have written anything that comes off too pointedly defensive, let me know.  It is not my intention.   The internet can make for misunderstandings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I am REALLY GLAD you are bringing up all this stuff because number one there is a lot of validity and we have to question everything.   Also, there are people who are going to have your viewpoint and you are basically speaking for them.   So remember, I am finding arguments to support my basic assumption that for now there is good info coming from AJ, but that doesn't mean I'm an Infowars cultie at all.  A lot of times it is a hold my nose while looking through the garbage type thing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I have a lot of thoughts about the link you provided.  It looked like a sort of hit piece to me, but maybe I should rethink that.  I just have so many counterarguments to some of it and it is so tedious to write it all out!  I'd love to sit in a cafe with you over a carafe and actually just examine it together.  anyway, basically I don't think him doing something cointellpro invalidates every thing he says now.   But I do think he has had intelligence connections, even strong ones.  That doesn't invalidate his message, as I argued to bopper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Okay hope that clarifies some of my position.  BTW I am listeningn to AJ today and nothing that great at all.  He can be very uneven.

                      At the end of the day, we are just here trying to save the children. There are agents working for the powers that be who will stop at nothing, and have unlimited resources, to hamper our efforts. When I try to poke holes in a source, it is not personal, it's born of outrage that there are liars out there who protect corruption. I hope none of my musings felt personal.

                      We wil never see eye to eye when it comes to Stratfor and the CIA, nor when it comes to people who've agreed to work as cointelpro. Again, this should never be seen as personal. We just have differing views. I'd love to share a carafe, however.

                       Hey we were a pretty good example of deep discussion without going personal. We are actually not just being long winded, we are trying to parse history vs present day activity on public figures because trust is in very short supply right now for good reason. We are dealing with a VERY confusing environment.  A carafe it is - would probably take the edge off of a lot of the characters around here ; ).

                        So well said, my friend. I congratulate us both. You know i'm a fan of yours anyway. Hopefully one day i can treat everyone equally, regardless of my personal feelings toward them, but i'm afraid i've got a long way to go.

            Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone is believed to have been murdered in similar fashion in a mysterious plane accident right after standing up against the Iraq War, and after investigating allegations of abuse and other crimes connected with Monsanto, ConAgra, DuPont, Dow and other corporations. These same groups are connected with Agenda 2030. The IC is working for corporate interests outside the law and against the citizens of the United States. Trump needs to prove he is not fake and announce an immediate grand jury and investigations into Racine, Wisconsin and every community infested by Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.

              Correct. His foundation was taken over by the very people he was against. His family was forced into it, and they are all controlled now under the threat of ruining their father's legacy. His family has sold out their own father. It is sickening. Paul Wellstone knew the truth about Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption and was murdered for it.

               Those of us who went through the experience of #GamerGate knew we needed something similar to show that we aren't a bunch of #MISOGYNIST #RACIST #SEXIST #BIGOTS, &amp; to prove the actual lapses in decent journalistic 'judgment' as well as the multitude of incidents of collusion, scandals &amp; the lack of ethical journalism.

               I myself don't know how to make a site like that, but with the many brilliant minds involved here, there must be at least a few who would know where to begin. Perhaps we could vote or VOAT (◠ლ◠❀) on it &amp; each of the categories &amp; so on.

               idk, as long as we can make a sort of shareable database  &amp; give the finger to some of the MSM &amp; the Pedos of the Swamp

               (I have not contacted anyone affiliated with DeepFreeze.it, I just woke up a bit ago &amp; replied to this post with the idea that an online easily accessible database similar to DeepFreeze.it could work really well for #PG ~ maybe I'll make a submission post out of this or if anyone else wants to run with it please do!)

             Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash with his family soon after 9/11.  The rumor was that he doubted the official story.

             And of course, Monsanto, du Pont and Dow support agenda 2030.  These companies are owned by America's oligarchs that started the CFR, League of Nations and then the UN.  They were some of the first companies allowed into China after Kissinger (a Rockefeller lieutenant) and Nixon opened ties to communist China.  These companies and other US oligarch owned companies moved to China and did very well using China's slave labor.

             Rockefeller then worked on getting free trade passed.

             At the Bildeberg meeting in 1991 David Rockefeller walked up to Bill Clinton and asked him what he thought about NAFTA. 
Clinton replied, "If it's important to you, Mr Rockefeller, it's important to me." 
Rockefeller replied, "Thank you, Mr President."

              This is all true. Paul Wellstone was one of the few who knew the real truth and spoke strongly against the collusion of big business and secret societies. He spoke about it in detail privately, and he was murdered for it.

             Very interesting.  THis is a good thread to list these examples in our collective memorybanks of these people killed with Vault 7 tactics.

             I do give Trump credit that he has turned over this wiretapping charge to be investigated by Congress - putting something in their lap for a change.  If they say "nothing to it" the people I believe and hope, would run them out of office next elections.

             In today's White House Press Briefing, Spicer is asked about it over and over again, so he explains pretty well how Trump is handling it.   Smells right, I think he is using this to fight his enemies pretty well -

            <p>
             I have never watched press briefings in my life, but the ones from this administration are great.   I encourage everybody to check them out regularly.  it's another outlet to get the message straight from the administration and watch how the press try to spin in real time.

               I like Coleman too, but where are they since 1 year? It's a concern....

               They were MIA for around 5 months, in 2015 I think, came back, made 2 posts and disappeared until now.
When they returned they said they'd been working deep within enemy lines.
I wish they'd turn up again... to know they're safe and, for more great research.

            This is a good video. If the public only saw this streamed everywhere on their TVs, they would become so awake. The things he reveals here are staggering, yet they are absolutely true.

            Also, when considering what happened to Hastings, one cannot overlook the same situation with Glenn Beck. A few years ago, on Fox, he challenged George Soros, as he was one of the first MSM hosts to reveal Soros, but subsequently received a 'visit' from that Sith Lord. After leaving his job and starting The Blaze, he said he had 'explosive' information that would change America forever - Pizzagate and probably the same information Hastings had. Beck presented this information  in April of 2013, and then he never spoke of it any further. A few months later, on June 18, 2013, Hastings died. Coincidence? Definitely not. Glenn Beck and Michael Hastings received/knew the same information - one buckled under the pressure and sold out and the other didn't.
           </p>

            The results speak for themselves.

             I think Glenn Beck is part of the deep state myself to a degree. Think about it. His mission in Haiti has no names of anyone arrested. No interviews with even the adults that were supposedly freed from human trafficking. Plus who announces a raid before they go and do the raid? The whole thing was sketchy from the start.

             Yeah I think Beck was taken to a quiet location and alerted to the fact his children could easily end up in Saudi Arabia being fucked to death by some damn Arab Prince and no one would ever believe him.  And the former drunk shock jock just folded his tent and retreated.
