<p>All our old friends have returned!</p>
<p>MEGANON RETURNED: &gt;&gt;<a href="https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/145424519#p145426631">https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/145424519#p145426631</a>
&quot;/pol/, 
Pay attention so you don\'t lose the opportunity to approach this right and look like fucking heroes. 
Remember when I said you won\'t see Hillary go down for pizza, but you will see her go down for big shit?! Then, I told you if you keep looking for her being charged for pizza, you\'ll miss all of the big wins and REAL HAPPENINGS?! This is exactly what I was referring to. This is Assange\'s final release (to the EXACT DAY, A YEAR LATER) of his promised, pre-election &quot;October surprise&quot;. He was set to release it on 10/21/16 and since 10/14/16, you\'ve hardly seen him since the embassy and his Icelandic HQ went dark, with the rest of his employees other than Jacob.</p>
<p>Like I said in the thread before, these are the Weiner files the NYPD mirrored/retained as evidence before handing the hardware to the FBI. Some of the files are pizza-coded creepy, just like Podesta\'s don\'t get me wrong but, the NYPD recovered ALL of the files on Weiner/Huma\'s computer, which in their majority, are directly tied to ALL of Hillary\'s dirty Secretary of State Middle East dealings and her backdoor foundation profits thanks to hundreds of millions in cashed payroll checks for their dirty &quot;cooperation&quot;. Yes, the pizza will burn, but she will ultimately go down for the shade she threw to our nation, as our Secretary of State. </p>
<p>Just want to be clear... you\'re not getting 650k of pizza related files. You\'re getting 650k of NYPD recovered files from Weiners/Huma\'s computer that will mostly focus on their EXTENSIVE international/Terror funding and fueling crimes and as you read through the files, yes, you\'ll see a bunch of creepy Podesta-style, back and forth files/communications, sprinkled in between. PLEASE don\'t let yourselves get so excited over pizza, that you completely miss the actual fucking happening you\'re being given in this release.&quot;</p>

            That same 4chan OP says that donald trump Jr. signalled "it's happening!" on his twitter, but this is also a lie..

              Well yeah, I saw that tweet.. But the 4chan post kind of twists its words a little bit in to just saying that it says "it's happening!" or some thing.. I guess I was hoping for the tweets to be about whatever julian is about to drop, but don jr.'s tweet is still better than nothing I guess.. I at least hope a witch hunt really does start for hollywood....or more like a pedo hunt..

            What are the odds that this is to throw bones to dogs to keep their mouths occupied until shit blows over. Or just shovelling a ton of shit at the hungry beast that is the autists on the internet until it either keels over dead or becomes fat and complacent?
