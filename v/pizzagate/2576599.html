<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Monday the Justice Department was beefing up its fight against violent crime, drug use and illegal immigration by assigning 311 new prosecutors to work on the problems, the largest increase in decades. </p>
<p>“The Department of Justice is going on offense against violent crime, illegal immigration and the opioid crisis - and today we are sending in reinforcements,” Sessions said in a statement. </p>

            If you want some additional insight into this move by Sessions, here are some links and facts.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Trump has so far proposed 65 U.S. Attorneys, of which 63 have been confirmed by the Senate. If you look at
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorneys_appointed_by_Donald_Trump">
               this list
              </a>
              , you will see something interesting. None were confirmed earlier than a single name in August of last year. There were 12 in September, 10 in October, 14 in November, 5 in December, 13 in January, 6 in February, and so on. Trump personally interviewed several of them,
              <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/trump-personally-interviews-us-attorney-candidates-for-new-york-and-dc">
               which is very unusual
              </a>
              .
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The accumulated backlog of approximately 30,000 sealed indictments/motions in the PACER system began in November, and proceeded at a fairly steady pace of about 4,000 new items per month. Assume that our suspicion is correct, and these are corruption/child sex trafficking/treason/organized crime related. It follows that someone new to the system would have to be brought in for each of the 93 districts, and that until a district got its U.S. Attorney, there would be no one to direct creation of these highly sensitive items in that district, and to sign off on them. What we have seen is roughly an 8-week lag between the monthly arrival of a dozen or so new U.S. Attorneys, and the generation of several thousand sealed indictments. (We could confirm this if someone has PACER access. For example, we could check to see if the sealed items added in November were generated for the districts that got new U.S. Attorneys in September.)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I've been unable to get a precise count of how many federal prosecutors there are. Supposedly the largest single district has 350. However, many districts are quite small. There must be thousands of them in total, because
              <a href="https://www.naausa.org/site/index.php/about-naausa/history">
               there are 1,500 members in their professional association
              </a>
              and they complain that lots of prosecutors haven't joined. Anyway, I think the way to read Sessions' remark about the 311 additional prosecutors is that they will be handling the more routine files that the existing staff have been forced to neglect because of the unprecedented organized-crime task they've been dealing with. You wouldn't assign a new hire to go after Al Capone.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            In short, yes, this is really great news, but it is just another small milestone in a process that has been going at its best possible speed for the past 17 months. First Trump had to take office. Then he had to get Sessions confirmed. Then Sessions had to recuse himself and get Rosenstein confirmed. Then they had to work through the 93 districts and find people for them (still not done!), and then the Senate had to confirm those people, and then they had to get up to speed and start issuing the sealed indictments.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's going to happen. The pedos are going to get taken down. But it's important to pace yourself psychologically, to understand what the obstacles are and why this has taken so long.

             God I sure hope so.  I am fully aware that Obama and Co. and the DS did everything they could while in power to hamper changes in the future.  They disabled many districts by getting either rid of judges or putting in place those that enforced their evil agenda.  So yes, I admit it will be a Herculean Task.  Thank you for your work and research.  I am praying daily.

             I know.  It is lodged in the back of my head.  Even though I was hopeful when reading, that number keeps popping up.  What are the chances that they needed that exact number. There are hundreds of other numbers.  Sigh.

             Opioids are killing thousands (don't know exact #) and most are white young people.  I have always been a person to believe that are all worthy, but we know why they are planning the deaths of white children.  This may not be the number one reason for our cause but it plays an important part.  We are not talking about Weed.  It is a much more powerful drug.

              Yeah the advertising is always for opioids but the enforcement action is always for Weed...   If there were enforcement for opioids we would see doctors going down for over-prescribing them.  If there were enforcement for opioids we would see the owners and top execs of pharma companies that pay doctors HUGE bonuses to push them going down in flames since that is the root of the problem ESPECIALLY through the VA.  NOpe... Legalize all drugs.  turn prisons into drug centers where a junkie can stay and get free drugs till they OD (encourage OD death).  If they want to get clean they can do so.  It would decimate the street value.  Run constant ads and social media stuff showing how useless and shitty drug users are and you will find people won't do it.  Hell, even weed is falling fom grace in the eyes of young people in legal states because it is something that grandma uses to treat her arthritis and dad uses to get to sleep since he is messed up still from his military service...  Legalization is making weed boring and mundane.    If you make it illegal and enforce it then there are rap songs written about "gettin rich or dye tryin'"  tier shit and kids love it.  It becomes the cool thing to do.  Legalize it and make it free and no one will want it.  Just like getting rid of an old piss soaked couch.  Put it on Craigslist for free and no one will take it.  Put it on the curb with a sign that says $20 and someone will steal it.

               I can't argue with anything you have just said.  I have been in favor of legalizing drugs now for about 10 years.  I figured it out too.  Yes, as usual the real criminals (Big Pharma) are getting off free.  I saw on the news that there are states that are suing the Drug Makers regarding Opioids.  We shall see where THAT goes.  States are having to foot the bill for the Antidote drug.  Yes, your plan sounds like a really good plan.  You should run for office.

                I am not very personable and a shitty public speaker.  I am FAR better as a small scale team-leader doing something dangerous and hard in a bad environment.  Everyone is a faggot now and there is not much of that left though so the world has little use for someone like me.

                 You are selling yourself short.  There are plenty of people willing to listen to a person without the gift for gab.  The most important people we need now are not those Slick Willy talkers but people that speak from the heart.  People that are Everyday Americans.  But do what you are comfortable and keep up with your Good Works.

                  I also live in a VERY liberal area.  Honestly I am afraid that I would be killed or swatted or ruby ridge'd if I was too vocal.  Family and I are extremely vulnerable to losing everything from a county agent or cops sadly.  This place would eat me alive if I "existed".  So I hide in the shadows.  Literally live off the grid and try to redpill on the internet.  If I do otherwise I will end up homeless again.  Not fun, let me tell ya.  Not enough people here think this way and those who do basically have to hide.  Land of the free right?

                   Wow.  Can you move?  You should not feel so miserable.  I know it is hard to leave an area.  But you sound like you are a prisoner.  Hope you are successful in keeping what you have.  I have read about others that live in the opposite political territory.  Hard either way.  You are doing the best you can.  Keep up the good work   Homelessness is one of their tricks.  The reason they do nothing about it, is it fuels their trafficking.  Do whatever you can to keep a roof over your head.

                    That is what caused all this bullshit.  Normal white families packing up and moving away from the best lands and best areas and leaving it to the scum.  No.  I won't move.  I fought for 20 years to gather enough wealth to buy this land.  I built my home on it even though the communists and faggots said I couldn't.  I built a system for electric power.  A system for hot running water (tough to do off the grid).  A cabin that costs less than a shitty used car but is comfortable and clean.  I heat it with wood from my land.  I eat from my garden and my animals.  I did it all with zero debt and zero horseshit laws.  I am almost entirely self-sufficient and I will die before I am driven off. As it stands I am going to homeschool my son with the Ron Paul Curriculum.  I encourage the opposite of what you said. In fact you should be ashamed of that comment to run away.  YOU need to do the opposite.  YOU need to move HERE.  You need to quit running and step up to the front lines and fight.  We are all taking the nation back right now and I. WILL. NOT. RUN.

                     You are right.  I should not have suggested that.  I am a fighter too.  But I had no idea what you did for yourself.  I thought from your statement that you were near homelessness. NO you should not move.  Also, I believe that many need to do what you have done and that is do for themselves.  You are to be commended for self sustaining your family.  Bless You.

                      By the book I am homeless now... Camping on my own land in an illegal homestead.  Pretty sad that this is the case in this nation.  How far we have fallen as a nation and a people.  If the wrong people found out what I am doing out here I would be driven from my land though by the government and the fines would take my land and savings.  This is what you support when you pay taxes.  What you support when you pay your mortgage.  This is what you support when you pay with a credit card.  We are still doomed.  Not enough has changed.  Not even close.

                       There is no getting around the Mortgage Scam if you live in a city or town.  The only way would be for millions to refuse to pay until things are reversed.  I have begged my husband to stop using the credit card but it is tempting he says.  I am even more rabid about using only cash since the put chips in the cards.  I hope you are able to continue in your spot.  It really sounds like heaven.  I see nothing wrong with anyone living off the land.  You should not have to pay taxes imo.  They would like to make all of us illegal in one way or another.

                        Don't give up the fight.  Try to get out.  The financial reset is coming hot and fast.  Sounds like you got your head on straight.   You should listen to Rogue Money on YouTube.  Also X22 report and x22 spotlight.  Bottomless redpill there.  Worry not.  I will not leave.

            It´s so weird with these numbers. We got 311, something with 6-11, then 9-11. I read somewhere that 311 is a code for child pornography in California.

             311 is a strange number.  Sessions could be sending a message because, as you point out, California Penal Code Sections 311 to 312.7 deal with "Obscene Matter," including child pornography:

            I saw this earlier today and thought this was a significant marker.  That's a lot of extra prosecutors.  Why does one need more prosecutors?  Because they have a lot of prosecutin' to do.  Prosecutors don't prosecute misdemeanors.
