            I've heard of the series, but never watched it. I went &amp; read some background to get me acquainted to this post; my brain is churning with questions in many different directions.
Btw, I went to Begotka's blog site, but seems his original post regarding his eye account is no longer there. I was then led to 'georgezipperer' blogsite that listed, it appears, much of Begotka's entry. I agree wholeheartedly, that many details of that area &amp; their prominent people reek of possible SR cult(s). Something in that latter blog, made me do a double-take. 
First off, forgive my ignorance if this is customary in certain parts of our country. I'd never heard of such, so it struck me as rather "odd": On the zipperers blog page, there's an old newspaper photo from Manitowoc Herald-Times, October 2005. It lists "trick-or-treat hours" for Manitowoc &amp; other neighboring cities &amp; villages. Am I crazy?!? I've heard of such for, say, a business or church offering designated hours for their advertised festivities. However, a schedule of designated trick-or-treating hours for an entire city to abide by??!? Is it simply a small town custom? My immediate thoughts were of a staggered schedule in connected towns for ease of nefarious benefit of satanists on their highest holiday of sacrifice. Ugh, I feel sick...

            Tysm for this post; I think you've convinced me to watch the series. I think you're so right: I think many of our cities are peppered with "clubs" operating &amp; behaving exactly like this. They hide in plain sight because they work in every type of industry &amp; organization that keep our communities going. 
May God continue to protect these brave people who fight this evil constantly first-hand! Spiritual warfare is very real &amp; prayer is such a powerful tool in defeating the enemy.

            The Fraternal Order of the Eagle.  That's the Freemason group involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Locals on reddit have confirmed a sex club.
           </p>
           <p>
            The University of Wisconsin, which is in Manitowoc,  is an MKUKTRA  site.  Several young woman from the University have gone missing / been killed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also a local reported that a cop had done a hit and run on a young bloke,  but couldn't get justice.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Devils Mountain Cult,  close by,  was set up by Anton LeVay.  Ed Edwards the serial Killers spent two years living with LeVay.
           </p>
           <p>
            A military base in Wisconsin has also received MKULTRA funding and stored alien craft.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Wisconsin has the highest or second highest number of Occult groups in the USA.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wisconsin was originally settled by Germans,  who bought their nasty Occult crap with them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Read the website,  Occult Wisconsin?  Weird Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've read of several hit and runs in Wisconsin,  I'm wondering if that's some sort of initiation for police?
           </p>
           <p>
            Like the cold kills for the Cherry Marine's,  mentioned in the YouTube videos by the Wife of a military assassin.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are too many creepy abductions and murders in that state.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Teresa's family was into the occult/sex club or MKUKTRA,  then it would explain why she was sleeping with married men (in such a small town).
           </p>
           <p>
            She was sleeping with some guy and taking photos of him and his wife naked.  Not normal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sacred Prostitution?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Dairy farm had a trust,  Teresa and Tim were in it,  but not Mike. Mike,  the family spokesman,  who didn't seem upset about her death/disapearance.
Big money.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the family were into this crap,  it's likely that Teresa was being shagged by her entire family.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they thought she was going to speak out,  or even if Mike thought she was going to speak out about him,  well that's enough for her family to want her dead.
           </p>
           <p>
            Teresa lived in a house on the family farm.  Media makes out that she was living independently, but she wasn't.  Her family didn't notice she was gone for four days?  Crap.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mine wanted me dead for speaking out.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are heaps of cases that seem to go nowhere in Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Journalist Timothy Charles......? 
Might have the name wrong,  he's a whistle blower on the child rape and trafficking by the FBI and CPS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Authorities are trying to arrest him at the moment.
           </p>
           <p>
            He believes that Teresa was murdered by the same group that killed Jon Benet Ramsay.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a lot of sick and criminal stuff going on here.

            For anyone who hasn't watched 'Making A Murderer' part 1 and part 2 on Netflix yet, I
            <strong>
             highly recommend it
            </strong>
            . It's really starting to look like a satanic-pedo-rape club of elites in a small Wisconsin city are responsible. You'll learn A LOT about how they conduct their nefarious activities. It's a microcosm of what's happening at the highest levels of the worldwide power elite.

             We're supposed to take the words of a random internet user who uses "666" in his youtube channel name for granted? No thanks. People need to stop being so quick to believe random people before they're properly vetted. I don't see how this is even remotely relevant to this sub though considering it has absolutely nothing to do with pedophilia, or politicians in DC.

               Before Mam i was kicked off every fourm (Before Facebook) in the manitowoc area so i made up names and used a IP scrambler to keep talking and DrNephilim666 was one of many......then Youtube came out and i used that name to make a anonymous account....it was to kind of to "shine on" or too piss off the "club" and its satanist cohorts....."Dr" meaning i think i am pretty smart and if i spent as much time in a regular academic forum as i have spent learning on the internet i would have a doctorate by now...lol... FYI most major universities put most of there lectures on youtube and i have watched hundreds of hours if not thousands watching them....(i am crippled with chronic pain and spend 20 hours a day in bed or a recliner) the "nephilim" part is i am pretty big 6'4" 260 and Nephilim is another word for giant and 666 is i was born in June of 1966. I regret not just starting a new channel but sluths would have found it and it would have been even a bigger deal then..............I am for the good and always have been!﻿

                DUH.  Sorry.  I have been looking at articles and thoughts are all over the place.  The fact that her body was buried in a hole and there was a fire there, and it was on Halloween, well there is enough to go on in order to research the possibility of a satanic crime taking place.  There was a post months ago I will see if I can find it.  It is about a pedo ring in Wisconsin.  Wisconsin goes way back and sick crimes go way back. Glad you noticed my comment.

                  thanks!  I will check it out.  So glad someone is coming to his aid.  People just tend to believe what's on the news and the verdicts.  Thank God though that some venues have kept interest going.
