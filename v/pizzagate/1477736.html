<p>I highly recommend reading the following article: 
&quot;Perhaps nowhere has this played out more clearly than in trying to help the courts decide whether someone is telling the truth or not.  In August 2014, Michael Brown, a young, unarmed man in Ferguson, MO was fatally shot by a police officer in broad daylight.  Witnesses to the event give dramatically different accounts of the events.  Did they perceive the events differently?  Do they remember them differently?  Are some of them lying?</p>
<p>Whether an account is accurate or not may have nothing to do with whether someone is intentionally trying to deceive.  Memory is not perfect and what you retrieve is not a veridical rendition of what you saw.  It is open to forgetting, failures to encode, distortions, biases and misattributions of the source.  But, the fact that it is imperfect, and that memory for an event may contain both accurate and inaccurate aspects does not mean the person must be intentionally lying.  It merely means that some portion of the memory is false.  How we perceive the world is driven not only by what enters our brain through our eyes, ears, and other sensory receptors, but also by our expectations.  Often called “top-down” influences, these expectations drive what we attend to and what we see and are themselves driven by how our past experiences have shaped us.  Two individuals with different backgrounds can therefore honestly witness the same event and “see” it differently.&quot; <a href="http://www.dana.org/Publications/ReportOnProgress/Truth,_Lies,_and_False_Memories__Neuroscience_in_the_Courtroom/">http://www.dana.org/Publications/ReportOnProgress/Truth,_Lies,_and_False_Memories__Neuroscience_in_the_Courtroom/</a></p>
<p>When trials begin and victims testify, we must remember that these people have suffered traumatic events and some of their memories may be distorted, but we should not simply assume that they are all lying or they have had false memories implanted by someone with an agenda.</p>',

            The people in high positions of power are some sick mofos. I'm sure they're doing good things with it but the bad things.... I just find it strange that CERN's own logo is 666

             https://home.cern/
            </a>
            , they created the WWW protocol. WWW in Hebrew = 666. Why are they fucking with alternate realities? They have no idea of the evil they're unleashing.

            These people can't stop the victim from knowing what happened and from comparing it with other victims globaly.   for example,  the following video shows people in France who don't know each other but share the same experiences.   The same is true of victims in UK and Belguim, etc.

            These pedo-criminals have a set routine and a victim in one part of the world can identify with others in other parts of the world because it ends up being globally influenced.
           </p>
           <p>
            What will these so-called experts do when the victim information matches up to other stories globally?   What will they say then?     Then they'll start another war or a trauma or catastrophe to distract people so the focus is taken off this and people move on.... while their sickness with children continues.
           </p>
           <p>
            We must not allow this.  We must have zero tolerance and continue to identify.

            SJWs might actually ally with us here with their whole "never blame the victim" rhetoric. We need to put aside our differences and unite to go after the real enemy, the elites.

            Well there are somethings you never forget such as being abused. You might not remember much but you will remember the basics which is the important part. Details are filled by our brain on a daily basis but we do remember if something we consider significant has happened to us.

            This falls right in line with another of my posts today that it seems "they" have finally determined an agreed upon plan they all agreed upon and are moving forward with implementation. Fortunately I believe they are operating in a very different world. Can't speak for everyone of course but I won't be distracted

            The problem is that   global therapists would be able to come forward to compare stories and that's where they'd get nailed 2 ways:  one in that the stories would likely match, and two in that  it could match a global connection more easily.
           </p>
           <p>
            UK therapists have documentation, as do French therapists,  and the renowned Belgian  therapist, to name a few countries, all    having decades of experience with victims.
            <br/>
            Cross referencing  global therapists  would be easy. 
These media shite sure are trying to cover up and discredit though aren't they!

            Good post.
           </p>
           <p>
            You're right to be very concerned. It's been suggested by experts that MOST kids who report this kind of abuse aren't believed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a classic case that should horrify you - most of you have heard of the Hampstead case in the UK. A brother and sister (ages 6 and 9 I think?)
            <strong>
             described and sketched in detail tattoos and other distinguishing marks on the genitals/groin
            </strong>
            of the teachers abusing the siblings, medical exams proved long-term sexual abuse, and claims that 20 "special children" also have a devil tattoo on their genitals (with the exception of these two kids "since their mother is not part of the cult". However, no charges were made.
           </p>
           <p>
            Shortly after the kids were interviewed (the full videos below), the kids' statements were claimed to be coerced. Subsequent reports stated that the police officer who interviewed the kids was a former employee of the father, Dearman, who was implicated in these crimes.

             Yes,  I think some of them aren't believed because their minds already have  dissociative  disorder, or have split in some way,  or developed other disorders,  causing them to be unstable,  so people don't believe them.
             <br/>
             They would be more believable if they came forward to press charges against all parties,  but then again,  as we see the system is not on their side, so there's fear of going through hell in the legal system after having already gone through hell.
            </p>
            <p>
             We need to get a meme out, and lots of videos on media asking victims to come forward,  and as a global community we will support them to take legal action as heroes.   This forum could have a tab to link to other media where they could get support from global communities as they step forward to be heard and to get legal aide.

            Funny the hypocrisy, the entire holocaust story is based on victim memories, not a shred of physical evidence, photos of body piles were mostly victims of firebombing and starvation form supply routes being bombed out by Allies... Use this dissonance against them

            Yes, they already tested this theory by making up "Mandela Effect" to see how many halfwits would bite.

             I'm one of those halfwits you speak of.  So what can one be sure of then. If I were to ask you that for $1000 answer how Darth Vedder announce to how they were related.  You can go of common knowledge and answer what is embedded in your brain, but keep in mind that it's a good amount of money so you research your answer after your research you second guess yourself. For final anewer you submit what you knew in your heart, brain, and spine to be true.  You go with "Luke, I am your father" and loose the price.when you contest you are presented with all kinds of different Web results claiming the correct answer is "No, I am your father.  In addition now that I have your attention can you tell me the shape of the earth, if we landed on the moon,  did dinosaurs ever exist,  was Hitler reasonably kind hearted, and the purpose of Egyptian Pyramids?  Keep in mind that all info/evidence on these creeps is also in plain sight just as the answers to the questions I and many others have.

             With that said check out what I wrote to someone who like many off us are in need of something real and everlasting IE. KNOWLEDGE

            <pre><code>Let me tell you something,the reddit group that got banned "the bearstein bears" introduced an interesting topic that allowed me to disconnect from the constant great discoveries you'll be posting. The great hope I got from the mandella effect was my belief that maybe in a different time line these self-righteous scum would keep getting away with the evil they have been casting upon us. BUT NOT IN THIS TIMELINE MOTHAFUCKERS. keep it up folks, all mayor wars last many years and this one is the first war that is being fought with an actual purpose.

             I bet you have absolute zero knowledge on dwave/dwave2 and what the company claims they're doing with it.
