             </p>
             <p>
              I actually think most people here might agree it's not falsifiable, and if you do agree it's not how is advocating harassing podesta on twitter acceptable? Since most people seem to agree that there's no hard evidence.

               But there is 100% proof that him and his peeps were directly responsible for the violence directed at Trump supporters (other crimes as well)..but that alone makes him deserving of a verbal beatdown on Twitter.

               Even just some reasonable explanations for some of these coincidences, the emails, the use of certain words and pictures, would go some way towards making people think again, if the explanations actually made sense. But no one has offered any explanation, no one has gone through all the evidence debunking it, so the only conclusion to be drawn is that either they want us to think this about them, or they know it can't be debunked because it's true.

                I would argue that if these people are innocent then to these people pizzagate just looks like an angry mob. I also think that there is no explanation that could be given that would ever be enough for the pizzagate people.  There is that one video of the protesters who went to comet and asked him about some of the pictures like the girl taped to the table and he gave answers to them. In the comments section you could see that people were ripping apart his answers, which were very reasonable and plausible.
And once you've submitted yourself to the mob you're at their mercy. Why did he answer this but he suspiciously remains silent about THIS?! Nothing will ever be enough.

                 Yeah I saw that and I agree that the girl taped to the table isn't that sinister or crazy, to some people it obviously looks awful, but I can see how kids could do that for fun. So he explained that one away, fine. But his instagram posts, is such a teeny tiny part of it anyway, but there are a lot of dubious references in there that are just totally inappropriate given that the pictures are of kids. But still, that's not evidence on its own that there's been any wrongdoing. But when you look at it all, it starts to come across very odd - you could misinterpret some photos maybe, but some of the comments were difficult to misinterpret. You could overlook the weird artwork of adults having sex with children and the adult themed posters for events for all ages, and on its own that strange video of the woman talking and laughing about everyone having their 'preferences' when the audience calls out that someone loves little kids, on its own that's maybe just one weird thing. And the fact that this guy is friends with people really high up in the Democrats to the point he can ask them for last minute favours and they'll do it for him, that on its own would be weird but maybe he just got lucky and happened to make friends with them. And the fact that John and Tony Podesta also like weird art depicting children in various states of undress and discomfort, I guess you could say that's what brought them together perhaps, in an innocent way, just an innocent appreciation for art involving child abuse.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And then if it was only the fact that Alefantis owns a construction company that did work on a house in DC that he owns half of, if that was the only weird thing about him, yeah sure that would be nothing to worry about. The fact that this building has the word KIDS painted out the front wall and a little statue of a child by the door, reminiscent of the little statues paedophiles used to communicate with one another what children were 'available' on the island of Jersey in the UK, during that horrific pedo ring/child abuse cover up that was revealed a few years ago - those facts are definitely weird, but on their own you could probably dismiss them and explain it away.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I mean, that is just about Alefantis, that doesn't even get into the mountains and mountains of things that have been discovered that seem to have little to do with Comet ping pong directly, but which point to a global operation of trafficking children and humans as slaves and for sex.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Do you see what I mean, though? That you take one of those weird things/weird connection/weird coincidence/weird behaviour etc and you can dismiss it, but the more weird things and coincidences you find, the less likely it is that they are a coincidence. I didn't even mention the use of known paedophile symbols in the logos of two of the restaurants on the same street as CPP - another coincidence that happens to relate to paedophilia. Or the Podesta emails, or the links between the Podestas and the Clintons and known, convicted paedophiles like Hastert and Epstein and Clement Freud. Or the Clinton Foundation UK branch's use of the same address in London that at least two known UK paedophile politicians also have their businesses registered at. Another coincidence? Clinton's interest in Laura Silsby, who was caught trying to illegally take 30 children out of Haiti, and her role in getting Silsby released so she could change her name and get a job working for Amber Alert, a company which puts an alert out on missing children?
                </p>
                <p>
                 That's just from memory, there's loads more and all of it evidenced. So you tell me, what will ever be enough for YOU to agree that perhaps this isn't 'fake news' after all, perhaps we aren't all crazy, perhaps we are decent honest people doing our best in a shitty shitty world to try to expose horrific crimes and save little children. What would be enough for YOU to agree that perhaps this at least deserves serious attention and a proper investigation instead of being dismissed out of hand, as has happened historically with many similar cases, such as the Catholic Church child abuse, or the various establishment pedo rings in the UK, Belgium, Norway, Australia etc?

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But it's not true according to their own link. The linked document says:

                  Clinton brokered the release of all the missionaries, except for the group leader, Laura Silsby.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Interesting non-essential side note, if you look at
                  <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/794247777756860417">
                   this shameful, monumentally embarrassing tweet from Wikileaks
                  </a>
                  where they link to an early pizzagate thread on the_youknowwho, you can see the original formulation was that "One of the first things Hillary did when she took over the scene in Haiti was get Laura Silsby off the hook..." This has been edited to say "the Clintons" instead of "Hillary" because the linked 46-page document doesn't even mention Hillary's name. And besides, "the Clintons took over the scene?" The outcome for Silsby was determined by a trial with a judge and lawyers and testimony from the parents of the "orphans" and all kinds of neat non-Clinton-y stuff.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So what happened to Silby? Again, from the pizzagaters' own link:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Despite Silsby’s stated intent to take the children over the border to an unauthorized orphanage and her connections to human traffickers such as Torres-Puello, the courts eventually dropped the kidnapping and criminal association charges against her. Silsby was instead convicted under the additional charge of organizing illegal travel, sentenced to time served (3 months and 8 days), and released on May 17, 2010. In the end, her sentence was based on the least polemic charge against her. The pressing issue—whether Silsby intended to deliver the children into trafficking rings or grey adoption markets—was not addressed or resolved.
Rather than turning on Silsby’s actions, the decision in her case appeared to turn on the actions of the parents. Judge Bernard Saint-Vil explained that his decision was based on the Haitian parents’ testimony that they had “[given] their kids away voluntarily.” Similarly, defense lawyer Jorge Puello stated that the missionaries “willingly accepted kids they knew were not orphans because the parents said they would starve otherwise.” Another trial attorney for the missionaries, Aviol Fleurant, argued that “[t]he parents’ testimony means no law was broken and ‘we can’t talk any more about trafficking of human beings.’”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  More bombshells about the people who were "trafficking in Haitian orphans," from the same document. Pizzagate investigators will never highlight or mention this:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Americans denied any wrongdoing and said they had been trying to help children left orphaned and destitute by the Haitian earthquake. They said Puello had approached their relatives and church, offering his help. It turned out that the children who were with the U.S. missionaries had living parents, many of whom testified they had voluntarily handed their offspring to the Americans in the hope they would be given an education and a better life.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Pizzagate theorists will point to a lawyer Torres to try to make Silsby and crew look worse, but just read this excerpt from an
                  <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/fugitive-who-posed-lawyer-following-haitian-earthquake-sentenced-3-years-federal">
                   ICE News Release
                  </a>
                  to put it all into context:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In early 2010, Torres surfaced in the Dominican Republic posing as a lawyer representing American church workers detained in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake in that country. Torres convinced a church that he was Jorge Torres Puello, an international lawyer and president of "Puello Consulting" in the Dominican Republic.
Torres obtained a monetary retainer from the families of the detained missionaries and began representing himself to the Haitian court and international media as the attorney/spokesman for them. However, U.S. authorities recognized him as Jorge Torres when media reports showed images of the "alleged" lawyer wearing a suit and carrying a brief case.
                 </p>

                  An extradition package was prepared and sent to representatives in the Dominican Republic. Torres was arrested, detained and extradited to the United States to face the 2003 alien smuggling charges in Vermont. He pleaded guilty to the charges.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  To sum up this Torres business, the dude faked his identity, offered his services (as in HE approached THEM), bamboozled the missionaries, pretended to be their lawyer until he got extradited.

                 <p>
                  So Bill Clinton was asked to go in and straighten this business out. Hillary Clinton emailed someone for details about the situation. There are so many leaps that have to be made here to get to satanic-pedo-ritual-sex-slavery ring it's not even funny.

                  And so, after all this, Pizzagate investigators go berserk over

                   this email

                  What would convince me? I would say a police investigation that turned up something like
                  <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42108748/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/massive-online-pedophile-ring-busted-cops/#.WFA0BHX6xhE">
                   the recent one out of Norway
                  </a>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What would convince me that an investigation needed to take place? I think those things usually start with accusations of specific incidents either like sexual harassment claims or specific claims from a witness or general sexual misconduct that may imply something illegal is happening.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also, about the Alefantis stuff you just listed most of those things don't even involve him.  He couldn't explain most of those things away, this is my point about the evidence becoming so thin it becomes impossible to refute.  One of my theories about pizzagate is that people who believe it are mostly from rural areas, and I don't mean that to sound at all condescending but the stuff about comet like the shows and things really are just edgy bullshit you would see sometimes if you lived in a city.  Like that video of the exchange between the performer and the audience. I guess that could be two pedophiles speaking openly about pedophilia but are people
                  <em>
                   likely
                  </em>
                  to do that? to literally say exactly what illegal activity they're involved in in what looks like a public performance?  You know most of the time I wish the pizzagate people would just ask themselves 'do people behave that way?'. If you were conducting a pedophile ring from a house would you literally  just spray paint 'kids' on the outside of it?  If you had a 'killroom' would you take a picture of it and post it publicly to instagram and then literally call it exactly what it is in a hashtag?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I didn't want to get into a conversation about evidence I just want people to think about if the people
                  <em>
                   are
                  </em>
                  innocent at what point does it end? I think that this will never end because there is nothing that could disprove the vague but intense suspicion it's founded on.  I don't really care about public figures like the Podestas but what's happened with Alefantis I think has shown that relatively regular people not in the public eye can be dragged down into this and harassed.  JUST BE CAREFUL is my message.  If you see a suspicious email call it that and LEAVE IT at that.

               There's so much circumstantial evidence though that it makes it statistically pretty near impossible that all of these different things and people and connections and symbols that all have something to do with child sexual abuse are all merely coincidence. The chances of ALL of these connections being purely coincidence and not linked by that common theme for a reason (i.e. pedo ring) is infinitely small.

                That's interesting I would've thought most people here would say there's not enough evidence.
Also, I would say that your logic about circumstantial evidence is piling up is how most conspiracy theories work. The accusations are so abstract and the evidence is so thin it becomes impossible to disprove.  Especially given the fact that pizzagate is built on conversations and pictures that seem suspicious to some people, but suspicious is just a feeling some people have it cant be disproved. One of my earlier comments is about this, be wary because conspiracy theories only grow wider not deeper.

                Anyone who criticizes the movement is implicated as being complicit in it themselves. The witch hunt continues. 
My suggestion is just don't harass these people online, can't most people get behind that? Just PR wise that makes sense.
