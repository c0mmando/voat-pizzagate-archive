She is now known as Laura Silsby-Gayler, on the executive team of the company AlertSense (see <a href="http://archive.is/axolK">http://archive.is/axolK</a> ). Searching the name of Silsby\'s non-profit led me here: <a href="http://archive.is/h8LJb">http://archive.is/h8LJb</a>. On this page, Silsby\'s email address is revealed. I searched her address, and I came across this:

The content is the same, but notice who uploaded this version: doktorgreen.

<p>This is Doktor Green\'s profile and it gives access to some of the threads he\'s been posting in on this &quot;Nagual Forum&quot;. A quick search reveals that &quot;Nagual&quot; refers to &quot;a human being that can transform spiritually or physically into an animal form&quot;. (<a href="http://archive.is/j651V">http://archive.is/j651V)</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/2O3H7">http://archive.is/2O3H7</a>
On this thread, notice doktorgreen\'s response to &quot;Julio&quot;: &quot;Some people say that ritual components and applied discipline are to distract/occupy the mind while the spirit slips past.&quot;</p>
<p>This &quot;Julio&quot; later posts a thread titled &quot;Everyday Cult Leaders are here at the nagual forums&quot;:
<a href="http://archive.is/9weEg">http://archive.is/9weEg</a>
The first response is by a user who has deleted their account, but they hint that Julio is upset with THEM in particular and believes they are a cult leader? Could this deleted account be Silsby\'s? She did have a prominent following. Could Silsby\'s organization\'s status as a Christian non-profit be a facade? The New Life Children\'s Refuge could have possibly been some sort of Nagual cult looking for new recruits (taking advantage of the chaos in Haiti and posing as a Christian group).

&quot;After 4 weeks, your subconscious will be programmed.&quot;  Sounds like mind control.
&quot;Do not fall asleep during the practice. You must practice this every night for 4 weeks. If you miss a night or fall asleep, you must start over! 4 WEEKS! &quot;
&quot;Becoming aware of your color will be your first indication that you have set up dreaming.&quot; Remember this. Will return to another connection between doktorgreen and dreaming.</p>
<p>More research needs to be done into this forum!</p>

<p>I\'m not sure how solid this all is, as I haven\'t had the time to carefully read every word, but there is a lot of VERY scary stuff that unraveled simply by trying to get a better idea of who Laura Silsby is. All of it seems to somehow relate back to human trafficking.</p>',

            There have been so many Dr. Greens recalled by survivors of different programs that I think it was probably used as a code name with "patients" (victims) to signify a particular role. Like you would call someone Sarge because of the assignment he is on. You might have a designated Dr. Green on duty, whether or not that as his real name.

            Programmers and Places
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s difficult to figure out who the original programmer of this satanic project was, due to the substantial amount of disinformation and cross-contamination propagated by the "powers that be."
           </p>
           <p>
            The two that went by the color-coded name of Dr. Green are a Jewish doctor named Dr. Gruenbaum, who supposedly collaborated with the Nazis during WWII, and Dr. Josef Mengele, whose trademark of cold blooded and calculating brutality has not only scarred the souls of survivors from Auschwitz, but also a countless number of victims throughout the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mengele’s direct involvement at the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp was suspiciously downplayed during the Nuremberg Trials, and consequently no intensified effort by the U.S. and it’s allies was directed toward his capture.[13]
           </p>
           <p>
            As a means to confuse serious investigators as to his whereabouts, U.S. officials would report Mengele being a non-threatening recluse in Paraguay or Brazil, or that he was simply dead (the "Angel of Death" miraculously must have come back to life at least five different times).
           </p>
           <p>
            His unprecedented research, at the expense of thousands of lives, undoubtedly was a significant bonus to U.S. interests. Besides using the pseudonym of Dr. Green, survivors knew him as Vaterchen (daddy), Schoner Josef (beautiful Joseph), David and Fairchild. A gracefully handsome man of slight stature, Mengele would disarm people with his gentle demeanor, while at other times, he would explode into violent rages.[14]
           </p>
           <p>
            Other characteristics remembered by survivors were the cadence of his shiny black boots as he paced back and forth and his "I-love-you/l-love-you-not" daisy game.
           </p>
           <p>
            When he pulled off the last daisy petal, he would maliciously torture and kill a small child in front of the other child he was programming. Distraught survivors also recalled being thrown naked into cages with monkeys, who were trained to viciously abuse them. Evidently, Mengele enjoyed reducing people to the level of animals. He also would purposely restrain his victims from crying, screaming, or showing any excessive emotion.
           </p>

            Even stranger, recalled that "Dr. Green" was mentioned by a survivor of abuse as "Dr. Joseph Mengele."
           </p>
           <p>
            Fortunately, Mengele is officially dead.

            But he did survive to work on "twins" in Brazil.

            I read the document regarding DC Hammond discussing Dr. Green known as the Greenbaum Speech. I was distraught with this mind altering stuff Satantic groups do to children.  Here is a youtube associated with this facility.

            It's been said before but I'll say it again why is a woman who was jailed for child trafficking in Haiti "on the executive team" of the company who's software manages Amber Alerts which helps fight child trafficking?

             . Voaters spend thousands of hours researching and compiling compelling evidence - but all we've learnt is that even the most blatant, obvious, red-handed 'smoking gun' such as the entire Silsby scandal are useless.

              I disagree. This is the information we need to focus on and get out there. Information like this is always overshadowed by more dramatic stuff like the kill room and spirit cooking, which makes the entire thing look ridiculous. We need to focus on red pilling normies about Epstein, Silsby, The Elpida Foundation, etc.

            In addition to the definition you found for "Nagual" I have encountered others. The one that I have remembered for years is Native American. The Nagual is a term for "All Things Which Cannot Be Named".

             NAGAS appear in all asian cultures. If you practice qigong you know about Naga's (and if you dont get a new teacher)
            </p>
            <p>
             In the great epic Mahabharata, the depiction of nagas tends toward the negative. An epic calls them "persecutors of all creatures", and tells us "the snakes were of virulent poison, great prowess and excess of strength, and ever bent on biting other creatures" (Book I: Adi Parva, Section 20). At some points within the story, nagas are important players in many of the events narrated in the epic, frequently no more evil nor deceitful than the other protagonists, and sometimes on the side of good.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81ga">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81ga
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The epic frequently characterizes nagas as having a mixture of human and serpent-like traits. Sometimes it characterizes them as having human traits at one time, and as having serpent-like traits at another. For example, the story of how the naga prince Shesha came to hold the world on his head begins with a scene in which he appears as a dedicated human ascetic, "with knotted hair, clad in rags, and his flesh, skin, and sinews dried up owing to the hard penances he was practising." Brahma is pleased with Shesha, and entrusts him with the duty of carrying the world. At that point in the story, Shesha begins to exhibit the attributes of a serpent. He enters into a hole in the Earth and slithers all the way to bottom, where he then loads the Earth onto his head. (Book I: Adi Parva, Section 36.)
            </p>
            <p>
             The great nemesis of the nagas in the Mahabharata is the gigantic eagle-king Garuda. Garuda and the nagas began life as cousins. The sage Kashyapa had two wives (amongst his 13 wives, all prajapati Daksha's daughters), Kadru and Vinata, the former of whom desired many offspring, and the latter of whom desired few but powerful offspring. Each got her wish. Kadru laid 1000 eggs which hatched into snakes, and Vinata laid two, which hatched into the charioteer of Surya the sun god and Garuda. Through a foolish bet, Vinata became enslaved to her sister, and as a result Vinata's son Garuda was required to do the bidding of the snakes. Though compliant, he chafed and built up a grudge that he would never relinquish. When he asked the snakes what he would have to do in order to release his mother, Vinata, from her bondage, they told him he would have to bring them amrita, the elixir of immortality. Garuda stole the elixir from the gods and brought it to the serpents in fulfillment of their requirement, but through a ruse prevented them from partaking of it and achieving immortality. From that point onward, he regarded them as enemies and as food. (Book I: Adi Parva, Sections 16ff.)[citation needed]

             The Sanskrit word Naga
The word Naga in the Sanskrit language means snake or serpent. It seems likely that the Naga people were a serpent-worshipping group who were later described as serpents themselves in ancient Indian literature. Ayus people were Serpent cult people from the beginning. Serpents are reptiles with "hoods". Snakes are reptiles without hoods. Maha Vishnu's Shesha NAAG was a huge serpent with 5 hoods. That needs to be differentiated from Shiva's one headed snake.

             GARUDA is the natural enemy of the Nagas-
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Garuda is known as the eternal sworn enemy of the Nāga serpent race and known for feeding exclusively on snakes, such behavior may have referred to the actual short-toed eagle of India. The image of Garuda is often used as the charm or amulet to protect the bearer from snake attack and its poison, since the king of birds is an implacable enemy and "devourer of serpent". Garudi Vidya is the mantra against snake poison to remove all kinds of evil.[3]
            </p>
            <p>
             as a practictioner of qigong/bagua and other ways derived from the Bon Po sect (that the Buddhists usurped and wiped out) have the best understanding of the Naga's IMO I can tell you that they always have Garuda present as protection from the evil serpent gods.
