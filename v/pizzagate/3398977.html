<p>This is a woman who sounds and seems entirely honest. What she says fits with what we know, and the really dark stuff that hasn\'t made the recent news, ties in with what we learned during Pizzagate (ie, that human sacrifice and practice of worshipping evil, raping and eating children, etc., are real). She remembers being in the tunnels under Little Saint James. She goes into a lot of detail that may be too much for many. Because it\'s impossible to listen to this woman and not know she is absolutely telling the truth. Listen to her voice, especially when she speaks of being 5. She speaks like a little girl, and when she talks of past abuse, she speaks about herself in the second person. Her voice has pain in it at the appropriate times, and she does not have any passion behind her words, she is not trying to persuade anyone, she is just retelling her story. She sounds resigned and tired about it. There is no sense of her making anything up. Worth a watch.</p>

              I wasn't just basing it on Amazon comments, VZ. The claims just aren't tenable. Abused "in the womb" huh? And this person claims to know all about Epstein's tunnels, but never spoke of it until QAnon exposed it?
             </p>
             <p>
              We can't afford to be pushing fake news around here. Those details increase the odds the Amazon reviews are accurate.
             </p>
             <p>
              If evidence comes up that this woman really is legit, ping me and I will change the flair.

               What kind of evidence could possibly show she is legit I am not asking you to flair this as legit, but as you originally had it, "unverified". Her testimony is being referred to by other researchers as if it is legit, for waht that's worth. Flagging it as unverified takes all the pressure off of Voat as you are officially NOT pushing fake news, you're simply allowing me to have free speech and allowing this woman's words to be considered by the community. @-think

              after watching that video ... I am thinking about Epstein victims and class warfare. The ultra rich against the poor.  Like ancient Ireland druids burning kids in those big wicker monuments.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am thinking these rich people who run with Naomi Campbell etc. are beyond redemption ... they cannot have their views changed or their criminality cured.
             </p>
             <p>
              Somehow they need all to be gotten rid of.  I don;t know how,  They own the technology and the goons who protect them.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am sick after reading this short segment -
              <a href="https://9east71.home.blog/2019/08/26/st-tropez/">
               https://9east71.home.blog/2019/08/26/st-tropez/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              And this story of the Hilton Hotels heir.  I guess  ultra rich molest their own children and make perverts out of them. And the heirs do nothing, contribute  nothing to society, ever.
             </p>
             <p>
              There needs to be a maximum wage like there a minimum wage and maybe  ultra-rich estates can only have x-per cent go into heirs as all they do is grow up to be rakes.
             </p>
             <p>
              The whole  money system is corrupting.

            Read the early history of the christian religion and tell me that shit isnt crazy. Most christians didnt believe in christ like he is presented today. I am not saying dont believe, i just think if you are going to know the history of the thing. I think it is a hard thing for christianity to face the origins of its religion. Also, I am guessing by the way you write you are not catholic, so therefore are protestant and must know the teachings of martin luther and his book "the jews and their lies".

             It's sad that people see mention of "my walk with Christ" or Jesus, or God to be synonymous with religion. Jesus has made Himself known to me throughout my life, but especially when i had a near death experience. People who want to follow Jesus know there are prayers and practices, and ways of living and thinking that bring us closer to Him. As well, our practice (WWJD) not only heals us, but it helps heal this world, and helps Jesus to do His job to save us from this evil that we have no way of combating otherwise. I get lazy in my practice, and anything that lights a fire under me to really get serious with my faith and prayer, etc., is highly valuable.
            </p>
            <p>
             This relates to Pizzagate because without the belief that there is something more powerful than this network of occultists and satanists, i wouldn't be studying this stuff. I would have gone mad by now. But i see this as 'the darkness before the dawn', as i sign that the Second Coming is upon us and that's why all this ancient evil is being outed for all to see right now. This has ZERO to do with any man-made religion. Jesus comes to people who've never been to church. My pagan-Jewish family did not introduce me to Jesus, but He came right into my bedroom when i was a teen and i've been seeking to get closer to Him (on and off) ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
             To post a video like the one above made my uneasy, it is probably the more evil thing i've ever heard coming from first hand experience like this. I wondered if spreading such a story around would hurt more than it helped. But hearing how diligently the dark side is working to manifest their desires, to manifest evil and pain on innocents, makes me want to pray 100 times harder and more diligently. It creates warriors when we need them most - right now! If these sickos are doing satanic masses all the time and sacrificing babies daily, the least we can do is get our own act together and help Jesus overthrow this. It strengthens my relationship with Christ/Jesus/God to know what He is REALLY dealing with here on earth, it highlights the REASON to have a spiritual practice and to follow THE top exorcist of all time, the ONE who can fix the problems that gave rise to Pizzagate and Epstein.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just learning about this evil does not heal it, it does not solve the problem. Ans for survivors of childhood sexual abuse, to watch all of this come out in media, and for NO justice to be done by humans (as our justice system is too far gone at this point, infiltrated by satanists) it is an extremely painful time... unless we look to God and remember He can handle this, and we can help.

            Interesting. I didn't realize any survivor had ever claimed there were tunnels under Little St. James prior to QAnon pointing out Ray Chandler's Instagram picture and noting the connection.
