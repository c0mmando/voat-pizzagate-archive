<p>According to The Daily Mail, actress Allison Mack, 35, who played Clark Kent\'s friend Chloe Sullivan on Smallville, is allegedly second in command of a secret sex cult.</p>
<p>The cult, called DOS, is allegedly a secret society for the highest-ranking female members within the self-help group NXIVM, which was founded by Keith Raniere. In October, The New York Times reported of a secret sorority that branded women, starved them and beat them if they didn\'t recruit enough “slaves.”</p>
<p>Frank Parlato, a former spokesman for NXIVM (pronounced Nex-e-um), stated on his blog that Mack supervises DOS, which brands women; he alleged that Mack is only second to Raniere in terms of seniority. On Wednesday, Parlato told The Sun that an “Emmy Award-winning actress” is a “key recruiter” for DOS.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail reports that the alleged actress is Mack.</p>
<p>Parlato wrote on his blog, The Frank Report, that Mack created DOS to become a “force for good and a female force against evil.”</p>
<p>The Daily Mail reports:</p>
<p>Ex-members have detailed how only the most loyal NXIVM female members are offered the ability to try out for DOS. In order to join, prospective new members must allegedly turn over damning personal information as a show of trust. But ex-members say that information is actually used to keep members from speaking out about the horrifying reality of the group. themselves, and it spreads down from there like a pyramid scheme.</p>
<p>Frank alleged that women in the group are kept on a 500-800 calorie a day diet; that “slaves” must immediately answer their masters at all times and are beaten on their buttocks if they do not recruit other “slaves,” and that Mack introduced corporal punishment to the group.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail adds:</p>
<p>When women are deemed worthy to enter the group, they are ordered to strip at an initiation ceremony and then branded with a symbol that includes both Raniere and Mack\'s initials. The blog also says that there\'s yet another tier of the cult above DOS. Women who perform well in DOS may also be invited to join Raniere\'s harem.</p>
<p>NXIVM has responded to the charges, stating: “The allegations relayed in the story are built upon sources, some of which are under criminal investigation or already indicted, who act as a coordinated group. We will explore any and all legal remedies to correct these lies.”</p>
<p>Mack has stated on her personal website that Raniere “mentored [her] in her study of acting and music … As such, she has developed a deep connection to the nature of humanity as it relates to acting as an art form, and a tool for personal evolution.”</p>
<p>The New York Post has reported that former Dynasty star Catherine Oxenberg met with prosecutors in New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman\'s office to discuss her daughter India, who is a member of the group. Oxenberg said, “Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story. Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”</p>',

             in 2011, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein hired the firm following the bad press he received after rekindling his friendship with Prince Andrew. As of December 2014, the matter was still before courts with Sitrick and Company claiming Epstein still has not paid an outstanding $103,500 bill

             In October 2017, Sitrick and Company was hired by Harvey Weinstein after news reports about the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, his subsequent firing by The Weinstein Company, and the resignation of attorney Lisa Bloom.
