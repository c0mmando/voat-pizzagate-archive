<p>“Turn it off!\': Ex-NXIVM member describes Clockwork Orange-style \'fright study\'”</p>
<p>“WARNING: This story contains graphic language and descriptions of extreme violence
Josh Bloch, Kathleen Goldhar, Anita Elash and Dave Pizer - CBC News
October 30, 2018”</p>
<p>“I can\'t watch this!</p>
<p>Why the f--k are you showing me this?</p>
<p>Those are the words Jennifer Kobelt remembers screaming as she sat in front of a television in a dark, empty former Italian restaurant near Albany, N.Y., wearing a sensor-filled cap, as she watched the horrific gang rape scene from the 1988 Jodie Foster film The Accused.</p>
<p>She said there was a camera in front of her, recording her facial expressions, and a machine behind her, which she assumed was tracking her brainwaves.</p>
<p>This scene Kobelt says she found herself in may seem similar to one from another film, Stanley Kubrick\'s ultraviolent 1971 classic, A Clockwork Orange.</p>
<p>Only Kobelt wasn\'t a sadistic rapist being forced to undergo a new form of violence-aversion therapy in a dystopian Britain. She was an actor from Vancouver and member of a self-help training organization called NXIVM, who had agreed to help her friend and fellow member, Dr. Brandon Porter, with one of his research studies.</p>
<p>She didn\'t ask many questions before agreeing to participate in the study. She just assumed it had something to do with unlocking human potential and making the world a better place — NXIVM\'s stated mission.</p>
<p>The experiment took place in August 2016, she said, nearly two years before NXIVM founder and guru Keith Raniere and key members of his inner circle would be accused of running what prosecutors in New York describe as an &quot;organized criminal enterprise.&quot;</p>
<p>Authorities allege a secret women\'s empowerment sorority linked to NXIVM was actually set up to recruit sex &quot;slaves&quot; for Raniere, whose initials were branded on the women\'s pelvises during an initiation ceremony.</p>
<p>Those accused have pleaded not guilty to all the charges, which include allegations of extortion, money laundering, sex trafficking and forced labour conspiracy.</p>
<p>Watch: Everything you need to know about NXIVM in under four minutes</p>
<p>Porter faces a hearing before New York\'s State Board for Professional Medical Conduct for his alleged role in conducting the experiment Kobelt underwent, described in documents as the &quot;fright study.&quot;</p>
<p>None of Kobelt\'s allegations, or those in the board\'s documents, have been proven in an administrative hearing.</p>
<p>\'What\'s going on for you, Jenn?\'</p>
<p>The scene from The Accused left Kobelt crying, shaking and rocking back and forth in her chair, but the worst was yet to come, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;What\'s going on for you, Jenn?&quot; Kobelt said Porter asked her.</p>
<p>She said she couldn\'t stop crying for what seemed like 15 minutes. She doesn\'t remember much about the next few scenes she was shown, other than they were &quot;probably happy clips.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Porter said he had one more clip to show her, but was nervous to do so because of her &quot;intense reactions,&quot; Kobelt said.</p>
<p>Kobelt said she had also been shown another violent scene from American History X, where a white supremacist, played by Edward Norton, kills a black man by stomping his face into a curb. Stunned, she burst out crying.</p>
<p>Kobelt says she was also shown a scene from the film American History X, where a racist young man, played by actor Edward Norton, kills a black man by stomping his face into the curb. (New Line Cinema/YouTube)
Still she didn\'t want to quit the study before seeing the last clip — her NXIVM training wouldn\'t have it.</p>
<p>She started telling herself: &quot;I\'m not going to be shown to be weak. I\'m not going to be weaker than every other woman you have had in here. I am a strong woman. I have character. I have discipline.</p>
<p>&quot;I don\'t remember if I actually said this to him or not, but I\'m pretty sure I said, \'Just f--king do it.\'&quot;</p>
<p>\'In shock\'</p>
<p>Only this wasn\'t a clip from another Hollywood film; it looked like &quot;real footage,&quot; Kobelt said.</p>
<p>A group of men, many with bandanas over their mouths and guns in their hands, were shown in what looked to be a cornfield, with four women on their knees, she said. Several of the women were topless.</p>
<p>Listen to the podcast at cbc.ca/uncover or on iTunes
One of the men started speaking in Spanish.</p>
<p>&quot;I can\'t understand what he is saying,&quot; Kobelt recalled, describing the final clip. &quot;I have no idea what is going on. I just see these four women on their knees. I think their arms are behind their backs.&quot;</p>
<p>The man in the video eventually stopped speaking and four of the men positioned themselves behind the women. Each then grabbed the woman in front of him by the hair, pulling her head back and chopping it off with a machete, Kobelt said.</p>
<p>(The professional conduct board\'s document outlining the allegations describes this clip as an &quot;actual video of the horrific and brutal murders and dismemberment of four women.&quot;)</p>
<p>Escaping NXIVM: How Keith Raniere went from gifted child to self-help guru to accused sex-cult leader
ESCAPING NXIVM The public and private turmoil of escaping a suspected sex cult
Kobelt said she was in shock, with tears and snot dripping down her face, when Porter asked her once again: &quot;What\'s going on for you?&quot;</p>
<p>He then suggested Kobelt should have an exploration of meaning, or EM, to find out why she had such extreme reactions to some of the clips, she said.</p>
<p>In the world of NXIVM, an EM is a process where a disciple digs deep into their psyche, with the help of a coach, to get at the root of an emotional reaction in an attempt to resolve the underlying issue.</p>
<p>At that moment, it sounded like a ridiculous idea to Kobelt.</p>
<p>She said she remembered thinking: &quot;I don\'t know if this is something I want to resolve. I don\'t know if I ever want to be OK with gang rape. Or, you know, murder by machete.&quot;</p>
<p>But another voice came into her head, she said, once again reminding her of the NXIVM lessons she\'d spent years learning.</p>
<p>Like that she has faulty programming and limiting thoughts that have been building up since childhood and hold her back.</p>
<p>And that she should accept feedback.</p>
<p>&quot;Jenn, you\'re fighting. Stop fighting. Just take the feedback,&quot; Kobelt said she told herself. &quot;If you\'re fighting it, it\'s probably true.&quot;</p>
<p>She went back to the house where she was staying, had a shower and then texted her NXIVM coach: &quot;Hey, I really need an exploration of meaning.&quot;</p>
<p>Doctor resigns</p>
<p>Porter faces numerous charges before the professional conduct board over several of the studies he oversaw, including the so-called fright study. The allegations include 16 violations of state and federal law, as well as violations of medical guidelines, including moral unfitness, gross negligence and gross incompetence.</p>
<p>He is defending himself against the allegations, none of which has been proven. His medical licence is still active, but he resigned from his practice at St. Peter\'s Hospital in Albany.</p>
<p>CBC tried to reach Porter repeatedly but did not get a response.</p>
<p>While Kobelt said she doesn\'t know the ultimate purpose of the fright study, a patent filed by Raniere in 2007 may offer a clue. Titled &quot;Determination of Whether a Luciferian Can Be Rehabilitated,&quot; it outlines nearly the exact same study as the one Kobelt described.</p>
<p>In NXIVM lingo, a Luciferian is someone who takes pleasure in other people\'s pain.</p>
<p>It\'s not clear how the study would rehabilitate such a person.</p>
<p>Documents filed in advance of Porter\'s conduct hearing say the fright study took place over a five-year period. A spokesperson with the state board declined to say how many people participated in the study, but CBC has learned that other participants will be testifying against Porter.</p>
<p>\'A lot of deprogramming\'</p>
<p>It wasn\'t until Kobelt left NXIVM a year later — after she learned about the secret group and the branding of women — that she began to really take stock of what happened.</p>
<p>That process included filing a complaint against Porter with the New York Department of Health in August 2017.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old says she\'s trying to move on. She\'s engaged and runs a marketing business with her fiancé, who is also a former NXIVM member.</p>
<p>But she is still haunted by the horrific images she watched during the fright study, she said. And she continues to grapple with the impact of the teachings that kept her planted in that chair, looking at the screen rather than running for the door.</p>
<p>She often second-guesses herself in situations, she said, and wonders whether she\'s listening to her own conscience or NXIVM instructions that may still be ingrained in her mind.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I had a wonderful success story that could just be like, \'Oh yeah, everything is peaches and rainbows now,\'&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;But I don\'t. It\'s still a lot of deprogramming work left to do.&quot;</p>

           He is defending himself against the allegations, none of which has been proven. His medical licence is still active, but he resigned from his practice at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany.
          </p>
          <p>
           CBC tried to reach Porter repeatedly but did not get a response.
          </p>
          <p>
           While Kobelt said she doesn't know the ultimate purpose of the fright study, a patent filed by Raniere in 2007 may offer a clue. Titled "Determination of Whether a Luciferian Can Be Rehabilitated," it outlines nearly the exact same study as the one Kobelt described.
          </p>
          <p>
           In NXIVM lingo, a Luciferian is someone who takes pleasure in other people's pain.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's not clear how the study would rehabilitate such a person.
          </p>
          <p>
           Documents filed in advance of Porter's conduct hearing say the fright study took place over a five-year period. A spokesperson with the state board declined to say how many people participated in the study, but CBC has learned that other participants will be testifying against Porter.
          </p>
          <p>
           'A lot of deprogramming'
          </p>
          <p>
           It wasn't until Kobelt left NXIVM a year later — after she learned about the secret group and the branding of women — that she began to really take stock of what happened.
          </p>
          <p>
           That process included filing a complaint against Porter with the New York Department of Health in August 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
           The 28-year-old says she's trying to move on. She's engaged and runs a marketing business with her fiancé, who is also a former NXIVM member.
          </p>
          <p>
           But she is still haunted by the horrific images she watched during the fright study, she said. And she continues to grapple with the impact of the teachings that kept her planted in that chair, looking at the screen rather than running for the door.
          </p>
          <p>
           She often second-guesses herself in situations, she said, and wonders whether she's listening to her own conscience or NXIVM instructions that may still be ingrained in her mind.
          </p>
          <p>
           "I wish I had a wonderful success story that could just be like, 'Oh yeah, everything is peaches and rainbows now,'" she said.
          </p>
          <p>
           "But I don't. It's still a lot of deprogramming work left to do."

            Might I point out the interesting fact that OCD can manifest itself in a similar way to the above: "She often second-guesses herself in situations, she said, and wonders whether she's listening to her own conscience or NXIVM instructions that may still be ingrained in her mind."
OCD sufferers can feel at odds with their ability to reason, as they are not sure if it was really their own mind or their OCD that generated a specific thought. Some religious OCD sufferers confuse between what they might perceive as the voice of God and OCD, not being able to effectively distinguish between the two. Just something to keep in mind

             OCD = Never been beaten severely. Funny how people start remembering things all the sudden. Some would, and I did, but it was actually Biblical in the sense I was forced to fight a battle I might have been able to walk away from. The fight was about my belief in God. I lost. I also fought for God. Beat your kids with painful sticks folks.

             He was not trying to reprogram Lucifarians. Title is clever. Evidence can be really heavy in a court case. I am talking hundreds of pounds of evidence. All you need is something verifiable.

                 I have just wasted o soo many hours of my short life looking for a man who could be named Don Forgiani,Fiorgani. I hope it is there, and I hope you do as well. The internet is scrubbed. Archive is all we got. Welcome to the new reality.  He was based at the time in a fenced in area for the State Park at Wakulla springs. He was living there on the compound.

                     Alrigyhty then. Don Fiorgino (memory) was head of environmetal, FWC, whatever and tried to privatize State Parks for concessions with Rick Scott's full approval. Those lucrative positions would then be filled by his friends. Honeymoon Island, was a test spot, and it backfired. Career criminals like that don't do it once in a while. It is a full time job, so you have to keep track of where they are at.

                       Some dude with the mafia. He played it as a gaming sell. Oh, we don't have enough money to pay Park Rangers and their starving families in rural counties, even though they are the highest paying jobs in the County, and paid for by the State. If we privatize a few of them, then we can keep them open for Floridians to enjoy forever. Then we can even add a trash can, plus someone to change the bag. Meanwhile legislation was being made to basically take over the land like imminent domain. Make no mistake, that is an evil bunch, with a high deer fence and security system paid for by the taxpayer. Gillium is one of them. Not sure about DeSantis to tell you the truth.

            The patent looks like what a luciferian would do....his intentions was the exact opposite...
The program was to create a luciferian...part of a social programming experiment..
This looks like how CiA and military intelligence , test bed their social programming ..
The debt system requires an increasingly luciferian and sociopathic outlook on life..
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember the time pulp fiction came out ..it was the start of mass programming of sociopathic behaviour into the general populace , especually the teenage gen..

             Holy cow, you just nailed something that had a HUGE impact on me, and I never once stopped and put it into focus with everything here until right now.  Friends and family dragged me to see that movie way back when — I liked Travolta and knew nothing about Q. Tarantino.  The graphic, G*dless, gratuitous violence shocked and upset me deeply.  So deeply I ended up sitting through most if it with eyes closed and fingers in my ears, horrified and saddened.  Afterwards, I could not relate at all to the gushing appreciative comments of virtually everyone who saw Pulp Fiction.  This may have been the beginning of my long-held aversion to anything to do with Hollywood.  I felt so alone, because I seemed so out of step with everyone, unable to laugh or joke or enjoy the stylised parts of that movie.  To this day, I avoid any shows that are so crude, so violent, so wanton in destruction of the things I value.  I know I sound prudish and cowardly; truly I am neither, it’s just that movie gave me a soul sickness I had trouble shaking.  With so much awful suffering in the world the last thing I want to do is watch movies like that.

              Don't let that stop you. Watch the worst films in history! Form your opinion, and write down everyone who had a part. Spider Baby's is one of my favorites. It transformed society don't you know.

              There's nothing remotely cowardly sounding about your attitude. It's braver to go against the grain and stand by your principles, than to go along with things you know are wrong and harmful just for social reasons.
             </p>
             <p>
              I feel a similar way about modern movies and TV shows. During the '90s a lot of evil things became mainstream and "normal", and it's just gotten worse since.

               Grew up with basically 2 channels of poor reception black &amp; white tv, only stuff for kids was Sat. am cartoons, which I did not enjoy.  Life-long aversion to banana-peel crude antics, always reminded me of Three Stooges, which I could not
               <em>
                stand
               </em>
               at all.  Interestingly, Alex Jones raises a similar cognitive dissonance in my head, cannot tolerate even 3 minutes of his voice.  Anyway, dud not own a tv through high school, college, or after.  Finally was given one as a gift in late 80s, found it practically useless.  Literally prefer to iron and listen to books on tape over television series, “news” or most of what is shown.  I like animal shows, as long as not preaching.  And Masterpiece period dramas.  Don’t mind cooking shows when I need mindless watching in a waiting room.  I feel lucky, because I have avoided the brainwashing so many friends seem to have suffered, now manifesting as TDS.  But it’s also a lonely place.  Most educated people seem to be completely hypnotised by the boob tube.

              The artificial hormones In milk also add to the aggressive nature ...testosterone and agressive behaviour increases when u r on that stuff

U see them program it into u to drink what is essentially cow juice ...not important for humans ...

                Its also the cause of diabetes...the pancreas has eastrogen receptors...so thevmilk supercharged with steroid induced hormones augments its behaviour..

              Damn, that's really sad toutedsuite. I've never heard of Pulp Fiction, is it just one movie? What year did it come out? I've seen real death several times in video recordings (obviously not on purpose) and it really does suck. It haunts you for a few weeks as it should. But I believe you're much more protected against that stuff if you never intended to see it in the first place. People don't believe wanton violence could have a bad effect on their psyche? What a ridiculous notion. There are plenty of studies as well as my own personal experience to instantly invalidate that claim. This is also one reason why pornography is deleterious, it sucks how many are addicted, including me. I hope you can recover from those images in any case.
