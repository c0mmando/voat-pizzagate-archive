            I think Dave Chappelle sold out when he returned and hosted SNL. At first he was against Hollywood and their grip on celebs... but my belief is he was offered a lot of money to shut his mouth and return to show biz. In one of the the photos of him on SNL during intermission, he does the one eye symbolism (covering one eye with his hand) that many soul-selling celebs do. Sad really he was one of a few comedians who spoke out against them.

            Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher used to be married, and as of late, Kutcher has notably been focusing his efforts on human trafficking. Nah, I'm sure it's coincidence.

            I don't remember the wording "eyes wide shut" in that podcast, but it has been a while since I listened to it.  I'm almost 100% sure they are talking about Dan Bilzerian there and I don't get a pedo vibe from him at all.

             It would help if you listened to it again. No, its NOT the one with DAN.

               Hmmm. From Wikipedia:
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                "Goldstein refuses to disclose how he made his fortune or his net worth, although the Wall Street Journal speculated that Goldstein made billions in real estate (notably Century City in Los Angeles).[5] When asked, he typically responds, "Let’s just say I had some investments that worked out pretty well." "I try not to think about the cost," he said. "It's worth it to me."
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Sounds exactly like Jeffrey Epstein's shady money situation. This crackhead James Goldstein is another one that needs to be looked at closely.

              I'll listen to it when I get home, but pretty sure it was Dan's party they were talking about...and also it was funny that Chapelle felt out of place because of all the famous people, when everybody loves Chapelle...he sounds like a humble guy.

               Dave;s a solid guy. Definitely wasn't the podcast with Dan Bliz. I've seen those ones as well. I'm kinda addicted to Joe's interviews. 
Dan Bliz is a hoot. Just a normal red blooded male. Lets thank the lord for that, in this sea of pedo grossness.

             I wonder why Pavlov of Greece and Von Furstenburg are members. Both are married to the Miller sisters, whose father is a member. Alexandra Von Furstenburg and Marie Chantel of Greece both pretend like they are such wonderful mothers and their shit don't stink. Olympia of Greece and Talita Von Furstenburg are the two teenage daughters who just graduated high school. What dirt did these people do to become a member of this bullshit dumbass club? Pedos much?

             I cross posted that Pugs link on this new sub of mine -

             as it really got me thinking.  I was sort of ignoring the Pugs thing but it all fits.

             that wiki is very interesting.   Taki himself writes that Jay-Z was not accepted because as a billionaire and rapper - HE WAS NOT VIOLENT ENOUGH...WTF?   wow.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              From Taki's Magazine article, How Not to Be a Pug, by Taki Theodoracopulos, published on June 21, 2014:[11]
After him Jay Zee, or Jay-Z, the rapper billionaire, also received more blackballs than we are members, so the president himself, Nick Scott, aka Professor Gimlet, explained that while the rapper was being kicked and beaten by his sister-in-law for no particular reason except for cheating on her sister, the rapper did not react in a typical rapper manner by punching her in the mouth and calling her a bitch. Not acting like a rapper when one has made a billion as a rapper deserves a blackball and a half, hence the result.

             Wouldn't want to be in a club with these people. Sounds horrible. And they blocked jay-z from getting in because he DIDN'T hit solange and beyonce? Cool
