            Probably just a homosexual reference IMO...not that either of them are gay, but they certainly know enough gay people to be familiar with the term "bear".   Hence the joke..now that he has moved to Colorado (mentioned elsewhere in podcast), he hunts them with clothes.
For those that don't know the term bear....https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_(gay_slang)

            That being said...Rogan mentions Pizzagate too much not to be following it.  He is also good friends with Alex Jones....he's keeping his cards close to his chest because he lives in Cali and is in the entertainment business.  Lots of smoke there as well.

            That is a LOT of effort expended due to a simple misunderstanding of the word bare.
Is this post a joke? Is it meant to undermine serious investigation?

             Honest mistake. I didn't think of 'bare' as in naked. The 'Teddy bear picnic' is a real thing that happens.

              Do not let this pass by. Everything and Everyone is suspect at this point. No stone should be left unturned.

            So are we to suspect Joe Rogan is in on it? Or he just can't talk? Either way he's pretty casual for a dude that cld know a shit load. I've seen a few videos of Golberg commentating where his pupils appear change to Reptillian look, I can't find it now but it was there on YouTube
