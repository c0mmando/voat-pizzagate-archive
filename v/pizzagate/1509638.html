            Ya, that's a rolled up carpet. "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar", and we currently have plenty of leads to follow without chasing shadows...

             Yea that was my assumption, but like I said there's been too many "coincidences" and their all right in our face, I'll delete it as not too send and drama to an innocent business

            Because it looks like a rolled up carpet I would give them the benefit of the doubt but good investigating.... we have to check out everything. I have seen many double heart logos but I think most are innocent and they are not aware of the pedo thing... it is good to use them as a watch point though if anything else occurs involving that business..... keep on hunting.....

It's fucked cause ever since this story broke you just see the symbols everywhere. Another will pop up soon that's more than a "coincidence" but most people in on it wld have probably long changed logos/pictures
