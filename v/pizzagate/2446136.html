COMMON GROUND by Justin Trudeau — Reviewed by Ann Diamond (henrymakow.com)
Justin TrudeauJustin Trudeau’s autobiography “Common Ground” was not easy to review. Its unspoken subtext involves abuse due to the Illuminati/Luciferian background of both sides of his family.
In her book TRANCE-FORMATION OF AMERICA MK-ULTRA survivor Cathy O’Brien stated that many world leaders, including Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney, are pedophiles. She met them in the course of her life as a sex slave trained (with her young daughter) to service high-profile politicians. Other sources support Cathy O’Brien’s allegations.
Over the years, insiders have told me that Pierre’s 1968 marriage to Margaret was “arranged” by the military. The couple programmed with LSD at a remote farm in British Columbia.
According to Trudeau’s Jesuit mentor, Trudeau ordered the kidnap and murder of his enemy Pierre Laporte in October 1970, because Laporte was threatening him with blackmail and exposure as a pedophile.
After Margaret ran off with the Rolling Stones in 1977, the marriage was over. Soon after, as a single father, Pierre turned to a York University sociologist, John Seeley, for parental advice.
John Seeley, a self-proclaimed ‘sadist and pedophile’ would fly up to Ottawa on weekends to “advise” Pierre on how he should be raising his three sons. Justin was six. (See also this article.)
Quite a childhood. First the trauma of being separated from the mother he adored, then frequent exposure to his father’s unsavory friends.</p>
<p>Children often idealize their abusive parents. During his eulogy at Pierre’s funeral, a smiling 28-year-old Justin seemed dissociated, almost giddy. He began the eulogy with a weird story about a trip he took at age six, with his father and grandfather “to the North Pole,” to a “military installation” at Alert NWT.
There the awe-struck boy discovered Santa Claus and “that’s when I understood just how powerful and wonderful my father was.”
Carolyn Hamlett, a victim of Illuminati mind control and pedophilia, said these abuses took place at military installations.
Is Justin referring to MK-Ultra brainwashing? In general, the eulogy rings insincere and hollow. There is no trace of love or grief. His father had little time for his children.
A few years ago, I was shown a 1984 letter signed by Pierre Elliot Trudeau expressing enthusiastic interest in meeting a ten-year-old boy. The letter may have been used in a blackmail attempt by the boy’s father.
If Pierre Trudeau was abusing their children, Margaret’s history of bipolar illness takes on a whole different cast.</p>
<p>POIGNANT PR</p>
<p>common-ground.jpgCommon Ground is all about the heir to the Trudeau throne.</p>
<p>The book is persuasive and well put together, probably with help from a seasoned journalist. It flows like slick PR, but has much-unhealed trauma in the margins. Posing as saviours, Trudeaus and Sinclairs may be well-paid agents of national decline, but their story is emblematic and unavoidable.</p>
<p>Here and there, a reader encounters tragedy almost worthy of a Russian novel. Certain passages actually moved me to tears: his parents\' divorce and the loss of his brother. His love for his mother, who skidded into depression while partying with rock stars and royals.</p>
<p>As for the politics - you\'re not really interested in Liberal rhetoric, are you? Young Trudeau manfully appeals to Liberal platitudes: tolerance, openness to cultural differences, gender equality, all of which sound good after the Harper Decade.</p>
<p>There are odd references suggesting the author has rubbed shoulders with elite perverts. Prince Andrew and the Starlight Foundation. Jacques Hebert and Katimavik. West Point Grey Academy and his mate Christopher Ingvaldson, convicted of possessing child porn. </p>

<p>All in all, Justin\'s very likable, although Post Traumatic Stress glimmers from his eyes. In Common Ground, he reminds us that everyone has a story to tell.  Justin could have flown away like Le Petit Prince, but instead is doing his utmost to move back to the scene of his childhood trauma: the cold, drafty mausoleum called &quot;24 Sussex Drive.&quot; </p>

<p>First Comment from Anon:</p>
<p>Your information about Pierre Trudeau</p>
<p>&quot;According to Trudeau\'s Jesuit mentor, Trudeau ordered the kidnap and murder of his enemy Pierre Laporte in October 1970, because Laporte was threatening him with blackmail and exposure as a pedophile.&quot;</p>
<p>is exceedingly important and makes huge sense according to Jack English see <a href="http://cuabcimc.blogspot.com">http://cuabcimc.blogspot.com</a> who has advised me, today, as follows:</p>
<p>toronto-pride-parade-20160703 (2).jpg(Trudeau in satanic tongue gesture)</p>
<p>Trudeau was a pedophile and Paul Hellyer was informed of this by Patrick Walsh who was Trudeau\'s RCMP bodyguard as I recall...</p>
<p>and English says ...</p>
<p>Hellyer and Walsh were so shocked by the discovery that Trudeau was a Satanic Pedophile that they convened a meeting at Hellyer\'s Resort to discuss removing Trudeau from office, but for reasons unknown, it did not proceed. It would be good to be able to discuss this with Paul and set the historical record straight.</p>
<p>My friends in the Canadian military have previously corroborated the reports from Mr. English and the information you have posted on your web site.</p>
<p>cuckold.jpgWe have published important information about Mr. Trudeau at the Water War Crimes web site including</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That he sent his wife Margaret to the MK Ultra Brainwashing Hospital - The Allen Memorial Hospital in Montreal when she had her nervous breakdown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That Margaret was treated by Dr. Pivnicki the father of Brian Mulroney\'s wife Mila.  This was no coincidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That his son Michel was in a near fatal accident, probably a targeted hit, in Brandon Manitoba six months before he was killed on Friday the 13th in a suspicious avalanche in November 1998 a month when avalanches are very rare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That Trudeau was part of the plan to loot Canada\'s water export revenues.</p>

            Please do not forget that Justin Trudeau is really Fidel Castro’s biological son. I didn’t believe it at first either but the evidence is overwhelming.

            Nice write-up. Trudeau is a puppet and his wife is the controller.  Please add a para explaining how/why this relates to Pizzagate and adhere to rule #1 (lower right sidebar).

             Thank you for not removing it. This might sound dumb but I had a dream telling me to research Justin Trudeau...I'm just starting now and I'm hoping others might start looking at it.
            </p>

             Summary. Justin Trudeau is the son of the former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau (
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau
             </a>
             )  and Margaret Sinclair (
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Trudeau">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Trudeau
             </a>
             ). Sinclair family is an extremely rich, elite family from Scotland.

            <p>
             "Cathy O’Brien stated that many world leaders, including Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney, are pedophiles. She met them in the course of her life as a sex slave trained (with her young daughter) to service high-profile politicians. Other sources support Cathy O’Brien’s allegations."
            </p>
            <p>
             After Margaret Trudeau left the family, Pierre consulted with pedophile Seeley on how to raise his children. Seeley visited the family often.
             <br/>
             "For Seeley, “mental health” was obviously a way to get close to children. In the 1950s, he had himself analyzed by a sympathetic crony, Toronto psychiatrist Martin Fischer. Seeley shared his violent pedophile fantasies with Dr. Fischer, who never reported them to authorities. These confessions appear in an early version of Paul Bentley’s PhD thesis on Seeley which he posted online on Scribd but has since revised, removing all references to pedophilia. "

              Pierre wasn't in Epstein's flight logs. That link mentions Pierre Trudeau airport. That would be strange if Epstein's logs included flights from the late 1990s.

                No worries. I was excited to see it was true, but alas was not. Pierre was open about his love for Castro, mao, and stalin. I don't doubt he was involved in great evil given who his idols were.

            You are totally on to it. I've been thinking about this for sometime now.  Turdeau always looks like his eyes are round like saucers, repetition of the same sentences over and over and over, not intelligent for a leader of country.  I question the Jesuit mentor????  That is a huge sign of something off.  But most of all the idiocy of Turdeau is beyond belief.  Have the depraved vultures put him in as a joke, because that is what most Canadian think of him.  Btw, I also think his wife is part handler.

              She has some kind of job in water reserve reservoir and sustainability.  That is the kind of garbage Bill is selling in Haiti.  It's a bunch of fake mumbo jumbo.  They are fake sites.  What they are doing is stealing our water in the meantime.  In the article somewhere I read how Justin had tried or was trying to drain the water dry.  This is how they plan to kill us imo, if we don't stop it Pronto!  They will make our children cry for water and thirst.  Nestle has been draining the aquifer since the 80's for pennies.  Brown is looking the other way.  There is also a nut bag that is in charge of the Great Lakes Water Reclamation.  I could go on and on.  This is serious stuff.

                Kudos to the Irish!!! I can not ever imagine our country doing that.  We have grown into a bunch of wimps.  My friend lives in Chicago and we talk quite a bit and she has asked me what I think about her installing a water meter now.  Chicago is heavily pushing this I guess.  I told her I believe this is the precursor to privatizing the water.  She says they promise that the people will be paying less.  I said yeah for how long.  Then once it takes hold prices will go up and they will not longer have water rights.  This scares the B-Geezus out of me. She has decided against it.  Thank God.

                 They installed water meters by force in every household in Ireland, they needed security in some places because people were fighting against it. Denis O'Brien's company installed them of course, a nice bit of easy money for him 😡

               I don't know much about the Trudeau family, but when you mentioned water, it reminded me of this case I read about a year ago. This woman was murdered by a guy she had just met. On the surface it seemed like just a sad wrong place/wrong time story, but below the surface there was som shady stuff she was involved in. She worked as a hydrologist and basically ran a large dam in Oregon. Recordings were later found about her taking about something to do with a big problem at the dam. It's all confusing but basically it is believed she was a MK Ultra victim who was put in her position in her job to be used at a later time to on some way compromise the dam. It's very very dark and intriguing. I  dig more and make a post as soon as I have time

                In the Northwest, there’s tons of hydropower. There is always a little tiny dam at the headwaters up in the mountains, with a smaller reservoir. If that one pops, a tidal wave comes down the mountains, popping all the other, bigger dams on the way down. It happened more than once already.

                Maybe I’m just paranoid, but if an MKULTRA puppet is at the helm of one of those, the could be in place to cause a lot of damage...

               Earth is mostly water on the surface. Are you telling us Califoricators are too stupid to use a high speed train to ship water in?
              </p>
              <p>
               All those Billions squandered on Kickback contractors and land grab rights. Cali should be taxed for water until it cost 5 times more than gasoline.

                Yes, and I believe anyone that lives in a dry climate  like Az. Nev. where they have to force grass to grow, they should not be allowed to put it in.  Why are you moving therein the first place. Sodding on top of sand uses a lot of water.  Believe me if we get to the point of water shortage, they will be the last ones to get it.  People will not stand for it.  Our country has become beyond selfish.  Buy Buy Buy and Use Use Use.  Then throw it on the pile. I did not grow up that way. Yes.  Tax them up the ying yang.

                 Actually parts of Nevada have enough water to sustain communities. Granted not ridiculous mega cities like Las Vegas, but the northern part of the state does just fine with water. Agriculture is actually the third largest industry in the state. Most don't think it, but a lot is grown in NV
