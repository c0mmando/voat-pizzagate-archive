            Donald Trump and multiple trump properties numbers are in black book which proved only that Epstein had phone numbers. Trump was questioned at length by FBI at time of Epstein investigation and it came to nada.

             Trump's name in the black book was circled by Epstein's (soon-to-be-deceased) Palm Beach caretaker, meaning he thought DT had knowledge of JE with underage girls.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also Epstein was asked about Trump and took the 5th.

            <p>
             There was also the election time suit against DT by a supposed Epstein victim.

            <p>
             (I'm willing to dismiss the latter suit because of suspicious timing; still hope DT will 'drain the swamp')

              Yeah, I have been following closely...know the facts as they have been discovered and have formed an opinion about trump/Epstein relationship but other people see the same facts differently.
My base level is this: pizzagate is about the pedo connection to massive, worldwide corruption and pervasive evilness.
The pedo part is necessary to examine because it is a. Horrifying b. Children and c. How they make sure they remain in control.
             </p>
             <p>
              A "normie" gets caught up because they get invited to a elite event...if they aren't immediately into "it"...easy fix. They are partying...already drugging or at least drinking heavily, making them easy to drug.  With the "right" stuff...they can be convinced, manipulated, whatever into a compromising position...which is documented.  Either they are depraved sickos who like it and will want more...or they are terrified of disclosure and easily blackmailed into compliance.  Either way, they will always fall in line.
             </p>
             <p>
              Oddly...trump doesn't fit in here.  Why?  He doesn't drink, smoke, or do drugs.  He is also an egomaniac germophobe who would rather not touch "that person" and prefers to get his kicks under gold plated ceiling tiles.  Short of tying him up and sticking needles in his arms... Would be hard to engineer his cooperation with dubious partners in questionable locales....therefore can't be trusted bc he can't be blackmailed.  That is why Trump was never supposed to be President.
             </p>
             <p>
              Epstein found him to be a useful boor...famous, with good stuff like hotels.  Trump thought Epstein was disgusting....powerful but revolting.

               It is strange that just as voters had a choice between Skull &amp; Bones Kerry or Skull &amp; Bones Bush, this year our choice was between two friends of Epstein. (Well Bill certainly was, Hillary's connection is still unclear.)
              </p>
              <p>
               As I said I still have hopes for Trump. It's interesting though that one of the leading anti-pedophile blogs has been exposing and attacking Trump for months:
               <a href="https://aanirfan.blogspot.com/search/label/Trump">
                http://aanirfan.blogspot.com/search/label/Trump
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               (I forgot the Largo Mar connection in my list of connections: JE recruited Virginia Roberts while she was working at DT's Largo Mar club; later on DT kicked JE out of the club for bothering young girls. This is really curious, while searching for Largo Mar Epstein on duckduckgo I get a headline "NewYear Breaking News: Trump Reinstates Jeffery Epstein" from breitbart.com. Click on it and the actual story from this last New Years has no mention of Epstein.)

                The reinstatement article thing happened because someone on Voat/politics posted their own fake-news "Epstein" headline when linking to an actual story on Breitbart.  The trump-hating OP deleted the thread but the internet hasn't forgotten...
               </p>
               <p>
                I am still supremely hopeful....because it isn't the Clintons or even the Bushes.  Trump is a gamble and he won't be able to fix everything...but at least he isn't Hillary.  Beyond that...I simply hope we can regain some sense of reason.

            Actually upvoated it first, because the story is great. The info is non-existent and the whole thing is a plant:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Donald Trump is in Jeffrey Epstein's Little Black Book
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It seems a fake post. The date on the post is allegedly 2015, yet in the post an article from 02/2016 is featured...
