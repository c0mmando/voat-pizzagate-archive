            thanks for the post, this is great exposure of insanity. Looks like former terrorist Maryan Rajavi is being set up to be installed as head of Iran after state department/cia manipulated regime change based on suspected uranium enrichment happening in tunnels, I wonder how Albania was coerced into taking this group in for the interim.
