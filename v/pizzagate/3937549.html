               Theyre the UKs biggest nightlife brand. With all the illegal stuff around nightclub style business drugs, prostitution, etc its worth a deeper look. The private venues made me think of Comets back room events.  Just another angle of the abuse cycle potentially covered by their companies.

              YES Merc! Thats it. Seems like shipping, 'removal' or clean-up, and real estate connected to the LLCs. I will help follow up on the real estate connected to their shell companies. Their financials are public too- looks like some of them make around 4M a year- 30+ all directed by Paul John Evans , most connected to one Hampstead address.

             We wrote about this previously on voat but here are excerpts from a related article:
             <a href="https://enigmachannel.wordpress.com/2015/07/02/the-sickest-trade-body-part-trafficking/">
              THE SICKEST TRADE: BODY PART TRAFFICKING
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              My investigation into online Black Magic cults which trade in human baby parts includes Malawi, Thailand and Britain.  By delving into this sick trade, I came to realise that some of the events actually corroborated allegations made by two Hampstead schoolchildren, back in September 2014...
             </p>
             <p>
              In November 2014, just a day or so after METROPOLITAN POLICE abandoned further investigation and closed the Hampstead case, DHL did indeed discover baby body parts in a consignment – what’s more, there were three DHL boxes, being shipped to three addresses – suggesting that a CULT NETWORK was involved.  The grisly DHL consignments were discovered in Bangkok, Thailand.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..In actual fact, that COVER STORY has now been blown open by investigators at THE ENIGMA CHANNEL:  There were TWO – not one – American ‘tourists’ – and they were not tourists at all – they were two American “filmmakers”, which we can now name as Ryen McPherson and Daniel Tanner.  What kind of films did they make?  They made BUM-FIGHT videos of homeless people beating each other – rather similar to some of the pranks found in the God Damn and Jackass TV shows – except more ‘real’.  What were they doing in Thailand, well, allegedly, they were filming homeless people and getting them to fight each other.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..The DHL parcels are said to have contained a baby’s skull, a sheet of skin and baby’s feet sealed in bags and boxed for shipping, according to CNN News on Nov. 16.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..But there were three consignments – and we still are not sure about all the contents.  Some reports said there was an adult human heart in one of the DHL boxes which had been addressed to Las Vegas – a stabbed heart can only mean one thing – this was a MURDER – it also has connotations to BLACK MAGIC SATANIC RITUAL SACRIFICE....According to Thai police one of the boxes contained pieces of HUMAN skin.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yet again, this confirms what the Hampstead children alleged – they said that cult members removed sheets of skin from the slain babies, and this skin was used to adorn ritual shoes, rather like HUMAN LEATHER.  A forensic examination confirmed the DHL box contents in Thailand [which were destined for the USA] were indeed Human in origin, said, the Bangkok Post.
             </p>
             <p>
              ..
              <strong>
               We then see a Thai cover-up happening – right on the same day that the Barnet Metropolitan police CLOSE THE HAMPSTEAD INVESTIGATION
              </strong>
              :  The Thai police did not press any charges against the ‘American Tourist’ – just like the London Metropolitan Police failed to make charges against any of the alleged Hampstead cult members.
             </p>
             <p>
              But it gets worse… SACRIFICED &amp; ROASTED BABIES:
             </p>
             <p>
              Back in 2012, we see yet more signs of an international Satanic Cult shipping babies – this time the premature babies had been ROASTED.  This yet again confirms and at least puts heavy credence to the allegations made by the Hampstead whistleblower children – they alleged that the babies which their father sacrificed were ROASTED AND EATEN by the Black Magic cult members in London.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Well, evidence which corroborates their claims can be found from a 2012 case, again in Thailand, which involved a British man…  Several  courier packages were discovered marked ‘children’s toys’ but x-rays showed they were not children’s toys.’

               I've just discovered some of those same trolls doing the same thing in the 'Samantha Baldwin' case.  This is a woman who had her sons taken away from her by the courts and it looks like another big cover up but I don't know yet too much about the case.  I just ng to d some of the trolls because they are trying to debunk SRA.. and then I recognized one  of the names.  Not going to say more about that yet .. need to do more research on that nest of vipers.

                I'm still not sure what to think about the Baldwin case. One of her supporters, Richard Carvath, who runs a blog, claims  that he witnessed the abuse of one of the boys while hiding in the bushes on the father's premises.
               </p>
               <p>
                But he didn't bang at the windows, or call the police, but merely wrote a letter - three weeks later, no less - to the police. They didn't invstigate his claims (of course....).
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, a close friend of the mother burned a house down where the father had been staying with the kids.
               </p>
               <p>
                It's really odd.

                 Yes, I agree. It's odd. And I only came across it when I was recently looking into the Essex police corruption case. I would not have paid any attention but I came across some characters on Twitter that I recognize.

                  Yes. He has also supported Carl Beech (who imo was abused by his father, but maybe not by the VIPs he named, although they have raped other children).

                   I have the impression that Beech got stitched up just like every other whistleblower in the UK of elite pedophiles. But again, I haven't paid too much attention to that case. I'm still working on Hampstead and that's enough for me.

                   <p>
                    They intentionally chose Beech, who then went on exposing VIP perps. Then it turned out that Beech wasn't a credible witness, so they sent him to prison, and are now able to claim all allegations against the perps he named are made up.

                    Which is bs of course, because Janner, Procter, Brittan etc. have been named by many other genuine survivors.

             Many of these children came from CAFCASS. The children in their initial testimony stated that Ricky dearman used "plastic / rubber Willie's" made in his shed using moulds ect. He now has a slime company that uses the same materials.

              FOREIGN MILITARY FINANCING is a form of money laundering run by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense that allows the US government to give direct aid to US weapon's manufacturers. It's the "military-industrial complex" Eisenhower warned about. The money given to Israel will mostly go towards the purchase of the F-35 made by Lockheed-Martin, Northrop-Grumman and Pratt and Whitney.

            I've never really been sure regarding the Hampstead thing, but I don't discount the possibility that an element of truth exists there in the kids' claims. The jump to FedEx seems a bit long, but we're in 'long shot' territory for some of this anyway...

            We do know that Robert Maxwell (-&gt; Kroll -&gt; Hollander) was largely UK based, so the potential for a tie in here isn't totally farfetched especially given the global reach of things...

             Here's something interesting to consider. The kids described supposedly upstanding, respectable members of the community as having tattoos and piercings. None of the accused were investigated. However Andrew Cuomo has a nipple ring and who was that woman who was fired after she was photographed naked with her female aide? She had an intimate tattoo. Basically it proves just because someone has a certain position in society doesn't mean they are hugely conservative and mundane. Everyone has skeletons.

                Whoa no not those ones. Remember there are FAKE survivors doing channels for attention, very few and rare but they are out there. I pointed out one on here a while back and got attacked relentlessly for it but I could prove what she was saying were regurgitated bits of info from many real survivors stories and doing it for the sympathy and attention.

                Phoenix is male and Aria is female both around age 35 to 40 I’d say, Arias father was a Freemason and she grew up with abuse from him and at the lodge and talks about it. Phoenix went to boys school Kings House elite prep school in UK and abuse was rampant. Same with Outward Bound camp Prince Philip and Saville were vested in. Programming and sexual abuse. He recently filed an official complaint and the police response is extremely telling. They both fled England.

                 Yes, there are a few podcasters who get on fake interviewees, rack up the views, split the $$ etc. Same happens with ‘animal welfare or rescue’ type vids, run by scammers in Asia etc. begging for donations. Yet the YouTube clean-up department prefers to spend time banning David Icke and Pedo Hunters.

             I'm sure that the intelligence services were involved .. as I was there at the start of it and saw the massive operation to cover it up and throw disinfo into the mix..
            </p>
            <p>
             At any rate, I always wonder why people say they aren't sure about the Hampstead thing because THE ONE THING THAT IS CLEAR is that what comes out of the mouths of those children will have had a devastating lifelong effect on their psyche.. and whoever did that to them -real or imagined- needs to go to jail, at the very least. There are some very dark forces on this planet.

               At any rate, I always wonder why people say they aren't sure about the Hampstead thing because THE ONE THING THAT IS CLEAR is that what comes out of the mouths of those children will have had a devastating lifelong effect on their psyche.. and whoever did that to them -real or imagined- needs to go to jail, at the very least.

              Well without really wanting to get into a yuge argument or anything, I'm guessing a few people might understand one of my reasons for taking it with a huge grain of salt. Aside from the unspoken, I was generally unsure as to which side of the story from the adults involved had more credibility – I think this is the first time I'd heard it from the kids directly though.

              Having seen the boy's candor in his interview(s), especially combined with the mention of coke, the signs of abuse/truth are there for sure.

                 It's understandable that you don't know the name.  The Hampstead case is of particular interest in the UK. However, I keep bringing it up here because it links the international pedo ring and the intelligence services of the US and the UK.  JizzLane Maxwell, Epstein, the City of London, the Royal family, it's all there..
