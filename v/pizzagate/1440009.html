<p>Thank you for your courage. Please remember, we Americans know that our government is lying to us. We know that our government is infested with pedophiles. The evidence has been abundantly clear for many years; decades, in fact. The difference now is we have names, confirmation, emails, addresses. Soon we will likely have videos showing what they do to these children - if that day comes, the US government will probably try to shut down our Internet via the use of an EMP or other kind of diversionary false flag.</p>
<p>They are already silencing much of our communication, and sabotaging our attempts to investigate, trying to get us to believe we\'re crazy, trying to dismiss the empirical evidence, in some cases threatening our lives.</p>
<p>We now see the failed and widely discredited &quot;New York Times&quot; for example is trying to conceal information about Pizzagate by telling everybody it\'s &quot;fake.&quot;</p>
<p>It is not surprising, since the CEO of New York Times has a past involving arch pedophile Jimmy Saville.</p>
<p>An op-ed in the New York Times also says &quot;pedophilia is not a crime.&quot;</p>
<p>So given the New York Times cozy relationship with pedophilia, it makes sense why the New York Times is hoping everybody believes that pizzagate isn\'t really happening. Maybe they themselves participate in the &quot;pizza parties&quot;?</p>
<p>Why do I mention the New York Times? Because this failing media outlet is just a microcosm of how the western media as a whole works.</p>
<p>Most of the media out here constitutes the largest and most sophisticated propaganda branch of the US government.</p>
<p>To the people of Turkey, please find it in your hearts to understand that Americans, as individuals, are with you. We stand with you. And we welcome your standing with us. We hate what our government has done to children, and we hate the media for its complicity.</p>
<p>We admire your courage in spreading the truth about pizzagate. Be careful, because the US government will probably try to demoralize you and attack you now. And the US government will probably try to get us to hate each other.</p>
<p>We are doing our best here to remove the blackened cancer festering in this government.</p>
<p>We welcome your support.</p>
<p>The world is waking up. This international nexus of child rape and sacrifice is perhaps the greatest crime in human history, and the war against it is only now beginning.</p>
<p>Solidarity with Turkey.</p>
<p>Also thank you to the people of Norway, Australia, Canada, and South Korea for exposing the evil.</p>
<p>700,000 people in South Korea fight in the streets tonight not just because their president is corrupt, but because she was involved in dark occultism and claimed to be contacting spiritual entities.</p>
<p>The people of Norway just busted thousands of child rapists.</p>
<p>The people of Australia used 60 minutes to uncover a massive pedophile ring.</p>
<p>We stand with people all over the world in affirming: dark practices in government is the problem, not us. We never consented to it and had no idea it was happening until very recently.</p>
<p>And finally, thank you to Julian Assange for having the courage to expose this painful truth to the world. Hope you are safe brother.</p>',

            Turkey? An Islamic country in which the abuse of children is rampant and they tried to withdraw punishment of child rapists...child brides are not uncommon...dude you're talking about a country in which this is basically ok.
