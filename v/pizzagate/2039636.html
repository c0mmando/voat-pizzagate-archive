             I believe there is cause for concern that the Deep State is behind this, the medical establishment has been compromised, and that the distinct possibilty that suspending puberty in children is or could be benefitting pedophilia and sex-trafficking.

            Agree, definitely the Globalist are behind it. What's happening has mushroomed into numerous social engineering crimes against humanity, it's not based in science, and as if screwing with people's minds wasn't enough, they're mutilating and disfiguring the bodies of children and teens (
            <em>
             double mastectomies at age 16
            </em>
            Really?)
           </p>
           <p>
            Among the clinics you mentioned, New York University Gender and Sexuality Service:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Treats "gender-nonconforming people from birth..."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I wasn't able to find how gender-nonconforming from birth is diagnosed.   I thought perhaps they were thinking of hermaphrodites etc. but given that 'gender' is not defined to be synonymous with any given set of genitalia, how would they determine whether any newborn baby is gender conforming or not?  Do they check hormones?  What difference does that make, gender dysphoria is not proven to persist past puberty in anywhere from 5% to 25% of cases (without mind fucking the kids as they're growing up).
           </p>
           <p>
            So an epidemic of clinics is going to make sure they can create and "treat" as many cases as possible with Freudian/Mengele-esque experiments on babies and children.  At some point parents will be required to only allow Globalist certified doctors to assign gender for the baby, parents will have to accept the "sexuality" of their babies...and plenty of pedophiles will be entering the medical profession to help make that happens.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regarding puberty blockers and the numerous health issues surrounding the use of them for gender dysphoria, they don't even help some Trans to transition, BECAUSE of the use of puberty blockers.  In order to have SRS apparently you need more than a baby sized penis.
           </p>
           <blockquote>

             Basically, Jazz started taking hormones before puberty in order to transition and now she has a baby penis down there. Apparently, having a completely underdeveloped downstairs mix-up is preventing Jazz from turning their current downstairs into the downstairs that they want.
