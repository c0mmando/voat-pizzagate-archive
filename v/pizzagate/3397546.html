<blockquote>
<p>Over the weekend, the head of this company, who had never been seen in person at this particular location showed up in the middle of the night. He had called ahead and the highest ranking person still left at this business was told to be there for the meeting. He instructed that no one else be there. The urgency was dictated because of multiple deaths that happened a short time before involving two very key employees of this company. Those two employees were in charge of the account number mentioned in the title.</p>
<p>That account number was established several years ago when the new owner bought out the original owner. It was an internal billing account, but the bills were never paid. They were never supposed to be paid. It was simply to keep track of a special group of clientele who are friends of the owner. The problem was that after the death of the two employees, one of the clientele showed up at the business with two very young women he said were his nieces and said he had a reservation. He used the name associated with that account. The problem is these clientele were always processed by the two dead employees. They were not always there in person but would arrange that all the formalities would be taken care of beforehand so whatever clientele were there could get on with their activities quickly.</p>
<p>When this man showed up with his nieces who really looked nothing like each other or the man and were really young to be wearing what they were wearing, calls were made. Did anyone know about the reservation and then someone looked up the history of the name associated with the account and sent a group e-mail asking about the reservation and included the account number in the e-mail. The man and his nieces were not given a room because none of them had or were willing to produce identification or a method of payment. The man explained that no payment was ever required because it was handled through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt">Mr. Weishaupt</a>. No one at the company had ever heard of Mr. Weishaupt and another group e-mail was sent inquiring about Mr. Weishaupt.</p>
<p>Only a few hours later, the call was made by the man who came in the middle of the night. Was it Mr. Weishaupt? I don\'t know. The person who told me all of this only caught a glimpse of the man as he left the next morning trailed by that highest ranking employee available at the company. The person who spoke to me is adamant that the previous owner didn\'t have a special account number. The employees had been trying to recall anyone they remembered who had used the account number or name when they checked in.</p>
<p>One person several people agreed on because he had been there multiple times using the name was this A+ list mostly movie actor who lives most of the year overseas. He also likes to direct. He is also an Academy Award winner. The staff just assumed he liked his privacy and it was a fake name. It wasn\'t until now, they realized he was using the same name as the man with his nieces. Whenever the A+ lister came, he always came without his wife and would only stay a few hours. No one saw anyone who came with him, but it seemed like given the circumstances he was meeting someone who would come to see him.</p>
<p>This A+ list mostly movie actress who is an Academy Award winner and is known all over the world used the name too. Someone remembered she stayed a week when she was in hiding and some of her employees would come by and have no idea they were supposed to use that name to see her or contact her.</p>
<p>The staff said the name was used a lot, but mostly by men who had a woman or women with them. There was one man they remembered because he stuck out. He was an older white man and he would often come with young black men and also would only stay an hour or two. I think I know who that person is and have written about him before, but no one remembered exactly what he looked like and he wasn\'t using his real name so it is tough. There are rumors that the man behind it all has big time professional sports interests.</p>
<p>One thing is certain. Any trace of that account number is gone from every system the staff can get into.</p>

            andrew balazs has links to chelsea handler and naomi campbell and of course katherine keating as well as uma thurman kylie minogue carine roitfeld jared leto diane von furstenberg hope atherton marina abromivic john leguizamo paul mccartney samuel l jackson donna karan vajna timea jennifer missoni pharrel williams blake lively susan sarandon katie ford cosima vesey ..... In 2017, the New York Times reported allegations that Balazs had "groped" Amanda Anka in London at a dinner hosted by him for Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux.A statement issued by Amanda Anka and her husband, Jason Bateman, said that his actions were dealt with at the time.....In 2011, Balazs launched a sea plane service to the Hamptons, StndAIR, an 8-seat plane operating scheduled flights and charters from Manhattan.....In 1998, Balazs opened the first of five hotels called The Standard in West Hollywood.[15][16] Balazs subsequently opened and operated five Standard hotels: in Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, Miami, and two in New York City,the most renowned being The Standard, Highline, before selling his interests in the real estate assets in a series of transactions and, finally, in the management company itself in a private transaction in 2017....He also owns the Chiltern Firehouse, a hotel in a former fire station in London.[27] Chiltern Firehouse was designed in conjunction with Studio KO, though Balazs is known to be personally heavily involved in the design of his hotels and it includes bar areas, a restaurant run by former Viajante chef Nuno Mendes and 26 suites.Balazs has also been involved in residential real estate as the developer of 15 William, a luxury condominium in New York City’s Financial District, with apartments and amenities that embody many of the same design qualities as Balazs’ hotel properties. .... i would bet his little black book has the same names as Jeffrey Epstein he's a mover and a shaker and socialises with the rich and the elite

            QAnon has been talking about the Standard Hotel for over a year. Now we're finally getting the sauce. I wonder if CDAN is connected to Q, or just riding on Q's coat tails?

             I would bet, when all this stuff becomes public, that CDAN, VOTL, Q on the chans are all connected as various pathways to inform the public.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would also guess that various other "channels" were fired up but never caught traction.

             The amount of detail being revealed by CDAN is simply WAY too much to be coming from a single source, no matter how well connected.

              That would make sense. CDAN so often seems to know things going on behind closed doors. It would be pretty hard to believe people are voluntarily telling this guy this stuff. A source in the NSA spying on Pedowood people would make sense.

              I’d say “Patriot/Hollywood White Hat cooperating as a civilian helper” rather than one of them. Like the deal with Sean Hannity.

              There are purportedly only 10 civilians who know (Trump being Q+).

             I’ve suspected Enty was a “civilian helper” ie one of the few civilians who know (like Sean Hannity) for quite some time.
            </p>
            <p>
             After all, Enty started getting MUCH more aggressive regarding exposing Hollywood pedos starting around fall 2017.

               Don’t think Himmmm has ties to Trump.
              </p>
              <p>
               What I’ve heard is that Himmmm is both a person and a group. More specifically, its four different people.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sort of like how Q is both a person and a group.....and I suspect I may have deduced the identity of one of them. M.R. and leaving it at that for obvious reasons.

                 Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is rumored to be a Himmmm. Rumors also point to a rapper and a British man being some of the others.

                 Yeah, but over 50% of people don't know that, and almost everyone takes them sooner or later. I felt really out of whack recently when I was on them for a couple of days, and was so glad to stop taking them.

                  I gotcha. Just was curious if that was a response to me.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I absolutely agree though, a lot of people dont know &amp; I think docs should put more emphasis on WHY its imperative to take them ALL.

                 <p>
                  Antibiotics literally mean "anti-life" - it's no wonder people feel whacked out when taking them.
