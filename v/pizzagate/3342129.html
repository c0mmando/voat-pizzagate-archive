            pol/ - Tracy R. Twyman dead after researching Elsagate -related...
           </p>
           <p>
            Topic strangly underobserved, like Chemtrails it is VISIBLE evil, cleansed from Twitter search (like other topics) GAB did not even show the # but serves #Fisagate !
           </p>
           <p>
            Elsagate has been continuing with blood, suicide and cannibalism and violence against child characters, age-inappropriate sexualisation targeted towards children in the youtube kids app. The main culprit was a channel called Simple Fun that had been getting millions and millions of views for a year seemingly out of nowhere. Once again, finally after huge public outrage youtube was forced to appease the public by getting rid of it. This is not the only culprit, there has also been copycats of this formula. Youtube can pretend that they don't want this pedophilic child grooming content on their site but anyone with half a brain knows better
           </p>

            Why superheroes? Theories about mental state and elsagate videos
Before you read this, this is just speculation and theory on my part. I have no sustainable evidence that anything like this is actually happening. But i feel the need to try to express what my beliefs are. I apologize for any gramatical errors or such as i am not a citizen of an english speaking country nor am i used to writing or journalism. If you have any questions or theories feel free to post them but refrain from going outside the scope of what i am tring to present, in that case just make a new post and add this as a reference.

           <p>
            "In a world where you can't fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment". – the big bang theory
           </p>
           <p>
            Fantasy prone personality is a construct that develops from exposure to abuse, exposure to loneliness, isolation, among other things. Example: A child who was bullied might retreat into a safe world surrounded by things that the child has associated as safe during early development.
           </p>
           <p>
            Several studies have reported that dissociation and fantasy proneness are highly correlated. This suggests the possibility that the dissociated selves are merely fantasies, for example, being a coping response to trauma. However, a lengthy review of the evidence concludes that there is strong empirical support for the hypothesis that dissociation is caused primarily and directly by exposure to trauma, and that fantasy is of secondary importance.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/https">
             r/https
            </a>
            ://www.researchgate.net/publication/221695375_Evaluation_of_the_Evidence_for_the_Trauma_and_Fantasy_Models_of_Dissociation
           </p>
           <p>
            A person with a normal upbringing not exposed to trauma, abuse or loneliness would find safety and emotional security with their parents, siblings teachers etc. Even if a traumatic event occured they would have someone to turn to for comfort. Without access to some form of emotional security the mind could potentially create this security as a measure of self preservation. Based on what is familiar and associated as safe, the creation would take on such properties and appearence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again look at the example of the bullied child. Imagine if this child comes from an abusive home or in other ways have no emotional security to turn to. It would only be natural for this child to create a construct to fullfill these emotional needs. The construct would have properties derived from what the child think it needs. Not having a real world connection to anchor these properties the child would anchor them to something familiar. This is where cartoon characters and superheroes come in. The child can relate the appearence and the social properties of these characters, and would derive the construct from those.
           </p>
           <p>
            What happens when you take someone traumatized, give them comfort and safety? What happens when you suddenly expose the fact that the thing they found comfort in was false? Given traumatic enough vehicle to present this to the traumatized, the mind would simply not be able process the duality. This is called cognitive dissonance, the traumatized now holds two completely contradictory beliefs. To reduce this dissonance the mind starts adding things to justify what is happening. This could leave you in a suggestive state.
           </p>
           <p>
            In A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the real world. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and so is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance, by making changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance, or by actively avoiding social situations and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/https">
             r/https
            </a>
            ://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance
           </p>
           <p>
            For anyone familiar with MKULTRA. It is believed that dissociation is a key to mind control. A mind is “split” into compartments, each with their own functions. These different compartments can then be used for different things without the persons knowledge. By traumatizing someone (usually when they are young and the mind is still forming and thus more suggestive) they can be made susceptible to dissociation. With dissociation and cognitive dissonance you can compartmentalize the mind and reprogram it.

            I've read all her books. Toying in the occult and initiation is ill advised. It's smart to know your enemy but swear no oaths (especially in blood). Still curious of the Kappy connection and his last video and could he have referred to her as one he pulled a Judas? Did she reveal secrets and suffer the fate of William Morgan?

             pol/ - Tracy R. Twyman dead after researching Elsagate -related...
            </p>
            <p>
             Topic strangly underobserved, like Chemtrails it is VISIBLE evil, cleansed from Twitter search (like other topics) GAB did not even show the # but serves #Fisagate !
            </p>
            <p>
             Elsagate has been continuing with blood, suicide and cannibalism and violence against child characters, age-inappropriate sexualisation targeted towards children in the youtube kids app. The main culprit was a channel called Simple Fun that had been getting millions and millions of views for a year seemingly out of nowhere. Once again, finally after huge public outrage youtube was forced to appease the public by getting rid of it. This is not the only culprit, there has also been copycats of this formula. Youtube can pretend that they don't want this pedophilic child grooming content on their site but anyone with half a brain knows better
            </p>
            <p>
             Why superheroes? Theories about mental state and elsagate videos Before you read this, this is just speculation and theory on my part. I have no sustainable evidence that anything like this is actually happening. But i feel the need to try to express what my beliefs are. I apologize for any gramatical errors or such as i am not a citizen of an english speaking country nor am i used to writing or journalism. If you have any questions or theories feel free to post them but refrain from going outside the scope of what i am tring to present, in that case just make a new post and add this as a reference.

             "In a world where you can't fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment". – the big bang theory
            </p>
            <p>
             Fantasy prone personality is a construct that develops from exposure to abuse, exposure to loneliness, isolation, among other things. Example: A child who was bullied might retreat into a safe world surrounded by things that the child has associated as safe during early development.
            </p>
            <p>
             Several studies have reported that dissociation and fantasy proneness are highly correlated. This suggests the possibility that the dissociated selves are merely fantasies, for example, being a coping response to trauma. However, a lengthy review of the evidence concludes that there is strong empirical support for the hypothesis that dissociation is caused primarily and directly by exposure to trauma, and that fantasy is of secondary importance.

             ://www.researchgate.net/publication/221695375_Evaluation_of_the_Evidence_for_the_Trauma_and_Fantasy_Models_of_Dissociation
            </p>
            <p>
             A person with a normal upbringing not exposed to trauma, abuse or loneliness would find safety and emotional security with their parents, siblings teachers etc. Even if a traumatic event occured they would have someone to turn to for comfort. Without access to some form of emotional security the mind could potentially create this security as a measure of self preservation. Based on what is familiar and associated as safe, the creation would take on such properties and appearence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again look at the example of the bullied child. Imagine if this child comes from an abusive home or in other ways have no emotional security to turn to. It would only be natural for this child to create a construct to fullfill these emotional needs. The construct would have properties derived from what the child think it needs. Not having a real world connection to anchor these properties the child would anchor them to something familiar. This is where cartoon characters and superheroes come in. The child can relate the appearence and the social properties of these characters, and would derive the construct from those.
            </p>
            <p>
             What happens when you take someone traumatized, give them comfort and safety? What happens when you suddenly expose the fact that the thing they found comfort in was false? Given traumatic enough vehicle to present this to the traumatized, the mind would simply not be able process the duality. This is called cognitive dissonance, the traumatized now holds two completely contradictory beliefs. To reduce this dissonance the mind starts adding things to justify what is happening. This could leave you in a suggestive state.
            </p>
            <p>
             In A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (1957), Leon Festinger proposed that human beings strive for internal psychological consistency in order to mentally function in the real world. A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable, and so is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance, by making changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance, or by actively avoiding social situations and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
             For anyone familiar with MKULTRA. It is believed that dissociation is a key to mind control. A mind is “split” into compartments, each with their own functions. These different compartments can then be used for different things without the persons knowledge. By traumatizing someone (usually when they are young and the mind is still forming and thus more suggestive) they can be made susceptible to dissociation. With dissociation and cognitive dissonance you can compartmentalize the mind and reprogram it.

                I am generally speaking.  If the white races aren't the Adam made in the image and likeness of another man, who is?  Who is Satan that rules for 6000 years?  If it isn't the white man (Jew and Gentile), who is it?  An invisible spook?  Was it a spook who put polio in blankets to kill off natives?  was it a spook who put my ancestors in chains, who were put through hell, to build the white heaven (that is now falling apart)....

                The bible supports what i say, it doesn't support what you say.  I am of the original people of the earth.  I am despised and rejected.  my people took the curses of Deuteronomy... my people were in bondage for 400 years... My people are the tail.  We are the bottom rail.  We are an astonishment to all.  We are DEAD mentally and spiritually...  So much so, God will fight our fight for us.  We are deaf, dumb, and blind.  We are niggers to the world.  But really it would take a nigger to make a nigger because God doesn't make niggers.  The white man does.

                 Listen, I'm not here to deny that whites can be racist, but the truth of the matter is that any time we use skin colors of others to justify our hatred, resentment, bitterness, fear, condescension, or any wicked behaviors we are wrong. But you don't have to be white to be racist. Any race can be racist against another race. The Bible says in 1 Samuel 16:7 7 "But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart."
                </p>
                <p>
                 God is the only righteous judge. But we that believe the true word of God thanks to the redeeming power of the blood of Christ know that we are to put away our fleshly tendencies and seek after His perfect ways. The early Hebrew Christians struggled with this concept. Many were Jews and they didn't understand why suddenly, after years of separating themselves from Gentiles (non-Jews) on God's orders, God was now saying this: Galatians 3:28 “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. " There should be no racism in a believer's heart. That's not God's will. Yet man is weak and the devil tempts us to fall for his lies. Even those who confess Christ with their mouths have done some really vile things to their fellow man.I

                 We're all liars if we say we have no prejudice towards others in our minds. It can be as small as being afraid to  be friendly someone of another color for fear we'll be rejected, to as big as enslaving an entire color of people due to pride (the worst sin is pride!) or trying to exterminate them outright! But it's awesome to know that this condition is temporary and someday when we are in Heaven we're going to be amazed at how stupid we all were to let Satan blind us with such a basic tactic.

              The Rothschild's are not Jewish. They only converted to Jewish to pretend they're goody goodies. 
Soros came straight out of Satan's ass drip. He's not Jewish.
The house of Saud (Saudi Arabia) are surely not Jewish. 
Deception 101. (Look over there. Not over here)
              <br/>
              Im not supporting the Jews.
This is a satanic thing hidden behind other religions.

               That is flat out incorrect. They are actually the the Bauer family, German Jews from Frankfurt. They got their big loan to start lending to nations from the Oppenheimer's, an ancient wealthy Jewish line. Rothschild means red shield, the symbol above their coin and loan shop.

              Correct. Jews are the embodiment and personification of evil and satanism.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jews are evil and all Jews need to be exterminated, eradicated and erased from memory.

                 Because you're a hard-core racist. You can lie to everyone and say you oppose this or that, but you're REALLY here to sow division with your hate. I see you, though.  No sane person thinks they can know what is in a person's heart based on skin color. No person with wisdom believes it's that simple. You should get on your knees, confess your sins before God almighty, and repent of your wickedness. Then you should apologize to everyone here for trying to distract us with your racist paranoia.

                  I just re-read this comment, and you're wrong about me on every level. At the foundation, you think I'm here to sow division with my
                  <s>
                   hate
                  </s>
                  truth, but in reality, I'm trying to inspire and forge unity with my white brethren to combat and match the insane nepotism exhibited by Jews so we can once and for all exterminate Jews, Feminists, Marxists, Communists, Socialists, Antifa Terrorists, Atheists, Niggers, Spics, and all other shit skins.

                   Again, thanks for showing everyone what you really are about. I have to ask you, don't you get exhausted by the us vs them mentality? Wouldn't it feel better to love your neighbor? Wouldn't you rather know that there's a peace-loving God on the throne? In your heart of hearts you know you can't win these wars you're waging; even if you do the unthinkable and actually kill somebody, which people do all the time...if amounts to nothing for you but prison. Or death. I'm hoping that you're just spewing bravado, in which case it's even more empty and cowardly. Words of rage on the internet may make you feel a bit better in the moment but you're smart enough to know they accomplish nothing. Hey, we're all guilty of it. But there are better ways. There's a God on the throne that loves YOU. And He sent His only son to die for you because you are that precious to Him. In fact the Bible says before the foundation of the world was made, He knew you, and knew that you (and I...) would sin and He came gladly anyway.  Before you hit back with rage, I hope you'll take a second to think about what that means. And if you ever want to talk about that, I'm here.

                    I meant what I said about being here if you want to talk about it. You said you want to exterminate atheists, so you at least have the wit to see that we didn't come from nothing.  I'd like to know what kind of deity you believe in. Do you believe in God? Do you believe Jesus Christ? I'm interested to know.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Please don't wish to exterminate anyone. If you believe in God, hear me out. God made this world and everyone in it. He so loved them that he put himself into flesh and walked in our shoes and suffered horrible things just to save us sinners. He LOVES those who don't know about Him, don't care about Him, that hate Him and curse His name. He LOVES even those that kill Christians. He LOVES pedophiles. He HATES what they DO. Ohhhh, how He HATES it. But he died for them, too. Remember Jeffrey Dahmer? A homosexual murdering torturing pedophile? He accepted Jesus in prison. I believe Jeffrey is with God in Heaven right now. I read his story and his dad's testimony. My God is that awesome! There is nobody so wicked that God's love and mercy doesn't extend to them! Jeff didn't die by death penalty. Jeff was attacked by a mentally unstable serial killer. And Jeff chose not to fight back even though God gives us the right to defend ourselves from harm. He had deep guilt and shame from past sins, so maybe some of that came into play. But I also see it as the fruits of the spirit. To resist the body's natural survival instinct is pretty hard. I'd like to think Jeff was just ready to go to his real home. And God can use that story to reach others like Jeffrey Dahmer. Because they devil loves to make people think they're too far gone for salvation. But it's just not true!

                   Not a single one of those statements are true. I'm not naive, I'm not married (therefore I can't be a cuckold), I'm not from the baby boomer generation, I'm not homosexual. I'm not even male. But buzzwords indicate you're a brainwashed chan kiddie. So, I'll take a little more pity on your plight. Remember, anime girls can't love you back. 😅

                    Well, your previous statements are indicative of you being abhorrently naive.
Being a cuck, in the sense and context of how I used it, has nothing to do with being married.
Well, you're not a boomer, so either you're a lazy millennial like hundreds of millions of others, or you're a retarded zoomer.
Grats on not being a literal faggot. Doesn't mean you don't act like a faggot, you know, the definition of the word before it was completely co-opted by a bunch of butt raping homosexual deviants.
Brainwashed? Hardly. Typical of someone who is drastically and almost irreparably manipulated by the mainstream media and other leftist talking heads.

                    Also, I'm married with children. Take you typical Stacy feminist "incel insults" back to pintrest where you belong you dumb cunt.

                     You're not married and you don't have children. You are definitely an incel. You are definitely brainwashed. I don't know what zoomer means, but it's not really important. I'm sorry that your self esteem is so low that you felt the need to: fall in with literal racists from 4-chan, hurl the most laughable, sophomoric insults at anyone that dares to disagree with you, and lie about your life. Nobody that is married with children acts like this much of a bratty little fool, and nothing you say to the contrary is going to change my mind. You're in need of help. Please seek it out. Someday mummy will get too old to support you and I don't think my tax dollars should go towards supporting your lazy butt. 🤔

                      It brings a wry smile to my face, knowing people like you don't have much longer to live in this world, and that when the collapse happens, you're going to shit yourself multiple times before you die.

                      You honestly think I care what some random fucking kike cunt on the internet thinks? Your incel insults are the most pathetically regurgitated mainstream stones you could possibly throw at me or anyone else.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The good news, is that pretty soon, when western society loses its social cohesion and societal collapse begins, naive and/or malicious cunts like you are going to be chased down and beaten to death, not before being raped, unless you really are a kike, in which case, you'll most likely be passed for being raped due to how incredibly ugly you are guaranteed to fucking be. People will just move on to lynching and disembowling you.

             Fucking stop.  Your superstition gets in the way of facts.  Open your eyes to a world that doesnt require ghost stories and super villains to have evil people.

             Evil exists because people have bad intentions, not because a fucking dark angel is telling them to do it.

              you miss the point.....the fuckers who want you dead take the cavemen writings very seriously and use them as an excuse for evil....you can dismiss them all you like....but you will never get anywhere unless you understand where this all comes from....yes people can be shitty but there is a whole structure in place to make them shittier and reward them for it

              I’ve witnessed a few demonic possessions, and they were truly terrifying. The psychiatry/mental health community like to water it down and call it schizophrenia, but that’s bullshit. My childhood friend was attacked/possessed by demonic entities and started speaking Spanish fluently in the most menacing sounding voice (he didn’t know a word of Spanish besides the common ones). He also tried to attack us with a knife and has inexplicable “superhuman” strength. Mind you, he was 12 at the time, about 100 lbs, and it took 5 adults to restrain him. Funny thing is, the “superhuman” strength was also a factor in another possession I witnessed. I’ve repeated these scenarios to some mental health professionals and none of them were able to give me a clear medical explanation.

              I get where you are coming from, if youve never had first hand experience with it it seems like such bullshit but, There are interdenominational beings.  I've had first hand experience with it, both with witnesses, and by myself.  Footsteps with no explanation, blankets ripped off me, a friend break into tears that id never seen cry for no reason.  You cant apply scientific method to this shit so its unprovable. I've never fucked with summoning or directly tried to amp up an entity when I had the chance.  Ive only lived in one active spot ever and i couldnt stay there more than 2 months before I left.  Most people are reluctant to talk about it, but if you ask a lot of people have had experiences at specific places.  If you're a skeptic, challenge yourself to spend a night in an active place.  I still own the active home, but I have it rented and I dont go there.

              You are missing something important.  Just because

              </em>
              do not believe in hocus-pocus "caveman" writings, does not mean that

               other people
              </em>
              do not believe in that stuff.   Which leads back to this point:

             <p>
              Some people actually do make those kinds of bad choices that cause them to follow the teaching of hocus-pocus, caveman, cult (occultist) ideologies. You cannot simply discount the influence of those extremist fringe sub-cultures on others.

              You make yourself look stupid when you say “literally” and don’t mean “literally”- like some zoomer who gets his dick hard by yelling at the Christian girl in class because she says she believes in God. You’re arrogance and ignorance are closely related. Those who believe in supernatural evil and supernatural good don’t refute the idea of people having bad intentions, it’s that they make a million immoral decisions, inviting evil into their life over and over again, until they are essentially my consumed. You’re a raging retard for saying “open your eyes” when all you have opened is your eyes. We see evil. We are evil men. But some of us didn’t stop there- some of us wanted to better understand our enemy so that we can understand how our enemy lives in us. We didn’t stop at people bad intentions, we wanted to know how a human can be so bad. My eyes are open and I can see that there is much that I cannot are. Open your mind you faggot.

                Wow- haven’t heard that one before. Sounds like your ego resisting something bigger than yourself. The central point that I made was that we must accept that there things that exist outside what we can see, that faith is a part of knowing all there is to know, because we cannot know most of what is. But cool quip there doofus.

                 I'm a doofus cause I called you out?  Of course I am.  The alternative would be to admit you look like an idiot.  And calling somebody a raging retard isn't very Christian of you is it?  You're a typical hypocritical, stupid jesus fag with more arrogance than intelligence.  Good luck doofus.

                  This is the most mad I’ve seen someone get from being called a doofus. And no, you’re not a doofus for calling me out; you’re a doofus for taking my comment personally when I wasn’t even talking to you. But I guess small-mindedness defends small-mindedness. I don’t hate you for being an idiot, but it won’t stop me from calling people out for refusing to see that there are planes of existence that are working around us all the time.

                    Sourcefagging is bad enough, but even worse for things you know can't (and don't need to be)be proven.  When you stop looking at yourself as a god you might learn more about the world, that is what you are being told...you can think about it and be quiet or you can keep spamming weak come backs

                      You've got it exactly backwards but I can completely relate and I don't have the foggiest how to convince you...no one who ever tried to convince me had a cogent argument.  My best advice is to have some kids...if you can't figure out all you need to know about God then you are really trying hard.

             Hanged is correct in this context. It's like "swum" which is a correct word that sounds stupid.

             When I was growing up, it was hung. Somewhere in  the late 90's, a word that never was, hanged, appeared and became correct. Previous to that, in in school you would get made fun of for saying hanged 'cause Hanged ain't a word!  It was a common mistake among esl kids, as it was drilled into us in english class from a very young age.

              it was always hanged....."to be hanged by the neck until dead" was the sentence read for the death penalty in the UK since forever....I guess because the US found other creative means of execution and the UK abandoned it the term fell out of use and people adopted the more usual English verb conjugation....but pedants like me will always correct people....it's always been hanged

                 Hmmm. I wonder. 
I just remember kids in school making fun of any one who said hanged 70's/80's then during gulf war 1 , a CNN correspondent kept saying hanged, and we all made fun of him but then my friends in Asia all started using that term.

             Yeah it is a bit of a weird quirk in English. I wouldn't expect native speakers to get it right, as it is rather bizarre.

              That is correct, but to be more accurate people can be 'hung out to dry' or they can be 'hung by their arms and beaten' as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is given that we use Hanged as the past participle of To Hang when meaning 'To be put to death by hanging'.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hung is the past participle for all other uses of To Hang - e.g. We hung the picture in the hall. /  They hung the curtains themselves. / She hung the rabbit in the tree.
