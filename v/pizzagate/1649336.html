<p>** This a great thread that tied together a lot of the suspicious things about her &quot;suicide&quot;. ABSOLUTELY MUST READ!!!</p>
<p>I\'m not going to regurgitate the whole thread here, but I just wanted to redirect eyeballs back to what I feel is a very strong lead.</p>
<p>Aside from the strange Marfa connection, of particular interest to me (in hindsight) is that she was in the Peace Corps in St. Lucia and worked with organizing relief efforts for Haiti. She also worked with children\'s charities here in the US.</p>
<p>This brings us to Monica Peterson, who also &quot;killed herself&quot; after her work in Haiti.  George Webb covered Monica Peterson fairly extensively in his YouTube series (appx Days 70-90+).  You could listen to any of those for some of his take (Dyncorp connections and more).  
</p>
<p>George Webb seems to believe she was digging into the micro-financing (&quot;micro-loansharking&quot;, as he calls it).  This is potentially the channel with which poor women in these impoverished countries (Haiti, India, Indonesia) get lured into usurious loans that are intended to spiral out of control and entrap them into debt bondage (later leads to prostitution, slavery, selling off children, etc). </p>
<p>Couple of old threads that deal with microfinancing:</p>

(<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1602869">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1602869)</a>)</p>
<p>The main purpose of my thread is that I wanted to re-direct attention to this old case (Melaney Parker), as I think it deserves more attention.  The similarities to Monica Peterson were also very curious to me... both strange &quot;suicides&quot; and families that insist they didn\'t kill themselves.

             There are only two down votes shown...but there has been a lot of sliding with duplicate posts.  We have 3x Normal amt of active users...likely spurred by all the news but at least 1/3 are probably shills.  Possibly CTR / Media / blue state paid army...run by Clinton leach, David Brock.

              The duped posts are getting really annoying. 
Assumed it was unintentional, but interesting thought that it is deliberate to clog up front page. Either way, it is extremely counterproductive and wish the mods would crack down on it...

            Monica Petersen is the key to all of Pizzagate. Her boss Claude d'Estree and friend Rex are in on it.
