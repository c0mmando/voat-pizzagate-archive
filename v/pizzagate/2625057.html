<p>Pretty much everyone under the scope of Pizzagate has a few degrees of separation to Hillary, so the intention here, unless its a super close and long standing connection like John Podesta (by which she would likely know what kind of creep they are), is to try and limit/highlight evidence specific to Hillary herself, or the Clinton Foundation’s direct activities</p>
<p>1990s 
<a href="https://youtu.be/gLclDXINVsY?t=2551">Cathy O’Brien</a> sexually abused and mind controlled from birth and offered to the elite in the Whitehouse for abuse and occult rituals, names Hillary as one of her abusers (she also names Justin Trudeau’s father)</p>
<p>1997 
Hillary, who still cites it as one of her proudest achievements, drafts and Bill signs into Law the Adoptions and Safe Families Act. In an obviously perverse incentive, it mandates $4000-$6000 cash bonuses for every child taken off biological parents and handed over to Foster parents, immediately placing them in a demographic of catastrophically worse life outcomes. Children so taken typically go through a revolving door of foster carers, some of who are paedophile ring participants. Senator Nancy Schaefer<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byMofVM8RtA&amp;t=3s"> died in suspicious circumstances</a> as she neared completion of a documentary which alleged that paedophiles were routinely and knowingly given foster kids.</p>
<p>Late 1990s The head of the Kosovo Liberation Army is known to have funded his genocidal guerrilla force through underage prostitution rings and organ harvesting from captured soldiers and civilians. On the global charity Gala circuit, he is often found seated <a href="http://archive.is/j2vok">at the same table</a> as Bill &amp; Hillary. The extent of Human trafficking during the Yugoslavian genocide - and how no-one in the U.N. camp faced jail for it - is detailed in the movie The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E56OYUV7BWw">Whistleblower </a>with Rachael Weiss. The woman who blew the whistle in real life was so reviled in her workplace as a result that she ate alone in the UN cafeteria. Think about that.</p>
<p>Early 2000s Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein regularly <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=0WH406_rMIY">conducts orgies</a> on Little St James Island in the Caribbean, for which he is convicted of a child prostitution racket. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1507315-epstein-flight-manifests.html">Flight records</a> allege Bill Clinton took 26 trips to that island and Hillary took 6. Epstein claimed to have been a founding member of the Clinton Foundation</p>
<p>2011 Laura Silsby affair, in which Ms Silsby was convicted on a second consecutive attempt to alight across the Dominican border with 33 children without adequate attempts to locate their parents in earthquake ravaged Haiti. Ms Silsby was extradited after personal intervention from the Clintons, and Silsby was one of the gests at Chelsea’s wedding</p>
<p>Speaking of Chelsea, she seems to have a penchant for wearing an <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3fx1cjyjSkk/maxresdefault.jpg">upside down cross</a>, signifying an affinity for satanism. She seemed to corroborate this interest in<a href="https://twitter.com/churchofsatan/status/948304648133201920"> publicly tweeting</a> in glowing terms of her connection to Church of Satan twitter account holder</p>
<p>In 2016 Wikileaks dropped the John Podesta email cache which coined the term #Pizzagate. Covering several years of Hillary’s right hand man in Washington DC, it contained several cryptic references to ‘pizza’ , an unrepentant friendship with the convicted Denis Hastert (sentenced for bribing his child sexual abuse victims to keep quiet), and occult practices such as ‘spirit cooking’ occult rituals with Marina Abramovic. This prompted a wider enquiry into Podesta and his brother Tony, revealing a disquieting interest in the exaltation of child abuse and cannibalism artwork, and the uncanny similarity between the brothers and the police identikit in the Madeleine McCann disappearance, with accompanying evidence that they were staying at Clement Freud’s house (who also incurred paedophile accusations from a number of UK victims after his death) at the time.</p>
<p>So that’s Hillary’s right hand man. Her left hand, her ‘shield maiden’ personal aide Huma Abedin, whose family are leads of the Muslim Brotherhood, came into notoriety when her husband Anthony Weiner was convicted of sexting an underage girls.When arrested, Weiner yielded a laptop to authorities in which it is alleged there were \'insurance files\' of pedophile blackmail videos of Hillary and Huma . This was also <a href="https://truepundit.com/ig-report-confirms-true-pundit-bombshell-on-hillarys-emails-details-comey-was-briefed-on-clinton-linked-sex-crimes-against-children-evidence-on-weiner-laptop/">allegedly mentioned</a> in the IG report which dropped in June 2018.</p>
<p>2016 cont 
The Podesta emails also showed Hillary had fundraising parties at Comet Ping Pong, a restaurant which featured artwork from child sexual abuse victims, hosted bands who joked onstage about paedophilia, and whose owner’s <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=ausqrX-lDaA">instagram feed</a> was a litany of the dark humour of infant sexualisation fetishers. That owner, Alefantis, chose an historical symbol of pedorasty as his Instagram <a href="https://hooktube.com/watch?v=oGYK6YIhd6M">avatar</a>. James Alefantis is also an ex-lover to David Brock, the media mogul with connections to the Rothschilds who kept America enslaved to the idea of Hillary’s entitlement to the Presidency.</p>

Haiti seems to be a hotbed of Clinton Foundation misconduct speculation, including the allegations that mysteriously murdered researcher <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1468735">Monica Petersen </a>made about Foundation involvement in the sex trafficking of Haitian women shortly before she died in late 2016</p>

              has stickied another post, and we unfortunately cannot sticky more than three at a time.

              said we cannot link it to the sidebar either, since we ran out of space there.

              He is going to do a summary of the Excutive Summary posts (including yours), after he'll be back from his holiday.

              Also, we can re-sticky your post in a couple of days when we'll take down one of those currently stickied.

               We are literally maxed out in the sidebar. Not a character more can be added. Last time I tweaked it, I had to reword a few things. I think what we need now is an Executive Summary of executive summaries, LOL. That would be fitting, since Falcon never updated his. It shouldn't be the only one linked.
              </p>
              <p>
               So...we need to make a thread rounding up all of the round-up threads and put that in the sidebar. When I get back from vacation, I can do it. But for the next two weeks, I'm not going to have the time.

             no, it isnt. The producer she worked with was 'got at' - something spooked him. He swore 'nothing would stop him releasing it' - then after Nancy died (the film was about 3 weeks from completion) he did a 100% turnaround and refuses to release it

             We should definitely sticky it -- but only after it has links supporting every claim. There are several yet to be filled in. MH, ping me when you've got them all in place. In a thread like this, each statement really needs to link to the proof/relevant research threads.
            </p>

            Late 1990s The head of the Kosovo Liberation Army is known to have funded his genocidal guerrilla force through underage prostitution rings and organ harvesting from captured soldiers and civilians. On the global charity Gala circuit, he is often found seated at the same table as Bill &amp; Hillary. The extent of Human trafficking during the Yugoslavian genocide - and how no-one in the U.N. camp faced jail for it - is detailed in the movie The Whistleblower Whistleblower YouTubewith Rachael Weiss. The woman who blew the whistle in real life was so reviled in her workplace as a result that she ate alone in the UN cafeteria. Think about that.

            Thank you so much for mentioning this and for speaking about Organ Harvesting/Trafficking. Hillary and Bill have done so much to harm our children  They need to be called out for this, one of the most egregious crimes against the Children of the World.  The names they stamp on their Bills and Org. are never what they seem Adoptions and Safe Families Act.  One of the worst tricks  played on our country.

             , surely you can't deny that these facts about Hillary -
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3729466/Child-rape-victim-comes-forward-time-40-years-call-Hillary-Clinton-liar-defended-rapist-smearing-blocking-evidence-callously-laughing-knew-guilty.html">
              http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3729466/Child-rape-victim-comes-forward-time-40-years-call-Hillary-Clinton-liar-defended-rapist-smearing-blocking-evidence-callously-laughing-knew-guilty.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             For me this tells us a lot about the character and ethics of Hillary. I personally do not know of any female who would knowingly defend a brutal child rapist like this. A man who caused injuries so bad the victim could never bear children. Hillary was unaffected by the instinctual feminine empathy any normal woman would have towards a child who had been brutally raped and injured by an unrepenting man. She proves to us she has no empathy in real life for crimes such as this against children. In fact she values the rapist more and sees it only as an opportunity to further her career.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the definition of a psychopath.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a starting point, this FACTUAL case sure paves the way for believing all the other allegations against her that you say are lies.
            </p>
            <p>
             If, for example, she had actually vigorously defended the victim and got that rapist the 30 years he deserved then maybe we could say her character does not match her alleged crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is not the case.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you know of any females who would defend a child rapist that you knew was guilty in a case like this?

              An opportunity to further her career?  That's just ludicrous.   She was appointed by a court because the defendant insisted on a female lawyer.  She didn't take this case herself.  She was ordered by a judge to take it.  She didn't have the right to refuse this case.

              No, this is a fake character you created to rip down.  You demonize her, give her zero benefit of any doubt, lie about the facts and then make this claim.

             <p>
              The truth of this case, is Hillary Clinton did not put this girl through anything, legal experts said she did nothing unethical and the reporter who interviewed her says she never laughed at the girl once.  What this girl went through was not Hillary Clinton's doing.  Clinton never questioned her and never had her questioned.  It was the prosecutors who grilled her and eventually had her take a polygraph, because the prosecutors believed she wasn't telling the full story of what happened.  In fact, you take Hillary Clinton out of this story and this poor woman's story doesn't change a whit.

              You have no idea how our criminal justice system works.  Female lawyers defend clients all the time.  The American Bar Association says "Defense counsel is essential to the administration of criminal justice" and says
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Defense attorneys are ethically bound to zealously represent all clients, those whom they think will be justly found guilty as well as those whom they think are factually innocent.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              If she didn't defend her client vigorously, he could appeal his conviction and have it overturned.  It's called "appeal due to ineffective counsel." The American system is the government has to prove you are guilty and when you are found guilty, we can say you had a defense and a jury of your peers still found you guilty.  This is a system of justice, not a system of tyranny.  It's not a kangaroo court you find in dictatorships.
             </p>
             <p>
              The part when she says she knew he was guilty was due to the fact he plead guilty.   She specifically laughing at why polygraphs are not used as evidence.  He passed his polygraph and later plead guilty.
             </p>
             <p>
              For example this claim in the article is false, this "grueling court-ordered psychiatric examination" never took place and the girl never knew anything about this at the time.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Shelton said Clinton accused her during the case of 'seeking out older men', and demanded that the 12-year-old undergo a grueling court-ordered psychiatric examination to determine whether she was 'mentally unstable'.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Clinton filed a request and it was turned down.  This exam never happened.  A lawyer found the full case files after these news stories came out.

               <strong>
                it was denied by the judge.
               </strong>
               The court docket for July 28 says Clinton filed her motion for an exam. On July 29, it states: “Hearing on Motion for Psychiatric Examination — Motion denied. Defendant objects.” (

              The questioning she experienced was on behalf of the prosecutor not Clinton.  Clinton never got to question her at all and there was no cross examination and no trial.

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Shelton said one of her worst memories of the case was being questioned repeatedly by appointed experts.
              </p>
              <p>
               'It got so bad that I told my mom I wasn't going back, and whatever happened, happened,' said Shelton. 'It's sad that a 12-year-old had to go through what I had to go through, because for days I cried and cried and cried over it.'
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Her worst memories have nothing to do with Clinton.

              In fact, the victim in this case said in 2008 that she bore no ill will to Clinton would was just doing her job.  The people who actually gave her grief in this case were the cops and the prosecutor because they didn't believe her story.  This article is the most fact-filled article on the case.  It originally came out in 2008.  Here's what the woman said.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               With all the anguish she’d felt over the case in the years since, there was one thing she never realized — that the lawyer for the man she reviles was none other than Hillary Rodham Clinton.
              </p>
              <p>
               “I have to understand that she was representing Taylor,” she said when interviewed in prison last fall. “I’m sure Hillary was just doing her job.”........
...she bears Hillary Rodham Clinton no ill will and was eager to read “Living History” — at least pages 72 and 73, which contain her case.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              Hillary was court-appointed to defend this guy and legal ethics say you have to vigorously defend your client.  It's part of our system for hundreds of years.  It's a check on the government's awesome power to take away your liberty.  Legal experts said she did nothing unethical.   The guy got a lesser charge, because he the prosecutors had an extremely weak case and he got a plea deal.  They didn't fully believe the girl, the cops lost the physical evidence connecting him with the crime and the girl's mother didn't want her to testify.  95% of violent crime convictions in this country are the result of a plea deal.

             <p>
              This is false too.
Clinton was not laughing at this woman.  She called the case a terrible case on those very same tapes and said it inspired her to open the first rape hotline in Arkansas.
She was laughing at things like the judge wouldn't let her hear evidence against her client because she was a woman.  She never laughed about the girl.

               replies? Are you using 2 accounts? Why is one article declared 'lies' over another? Why are you trying to use legal logic when my point was she has no empathy or morals? You didnt answer one of my only questions just tried to lecture me -

              <p>
               Do you know of any females who would defend a child rapist THAT THEY KNEW WAS GUILTY in a case like this?

               I don't know any women who would. I wouldn't want to.
              </p>
              <p>
               Psychopaths lack empathy, are driven by power and are depraved of morals. 
No one forced Hillary to do this, I find that reasoning most laughable. If someone in my line of work asked me to do something which went against my morals in such a way, meant huge injustice and risks to the public would be carried out - I  would refuse. Even if it meant leaving my job. I have left a position of employment before as I no longer agreed with the ethics of the employers and despite raising my concerns they wouldn't change position so I did.

The Daily Mail routinely pays people for their stories and when they do, they don't check out their claims.  The victim in this case, Kathy Shelton tried to raise money over "Clinton's treatment of her."  The problem was all the bad treatment she cites had nothing to do with Clinton. She complained about being questioned over and over by investigators and being given a polygraph.   Clinton had nothing to do with this, Clinton never questioned her.  Shelton's GoFundMe once claimed

                Because you are making a claim that is completely ignorant of our system of justice and you seem to not understand the moral dimension of justice
"
                <strong>
                 The principle of justice could be described as the moral obligation
                </strong>

               <p>
                Unless you believe the government can do no wrong, you support accused people having a fair trial.  To convict someone of a crime, you must first have a trial.  To have a trial, the defendant must have a lawyer.  She was appointed by the Court to be his lawyer and she is then obligated to "zealously advocated for him."  If defense lawyers are working with the prosecutors you have a corrupt system.   You claim that her acting as his lawyer implicates her morality and her empathy.  That is false.  You further make the sexist claim that no female lawyers would do this.   As for her empathy, at the time Clinton's job was teaching law and running a Legal Aid clinic offering legal help to the poor. A job that was her choice and a job that requires empathy.  She also was pioneering legal research that expanded advocacy for children's rights.  After this case she started the first rape crisis hotline in Arkansas, one of the first in the country.

                You don't know what you're talking about.  There's no injustice at all at giving someone a fair trial.  A fair trial means the guy is going to have a lawyer and the government is obligated to prove his guilt.  Doesn't matter if it was Clinton or someone else. Your scenario is imaginary.   To convict, he needs to have a lawyer.  Having a lawyer is a basic component of justice, it's not an injustice.  The consequences of refusing would be more than leaving her job.  It might affect her law license and her ability to offer legal counsel to the poor.

You sound like you think Hillary is some sort of victim forced into getting the pedophile off who she knew at the time was guilty. Have you ever met a victim of child abuse? Ive worked with people like the victim and know many personally. This is about morals and human empathy. You don't seem to have any btw. Spend a day listening to the stories I hear and see the corruption that stops them being able to even take their abusers to court and you might wake up a bit.

                  I use two accounts because I can only make 10 comments.  The guy did not get off.  He plead guilty in a plea bargain.  Why did the prosecutor go for a plea bargain?  Cops lost the main piece of evidence and they didn't believe their witness's story.  They felt the girl had feelings for the boy in the case and the man used that as a lure.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Since the evidence was so weak, they could have lost the rape case, there was a real possibility of him going free.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You claim Hillary knew he was guilty.  You are jumbling the timeline.  He always denied the crime and took a polygraph and passed it.  He denied the crime up until he plead guilty.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Kathy Shelton withdrew her claims that her rough questioning came from Clinton.  Her lawyer admitted she removed those references from her go fund me site.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  None of the victimization Kathy Shelton felt had anything to do with Clinton.  Clinton did not cause the case to be weak.  Clinton did not cause the cops to lose the evidence.  Clinton didn't cause the cops and prosecutors to disbelief her story and subject her to aggressive questioning and a polygraph.  The one thing Clinton wanted to do never happened. Clinton asked for an exam and the judge denied that request.

                   That's two of my questions now you blatantly ignore and refuse to answer so unless you're going to actually answer my questions to you don't reply again. Proves my points that you just don't get it.

                 If your friend is so innocent and uninvolved,, David, why does the rape victim claim otherwise?
                </p>
                <p>
                 By the way, David, your friend initially said that she did the case as a favour to a male lawyer because the rapist requested a female lawyer. She changed her story later (

                </p>
                <p>
                 While your friend was "just following orders," she has never bothered to apologise to the victim. The thing is, David, your boss has a pattern of aiding and abetting sexual predators; Bill, Anthony Weiner, Harvey Weinstein, Skippy. Why?

Because giving her the benefit of the doubt she is being used by others.   Casting a more skeptical eye, she was trying to raise money from Clinton haters.

                  <p>
                   Apologise for? For assaulting her character, for stating that she "wanted" it to happen, for using junk Kinsey science when we understand child sexual assault much better now, and understand that victims aren't responsible for their assaults? For being part of a now discredited legal strategy? She's morally culpable, especially since she pretends to be such a feminist and advocate for women and children.

              This is actually what happened on the first seven flights
Ghana: Clinton teamed up with Peruvian economist Hernando De Soto to help implement De Soto's initiative to grant title to the poor, so that Africans can use their farms, homes, and businesses as collateral for credit. In all of Africa, much of the land is held in common and controlled by tribal chieftains.
             </p>
             <p>
              Nigeria:Clinton met with hundreds of political and educational leaders, discussing ways to modernize their government and fight against HIV/AIDS.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rwanda and Mozambique: He visited AIDS clinics, discussed economic issues. He noted that Mozambique, before the devastating floods, had ranked among the top five countries in the world for economic growth for three consecutive years. In Rwanda, Clinton visited the genocide memorial. In a small village, he met a Tutsi woman who lost her husband and son in the genocide and a Hutu woman whose husband was charged with participating in the genocide. Both of them, he said, are working toward reconciliation and integration. He said that the hindrance has been politicians seeking aggrandizement and power, rather than with various groups divided by ethnicity.
             </p>
             <p>
              South Africa: He met with a group called Young Life, comprising young people dedicated to working to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. He met with Nelson Mandela to discuss advancing citizen participation. Already advancing the cause, South Africa will have the first foreign branch of Clinton's signature Americorps program and Clinton participated in a televised town hall meeting to discuss and publicize the program.

              Utter fucking bullshit.   The IG report says nothing whatsoever about that.  How demented do you have to believe that if the FBI covered up this crime, the IG report wouldn't actually um....devote a paragraph or two to this ?

               read the damn thing on the govt website. It says Comey was briefed as to the existence of this implicatory evidence re Huma, Hillary &amp; the Foundation re abuse of children, and comey's response was to say 'just focus on any evidence pertaining to Weiner'
