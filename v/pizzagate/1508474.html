<p>RE: While searching wikileaks HRC emails for &quot;Cards&quot;</p>
<p>HRC from her personal email instructed Luis CdeBaca the United States Ambassador in the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons to prepare an informal paper RE: Child Slavery in Haiti.
The email was written in 2009.
<strong>Note: the Earthquake in Haiti was in 2010</strong></p>
<p>As I recall HRC worked hard to help her friend Silsby who went to Haiti after the earthquake  who under the auspices of starting an orphanage got in trouble for rounding up 33 children. (Silsby was defended by an attorney with history of some type of trafficking.)
Silsby also failed to get licensing etc. for the orphanage and some of the kids had parents who complained.</p>
<p>It turns out there are no laws against human trafficking in Haiti and it is common practice for poor people to give their children away as domestic servants. And there are no National Identity **&quot;Cards&quot; **issued until voting age. So if a person or a Foundation was seeking to get into human trafficking then Haiti would be a place without any major barriers to entry and the earthquake would make it easier.</p>

<p>Hi Cheryl,</p>
<p>The Secretary asked me to send her, through you, an informal paper that she could share with President Clinton on the
<strong>restavek</strong> problem. I was in Africa and then out of pocket much of last week, but I wanted to make sure that you have it</p>
<p>before you go to Haiti.</p>
<p>If I don\'t see you before then, have a great trip!</p>

<p><em>Definition: A restavek (or restavec) is a child in Haiti who is sent by his or her parents to work for a host household as a domestic servant because the parents lack the resources required to support the child.</em></p>
<p>Per the informal paper from Luis CdeBaca</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14662">https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14662</a><a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/14662">Title Here</a></p>
<p>APPENDIX: Haiti Narrative 2009 FULL</p>
<p>HAITI (Special Case)</p>
<p>Haiti has had a weak government since widespread violence and political instability led to the resignation of the
president in 2004. National elections in 2006 elected a president and a Parliament that replaced an appointed
interim government, but the effectiveness of state institutions remained severely limited. Civil unrest in April</p>
<p>2008 left the country without a government for five months. The Government of Haiti\'s ability to provide basic
services and security for citizens, and to control rampant crime in the capital, Port-au-Prince, continues to be
compromised by limited resources, an untrained and poorly equipped police force, entrenched government
corruption, and perennially weak government institutions.</p>
<p>The UN Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) continued to maintain more than 6,950 troops and 1,900
police throughout the country to provide security. Haiti remains a Special Case for the fourth consecutive year
as the new government formed in September 2008 has not yet been able to address the significant challenges
facing the country, including human trafficking. The U.S. government, however, notes the progress of Haiti\'s
government, and urges the Government of Haiti to take immediate action to address its serious trafficking-in-
persons problems. The following background and recommendations are provided to guide government officials.</p>
<p>Scope and Magnitude: <strong>Haiti is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children
trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation.</strong> Haitian women, men, and children are
trafficked into the Dominican Republic, The Bahamas, the United States, Europe, Canada, and Jamaica for
exploitation in domestic service, agriculture, and construction. Trafficked Dominican women and girls are
forced into prostitution. Some may be patronized by UN peacekeepers in Haiti, although MINUSTAH is
implementing programs among its personnel to suppress this practice. Several NGOs noted a sharp increase in
the number of Haitian children trafficked for sex and labor to the Dominican Republic and The Bahamas during
2008.</p>
<p>The majority of trafficking cases are found among the estimated 90,000 to 300,000 restaveks in Haiti, and the
3,000 additional restaveks who are trafficked to the Dominican Republic. Poor, mostly rural families send their
children to cities to live with relatively wealthier &quot;host&quot; families, whom they expect to provide the children with
food, shelter, and an education in exchange for domestic work. While some restaveks are cared for and sent to
school, most of these children are subjected to <strong>involuntary domestic servitude. These restaveks, 65 percent of
whom are girls between the ages of six and 14, work excessive hours, receive no schooling or payment and are
often physically and sexually abused. Haitian labor laws require employers to pay domestic workers over the
age of 15, so many host families dismiss restaveks before they reach that age. Dismissed and runaway restaveks
make up a significant proportion of the large population of street children, who frequently are forced to work in
prostitution or street crime by violent criminal gangs. Women and girls from the Dominican Republic are
trafficked into Haiti for commercial sexual exploitation.</strong> Some of the Haitians who voluntarily migrate to the
Dominican Republic, The Bahamas, the United States, and other Caribbean nations, subsequently face
conditions of forced labor on sugar-cane plantations, and in agriculture and construction.</p>
<p><strong>Haitian officials recognize that human trafficking is a serious problem in the country, including the exploitation of restavek children as domestic servants. As a policy matter, however, the national police child protection unit, the Brigade for the Protection of Minors (BPM), does not pursue restavek trafficking cases because there is no statutory penalty against the practice. Haitian law also does not specifically prohibit trafficking in persons, which limits its ability to punish traffickers and protect victims. It did shut down a number of unregistered orphanages whose residents were believed to be vulnerable to trafficking.</strong></p>
<p>The Office of National Identification, with technical assistance from the Organization of American States and
the Government of Canada, began to provide national identity <strong>cards</strong> to persons who reached the legal voting age
since the last election. It continued to provide birth certificates to citizens who had not previously been issued
official identity documents. The government does not follow systematic victim identification procedures,
though Haitian authorities work closely with NGOs to refer identified victims -- primarily children -- and
coordinate protective services as needed. Shelter services for adult trafficking victims do not exist, and the
government should make every effort to open or support facilities which could provide men and women with
appropriate assistance.</p>

            Identity cards birth certificates etc are a good angle to pursue.  Having first hand knowledge of the recent wave of mainly central American illegal immigrants to US,  I have seen the majority of the children have false identities and false birth certificates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Very commonly, the children when questioned in their native language will give ages and birth dates that differ from what is in their school registration forms and birth certificates. In most cases they are older than stated, with many actually 18+. Stating minor age is a huge barrier to investigating and ultimately a safeguard against deportation. Additionally they often have a guardian who is unreachable or fictitious and they often stay with unrelated people or more distant relatives rather than staying with a parent.  All this keeps children vulnerable as many services cannot be provided without parent/guardian signature.
           </p>
           <p>
            I realize this may seem tangential to the topic as far as it isn't limited to &lt;18 kids, but I want to provide understanding of the overall patterns of trafficking in the americas and emphasize the major role of false papers and false identities. The systems of false identities practiced both by criminals and by our own government  are huge and prolific.

            The dealings involving these islands, Haiti/DR, Puerto Rico and possibly even the US virgin islands, given their close proximity, is I'm sure where something absolutely huge is going to be found. I found an article a while back saying how the Podesta's had lobbied for the Puerto Rican's to get the US to wave billions of dollars in debt, backed by Hillary.

            If we assume they are trying to traffic children from Haiti, east through the Dominican Republic, the logical next step is indeed Puerto Rico. A short boat ride off the island and BAM! you're in another country who is effectively, in your debt.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we could find something if we look into the logistical side of things concerning these countries.

            Please go back to that CdeBaca email and you will notice under his signature LOU is the number 322. There's another Wikileaks Hillary email about a young girl from Yemem where Hillary is asking to be reconnected with the young girl. It's creepy.  Hillary also signs 322. Look the emails up on wikileaks or check my Twitter (same name) &amp; I'll repost the emails and images just now. HERE'S THE THING:
            <strong>
             322 is code for Skull &amp; Bones and they are the actual buyers of the kids
            </strong>
            that are being trafficked. If anyone is interested I've got more on this connection. Let me know. Thanks.

            No national identity cards until voting age?
           </p>
           <p>
            That means no identification. In essence, it means that the child may or "may not" exist, or only in a family member's memory. That's why Haiti is such ideal trafficking ground for the pedophiles. This is a great find.

            I find it curious why she ended up with exactly 33 children.....not 31...not 35.....33. It could be a coincidence, but one thing we've learned about them is that they love symbology and ritual. The "coincidences" are at an absurd level at this point.

            It would make sense to use as a hub any country where trafficking is either legal or otherwise overlooked.

            Okay, so I saw this post in which a "card" is government registration and the other one about "cards" with the theory that cards provide access to something like "sex auctions" or "admission to ritualistic sex events". Which interpretation of cards best fits FBIanon's usage? Convince me.

             Regardless of a "card(s)" theory being correct or incorrect or whether the FBIAnon is real or not for whatever reason the invisible hand of truth seems to point to the SOS/Clinton Foundation at a minimum being too close and cozy with a subject matter under our nose and off the radar of our daily lives- Human Trafficking.

            Liberia has the lowest percentage of registered children of the Clinton Foundation counties, with only 4% registered, and Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire have a high fertility rate of roughly 5 children per woman, making these countries targets for child trafficking.

            There has been an extensive post and research on the "cards" They are linked through Southebys including information about art museums as fronts for acess much sinister i.e. Child sex/satanic ritual abuse and he worst. It was a mind blowing discovery. Documented in Voat earlier there extensive investigation into the elite connections to museums of alleged art. Which has been repeatedly shown the sadistict, immoral, so called the future of art. Now we see all these worlds comtogether in open exhibits worshipping Satan, Muloch, Osiris, Thermaic, Alister Crowley, new age occultism, Illuminati, NWO, etc. I could go on. What they all have in common is the complete handover to Satan and his demons

             What I see in this is a system to legally acquire children who are know as Restaveks and send them to the Dominican Republic. Where a company works providing energy for resorts and hotels. The company is InterEnergy Holdings Ltd. Who's CEO is Rolando González-Bunster.  Rolando also holds a board position on the highly suspicious J&amp;T Packing Co. Inc. out of Arkansas. All that means little to nothing without more evidence but it's a start. Details on what appears to be the  Clinton's J&amp;T Packing .

            I wonder if any "cards" are given to children to give them fake identities, and perhaps the children wouldn't understand what is happening. The fake birth certificates would have a sense of truthiness, while not being useful at all.

             It seems plausible to me. I am undecided - however - if one takes some of his claims and finds useful information like this, there might be truth in it, even if he is a fake... so good can come of it if one has an open mind.

             I'm inclined to believe he may just have been a rather insightful LARPer, but insightful nonetheless. His notes have been helpful either way, and that's what I care about.

               I said rather insightful, not every word is gospel. But he also addressed the more ridiculous things by indicating he was mixing in false info for plausible deniability reasons.
              </p>
              <p>
               And it seems most of the things he's indicated about the CF and trafficking do add up, unlike his sillier comments about Soros, Jews, etc.

            This is also a common practice in Mozambique, kids are given away or sold off by their parents into servitude because they can't afford to feed them. They are taken across the border into South Africa, the girls go to work as maids or prostitutes and the boys to the mines and farms, when for whatever reason they cease to be useful or especially if they rebel, immigration authorities are called in and deport them back to Mozambique. The report I read long ago mentions Chinese and Russian gangs being intermediaries, although the kids are usually sourced by people trusted by the parents, usually priests or muslim clerics claiming to be taking them to a religious school. The going rate for a child is $2000.

             32 of the 33 children in Silsby's (unauthorized) possession at the time of her arrest, had parents.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was attempting to steal kids from the Earthquake zone, undetected. She was being followed very closely by Hillary Clinton, via Huma Abedin as a level of deniability. Silsby has not set up the orphanage, and she KNEW that she had to do that first. She was attempting to remove 33 kids from haiti, and she and 10 others involved were arrested. The ten other were released, and Silsby was convicted of trafficking. Her attorney, at that TIME, was wanted in Sal Salvador for sex offenses and trafficking, and has since been convicted.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's a mess anywhere you look with Silsby.

              I'm pretty sure Jorge Torres (convicted sex trafficker) got the charges reduced pretty drastically.  Otherwise, she would be in jail.
