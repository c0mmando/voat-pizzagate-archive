            - first read the coimment which is "D E S C E N D".
Question for the instagram, in which sense? The boy is going trough something, whilst you are looking?
- second look at  the boy
he looks as he in distress, the left eye is probably swollen with an edema.
he is not with the legs is a position where he can try to lend on the floor naturally
he did not jump his legs are suspended up in the air,  and he is worried
assured he is going to land on the floor as he is seen on the picture.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the only photo that cannot be chamaleon as 'artistic'.
Even if the advocate of the pedo love from MSM cannot say this is a type of 'natural pederast love'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at the boy again, this is a damn proof of torture and sadism, goodness sake.

            yeah,, You mention a photo. Look I'll watch the video later but in the meantime it would be useful if you put an archive link to the actual photo you're talking about. There's enough of a backlog of vids for me to get through as it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's funny, I remember at the start when we were on the chans and just starting to discover this stuff and anon's were shouting about how we needed to get vids' and consumable media put together.... I think that we can chill on that now and just get back to collecting evidence ie ARCHIVING the FK out of Everything.
           </p>
           <p>
            I heard someone mention a wiki the other day... starting to sound like a really good idea!!!
