<p>If you shift your primary focus (or any focus at all for that matter) of the investigation onto cartoons and shows that are mostly satirical, then you\'ve essentially become just like the third-wave feminists that want to control the video game industry because of sexism (Anita Sarkeesian) and the religious right-wing that wanted to control it for the reasons of violence (Jack Thompson), AKA you\'ve began to attack people and content creators because of your feelings with absolutely no basis to back up your general claims that cartoons that &quot;promote&quot; pedophilia cause people to accept it as normal.</p>
<p>I don\'t want PizzaGate to turn into a pointless shitstorm where people point out pedo jokes on TV or a &quot;war on pedophilia&quot; where we all resort to full blown autism and start name calling as the neocons and neolibs have been doing for so long now. As we all know, that kind of mentality never works.</p>
<p>All I am asking is that we lay off the cartoons, the comedy and TV in general a bit because so far I\'ve seen no meaningful advancement in the investigation come from investigations of TV shows and cartoons.</p>',

            For years, Hollywood has been conditioning and desensitizing us, mainstreaming vulgarity in movies, prime time tv family sitcoms, dramas and kid shows. How many times have you watched TV with your family and friends and become extremely uncomfortable at what you are hearing and/or seeing on the screen?  Hollywood continues to push the envelope.  They went way over the line with the animated movie “Sausage Party”. Huffpo published a review
            <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-the-rape-scene-in-sausage-party-wasnt-funny_us_57b33b68e4b04147250fba45">
             http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-the-rape-scene-in-sausage-party-wasnt-funny_us_57b33b68e4b04147250fba45
            </a>
            . Here’s a quote from the article. “The bad guy, “Douche,” finds a helpless grape juice box lying on the floor, injured and unable to move, asking for help.  It is oozing liquid out of a hole in its [vagina? asshole? box bottom?] and instead of helping, the bad guy puts his face into the hole, sucks out all the liquid, and says menacingly, “If you say anything, no one will believe you.”    That is blatant pedophilia and child rape complete with intimidation tactics.  I know this film was intended for mature audiences but wonder how many parents missed that and took their kids?   And when is child rape or any rape funny?  I used to love Bill Hader and Kristin Wiig  but knowing that they were a part of this film has completely soured me against them and all of the other actors who participated.

            Family Guy is a despicable show, plain and simple. If it's making references to paedophilia and then just happens to mention pizza, it may be worth looking into. I loathe this show, it promotes bigotry, violence and rape, so if it's promoting paedophilia as well then it needs to be taken off the channels.
           </p>
           <p>
            South Park is another one, not as bad but it does promote bigotry. As does American Dad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Simpsons? Now they know how to toe-the-line. Rarely I think they push it a bit too much, at most they occasionally desensitise a topic but don't go so far as to make a complete mockery of our emotions.

            , could you look over the submission guidelines for
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            and add some links to examples of the things you are referencing? You've only got one link here, which really doesn't make this a research post that satisfies the submission requirements. We have another sub for meta discussions --
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            -- but you could easily turn this into a research post that can be left up here. Linking to a family guy episode (timestamped) would be especially helpful. Thanks.

             Is there a way to move a post to a different sub without resubmitting? I guess
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
              v/pizzagatemods
             </a>
             is a better place to submit this.

              You can click the "source" button and copy the text, then delete the post. Go to the new sub, create a new post and paste it in. Individual comments can be pasted the same way. Unfortunately, there is no way to move a post.
