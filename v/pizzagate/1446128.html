            What's the #49th most powerful man in D.C. doing owning a "pizza place" who doesn't answer his business phone, doesn't have "Pizza" mentioned anywhere on his signs out front.
If want's to be credible the first thing he can do is quit running and answer his business phone, he doesn't because he is running, hiding. Why is his business directly above the old subway tunnel system why are there photos of him breaking concrete to those subway tunnels, why are torture rooms mentioned in his instagram pics, why are yellow neckless' on babies with grown men, why does he allow pedophiles to perform at his place HeavyBreathing performs there and HeavyBreathing talks about "little boy and little girl preferences" 
You are clearly a shill probably hired by #pizzaGate boyfriend David Brock, CTR MediaMatters shill.

            I agree with most of what you have said, but you have been misinformed about one thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I am not mistaken, the wearing the shirt that said I ❤ L'Enfants was not Alefantis, and even if it was, that does not say "I love kids."  In French that is "J'aime les enfants."
           </p>
           <p>
            The shirt the man is wearing is obviously about the L'Enfant Cafe, which was named after Pierre L'Enfant, the architect of DC.

            The only way to destroy Podesta and Brock = destroy everything they touch.   They won't be able to get a table at a restaurant after this, or find young boys to screw.

            Nazis, Nazis, Nazis.  You guys cried wolf too often.    That has no power or meaning any more.   Nor does the word 'racism.'  It's all a globalist scam to keep the sheeple in check.

             Yes, but when you falsely accuse a man of being a pedophile that is a death sentence should something happen to jimmy-comet, all the powers that be will track you all down and name you in the premeditated murder complaint.
You yell fire in a theater you go to jail. This is coming assholes.

             ...
There isn't any kind of evidence for anything other than the crime of eating or talking about pizza. 
The problem is this all came from 4chan, where up until a year ago was a honey pot for real CP, all those ppl had CP on the brain 24/7, it was ha-ha, ...
Then along came Trump and MAGA and a special place was created for social retards it was called the "The Donald" on Reddit, and then the CIA released the wiki podesta emails and CP autistic back at 4chan found the word pizza in podesta email and of course if you live on 4chan ( socially retard ) then pizza can only mean one thing? Pizza; I myself am a gourmet cook and so is podesta and guess what we make pizza, we talk about pizza, but do you think a social retard would understand this? fuck no
            </p>
            <p>
             So the ppl at "The donald" on reddit decide to spawn a special kill-hilllary sub called  "pizzagate" and they created a convoluted fable where nothing existed, ... it became a witch-hunt, they got banned from reddit and dispersed.

              What's the #49th most powerful man in D.C. doing owning a "pizza place" who doesn't answer his business phone, doesn't have "Pizza" mentioned anywhere on his signs out front. If want's to be credible the first thing he can do is quit running and answer his business phone, he doesn't because he is running, hiding. Why is his business directly above the old subway tunnel system why are there photos of him breaking concrete to those subway tunnels, why are torture rooms mentioned in his instagram pics, why are yellow neckless' on babies with grown men, why does he allow pedophiles to perform at his place HeavyBreathing performs there and HeavyBreathing talks about "little boy and little girl preferences" You are clearly a shill probably hired by #pizzaGate boyfriend David Brock, CTR MediaMatters shill.
