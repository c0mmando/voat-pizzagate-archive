             I write in the aftermath glow of the Official Opening of Lawson High School on 2nd August by Rt. Hon. Jeremy Hunt, Secretary of State UK, in the presence of the British High Commissioner, H.E. Rob Macaire, Members of our Kenyan Board of Directors and the Bishop of Kitui's representative....

            <p>
             ..Some days previously, Alison Stedman COGRI Nyumbani (Scotland) Trust presented me with a cheque of GBP 12,000, a donation for Lawson High School Library and computer laboratory which had been facilitated by a matching grant through Rotary Karen. Alison, her companion Trustee, Frances and group then came up to the Village to view what their donation had realized. They also presented each pupil in Class 7 in Hot-courses Primary with a personal dictionary, a gift also given to standard 7 in Nyumbani Home. This will become an annual event.

             Lea Toto had their special event on 26th July when a Government delegation from Viet Nam led by the Deputy Prime Minister, H.E. T. Vinh Trong, visited our Kibera Centre to see how we operate a NGO HIV community-based service...
            </p>
            <p>
             The special moment recently for the Nyumbani Home children was a visit from USA Congressmen Donald Payne and
             <strong>
              Keith Ellison
             </strong>
             together with staff, including our USA Board Member, Karen Robb. The highlights of the visit for our guests were meeting the children en famille and the Lea Toto children in the Respite Centre. For our children, hearing Donald Payne sing one of the songs they had just sung and listening to Keith Ellison tell the story of Jesus multiplying the loaves and fishes with the unique moral 'There is enough for all' caught their amazed attention.

              Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading George McGovern's effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office.
             </p>
             <p>
              Chester was born in 1976, John podesta's political career started in 1972, '76 was an election year and his wiki states that he worked on George McGovern's unsuccessful campaign, so he likely would have been campaigning around the US the prior year. We know how these politicians are, it's not improbable that he may have had a tryst with Chester's mother, she may have been a McGovern supporter.

             Steve Jordan interviews David Hollins as he joins Momentous Relocation, just a year after Paul Evans bought the company, in its new home in central London.
            </p>
            <p>
             was winding my way down Baker Street.  I was light in my head and dead on my feet. It was another rainy day, I’d drunk the night away and now I’d forgotten about everything.  Fortunately, just around the corner from the tube station, at number 188, is Chiltern Court the new home of Momentous Relocation.  I dropped in.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The building is a remarkable place, owned and built by London Transport immediately adjacent to the tube line and, indeed, with a secret direct access to the platform.
             </strong>
             Handy!  “But they don’t like us using it,” said David Hollins, the company’s new managing director.  I’m not surprised.
            </p>
            <p>
             With Rafael Ravenscroft’s iconic sax solo burning an ear worm in my brain I followed David to the company’s offices in the remarkably airy basement.  With modern furniture,
             <strong>
              intriguing art on the walls
             </strong>
             and collectables adorning the hallway the whole place is a bit of a home from home for Paul. It’s a nice place to work and kind of handy for … everything really. Especially buskers and record stores one would hope.
            </p>
            <p>
             David had just got his feet under the table at Momentous having joined only six weeks earlier after 18 years’ service with Crown. It is a new challenge for him and very different from what he has known before.  But he has a good team around him: Christian Peck (Stuart Peck’s son) business development; Caroline O’Connor is handling sales support; David McWilliam has been in corporate sales for a very long time; Lyris Andrews, ex Sterling, provides DSP services; Wesley Davies, is new to the industry; Wendy Smith, customer support; Ian Nicholson is in Florida oiling wheels; and there is Paul of course … Mr Midas.  It looks like a winning formula.  It probably is.
            </p>
            <p>
             Baker Street is the sales and customer service operations centre of Momentous.
             <strong>
              The company still has its warehouse in Aylesbury, 40 miles north-west of London for long-term storage and its new international operations centre in Park Royal (London’s mover city).
             </strong>
             The company employs around 30 people in total.

             Tate Modern was opened by the Queen on 11 May 2000.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tate Modern had attracted more visitors than originally expected and plans to expand it had been in preparation since 2004. These plans focused on the south west of the building with the intention of providing 5,000m2 of new display space, almost doubling the amount of display space....This project was initially costed at £215 million.[12] Of the money raised, £50 million came from the UK government; £7 million from the London Development Agency;
             <strong>
              £6 million from philanthropist John Studzinski; and donations from, among others, the Sultanate of Oman and Elisabeth Murdoch.
             </strong>
             In June 2013, international shipping and property magnate Eyal Ofer pledged £10m to the extension project, making it to 85% of the required funds.

             , has been controversial. It was originally designed with a glass stepped pyramid, but this was amended to incorporate a sloping façade in brick latticework (to match the original power-station building)[20] despite planning consent to the original design having been previously granted by the supervising authority.

              In May 2017 the Switch House was formally renamed the Blavatnik Building
             </strong>
             , after Anglo-Ukrainian billionaire Sir Leonard Blavatnik, who contributed a "substantial" amount of the £260m cost of the extension.

             In 2016, Oxford University opened its doors to the new Blavatnik building - home to the Blavatnik School of Government. The language in the Guardian article and the architecture of the building had me thinking New World Order and the UN. So, I google Blavatsky and Blavatnik and got a link to transhumanist Anders Sandberg, a colleague of Nick Bostrom and many links with Jeffrey Epstein. Then I found an archive of his internet links to all matters esoteric, including satanism. ...

            <p>
             On Feb. 15, two famous billionaires – Viktor Vekselberg in Moscow, and his business partner, the globetrotting Leonard Blavatnik from the U.S., well-known founder of Access Industries in Russia – lost a motion to dismiss a $2 billion lawsuit. ..
            </p>
            <p>
             Local Russian businessman, Leonid Lebedev, a senator and a mid-size utility shareholder known for his movie-making ventures in both Russia and the U.S., is the thorn in their side. He won’t let go of this story. Lebedev claims that Vekselberg and Blavatnik have reneged on a silent partnership agreement they had regarding shares in private oil firm TNK, a company that at one time was producing as much oil and gas per day as Libya.
            </p>
            <p>
             TNK is one of Russia’s biggest melodramas. Once known as one of Russia’s best managed private oil companies, it has been the source of serious problems; problems that have helped contribute to Russia’s reputation as a risky place for companies to invest. Two of TNK’s biggest shareholders, Vekselberg’s Renova Group and Blavatnik’s Access Industries, are no stranger to disgruntled shareholders.
            </p>
            <p>
             By most measures, their marriage with U.K. oil company BP ended poorly. To close watchers of oil battles gone bad in the Russian Federation, this is a bit of déjà vu; a story of multiple lawsuits in New York and London, harassment, and threats of incarceration.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Len Blavatnik made his fortune off Russian oil firm TNK. Now he is one of the richest men in the U.S., surpassing the wealth of Elon Musk and hedge fund manager Ray Dalio. Here he is hosting a party at the Cannes Film Festival aboard his Odessa II yacht on May 15, 2016. Infamous Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein co-hosted the party.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              One enterprising English law firm sits at the centre of a web of connections between Russian oligarchs and the British elite. An analysis of its connections shows how deeply Britain has been penetrated by Russian wealth and the potential threat it poses....
             </p>
             <p>
              The offices of Tulloch and Company, an English law firm, are based in a sepulchral white town house in London’s Mayfair. There could, superficially, be nowhere more British, and you half expect to see a gentleman in a bowler hat striding up to its front door. But Tulloch and his partner, Bruce Gripton, sit at the centre of a web of connections between Russian oligarchs and the British establishment..
             </p>
             <p>
              ..If you research Tulloch’s name you feel as if you are looking at several interconnected spider webs. I came across his name in connection with Parex, the Latvian bank which collapsed having lent money on “favourable” terms to its owners. Tulloch was a name on a list of individuals linked to commercial pledges involving Double Coffee a coffee chain associated with Parex. The ownership of the coffee franchise was masked throughout much of its existence via a British Virgin Islands registered firm. His presence there remains mysterious and may be nothing more than an internet anomaly. However, his role often seems to be to act as the secretary for offshore entities to manage Russian wealth. As Michael Weiss writing on the Daily Beast in 2014 noted he was the secretary for a company called Sevenkeys which managed the assets of the family of Putin aide Igor Shuvalov. The ownership of Sevenkeys was masked via a British Virgin Islands registered firm.
             </p>
             <p>
              When you search Tulloch’s name on the offshore leaks database it is linked to an enormous number of similarly mysterious entities:
             </p>
             <p>
              Ardin Investments Limited, one of Tulloch's mysterious firms, was used by Aleksandr Lebedev to purchase a mansion in London in 2007. Tulloch is an officer at two offshore firms, The Gemini Investment Fund Limited (GIF) and the Lion Investment Fund Limited LIF, which featured in a 2013 case involving money laundering heard at the High Court of Justice in London. GIF was used to purchase overpriced Argentinian warrants but there is no suggestion he personally was aware the transaction was dubious. Similarly his name is given as the contact for four apartments at 1 Hyde Park, the world’s most expensive residential address, in the British land registry. The ultimate owners are probably still more of his high value clients.
             </p>
             <p>
              Another offshore entity where Tulloch was an officer, Taurus Asset Management reportedly owned a 50% stake in Baltijas Aviacijas Sistemas (Baltic Aviation Systems) in 2011. BAS  was used to invest EUR 50m in airBaltic a low cost Latvian airline. It emerged that a Russian citizen Andrey Rudeshko, was the beneficiary of Taurus Asset Management, but that he in turn was the front man for Vladimir Antonov, the former owner of Latvia’s Krajbanka. Krajbanka collapsed in 2011 amid claims that ‘loans’ had been made to offshore companies believed to be controlled by Antonov as a means of transferring assets out of the bank.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is only a snapshot of how Tulloch's offshore expertise rendered him valuable to his Russian clients. However, a second element of his role is his charitable work for Russian oligarchs…
             </p>
             <p>
              If we hop on a jet from the Bahamas, where many of the Tulloch connected entities are registered and head back to the rainier climes of England we can pick up Tulloch’s trail in Oxford. He is one of the trustees of the Oxford Russia Fund along with Lord Patten, the Chancellor of Oxford University. The other trustees include Boris Saltykov a former Russian science minister and Rupert Caldecott of listed as a partner Dalton Strategic Partnership LLP (DSP). DSP is a global investment management firm managing $1.8bn for a range of organisations and private clients. The fund supports education in Russia. Tulloch, however, is also a trustee of four UK registered charities linked to Russian oligarchs. These are the Hill Foundation, Lebedev Foundation, The Mamut Foundation, and the Vinchel Foundation. He is the contact for the Khodorkovsky Foundation. The Hill Foundation while not bearing the name of an oligarch is linked via its chair Mr Anthony Smith CBE to other Russia linked charities. The charity supports gifted Russian students with Oxford scholarships and Tulloch regularly visits universities in Russia to promote its work.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Lebedev Foundation is of course the pet project of Tulloch’s employer Aleksandr Lebedev and he and his son Evgeny are its trustees along with their solicitor. The main donors are the Lebedev family and the charity largely supports the work of the Raisa Gorbachev Foundation. Indeed Lebedev first foray into the “British social scene” was marked by a fundraising dinner for the Raisa Gorbachev Foundation in 2009. This allowed him both to make contacts among the British elite while associating himself with a name naively associated in the west with benevolent reforming politics. The Mamut foundation bears the name of its patron oligarch Aleksandr Mamut and while supporting cultural activities in Russia it made a donation of £100000 to Eton College for the renovation of the library. Mamut has a residence in Kensington.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tulloch is listed as the contact for the Khodorkovsky Foundation which had long term investments of £413m against expenditure of £8.8m in 2017. Mikhail Khodorkovsky is, of course, the oligarch who was jailed by Putin in 2003 and released in 2013. He is known as a vocal critic of Putin’s “managed democracy.” Ironically Michael Weiss works for the Interpreter Magazine which was launched by the Institute of Modern Russia, an organisation founded by Khodorkovsky’s son Pavel. Khodorkovsky senior has sent out mixed messages on Crimea but a 2014 interview showed that he did not consider the issue within the framework of the sanctity of borders in international law. He stated that “Russia has several reasons to consider Crimea a part of its territory. The Crimean society also believes it to be a part of Russia.” The questionable statement on Crimea reflects his views on Chechnya which emphasise the imposed Russian legacy and display no awareness of that the country was violently subjugated to Russia. It’s rather as if a pith hatted monocle wearing British officer, just back from a ripping time in Simla was commenting on the views of the Indian population. Khodorkovsky is not the sole “democratic” Russian with similar views. Navalny, who is lauded naively as a reformer referred to people from the Caucasus as “rats.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The Vinchel Foundation which aims to help blind and visually impaired people in Russia is in financial terms the smallest of these firms. Tulloch is one of three trustees the other two being Mikhail Vinchel and his son Anthony Vinchel. Mikhail is one of the co-founders of mail.ru a major Russian internet firm which was banned from Ukraine in 2017.When the western press covered the measure they were overwhelmingly critical suggesting that it was to quote the Economist “pointless” and “because they were Russian.” The article was imbued with the sneering condescension with which Ukrainians are all too familiar stating that “the government still sometimes takes steps that seem more appropriate for a budding authoritarian regime than for an aspiring European democracy.” The report, filed without a hint of irony from Moscow, seems extraordinarily naïve given the subsequent emergence in July 2017 of the fact that Facebook had permitted mail.ru to collate data on its users friends. The potential uses of this data will be apparent as will the journalist’s internalisation of negative perceptions about Ukraine which, in turn, blinded them to a potential security threat to their own country.

            Recently, through my own investigations of the Hampstead case, I was alerted to a United Arab Emirates satellite broadcasting company Yahlive . The Hampstead angle is another chapter of this book, so I won’t go into that here. Yahlive is a very important broadcasting company for the Arab world. Saudi TV channels use this company exclusively.
           </p>
           <p>
            Several years ago I performed data recovery for a US based satellite TV company owned by a middle eastern man (clearly an arabic name and accent). This recovery was on an 8TB RAID array. Most cases someone removed a wrong disk or did something to crash the array and it just needs to be reassembled, mounted and fsck it. So the first part of recovery is examining the system logs for different things like disk/power/filesystem events. Well this system had a slew of file system errors all which showed there were video files with names that all had ages in them like "8 yo" all the way to "16 yo" and some with pornographic titles. I was able to recover the RAID part with the data on it and I checked the folder these files were in and there were
            <strong>
             thousands of these videos
            </strong>
            . I checked the folder size and it was obviously the purpose of this storage device since it over 80% of the storage space being used.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was told I would likely find CP after enough time doing DR, so I documented what I did, per our SOP, reported it to my director and he reported it to the FBI.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had this feeling at the time that the whole satellite thing was being used as a front to distribute CP but I just told myself it was being handed off to better people and that was all I could do to help. I'm dumbfounded the guy just acted so casual about it and didn't think anyone would notice what the dataset consisted of. I don't poke around in people's data, but couldn't justify to not do anything in this case.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't recall the company name but I do remember it was on the east coast since I had to coordinate between timezone differences.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still in shock at the emergence of the "streaming" industry. Look at twitch, all it does is host people streaming games and it sold for a billion dollars. The hardware and internet bandwidth needed to host streaming services is readily available to the public, anyone can go rent a server these days, and you can even purchase "anonymous hosting" with bitcoin through TOR. Hell you can even rent a server hosted in a raid proof bomb bunker. For the handling of the video, there is open source software for encoding/streaming/encryption. The whole streaming thing seems to of started with "camgirls" and this idea has been around for a while now.
