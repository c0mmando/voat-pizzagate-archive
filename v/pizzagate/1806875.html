<p><strong>What happened when ‘Pizzagate’ exploded at my restaurant</strong> By <strong>James Alefantis</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;Sadly, many people who don’t know me or my neighborhood cling to an absurd lie: that I and political figures including Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta, run a child-slavery ring out of Comet’s basement.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>REALLY?</em> So is that really the crux of our argument? Hmm. Nice crystallizing heuristic angle, latch on to the key points that were implanted by your ice moles, but here, <a href="http://www.dead.net/features/greatest-stories-ever-told/greatest-stories-ever-told-franklins-tower">if you plant ice you gonna harvest wind.</a></p>
<p><strong><em>I AM HAPPY TO REPORT, HOWEVER, THAT NO MATTER HOW HARD THE MSM TRIED TO LIE FOR YOU JIMMY, YOU ENDED UP TELLING US THE TRUTH ON THAT YOURSELF, THANK YOU!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;I’m often asked how this happened. It started in October when WikiLeaks released Podesta’s hacked emails.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><em>Nice to finally hear the truth right from the horses mouth, or should I say Minotaur?</em></p>
<p>&quot;Suddenly, the lives of everyone in Comet’s <strong>orbit</strong> (ooh, how <em>fancy</em> we are with the literary embellishments) were thrown into chaos.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Online, we were labeled as criminals — or worse. They posted our pictures, links to personal social media, even our home addresses. Our community of food runners, hosts, bussers, waiters, customers, artists we display, bands that performed, my godchildren, surrounding businesses and my mother all were harassed by self-proclaimed “investigators.”</p>
<p>-<strong><em>very clever</em></strong> placing &quot;godchildren&quot; behind &quot;bands that performed&quot;. Does Jimmy have help editing? If not, he seems quite proficient with journalistic writing prose and propaganda, even though we all know who Miss Luzzato is, her wide range of connections, and her strange parenting ability, and the fact that \'godchildren\' is only a vague superficial designation for you just <em>KNOWING</em> someone else\'s children. For a gay man who has admitted he hates children in a drunk rant to one of your \'fans\', and your constant reference and photo op\'s with them are <em>SUPER CREEPY</em>, no one has ever told you that? Its a projection that writes an entire movie about you.</p>
<p>Like this band James?</p>

<p>This is our community.... BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH</p>
<p>I couldn\'t take any more what with the bile working it\'s way up my throat and a migraine developing through every nauseating word this WaPo celebrity wrote. Spare us the theatrics drama queen basic bitch.</p>
<p>Keep pandering and grovelling to your pan-satanist DC enablers, you\'ll only come to find out that they\'ll be the first to cannibalize you in the end game. You should know that by now Jimmy, <strong><em>that\'s just the nature of the beast you run with</em></strong>.</p>',

            Sunday afternoon at a DC protest, a violent member of Antifa assaulted Rebel Media’s Washington Bureau Chief Jack Posobiec, as he attempted to give the alt-left a platform to speak their mind. The assailant was quickly arrested by George Washington University police, and Posobiec is filing charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            Upon closer inspection of the video, however was clear footage of Antifa organizer Paul ‘Luke’ Kuhn – who was busted by Project Veritas plotting Butyric acid attacks at a DC Trump inauguration party. The undercover sting, filmed at the iconic Comet Ping Pong pizzeria resulted in the arrest of Kuhn along with two others.
           </p>
           <p>
            As part of his ‘deferred sentencing’ / probation, Kuhn agreed not to attend future Antifa events. And it looks like he just violated that agreement…

            James Alafantis has got to be fucking pissed at Pedo Podesta, he got his ass kicked then thrown under the bus all because the spirit cooking pedo didn't want to reveal what  a " pizza related map" or what is " dominoes on cheese or pasta". Had he very simply just explained and acknowledged those emails his friends and families would not be a public laughing stock and forever known as Satanic pedophiles. What could those coded messages be that would be worse than you and your friends being labeled pedos? If I was James I would made Skippy talk about those coded messages or made his life hell. For christs sake his little baby goddaughter is plastered all over the internet in relation to Satanic pedophiles, she's going to be pissed when she grows up and she's going to want to know what the fuck a pizza related map is and how to play dominoes on cheese and pasta and why keeping it a secret was more important than her. Any decent friend or just human being in general would have come clean no matter how embarrassing the true meaning of the coded emails were. What a dick

            thank you for allowing me to ingest this article through your lens and saving me from accidentally viewing the actual contents of this pedopropaganda piece. I'm not a huge fan of lies, the CIA, pedorapists, WaPo, or James Alefantis. But I'm a huge fan of yours, now. Your commentary above and in the comments section are just friggin brilliant.

            This is bait.  WAPO gives a non-journalist a column, John Podesta points attention to it in twitter.
It is important to only bring up the old standards (E-File of the podestas in the McCaan is really important) and be genuinely inquisitive about the E-File with something like 'Why wouldn't John and Tony just prove they were not in potrugal at the time?"
           </p>
           <p>
            The Dominos on Pasta or Pizza comment is an old standard as well and people twitter John about it constantly
           </p>
           <p>
            We also should call attention to how we ignored that nonsense red herring with Allyn Hughes and her 'language' that was planted strictly for us to pick up so WAPO can talk about another victim.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can use podestas Twitter attention to mention Dyncorp and the arrest of its old VP, the Norway and Canada trafficking rings and how Norways major happening was deleted from NYT and WAPO.  The mass arrests all over the US since January.  I would love to get more of a source or Gowdy mentioning the two missing investigators which looks like fake news right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Be aware, this is Bait, skippy and jimmy have been amassing a great deal of information and covered their tracks so they are finally ready to hit back with dissinfo.
This WAPO article is all totally old news, Jimmy is ready to talk about developments but he wants to wett the wick first.

            Another great research by ASolo. "Sadly, many people who don’t know me" cracks me up. We know quite a bit about him, his drag queen dressing pics on instagram, ex-Boyfriend of Brock who people are finding out didn't pay his taxes (probably the least criminal act he's done), calls his pizza place "family friendly" yet promotes acts like Heavy Breathing that are filth and he has a GoFund me page taking money from people even though he was the 49th most influential in DC?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's ok, let him cry out to the Lib sheep that believe his bullshit and donate to his GoGetScrewed page. We know exactly what he is and that includes the company he keeps.

            The Obama-Alefantis connection has deeper roots, as shown by the availability of a ham-and-pineapple pizza in East Berlin. Our passage to Hawaii starts below the Berlin Wall, or what’s left of it, into the Death Strip on the edge of uber-hip Green Party stronghold Prenzlauerberg. This section of the infamous wall was preserved as a stretch of open space to memorialize East Germans who attempted escape but were gunned by the GDR border guards.
           </p>
           <p>
            Post-Cold War, the Death Strip is a graffiti-sprayed playground for teens, with its Sunday afternoon Bearpit amateur karaoke show in the amphitheater and outdoor basketball courts (take note, Barry, and be sure to tuck a hankie in your back pocket). Adjoining the Turkish ghetto of Kreutzberg, the Death Strip is a gay-cruising zone for those hankering after Arab, Kurdish, Kosovar, Bosnian or Albanian hot meat on a stick, a spicy kofta kebab slathered with tahini sauce.
           </p>
           <p>
            In year 2000,
            <strong>
             James Alefantis and partner Oliver Miller discovered Prenzlauerberg, where Miller opened Dr. Pong, a ping pong bar. San Francisco architect Miller had arrived to Berlin earlier, in 1993, when he noticed that ping pong is the only low-cost sport for plebeian youths in every sad town from Muncheberg to Kosovska and Bucak, Turkey. Playing ping pong is an easy way to strike up a conversation with penniless and hungry young kids eager to please an older male who takes them under his wing
            </strong>
            . In the sexually segregated Muslim realm, sex between an older man and a young boy is taken casually as a misdemeanor that goes unnoticed as opposed to the felony of adultery by a woman, which is punished by the death penalty. The bored boys from nearby Kreuzberg are easy pickings drawn to the bait of ping pong and beer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just up the street from the Mauerpark market, the ping pong tables at Dr. Pong provided the model for Comet Ping Pong Pizza in Washington D.C. The Berlin pedo-center is described in a reddit post: “Dr. Pong is a rugged little dingy bar in the heart of Prenzlauerberg, reminiscent of a teenage clubhouse with its minimal decor.” Note “teenage”. Its limited beverage menu is mostly non-alcoholic for entry-level rough-trade Muslim boys circling around the game tables for the next volley in the group game of “Around the World”, a dress rehearsal for a daisy chain.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the Doctor doesn’t do beer deliveries to embassy residences, there’s probably a lot of demand from diplomats for take-out meat sticks, judging from the great reviews on Trip Adviser’s English-language list of the top 10 bars in Berlin. The Top Ten list fails to include the plusher interior of the fetishist KitKat Club. Another telling indicator is that 666 bar-hopping tours stop at Dr. Pong, indicating a connection to the Satanic rites similar to those in DC. What’s intriguing about Dr. Pong is that its male-on-male games may have provided the concept for torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Graibh prison.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the last years of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) or East Germany, Prenzlauerberg was the favored residential district for gays, hippies and avant-garde artists, a tradition that continued after national reunification in October 1990. Prenzlauerberg is also the location of Rykestrasse Synagogue, the largest Jewish center in Berlin, which was restored at great expense after reunification while Berlin was being restored to its former glory as a Jewish capital with coprophilia clubs and fetish bars to degrade the goyem.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oliver Miller’s arrival in 1993 coincided with the massive expansion of human trafficking of children for the European pedophile sex trade out of the war-torn Balkans in the wake of the Clinton-Blair NATO interventions to break apart Yugoslavia. Berlin was a transit point for children transshipped between Belgrade and the UK by the Kosovar mafia and Western military contractors including DynCorp. London is the wholesale global market for child sex slaves through fraudulent NGOs that act as adoption agencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sadly for Alefantis and Miller, the pair arrived a few years too late to join SchwuP, the Movement for Gay, Pederast and Transsexual Rights, which until 1987 was a wing of the Green Party, itself a product of the sexual liberation and drug experimentation theories of the CIA-allied Frankfurt School. Even after being busted for possession of methamphetamines, SchwuP leader Volker Berg survives as a parliamentarian in the Bundestag as the crusty old chief of the German-Israeli Parliamentary Friendship Group. Go chew on that, vice cops and DEA agents.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1986, Volker’s “Schwuppies” distributed this Green Party flyer to parliamentarians: “He is a boy, roughly 10 years old, with a pretty face, full lips, a straight nose and shoulder-length hair. The wings of an angel protrude from his narrow back, and a penis is drawn with thin lines on the front of his body.” In any country other than defeatist Germany beholden to the Israeli pedophiles, this sort of drivel is called illegal pornographic trash and justification for SWAT shoot-to-kill raids.
           </p>
           <p>
            The politically ambitious Greens eventually had to repudiate their support for sex with kindergarteners by their founders including Danny “the Red” Cohen-Bendit, the CIA-promoted leader of the 1968 student riots in Paris. The pedophile campaign was carried forward until 2008 by Volker Berg’s partner Jacques Teyssier, a former member of the French intelligence service, who was on board of the Lesben und Schwulenverband in Deutschland (LSVD), the lesbian and gay association in Germany. The German gay movement is obviously a brainwashed arm of the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            The darker side of the pedophilic underground has since been carried on by a provocative novelist with the pen name Klaus Wanninger, the Anonymous of the Karlsruhe-based Schwaben-sumpf (the Schwabian Swamp). Sadistic and Satanic imagery was developed in parallel by this deviant strain, which obviously has had a huge influence on the artists and customers at Comet Ping Pong Pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            In early 2012, Alefantis and Miller teamed up to start a restaurant called Nalu or “wave” in Hawaiian. The partnership in the Berlin restaurant inspired Alefantis to sponsor a “sausage festival” at his Buck’s Fishing and Camping restaurant in Washington DC to honor a visit by Oliver Miller. There is no indication that Nalu or Dr. Pong has ever celebrated Octoberfest in Berlin by adding traditional bockwurst mit sauerkraut und senf (mustard) to their menus. - See more at:

            For example, Comet Pizza’s James Alefantis, who is of Greek ancestry, considers Pan to be his avatar.  The dancing horned god with goatee, a goat’s peter and hairy hind legs blows on the multiple tubes of his pan pipes. Alefantis’s fan devotion to this hedonist demonic figure extended to being a producer of the short film “Chapel Perilous”, in which the protagonist named Levi grows goat horns as a sign of his self-discovery. The film’s title is taken after the Round Table knight Percival’s encounter with the “black hand” of Satan in a mysterious chapel during his Grail quest, that being the moral specter of masturbation. - See more at:

            Alefantis lurks here. Message to you, Jimmy: You may get by with your demented actions unpunished in this lifetime, but you will pay dearly in the next. Better hope they find an immortality pill, because lifetimes are short and eternity in hell is long.

             I agree with what you said. I firmly believe that Good will defeat Evil in the end. This means that Evil people will be punished eventually. If not in this lifetime, then in the afterlife world.

            The Comet Pizza crowd has promoted “pansexuality”, which is defined in the LGBT online dictionary as “sometimes referred to as omnisexuality or being ‘gender blind’, pansexuality is inclusive of bisexuality (attraction to both males and females) but additionally includes attraction to other genders and sexes such as those identifying as transgender, genderqueer, bigender,  intersex and . . .” That List goes on into four-letter expletives with whom sexual intercourse is unthinkable and better done with the lights turned off and a condom held on with superglue.

            ' 'fake news' meme disseminating Washington Post, who, may I remind you, published the PropOrNot list, promoting anonymous and shoddy claims that a vast range of some 200 websites are all accomplices or tools of the Russian government. Marty Baron, executive editor of the Bezos-owned Washington Post, also appears to have a loyalty to the intelligence agencies:
           </p>
           <p>
            Heinz Baron and his wife immigrated in 1954 to Davis Island in Tampa, which hosted the airstrip for Coastal Patrol Base 13 of the Civil Air Patrol (since renamed the Peter O. Knight Airport). The backwater airfield was also a jumping-off point for gangsters and shills for Meyer Lanksky’s casinos in Havana. Here it should be noted that the Baron family in Ulanow, Poland, were innkeepers and bartenders aka mobsters. Located where he was, Israeli dual citizen Heinz Baron could not have avoided connections with the Lanksy organization and, later, the CIA plans to topple the Cuban revolution.

            Close to Tampa and Fort Meyers on the Gulf Coast, Useppa Island was the first CIA paramilitary training ground for anti-Castro Cuban exiles for the upcoming Bay of Pigs invasion. Another confluence of Cuban Jewry in the casino and spookdom is The Miami Herald, where Martin Baron received his apprenticeship. Here is a revealing quote from the History News Network:
           </p>
           <p>
            “The tale of the Miami Herald’s Bay of Pigs scoop and its subsequent capitulation to the CIA has mostly been shrouded in mystery for the past five decades. It was explored briefly in ‘Anything but the Truth’, a book by Washington reporters William McGaffin and Erwin Knoll that was published in 1968 and quickly disappeared.” Herald reporter David Kraslow, who had stumbled on Cuban exiles practicing marksmanship near Miami seven months before the invasion, was forced by CEO Lee Hills to have his article vetted by the State Department and CIA in October 1960. CIA director Allen Dulles killed the Herald story with a phone call to Miami.
           </p>
           <p>
            Martin Baron was apparently a good student of Miami Herald-style “capitulation to the CIA.” The newspaper’s close cooperation with the CIA has gone so far as to provide its espionage agents with cover as reporters, according to Agency officials interviewed by Carl Bernstein. The spy assignments are done with the knowledge of top editors, which later I discovered with the Miami Herald’s role in a CIA-funded terrorist operation planned against American students abroad. The agent-reporter had carried bundled cash from a U.S. embassy to an Islamic terror outfit in at two locations.

            Amazon.com can, too, be traced back to Las Vegas kingpin Lansky, an architect of the both Bay of Pigs and the JFK assassination, and his Cuban mafia of hidden Jews, which will be explored further on in the arrival of Cuban adolescent Miguel “Mike” Bezos under the auspices of the CIA and the Catholic Salesian Order, a legacy group of the Opus Dei surveillance arm of the hidden Jewish generalissimo Francisco Franco in the Spanish Civil War.

            There are other parallels between the Bay of Pigs and the Swamp of Swine known as Pizzzagate in the
running of safe-houses, secret passages, drug-smuggling, voodoo, child-rape, homosexuality, money-laundering and media complicity with CIA sponsorship of terrorism and false flag attacks against Americans. It has little to do with Cuba libre and instead everything about organized crime.

            Your propaganda piece will garner much empathy and concern from your 'loyal' customers and 'happy families' dining on your poisoned wares. I suppose you wouldn't care to explain to those families your choice of pagan god as an avatar, the notorious Pan that plays his magic flute and wisks the children away in droves to use as sacrificial offering. Or we could remind them, that they could, let their child attend a concert, late night, with JimmyC's choice of 'premiere' DC 'entertainment'.

             PropOrNot list was about as bad as journalism might get when in wrong hands. Every journalist familiar with the basic ethics would spit on that. First, reliability of an article is NOT based solely on reliability of a publisher so there can't be any kind of red flagged lists of publishers. Reliability of the writer plays much more important role, no matter to whom s/he writes to. Second, every good article is well sourced, including either names or links (or dropping the sources is well reasoned, like in case of protecting an anonymous source). Washington Post writers THEMSELVES does not follow this basic standard very often.
            </p>

             MSM is loosing public trust quickly because of their bias, propaganda and lack of journalistic ethics. They are endangered by alternative media, especially those doing their job following the ethics (unfortunately all too few of them). Putting up lists like PropOrNot are a desperate effort to fight back - while they could simply use their resources for better journalism, what the fight is about in the end.
