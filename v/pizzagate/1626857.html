            16 photos of a blonde boy as main person. Artist's name and address on back of photos. The 16 photos sold for over 5K. Is that normal to have the artist's address on back of photo unless maybe it's the address where you pick up the child you just purchased?

            The Art-related side of the CIA Kulture Kontrol Klub is under reported in my opinion, in part because Art is considered totally relative and subjective, so this person's secular heavy metal band is another person's satan worshipping devil group; this person's taste in paintings of chained children doesn't break any laws whereas it shows a demented mind to another person (most of us actually).  Just like the Marquis de Sade could write the most despicable disgusting torture scenarios, and it could be argued by good men of the Enlightenment that words in and of themselves are just ideas and break no laws and don't actually mean that those deed will ever come to pass.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ok I get it.  But the other side of the coin is the power of Art on the mind, and on culture.   The CIA gets it, and that is why one of the CIA's main activities is to influence culture.  If you have never read this article, please read it in full now

            MODERN ART WAS A CIA WEAPON.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes there were some stirrings of it already occuring, yes it might have been a quick movement on its own naturally, but modern art was actively promoted and instilled into the culture both pop and academia by a serious CIA effort to do so.  And in doing so they endeavored to place a CIA friendly reporter at every newsdesk in America in every town.   And they did it.  And that was back when the CIA was arguably "nicer."
           </p>
           <p>
            So what do you think the LSD dosed (see the book Acid Dreams if you don't know about that factor) CIA is doing these days regarding Kulture Kontrol?  It is exactly this weird gore scene with demonic, pedo overtones that suddenly seems everywhere that passes for art these days, done largely by untrained and feeble minded (hate to generalize, so that's what it seems like) so called artists who are more interested in fake shock value no value productions than doing anything that will be considered interesting in 100 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            tl:dr -  Art is a strong influencer of culture (including having a possible demoralizing effect if that is what is intended), and is considered above criticism in most arenas.  this can be a dangerous combination.  The only thing worse is censorship, however i don't think public spaces should have depidtions of murder and gore like this as art

              Yes - have to start somewhere - I see you're new too.  Nice to meet you.   Browsed Voat for ages, but posted on Reddit - decided to switch over bc Voat seems a little more "focused."   Your thread was the push I needed.  Thanks.

            Good stuff, OP!
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I have seen the absolute fucking worst of the modern artists are the Chapman brothers.  Here is a write-up by James Pinkerton about their art in the "Sensation" exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.  They also have their works shown off by Victor Pinchuk.

             NSFL example of artwork
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             But the real outrage is the work of Jake and Dinos Chapman. Their artistic oeuvre is naked girls. They have taken department-store mannequins of little girls, festooned them with penises, and then added vaginas and anuses--the kind you might expect to see on a blow-up sex doll--in random places over their faces and bodies. The wall cards attempt to explain all this away with folderol about the perils of genetic engineering, but these two artists were surely creepy before they ever heard of DNA.
Indeed, the sci-fi stuff is just a cover for pandering to pedophiles, as the museum well knows. The caption for "Tragic Anatomies" asks the following: "What would the world be like if we were freed of all sexual inhibition? Do we falsely deny the existence of sexuality in children?"
Why haven't the media reported on that? Is it because they've been focused on the feces? Maybe, but I think there's another reason. The critics and commentators don't want the real raw truth about this exhibit to get out, because they know that even they can't publicly defend Hustler-type photos or kiddie porn. Moreover, now that Giuliani's likely opponent in next year's U.S. Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has declared herself against his effort to yank the museum's funding, pressies don't want to undercut her by describing precisely what she wants to keep paying for. So they discuss the dung briefly and then move on to safer discussions of the 1st Amendment.

             Tanngrisnir, I think this might deserve it's own thread. I think the fact that Hillary wanted to keep the funding to a child-porn "art" exhibit while running for senate is just one more piece of circumstantial evidence that she was involved in some of terrible things.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another thought: WHILE SHE WAS RUNNING FOR SENATE! How confident do you have to be in the election "process" to think that the voters won't hold you accountable for this!

              I appreciate the enthusiasm.  I will refrain from doing that because I already posted most of my findings

              and don't want to be seen as excessively recycling posts.  Also Armyseer's alt accounts keep spamming the shit out of the place about me and I'm sure that will only get worse if I don't keep my head down for a bit.

               Sensation
              </a>
              The "Sensation" exhibit was a very Pizzagatey affair.  It had pizzagate player Damien Hirst artwork and also featured a giant portrait of child killer Myra Hindley made from miniature children's handprints.  I wish I was making this stuff up.  Also it featured the disgusting Chapman Bros which are absolute human filth who called a kid being murdered a public service and also like to sexualize them every chance they get.

             "falsely deny the existence of sexuality in children"???  WTF?  humans are all 'sexual' beings, that is one component.  but kids under 18 do not need sex pushed in their faces 24/7.  they need, more than anything, mature boundaries that bring joy into their life over time.   there is no giving of consent for the youth.  it is taken from them, and they are raped.  this is becoming a HUGE RAPE CULTURE.  with websites dedicated to rape fantasies and videos of rape.  I can hardly stand it anymore.

             reading through the last part of that post to, I have to add as a response to those "questions" by the museum who thinks they are so edgy and provocative - Uh, we can have an honest talk about the natural human sexual impulses that children experience as they grow up without putting anuses and penises all over their effigies - that is not an honest talk, that is you idea of clickbait pulling in of an audience for your shock show reducing the stages of human sexuality to a circus sideshow and a great disservice to children, parents and society.

                Haha, indeed they are. The TX Hill Country is fantastic. (Just don't blame us that LBJ heralds from there.) I had a 30 minute one on one w/ Willie once, long time ago. Was trying to sell some really bad songs :) But he was nice about it.

              Germany was where Skull and Bones were imported from, Skull and Bones huge in creating CIA, Germany also has the migrant hordes with easily attainable, vulnerable children, and has a CPP location, and a few other links to american pedo activity.

               I've been thinking about this relationship too, the satanic thing keeps coming back up, the backwards, upside down, inside out, dark light, Ying yang thing. The left accusing the right of being Nazis, that came out nowhere and makes absolutely no sense, it seems like projecting really. The left has attached themselves to Germany as a sort of sister country in the advancement of globalism, the connection to Soros and his connection to Nazis in his youth. The Left and right seem more and more to be the Ying Yang, the balance of light and dark, good and evil, the calling evil things good and good things evil, the battling of the Angels, the clash between technological advancement being used for good vs evil, and the increased attempt to control information while information is simultaneously increasing in volume. I was pretty happy zoning out on american pickers and not knowing about all this a year ago. Now we're hearing new things everyday about Naziesque experimentations in life longevity, eugenics, pop control, shadow govs, etc...

                If you mean politically,  don't be fooled - the right is in on it,  too. Two sides of the same coin.  That's why they both hate trump.
