<p>James McHaney was Maria Cantwell\'s employee who one day got an invitation to go over to his friend\'s house and rape a boy. He brought 600 child porn images along with him and videos of babies being sodomized. </p>
<p>It was a sting and he was busted. His friend, who he had traded child porn with in the past and likely engaged in child rape with in the past, had to play the part to bust McHaney to get a lighter sentence for some unknown bust. I don\'t know who that guy is but I know where he lived at the time all this was going on. The Ellington Apartments in DC.</p>
<p>So now McHaney does what the unknown guy did to him and offers up a bigger fish for a reduced sentence. That is how they got Barbara Boxer staffer Jeff Rosato. Rosato apparently was the ring leader because he had no one to turn on and he got the big jail sentence and is listed in the sex offender registry. Barbara Boxer had the good sense to retire after this shame. Cantwell is still in office for some reason.</p>
<p>So we have to figure out who was the person who set up McHaney for reduced sentence. I think it\'s probably another west coast female congressperson\'s staffer. Feinstein or Pelosi would be my guess. Although it could be someone not affiliated with west coast female Democrat congress people because it looks like McHaney also turned in a DC cop named Kenneth Longerbeam. </p>

             Details are trickling out about Michael McHaney, no thanks to the Old Media. McHaney is an openly gay man and was an executive scheduler for the nation’s largest gay advocacy group, the Human Rights Campaign, from September 2005 to May 2006. It is not known the circumstances under which McHaney left the organization’s employ. McHaney also worked for the presidential campaigns of Democrats Dick Gephardt and John Kerry in 2004.

             I think he was in California and not the mystery witness but probably a contributor in the network. I remember that guy very well from his tv appearances. The three liberals I despised the most back then were Weiner, Ward and Moore. Two down...

              Just to add, you were more than right to hate this pos. He's a jesuit schooled theologian and worked as a sex-ed teacher at a Georgetown prep school (can't make this shit up) where over half of the faculty was homosexual including known pedo Garrett Orr.

              Yes he was SF-based but as I understand the docs Ellington appartments were merely a meeting point for the sting, not a home address. Also it was a federal case and Ward could be expected to have a Boxer's aide's trust.

               It looked to me like it was witness residence and they were to meet in the lobby.  McHaney asked if it was at his residence so it sounds like he knew where the guy lived. They probably would have arranged the bust at a hotel if they were trying to be sneaky.

                But yeah if McHaney asked to meet at his residence I'm probably wrong, or Ward had a DC appartment as well. Ellington does look quite large.

                 I just know that McHaney asked CW if he was at home and it wouldn't seem to flow in sequence if it turned out to be somewhere else unless they specified after that entry "no, we'll meet at x".  But it could have been somewhere else and just a sloppy line in the complaint. That was from the pdf that said complaint.

                  As I read it Mike asked the CW whether the boy was at his residence, after which they agreed to meet at specified location.

                  Not trying to persist in an error here, but it doesn't say that the residence and the predetermined location are one and the same. In fact the phrasing suggest they weren't.

                   I took "specified place" to mean the lobby of the apartment building that was CW residence. It would seem pointless to add the part about McHaney asking CW if he was at his residence when they could have just left that out and just said they agreed to meet at a specified location. That's the only clue I have about CW's identity so I'm not gonna let it go too easy.

                     Avoid security? I dunno. Seems like somewhere congressional staffers might live rather than rent a room. Would they risk spooking McHaney by bringing an unfamiliar residence of someone else into the picture?

                      According to this account you are right, they met in the lobby of CW's residence:

                     <p>
                      Still find it hard to let go of the Ward angle due to similar timelines, Boxer AND Podesta links, sexual prefences and the use of AOL accounts (lilmikierocks and vincentlio).
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Tried  and failed to establish a Bernard Vincent Ward (1951) property in DC, so you're probably right and Ward's a dead end.

                     <p>
                      I do believe there's more to Ward's plea deal, possibly as a CW, due to his lenient sentence especially in light of the sadism of his CP collection and further abuses coming to light afterwards, as well as the long period between arrest and plea, almost three years

                       That was the official final version, that they met at CW residence. It is in pdf 11. PDF 1, the complaint, left that part out.

                       That's interesting because Mr. Gallagher seems to have copied and pasted from the original document way back in 2008 and it looks like they removed that part later, probably because they realized they were exposing a big clue as to CW's identity. If one could get a tenants list for the time, it might be easy to figure out his identity.

                       I did a little more digging on Ward and was surprised to learn that the FBI raid on his houset was way back in 2005. It took them two years to indict. Maybe the media didn't report the raid but he told his friend about it

                        The plea deal I linked is from 2008 yet dates his arrest, i.e. the 'sexfairy2005' police call to December 2004.

                        Edit: just read your link about his 'friend turning him in and that story surely contradicts the one in the plea deal (i.e. the official story)

                         No it's the final version. PDF 11 at the first link I provided. We were looking at the preliminary complaint version. They cleaned it up and so it was definitely CW residence.

                         I don't know why the headline said the friend turned him in. The article doesn't say that. Maybe they were trying to put some misinformation in the heads of the people in the area so that Ward's "research for a book" excuse would sound more believable. I dunno.

             Not that many news articles about it online though.  One in the Washington Post and the San Francisco Chronicle but really nothing other than that.

            On the left there is a doc you can view, and on page 2 has the name Scott Schelble listed as the complainant.  And according to an award ceremony in 2011 he is the Relief Supervisor for the National Capital Response Squad of the FBI.

            Maybe you can cross reference some of his public cases from that year, or maybe a little before. I also thought it was, as always a "coincidence" that Clinton's campaign office was taking all the spot light the same day the story was scheduled to be released by little to no media outlets.

             That was the FBI agent supervising the sting. He would definitely know who our mystery creep is.  If FBI-anon is legit he should be able to drop the name in this thread. That's kind of why I went this route.

              Dude. your information is from a case 9 years ago. You write your post as if this is currently unfolding. You claim that Boxer "resigned in shame" when she never resigned at all.... She didn't run for re-election in 2016. 8 years after you claim she resigned.
             </p>
             <p>
              Resigning is not equivalent to Not running for re-election.
             </p>
             <p>
              You insinuate that Jeff was the ring leader, which is insane. And you claim that these two senators were in charge of the largest child porn ring, Which is equally insane.
             </p>
             <p>
              This was one isolated case, from 9 years ago. Involving no body of importance to pizzaggate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not to mention you claim that things would have been fine were it not for the obama administration.
             </p>
             <p>
              If this is the information you think solved pizzagate, you have very little understanding of pizzagate entails.  But again, almost every thing you've said was wrong in some way.
             </p>
             <p>
              Like I Said below, Maybe I'm the one who is missing something... Can you explain what you meant by "She resigned in shame" when she never resigned at all, Not to mention she was in office for 8 years after this bust.

              A while ago, someone came up with the theory that Amanda Kleinman was a clone as she had no father on her family tree.  I am sure this sounds a little far fetched for some of our most seasoned researchers but I decided to give this genius/insane person the benefit of the doubt and pursue their line of inquiry.
             </p>
             <p>
              What I found is remarkable.

              The coloboma of the eye is indicative of PAX6 congenital mutation/anomaly.  As well as this, Pax6 is responsible for the formation of the pineal gland and olfactory system of the brain, which hosts the olfactory bulb, which produces stem cells in adults, neurogenesis.
             </p>
             <p>
              Has anyone noticed how often Amanda wears sunglasses?  Could this be something to do with an anomaly in her eye, she wishes to cover, much like Jacob Rothschild?

            Why was David Miliband in Portugal on the morning of 8 September 2007? I remember wasn't it on some home video of the McCanns?
           </p>
           <p>
            "In late September Foreign Secretary David Miliband telephoned Gerry. "
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactions_to_the_disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            As Ed Milliband was classed as Gordon Browns pet project and David was Blairs it could explain a lot, like the missing link between SOROS and the family.
            <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/04/article-2487217-1930674500000578-886_634x441.jpgJPG">
             http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/04/article-2487217-1930674500000578-886_634x441.jpgJPG
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm certain it was part of the video released at Christmas showing Madeleine opening her presents, the one where she is dressed in pink, Some one posted a still from the video on a forum and it looked like Milliband sitting on the couch
"remind myself that David Milliband did get a bit involved in the introducing of McCanns to the EU parliament for the promotion of the Amber Alert thing."
           </p>
           <p>
            So I recently asked the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Freedom of Information Section:
           </p>
           <p>
            Please supply the following information during the period 1 August to 20 September 2007, together with:
           </p>
           <p>
            a) Actual Dates
           </p>
           <p>
            b) Names of countries and cities/towns visited
           </p>
           <p>
            c) Express purpose of the visit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have received this reply, dated today (2 July):
           </p>
           <p>
            I confirm that the FCO does hold information relevant to your request and the details are as listed below:
           </p>
           <p>
            10 August, visiting Florence, Italy: purpose: ‘Bilateral visit’
           </p>
           <p>
            4-7 September, visiting Bucharest, Romania – Istanbul, Turkey – Rome, Italy – Madrid, Spain: purpose: ‘Bilateral visits’
           </p>
           <p>
            7-8 September, visiting Viana do Castelo, Portugal: purpose: ‘GYMNICH (informal gathering of EU Foreign Ministers)’.
           </p>
           <p>
            So it seems he was in Portugal talking to the press on the morning of 8 September just by the fortuitous chance of being at an informal meeting in Portugal of some other EU Foreign Ministers.

             It's late and I am kind of dense. You are talking about months after Madelaine Mccann's disappearance right (She disappeared on May 3, 2007) and you are talking about August-September 2007. So are you saying that one of the Millibands was at the Mccann's house on Christmas 2006? Which Milliband and what is the significance?

              The photographer is Paul Grover who I think denied taking them, however his "name" is stamped on the front of the photo particularly the "skirting board " one. He has a website and has worked for the Daily Telegraph I think ? Or was it the mail, I forget but information can be sourced.

                The coloboma of the eye is indicative of PAX6 congenital mutation/anomaly.  As well as this, Pax6 is responsible for the formation of the pineal gland and olfactory system of the brain, which hosts the olfactory bulb, which produces stem cells in adults, neurogenesis.

            be that he had no one to turn on .  This is just a hypothetical, but what if that someone he could turn on was Boxer or Cantwell themselves?  Maybe he could turn on them, but the powers that be were protecting them, and he was just small enough of a fish that the buck stopped with him? Honestly, I'd be more interested in researching the two Senators.

             A while ago, someone came up with the theory that Amanda Kleinman was a clone as she had no father on her family tree.  I am sure this sounds a little far fetched for some of our most seasoned researchers but I decided to give this genius/insane person the benefit of the doubt and pursue their line of inquiry.

             What I found is remarkable.

             The coloboma of the eye is indicative of PAX6 congenital mutation/anomaly.  As well as this, Pax6 is responsible for the formation of the pineal gland and olfactory system of the brain, which hosts the olfactory bulb, which produces stem cells in adults, neurogenesis.
            </p>
            <p>
             Has anyone noticed how often Amanda wears sunglasses?  Could this be something to do with an anomaly in her eye, she wishes to cover, much like Jacob Rothschild?

             Sounds like some kind of top secret cloning program aliens, I mean humans are spilling the beans on.

              Is it possible I wonder if coloboma can take place after trauma in the womb. Mk ultra can start in the womb according to this manual.

             Some things are worse than a prison sentence. Not many things, but one of them might have been held over his head.

              Pizzagate made clear how there are definitely things worse than a prison sentence. And it seems they are made use of in abundance.

            Replying to post The_Kuru below, not sure why it's 3 above it, but I have read that Google has been "rigged" to ignore or misdirect certain searches.  I would suggest trying Webcrawler.com or Duckduckgo.com and see if you get bettter results.

            The Fox guy could have been a receiver of the same batch of porn but I don't see evidence that he was distributor like the Cantwell and Boxer headquarters. I'll try to find a docket on him.

             I did a google news archive search around that time and couldn't find what I was hoping to find. There was a Fox guy who was busted but it wasn't in the time frame I needed. His was after the McHaney bust.
