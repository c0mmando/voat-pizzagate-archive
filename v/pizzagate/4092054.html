<p>In previous year of 2019 there was article how three unapproved surveillance cameras were found in Potsdam\'s school, including toilet.</p>
<p>Here is link for the article: <a href="https://www.pnn.de/potsdam/voltaire-gesamtschule-kameras-auf-der-schultoilette/24582930.html">https://www.pnn.de/potsdam/voltaire-gesamtschule-kameras-auf-der-schultoilette/24582930.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Cameras in the school toilet</strong></p>
<p>Several unauthorized cameras were discovered in several places at the Voltaire School in Potsdam. The city of Potsdam has filed a complaint.</p>
<p>Potsdam - At the entrance, on the ground floor and in the boys\' toilet: three unauthorized surveillance cameras have been discovered at the Voltaire Comprehensive School in Potsdam. The city announced that now. The cameras had been discovered by employees of the municipal real estate service (Kis) and employees of the city\'s school IT - during routine work during the holidays. They were found at two different times - once on June 27th and around two weeks ago on July 3rd. The city announced that the surveillance technology was removed immediately. The cameras were located at the entrance to the school, facing Lindenstrasse and Schopenhauerstrasse, and there was a camera in the boys\' toilet on the ground floor, looking along the long wall into the room.</p>
<p><strong>Who installed the cameras?</strong></p>
<p>The municipal real estate service has now filed a complaint with the police. The officers are investigating suspected violations of the very personal sphere of life by taking pictures according to § 201a StGB. According to information from the Potsdam public prosecutor\'s office, <strong>there is expressly no evidence that a sexual motive is behind the installation of the cameras</strong>. According to PNN information, an employee of the school installed the cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Awareness is raised at other schools</strong></p>
<p>Whether and how recordings have been saved or processed and whether personal rights have been violated is currently the subject of the investigation. &quot;The state capital Potsdam takes this incident very seriously. The protection of personal rights as well as the data of the students has top priority for us,&quot; says the councilor for education, culture, youth and sport, Noosha Aubel Education, youth and sport of the state of Brandenburg, the state commissioner for data protection and the Potsdam data protection commissioner have been informed of the incident by the state capital. The parents of all pupils have also been informed. Also at other schools in Potsdam sensitize the city for such incidents, it said on request from the town hall.</p>
<p>After further searches, no further cameras were discovered in the Voltaire school.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They say no sexual motive was found behind installation of the cameras.</p>
<p>This year new article about Potsdam case surfaced about suspension of director of the Voltaire school: <a href="https://www.pnn.de/potsdam/ermittlungsverfahren-wegen-kameras-potsdamer-voltaireschule-ohne-schulleiterin-/26072676.html">https://www.pnn.de/potsdam/ermittlungsverfahren-wegen-kameras-potsdamer-voltaireschule-ohne-schulleiterin-/26072676.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Voltaire School in Potsdam without a headmistress</strong></p>
<p>The director of the Voltaire School in Potsdam was apparently suspended. The cause could be an investigation.</p>
<p>The head of the Voltaire school has apparently been suspended from the school office immediately before the start of the new school year. In a letter that the PNN has, the education authority informed the   parents that the deputy director will take over the management for the time being. The &quot;Märkische Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; reported about it first. The change could possibly be related to an incident last year that has not yet been fully resolved.  
</p>
<p>In the summer of 2019, construction workers from the municipal real estate service (KIS) discovered hidden surveillance cameras in the school during routine work. <strong>These cameras could not be recognized as such from the outside. There was also no evidence of video surveillance by signs or notices, as is actually the rule. Particularly irritating: One of the cameras was in the school toilet for the boys.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The proceedings have not yet been finally closed</strong></p>
<p>Apparently the caretaker wanted to take action against vandalism with the illegal cameras. After that was exposed, he was released from duty. The public prosecutor\'s office was investigating the caretaker - and also the rector.</p>
<p>In response to a request from PNN, the public prosecutor\'s office announced that the investigation against both of them had been &quot;temporarily&quot; suspended on August 5th for &quot;minor guilt.&quot; The accused now had to pay an amount of money that they had agreed to only after the money had been transferred, a spokeswoman said. </p>
<p>Such discontinuation of proceedings according to Section 153a of the Code of Criminal Procedure serve primarily to relieve the judiciary in the event of comparatively minor offenses. This avoids litigation. The setting is subject to conditions, as here against a cash payment. With their fulfillment, the “public interest in criminal prosecution” should be eliminated, according to the logic of the law. </p>
<p>Education authorities and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MBJS) confirmed on Friday that there was an ongoing process in response to a PNN request. The headmistress concerned did not want to give &quot;no information&quot; about this procedure on PNN request.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Secret cameras don\'t work at all.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&quot;We hope that the matter will be cleared up quickly,&quot; says Markus Kobler, spokesman for the Potsdam District Parents\' Council. Kobler emphasizes that he does not know whether the suspected suspension has anything to do with the camera incident or whether it will be lifted again. But basically he says: &quot;Secret cameras don\'t work at all.&quot; It could happen that video surveillance is necessary, for example due to repeated cases of vandalism. But even then, they should only be installed in accordance with regulations and with the consent of the parents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This could be something, or nothing, the weirdest thing is that cameras were installed in boys toilet. And then good cautious anon found that one of the persons shilling in this case [ who would shill in such suspicious case? ] was none other than friend of Oliver Miller who was partner of James Alefantis in his Berlin business Nalu Diner. But first let\'s focus on that friend of Oliver Miller, she is named Katja Dietrich-Kröck and here is her post on this case:</p>

<p>As she writes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>We all don\'t know what this is really about. The article is purely speculative and suggests that the camera storyte doesn\'t necessarily have to be the occasion. Perhaps the school office just wants to get rid of a supposedly &quot;uncomfortable&quot; headmistress. Who knows that exactly ...</p>

<p>Another post sowing doubt from her could be found here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/www.potsdamfinder.de/permalink/10158994390406414">https://www.facebook.com/groups/www.potsdamfinder.de/permalink/10158994390406414</a></p>
<p>Saying that investigation into camera thing is complete [ do not look deeper? ] </p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/771519541850669096/unknown.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/716477412505944167/771519541850669096/unknown.png</a></p>
<p>Saying: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The article contains pure speculation and the investigations of the public prosecutoraft to the camera storyte are basically complete. So, to all of you who think they know more here and support this with appropriately meaningless comments: first wait and see what it\'s really about</p>

<p>We know they\'re connected very much:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alefantis</strong> doesn\'t have a replacement for Reh in mind, but he’s busy with plans to celebrate Buck’s 10th anniversary in October, starting with a new front patio, open as of last night. The 45-seat expansion is where he plans to stage a “sausagefest” in June with the help of <strong>his business partner, chef Oliver Miller in Berlin — as in Germany, where the two men co-own (who knew?) Nalu</strong>, an American diner with Hawaiian accents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oliver was also owner of Dr. Pong, Pizzagate famous ping pong place that was researched heavily back in time:</p>

            We all don't know what this is really about. The article is purely speculative and suggests that the camera storyte doesn't necessarily have to be the occasion. Perhaps the school office just wants to get rid of a supposedly "uncomfortable" headmistress. Who knows that exactly ...

           There's definitely some reason to look into Katja Dietrich-Kröck, she could be completely innocent and connection isn't strong but definitely worth looking into.
