 In researching members on a 2008 roster of the ROJ (Royal  Order of Jesters) given in  an earlier post, I came across a guy in Phoenix  whose email address showed a connection to a company called ‘speedchoice’.  Having never heard of speedchoice, I started  researching it. There was very little information about the company. .  I could find no website for it.  I am not even sure if it is still active. But I did find was this write-up which shows it to be, what I believe is, a private internet company, based in Connecticutt (although one  link below shows it based in Delaware) and serving mostly western states.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.vxm.com/speedchoiceProfile.html">http://www.vxm.com/speedchoiceProfile.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article mentions that Sprint was looking to buy speedchase, which it did. As you may know, 80% of Sprint is owned by the Japanese Company, SoftBank.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In this link,  you can see speedchase listed on a Sprint document.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Here I found a link which shows the File number for speedchase and that the company’s filing status “is listed as Not in Good Standing”.  This is where it shows its Filing State as Arizona, its Domestic State as Delaware, and the filing date of July 12, 1993.  It gives an address for the Registered Agent as 2338 W Royal Palm Rd. Ste-J, Phoenix, AZ, and address of Principal as the Sprint Headquarters in Kansas with a report date of 2010.  It also gives Sprint contact names.</p>

<p>Before getting to the suspicious address of  2338 W Royal Palm Rd. Ste-J, Phoenix, I want to show the other bit of information I found for speedchase.</p>
<p>First is a speedchase, LLC in New Hampshire  with an address of  38 MILL RD HAMPTON, NH 03842. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dandb.com/businessdirectory/speedchoicellc-hampton-nh-8195901.html">https://www.dandb.com/businessdirectory/speedchoicellc-hampton-nh-8195901.html</a></p>

<p>Here is the map link for the mult-family home which shows a preschool and library nearby</p>
<blockquote>

<p>And now to the speedchoice in Phoenix at the address of 2338 W Royal Palm Rd, suite J</p>
<p>This map shows all businesses at as 2338 W Royal Palm Rd (the Sprint/speedchase showed it at suite J)</p>

<p>If you scroll to the right, on the left side, you will see that there are 11 business at that location, several in Suite J. </p>

<p>Actually, this link shows there have been 250 businesses at that site of suite J</p>

<p>Now, looking at Elite Community Services LLC which has 24 employees and annual revenue of $7.7M</p>
<blockquote>

<p>They have several offices in Arizona and Nevada. Their corporate office is at 3651 E. Baseline Rd, Suite E-222, Gilbert, AZ 85234
They appear to be a catchall service, founded in 2008, with 24 employees,  providing tutoring, housecleaning,   with an annual revenue of $7.7 M, and classified as an Industries Social Change Association.   Contact for the company is listed as Deanna L Lepper.</p>

<p>Looked at the contact person Deanna Lepper  who is also the registered for ACE Sober Living <a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/people/arizona/gilbert/deanna-lepper.html">https://www.bizapedia.com/people/arizona/gilbert/deanna-lepper.html</a></p>

<p>This is the listing for leasing the property 2338 W Royal Palm Rd</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>And if you notice on the map, there are 2 hotels very close, one of which is a Motel 6, which was just recently had to settle a suit for being complicit in human trafficking <a href="http://ktar.com/story/1712409/apnewsbreak-motel-6-to-pay-to-settle-human-trafficking-suit/">http://ktar.com/story/1712409/apnewsbreak-motel-6-to-pay-to-settle-human-trafficking-suit/</a></p>
<p>So what started out as a search into a private internet service, speedchoice, which I thought could possibly be used by the ROJs for communications, took me to this  location in Phoenix which appears to be the home of a lot of fly-by-night businesses, such as a limonsine nail and hair service, cash flights, document preparation, car painting, specialty custom-tailored services, specialty realty company, most of which have no website, and are located near a Motel 6.</p>',

           And if you notice on the map, there are 2 hotels very close, one of which is a Motel 6, which was just recently had to settle a suit for being complicit in human trafficking

           So what started out as a search into a private internet service, speedchoice, which I thought could possibly be used by the ROJs for communications, took me to this  location in Phoenix which appears to be the home of a lot of fly-by-night businesses, such as a limonsine nail and hair service, cash flights, document preparation, car painting, specialty custom-tailored services, specialty realty company, most of which have no website, and are located near a Motel 6.

            Is speed"chase" and speed"choice" the same company?
           </p>
           <p>
            When I was researching the directors of the Hampstead ordeal that had the mailbox at 88-90, some were affiliated with companies that claimed to make a lot of money but no websites or if there were websites, very limited info on what exactly they do.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you own a company, don't you think you'd have a decent website to attract more business? Especially if the biz is successful? These are shell companies I believe doing either CP videos or something along those lines. Great research.

             Thanks you so much.  I didn't realize speedchase was even there. I messed up.  It is suppose to be speedchoice all the way. I will correct it.     I think they are shell companies too.  I am hoping somebody living near there can take a look at the business.
