<p>&quot;By far the most expensive painting ever sold is Cezanne\'s Card Players.
That sold for something between 250 to 300 million in 2011, which is about double the previous
record. Curiously, we don\'t even know the price. It doesn\'t really matter, because the price is not the
clue. The reported buyer and seller is, along with the date. It sold to the royal family of Qatar, the Al
Thanis. Why is that a clue? Well, just search on “Qatar, 2011,” and you get the answer. Qatar was
involved in the Libyan war of 2011, supporting the Libyan rebels who toppled Gaddafi. Since that war
was engineered by the US, this means that Qatar was our ally. They did a job for us. How did we pay
them? That\'s right&quot;</p>',

            Theres only one muslim country with any independent power, and that of course is iran and i guess pakistan. Thus qatar, created by England, is probably a dead end.

But it seems Qatar is now pivoting to Russia / Iran, because they don't want to give in to the Saudis

              I still say "in the cards" might have to do with (SEIU) "union cards" and vote rigging, intimidation, and contract killing.

                That's the whole point of the "union cards" = voter fraud.  I'm not sure how this work, but it is pretty likely that the Unions can operate their own polling stations.  If they control those, especially through SEIU, they could guarantee a lock on many elections in critical locations.
               </p>
               <p>
                Why do you think Seth Rich is was killed.  To expose voter fraud is to unravel everything.  Pizzagate will just come along for the ride.

            I believe this is the answer to the "cards." They fund ISIS and Pedogate via inflated art prices via Qatar.

            Remember when Hillary approved the invasion of Libya and the killing of Gaddaffi?  Well,  Gaddaffi's son was just released from prison.  I am guessing he might have a message for Hillary.

             I think this might deserve a little more research. I am wondering if there really is some deeper underlying reason. As you say, take HRC down.  Maybe someone is pissed she didn't win the WH so they want a refund. I am sure HRC told them it was already spent on Chelsea's wedding 👰🏽 so no refund, in other words, pound sand.

            <p>
             Before Hillary, it was George H.W. Bush who meddled with Libya and what is most amazing is that Gaddaffi is a CIA plant. A bit like Bin Laden who worked for Bush Sr's CIA and was widely liked. The Middle East is a nest of Western obstructionism and genocide and it is unreasonable to think that the children will ever forget about what the West did to them (in collusion with Israel and Saudi Arabia of course).

              I believe Bin Laden was not killed.  I can't believe the Saudis would allow us to harm a hair on one of their own.  He is probably living a life of peace and quiet somewhere or they gave him a new face to do some more of their dirty work.  It was all staged.  The bunch of them with those horrified faces watching the murders in Pakistan.  What liars.

                The other "Bin Laden" guys they put on Rita Katz videos were not the same as the original, whose family is also quite well known and very "western". They are originally from Yemen, not Saudia.

                Are you certain of this, because now Snowden claims to have proof he is living in the Bahamas.

                Thank you so much for the link and the bit of news.  I started doubting it a little while after the big lie.  I can still see them i that room with their horrified faces.  Just now I thought about how wonderful it would be to see those faces again.  Horrified.  When they are sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in jail.  Just today I heard Joe Biden say he thinks Mitt Romney should run for Pres.  So we now know who our next 2 candidates for President will be. It hit me like a ton of bricks.  Another arranged election.
