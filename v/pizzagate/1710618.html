            If you don't want people to suspect child trafficking, I recommend not making 'jokes' about child trafficking, murder and pedophilia a focus of your Instagram account like Alefantis did.  But that's just me.  Maybe there is a whole subculture of people who joke about child trafficking and murder all the time, though I have never met a single one in my entire life.

            By the way, your obsession with fighting 'nothing' is more than a bit suspicious.

            Hint: If they use the word 'nonsensical' they are throwing out a mirror. It is saying they are in the guilty one.
Hint: If they call names, ex: 'conspiritard', they are afraid of their own crimes being discovered.

            What?! What do you mean? Does that fact that the crime of a baby being raped and killed is a reality and it happened somewhere out there in the world, basis for accusing you of raping and killing babies? Does the fact that those type of things happen somehow ads legitimacy to my allegations?! And am I justified in building an insane conspiracy theory about you based on that? Logic doesn't work that way.

              "failing at thinking critically".

             <p>
              All I've seen you do is repeat the same line and insult people. How is an Ad Hominum argument thinking critically?
             </p>
             <p>
              Could you tell us what your definition of pizzagate is? Maybe one of us "conspiritards"  could explain the logic behind why we believe  in this conspiracy.

            Pay no attention to this fool.   He has made numerous VOAT accounts to criticize and mock Pedogate and this is his LATEST account that he created all of 2 hours ago.    I wonder how much money he is being paid to be on here all day spreading lies?

              Was wondering, do you know why Alefantis says he hates kids? Does he really? What does he mean? You know, when he talked to Ryan. Unless that didn't happen?

              Probably because the cops are involved. Everyone in positions of power are involved for the most part. Keep living in your fantasy land where you've "got the world all figured out." Idiot. You probably think the Freemasons are just a bunch of old guys playing cards, too.
