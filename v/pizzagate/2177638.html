<p>Assuming all along here the the BODY was DUMPED, once people follow this body it leads to all kinds of CLINTON/BUSH/OBAMA shit going back to Reagan White House years. Ok, that 30+ years ago, but remember Stephen Paddock was just a young buck then.</p>
<p>More &amp; more it appears that RUSSIA is involved in most of this research coming forward, we don\'t know WHO dropped the body, or who shot up the streets of VEGAS, may have been NO shooting from the windows, accept the last round, but certainly there were shooting teams coordinated-diversions all over Vegas.</p>
<p>Whether they be MOSSAD or GHANA is unclear, ...</p>
<p>Some clear shit.</p>
<p>1.) That charger left in Paddocks room, was a hitech CIA-Mossad charger only used by seal-teams for wet ops, ... super special stuff, custom made.</p>
<p>2.) Somebody killed lots of TRUMP people to send a message to TRUMP.</p>
<p>3.) The entire top 4 floors of MGM-Mandalay are SAUDI owned, and managed by Four-Seasons, but they are actually used as a SAUDI/ISRAELI Embassy. So now we know how all the guns and shit and shooter dissapeared.</p>
<p>4.) Murren who is current MGM CEO told all 77,000 employees to vote for Hillary Clinton, thus using his property as home-base put\'s him in a world of hurt.</p>
<p>5.) All along since this story broke, it was clear that PADDOCK was a child-sex-slavery runner, his Girlfriend ( paid whore ) is a mama-san, she procures children from Philipines and spends most of her time flying between dubai, singapore, and macau to deliver chidlren to hotels for sex, including las vegas. Her job is go to back to PI to small villages, and recruit kids essentially BUY them from their familys, or promise that the child will meet a rich man, ... Obviously PADDOCK was always a PEDOPHILE and keeping the middle-age PI women near him was a cover, and she was ALWAYS keep children in her company that were accessible to him.  People who knew them in Austrailia, all said that he MADE it CLEAR she was a PAID WHORE, and not his wife or Girlfriend.</p>

            This involves Iran Contra Mena Ar, and so much more.  I think Paddock was the Barry Seals of today.  He may have been transporting children, but also guns and drugs.  A Holy Mess.

            This is a CIA/JTTF operation. Mossad and Saudi Arabia are sisters. The CIA manages both. JTTF is the FBI infiltrated by CIA operatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            This happened after 9/11 on purpose....
           </p>
           <p>
            Floors 35-39 owned by Israeli Tycoon called four seasons, Top Five floors owned by Saudi King Waleed.

            Paddock is an arms dealer. The UAE and Pakistani ISI infiltrated the Democratic Party through Imran Awan &amp; Otaibe...young girls &amp; boys were being drug raped in Washington DC &amp; flown to Las Vegas....this was exposed three weeks ago.The victims that were talking had to be taken out.
           </p>
           <p>
            The UAE embassy was burned to the ground in February to destroy evidence. This was also a planned operation to kill witnesses, dump bodies, scream terrorism, gun control for Rich elites to cover their crimes and make money by terrorizing citizens who are unaware.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI has been fully infiltrated. The majority of Congress and Senate are blackmailed pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            The large scale plan is a DOD operation as was 9/11....
Ask Rumsfield, Cheney and David Patreus.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was a CIA/military operation ran outside of chain of command just like Benghazi....and first 9/11...David Patreus zero footprint.
           </p>
           <p>
            They do this in at least 40 other countries which have been reduced to shambles and in the last years have implemented it on US soul against American Citizens.
           </p>
           <p>
            Black budget, dark money, weapons, children, huuuuge amounts of drugs, uranium, organs, all trafficked. Many major hospitals are involved. Intentional opiate targeting, murder for organs, planned parenthood sells of organs....

            OP, please provide sources for claims in your items, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Rule 2 requires that all factual claims that aren't common knowledge must be sourced (opinion is another matter, and doesn't need to be sourced).  It is important that we stay grounded in documented information.  Thanks.

            So somebody was sending Trump a message by killing his supporters; its connected to global pedo rings; but Sheldon Adelson, a huge Trump supporter, is hip-deep in the global pedophilia business himself?
Some of the above may be true, but taken as a whole, sounds like disinfo, designed to confuse.

            #6 Do you have a copy of that FBI Anon 4 chan post? Trump was a self funder, and he ran a very lean  campaign compared to others,  So do you have a link/proof for that? Not trying to be rude,  I just want the truth.

            The man they claim was Paddock who died in that hotel room, did not have the tat on his neck. That guy was not Paddock! Paddock needed someone/sombodies to think he was dead! All staged!
Paddock or whoever he really is, most likely thought he was there to sell guns to the Saudis. He was the patsy either way.

            Note: The brother was NOT going to say "arms dealer". he was going to say "Army of One", which would've denegrated the armed forces (It was the Army's commercial tagline for a while), and he decided not to do it.

            The rest of the video has very good information. just undertand that there is a very grave factual error, and "come to your own conclusions", as the video suggests.

            I posted this 3 days ago explaining the link to all above including direct links from shooter to pizzagate. I had sources but also called the Mandolay Bay personally and got them on record if who owns floor 35-39 Israeli tycoon and who owns the top 5 floors King of SA Waleed. MF would not allow it to stay.

            make you winder what was on that note. It was already stated it was not a suicide note. A confession? Calling people out?

              Of course it was. If we believe the whole thing was set up, that has to include the note, as well.

             People died and I know of at least 7 or 8 people that were there and are severely traumatized and one person who died.  Recently I posted that I knew of four people, and since then I talked to someone else who they told me about the death and the others.  It maybe more people that person mentioned, I know it was at least 4 (not including the one who died).  So bugger off with your 'no one died' bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Edit:  It was 4, one of them was shot, can't believe I didn't remember that up front, I was thinking about the person who died.  So 9 people, one dead, one shot but alive (so far), the rest severely traumatized.

Also in being surprised, the FBI approved this incident therefore I assumed it would not be an issue

             Shame on you.  Just because you don't know anyone personally that was killed, injured, traumatized due to being on site for work doesn't mean the rest of us are so callous. Fri night vigil in front of Mandalay Bay was cancelled but there's one tonight. Come to the march down LV Blvd to the casino 10/15 and hear the stories of those still suffering.
            </p>
            <p>
             Act like a human being and research the online message from the UMC trauma nurse who didn't even get a 15 min break for 48 hours after the victims overwhelmed the hospital's resources.

             You mean you don’t believe some people really died? Oh I do. My husbands friend has a friend that was shot. But, I think there were also crisis actors. Yes, they knew ahead of time because they sold their stock a few weeks before.

              Low-level total paid agent used as a tool. He was tricked/used. He believed in his cause. The way my mind works is: Was he really a tool of the left? Or was he a tool of the right?

            Pilots would be a good angle to pursue.  They are blue collar hard working guys in a skilled profession.  They travel in small circles.  They have a high level of exposure to these disgusting fucking dirt bags and are probably kept from acting by some sort of leverage.  But there's gotta be a fair number of them.

            Where's the evidence for the girlfriend trafficking kids?  Adelson has been accused of having prostitutes in his hotels.  Nowhere is it even implied he has had anything to do with raping children.  You make many claims without backing them up.

             Google it, Adelson is the richest Jew on earth, because he owns most of the world's pedophile Casinos, you people seem to not realize that in Macau, or Dubai nobody gives a fuck that elites are fucking SE-ASIAN children,
            </p>
            <p>
             Adelson's only biz model problem, is he can't get enough white children into his Arab/Asian Casinos, people don't go to gamble to these hotels, they go to FUCK, and rich elite arabs&amp;asians want to fuck young kids.

            Coincidentally, I was looking at the Four Seasons today because of this story:
            <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4959292/River-Cafe-diamond-girl-Daisy-Boyd-dead-aged-28.html">
             Glamorous sculptress Daisy Boyd is found dead at 28 in a private psychiatric hospital just months after £300m publishing heir Dan Macmillan, 42, broke off their engagement
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a link with the father's architectural firm Michaelis Boyd and the Four Seasons but I can't find the article with it.
            <a href="http://michaelisboyd.com/about/profile/michaelis-boyd">
             http://michaelisboyd.com/about/profile/michaelis-boyd
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            However, you will see this article mentions the Four Seasons Hotel stepping into the London market and hiring a firm of interior designers called Finchatton

              They are not CT.  We are researching right now.  Many are posting their findings.  It will all be ironed out while we research.  BUT we may never find our ALL of it.  When you call these CT on here, remember that we have new people possibly reading here.  We want them to know that we are really working hard to uncover this whole Masquerade.  We are suppose to give sources, so that the research we print here has back up.  That is not CT it is proof.  That is what we are demanding.  As I said this is a work in progress, Ironing it out will happen as we research.
