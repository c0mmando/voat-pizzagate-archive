<blockquote>
<p>Former senior pastors at a Santa Maria church are facing a <strong><em>sexual battery, assault and harassment lawsuit</em></strong> filed by a former parishioner, who also alleges church officials did not take action when complaints were raised.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>lawsuit</em></strong>* -- filed last summer by a mother of two in her 30s identified as Jane Doe -- claims that <strong><em>knowingly co-conspired in conduct from 2014-16 that included sexual harassment, battery, assault and gender violence.</em></strong>
…</p>
<p><strong><em>Robert stepped down</em></strong> from church leadership in June 2016 <strong><em>after complaints</em></strong> were made to church personnel <strong><em>about opinions on viewing pornography</em></strong> he allegedly communicated <strong><em>during one of his premarriage counseling courses</em></strong>, according to the suit. Shortly <strong><em>after Robert stepped down, Doe discovered more than a dozen women had similar experiences with the pastor</em></strong>.</p>
<p>In addition to serving as a pastor, Robert was a member of the Santa Maria Community Development Block Grants Committee before his appointment to the city’s Recreation and Parks Commission in April 2016. He stepped down from his post just a few weeks after he was appointed.</p>
<p>In her <strong><em>lawsuit against the Church of Life and the Litzingers</em></strong>, Doe alleges that Robert used his position as lead <em><strong>pastor</strong> to &quot;cultivate an atmosphere within Church for Life, through which he could satisfy his <strong>sexual fetishes</strong></em>.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit further accuses <strong>Church for Life of not taking action to investigate complaints against Robert</strong>, which included Doe\'s as well as claims made a year prior to the couple\'s departure in 2016. The lawsuit also alleges that <strong><em>Cindy knowingly assisted, facilitated and encouraged her husband’s sexual conduct.</em></strong></p>
<p>According to the complaint, in <strong><em>premarriage classes Robert would teach through the church</em></strong>, he would try and &quot;<strong><em>prepare the young women for their husbands</em></strong> and their wedding night,” instructing the women on <em>how to masturbate, have an orgasm</em> and figure out their bodies, being &quot;<em>prepared and willing to do whatever their husbands wanted.</em>”</p>
<p>Robert also would also encourage women to <strong><em>be open with their sex lives like his wife</em></strong>, stating that doing so made them strong Christian women, the complaint alleges. Part of his <strong><em>premarriage counseling included soliciting explicit photos from Doe</em></strong>, according to the complaint, and <strong>sharing his own sexual experiences with other women</strong>, explaining that “<em>we need to be open with each other.</em>”</p>
<p>Robert also would allegedly <strong>share photos of himself with Cindy</strong>, <em>covered in bed</em>, with a <strong>note</strong> that they &quot;<em>just had a great session.</em>&quot; Robert, then, would <strong><em>ask Doe to send similar photos</em> and, after multiple requests, she complied.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Robert allegedly continued to send photos to Doe</strong>, who found herself &quot;frozen in shock, confusion, fear and disbelief,&quot; according to the suit. When she asked him to stop, Robert would apologize and claim it was a mistake but encouraged Doe to &quot;be like his wife -- confident and a real woman of God,&quot; the suit continued.</p>
<p>During one occasion where <strong>Doe was invited to the couple’s home for a prayer group, Robert reportedly groped Doe’s breasts and genitals</strong>, which Doe <em>complained about to Cindy.</em> According to the complaint, <strong>Cindy called it an &quot;innocent mistake.&quot;</strong></p>

            Excellent work and nicely presented.  Both lawsuits are civil.  These sickos need to be criminally investigated, but Santa Maria Police twiddle their thumbs.  Their reputation is in the toilet, btw.

             Thank you for the original tip! I totally agree. Santa Maria is one of the few cities on the California Central Coast with lots of gang drugs/violence (it's a low-income farming town surrounded by beach-resort towns.)
            </p>
            <p>
             from your first article:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Lieutenant Dan Ast, a 23-year veteran of the Santa Maria Police Department before he was terminated last March in the wake of the fatally botched arrest of Officer Albert Covarrubias, is challenging his firing to an outside mediator who will submit an opinion to the city manager at the end of the five-day hearing, which Ast and his attorney opted to hold publicly. On Monday, attorney Jonathan Miller said his client was the victim of retaliation after he and two of the city's five police lieutenants filed a whistleblower complaint 12 days before the Covarrubias incident. The 29-year-old Covarrubias,
              <strong>
               under investigation for a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old member of the department's Explorer program,
              </strong>
              was shot and killed by a fellow officer on January 28, 2012, when he resisted arrest and fired his own gun during a confusing and violent confrontation at a late-night DUI checkpoint.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So a 30 year old cop was molesting a 17 year old in a youth police program, and he happened to be killed in a botched DUI stop?

            This loser has his own website in his first and last name. Apparently he was a car salesman and was in the army. Both he and his wife look like creeps. Something very off just looking at his intense eyes and facials expressions. Do a google image search lol! Of course these people aren’t godly, most places of Christian worship have been taken over by satanists posing as christians. Another long rabbit hole but they do it to discredit christians and make them become non believers. It’s too bad people have to use religion anyways just live with good intentions and don’t take advantage of others. Anyways good post on exposing these creeps.

            Rob Wrote a Book called PK (Pastors Kid). The Amazon Reviews are especially interesting (people growing up with him describe it as full of lies about his past). In it he describes how he’s a 3rd generation pastors kid, and how his father was kicked out of multiple churches for [litzinger explains them away as minor infractions like preaching for 5 minutes too long.] (you can read about it in the previewed chapter)

            <p>
             Rob Litzinger remembers the Sunday mornings when his church would wordlessly split into two sides at the pews: one side liked the pastor; the other did not. A third-generation PK, Litzinger was raised in a tight-knit Amish Mennonite family. His father preached at tiny rural churches mostly in Upstate New York. Because the Litzingers moved churches every three to five years, they had no friends but each other. The parents poured out their ministry woes to their three sons. Whatever mean things the church folks said or did, the boys heard about it. And it broke their hearts.

            So I researched Rob Litzingers’ family history

           <p>
            Rob Litzinger’s Father (Hugh Litzinger) was a pastor of “The Pilgrim Holiness” Christian denomination/movement in New York. (

            Currently neither Rob or Cindy Litzinger are pastoring a church. They now both work for a Real Estate company in Montana. I have been unable to find any updates about their California court proceedings. I would welcome anyone's research on either The Litzingers, or the Holiness Church Denomination

            While all of the accusers are above the age of 18, the incestuous themes and sexualization of the church/household include the Litzingers’ underage children, as well as underage kids who attended their church.
I got a distinctly “pedo” vibe from these Pastors, so I decided to investigate their social media. My investigation led to many more alarming, pedophilic indications:
Rob was a member of a “Christian” women’s organization called “SheResounds” (
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/SheResounds.tv">
             https://www.facebook.com/pg/SheResounds.tv
            </a>
            ) that “aims to give women of faith an opportunity for their story to be developed and heard through events, mentoring and platform development.”
Rob sold a “video production” package to young girls and published a tutorial on how to film and edit videos. He even offers a “package” where he will edit their footage for them and further “mentor” them on how to make more attractive videos.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The new lawsuit, naming plaintiffs Jane Does 2, 3 and 4, accuses the Litzingers of similar crimes. The suit also alleges that Church for Life "failed to investigate claims made by women in the years preceding Robert (Litzinger's) ouster in June 2016, instead, adopting Robert's explanations without question."
            </p>
            <p>
             The suit seeks financial damages over $25,000 for sexual harassment, assault, gender violence, battery, and states that the plaintiffs suffered emotional stress, humiliation and depression.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Church for Life also turned a blind eye towards Robert's teachings in its 'purity' classes and pre-marriage courses for years," according to the complaint filed by Santa Barbara attorney Jordan T. Porter. "Church for Life leadership was consumed with spiritualizing sexual conduct and sexualizing everything about the church was ingrained in church culture," the suit states.
            </p>
            <p>
             The suit further accuses Church for Life of negligence and creating an environment "where Robert could prey upon young women in fulfillment of his sexual desires," and blames church leadership for refusing to discipline Robert Litzinger.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does 2 through 4 had absent fathers, and Robert was an overly affectionate father figure to Does 2 through 4, the suit continues. This way, he would excuse his inappropriate conduct "as the normal way fathers treat their daughters, and explain that plaintiffs' unease was the result of their lack of experience and/or emotional distance in their earlier familial relationships," the suit added.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jane Doe No. 2: At one point, according to the suit, Doe 2 was invited to move in with the Litzingers, and the couple treated her like their own daughter. Shortly before Doe 2 moved away for college "Robert instructed her to break up" with her boyfriend, the suit states.
            </p>
            <p>
             Doe 2 returned to Church for Life after college, which is around the time the church began expanding, the suit continues.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Robert began suggesting he and Doe 2 have 'Dad snuggles' and 'Dad time,'" the suit states.
            </p>
            <p>
             During this time, the Litzingers in their teachings, "became more explicit about their sex lives," and talked openly about masturbation and insisted others share personal details as well, the suit added.
            </p>
            <p>
             At one of the Church for Life's retreats, conversations kept focusing on sex, the suit said. "Sex toys were displayed in a toiletries welcome basket in the event room bathrooms," according to the complaint.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later, Doe 2 became pregnant, and the Litzingers invited her over to their home and would ask her for photos of her nursing her baby, the suit states. They began sending nude pictures of themselves to her, and forbade Doe 2 to tell her husband about it, the suit said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The conduct continued through June 2016 until the couple left the church, according to the suit. Church for Life flew in a pastor from a Montana-based church where Robert Litzinger trained, to investigate the concerns, but "the investigation consisted of victim shaming and bullying the victims for their sins and roles in Robert and Cindy's actions," the suit said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The church has denied any criminal wrongdoing, and refused to release any further information to authorities except upon request, the suit said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jane Doe No. 3 Doe 3 was 19 when she interned at Church for Life for nine months, and lived with the Litzingers while 1,300 miles away from her parents, according to the suit. She was subjected to daily "Dad back rubs," which seemed normal until Robert Litzinger began unhooking her bra without her consent, the suit states.
            </p>
            <p>
             Litzinger also forced Doe 3 to break up with her boyfriend, claiming that he was having an affair with her mother, the suit continued. He threatened to kick her off the internship if she didn't comply, the suit states.
            </p>
            <p>
             Litzinger then began discussing masturbation with Doe 3, asking what she thought about it and how frequently she did it, the suit continues. Both Robert and Cindy Litzinger then began insisting Doe 3 join them for nightly "Mom and Dad snuggles" in their bed, the suit states.
            </p>
            <p>
             As time went on, the couple frequently asked Doe 3 for photos, and would often leave their laptop computer open in the kitchen "with nude pictures of Robert and Cindy engaged in sexual acts on display for Doe 3 to find," the suit states.
            </p>
            <p>
             Litzinger reportedly also told Doe 3: "What happens in the Litz house stays in the Litz house, because not everybody will understand what we do."
            </p>
            <p>
             Jane Doe No. 4: Doe 4 never lived with the Litzingers but was often invited to the couple's home for lunch after she began attending Church for Life in early 2016, according to the suit. Immediately afterward, Robert Litzinger urged Doe 4 to openly discuss sex, and invited her to "share her boy troubles with her 'Dad,'" the suit said.
            </p>
            <p>
             Doe 4 later asked Robert Litzinger if she could join his purity classes, the suit states, to which Robert agreed. During those classes, he would talk to Doe 4 about masturbating and watching pornography "in order to strengthen her faith and become like Cindy, a true woman of God," the suit reads.
            </p>
            <p>
             The classes culminated with a purity ring ceremony, the suit continues. Shortly afterwards, the Litzingers would send Doe 4 a photo of Cindy flashing the camera with the message: "So this is what you have to look forward to someday in a healthy, hot marriage (winking emoji)."
            </p>
            <p>
             Doe 4 immediately reported the couple to church elders, rather than members of the church leadership team, the suit adds, resulting in the Litzingers' removal from the church in June 2016.
