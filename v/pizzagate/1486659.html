            I have to agree with you on that.  In a way it's nice to be scrolling through wondering what's actually real and what is not.  If we had a definitive /v/ based purely in what we read, see, and link together we would have what would be a fairly sound, sounding thread.

            Unfortunately, as I dive further into the crazy symbols and actually learn what symbols mean to the powerful; I can see why people think it's important to put the information out there.  You kind of have to be able to spot the smoke to locate the fire.

            I've seen a few comments that I figure were people trolling for a laugh, but I really do think the majority are shills. What better way to get someone who is uninformed to turn their back? Coat the truth in a thick layer of fringe conspiracy!

            No joke, I was on several discord servers when I found out about pizzagate, this was right before
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             /r/pizzagate
            </a>
            got banned, and when I brought it up several people basically said "that illuminati pizza thing? I stop listening soon as I hear illuminati".
