<p>Yesterday morning I was awoken at 5:30am with the words &quot;PIZZA GATE&quot; blazing in my mind. I had previously seen the hashtag, but dismissed it...always disallowing myself a swift return to the center of the rabbit hole. I think God and my angels wanted me to get through Thanksgiving peacefully, so they waited until the food wore off and sent me back into the depths...</p>
<p>I spent all day yesterday (black friday, lol) crying my eyes out, thinking pure violence, filming videos which I immediately deleted for fear that the boogey man would latch on to me.</p>
<p>At the end of the evening, I was shown information about Monica Peterson and Max Spiers. I lit candles for them and said some prayers. I got messages from both. Uniquely different. </p>
<p>Monica recommends that we all let it go. She says go to Jesus, and protect the children that you can. If you have the means, she would love for you to rescue the children of Haiti through adoption. &quot;Pray for Haiti, and all the world.&quot; She told me its bad all the way through and through. She says if you decide to keep investing it, not only be ready to die, but know that you will die. Its a very heavy message to receive, but she\'s been on my heart so strong today, I finally asked how best and fastest to share her message and she told me to come on here. </p>
<p>She said, and the Angels, God/Goddess/All That Is concur:</p>
<p>The beast will rise before it falls. </p>
<p>They say that our minds think we can take on greater challenges than our bodies can actually handle. They want us to take care of our bodies, get strong, eat well, and spend quality time together. </p>
<p>Max is a spirit with such a different approach. He guided me to stretch and do yoga poses while I listened to one of his, and his mother\'s interviews. </p>
<p>He believes in digging in. He\'s fascinated by the whole construct, in almost a nonjudgmental-but-I-know-right-from-wrong fashion. He says he was right about a lot, but definitely wrong about some things. He would like for those of us who can stomach it to continue to study, and perhaps DO the type of work he was doing. </p>
<p>I ask them both what they think I can do to best assist?
They both encourage me to work locally and online to create safe spaces for people to learn about and express themselves (thank you)</p>
<p>I ask Monica if she has any messages?
If she has a sister, or young women who love her and are on the mission to solve her death she says. &quot;Simply slow down. Life goes on. You won\'t solve this, because I won\'t let you.&quot;</p>
<p>I ask is Max has a message?
I keep hearing the name Eric. And he says take good care of his ma. And he\'s showing me a massive pain in the top of his head, like an aneurism.</p>
<p>I ask him about the wound on his head?
He says he passed out and fell down. He\'s showing me a pool.</p>
<p>I ask about his girlfriend?
He shakes his head, no...no comment.</p>
<p>I ask for any other messages?
Monica: I say stay out of it! It\'s horrible, and satan is real and does not want you to disrupt him. Break apart television and show how it tells everyone everything. But stay safe in your neighborhoods and as you travel for now until we see what these people make of the world to bring down Trump.</p>
<p>How do you both feel about Trump?
Max: It\'s shocking me that he is not using this ammo. I wonder why.
Monica: He\'s not Clinton.</p>
<p>Monica: I want my family to live a good life. I am no martyr. I would have done better to run away and write a book. I feel secure here, but I am still very angry and upset. Everything I thought of God is different. I am growing to become more nonchalant about this because my soul has advanced greatly due to this. I think the greatest thing I can do now is tell people that all the creepy hollywood movies are true. There is always symbolism that makes them laugh at our stupidity. And we are complicit in their wrong doings when we are entertained by concepts of war, poverty, pain, chastisement, grandiosity, and slander. We have willingly submitted ourselves to their agenda, and to break away is to look away. If you decide to physically step in to save children, by guns, train in martial arts, and keep several hundred people around you at all times.</p>
<p>Thank you Monica. I just remembered that I was guided to go see \'Keeping Up With the Jones\' yesterday at the $2 theater.</p>
<p>Max: That was completely on purpose</p>
<p>Indeed. The part that is relevant was when Amy Adam\'s character is sneaking around the CIA neighbors house and wonders aloud if their work with Syrian Orphans is just a front. It was a part of the story line that was never revisited.</p>
<p>Max: It\'s fucking everywhere and everything. The more you get into it, the more your mind is blown by the depths of hell from which these- people (for lack of a better word) come. I still can hardly believe the lifetime I just had. They tell me my next one is going to be quick and a blast because I\'m going to kick a lot of ass. I\'m already there partway, but its not time to go yet, in your time.</p>
<p>What can either, or both of you tell us about consciousness existing in more than one place at once?</p>
<p>Monica: That\'s just the thing. These people are doing all these things and keeping all these secrets to bond closer to each other in the name of their work.</p>
<p>Max: YES! And if we, here on the other side of things could tip the balance a bit by agreeing with each other once in a while and not focusing on all this hocus pocus, we might be able to fucking SEE so that we could know when children and people are actually mind controlled slaves. It starts by breaking and continuously breaking the spell on ourselves, and kudos to you Shabrena for finally sticking to your truth and not voting!</p>
<p>Thanks Max.</p>
<p>Monica: Either its all gotta go, or we all go.</p>
<p>Max: This is true.</p>
<p>(I will pause here to reflect that all of this is alleged, but I do stand by the messages I am receiving.)</p>
<p>Both he and Monica knew too much and got way too close, and then their minds started to challenge them and they decided to fight back. They and the angels ask that you not investigate, and I, as a reader, have a complete black bar over the whole scene. I\'ve learned throughout the years what doors to knock on...this is not one. They recommend again that you don\'t write me off a a kook. They both want me to tell you about myself. </p>
<p>My name is Shabrena. You can look at my instagram account <a href="https://voat.co/user/shabrenamonet">@shabrenamonet</a> </p>
<p>I am 36 years old, single, black, living in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>I am working to make my business grow, which is funny that God is telling me to find two people I don\'t know to offer them my services. It\'s not truly MY services as you see. I am the conduit of their message, as I have surrendered time and again to God and the Angels asking them to tell me how and when to be of assistance. I kept thinking that I was supposed to get more involved with the situation in Standing Rock, but I kept hearing that my mission was coming and that I was already on it. </p>
<p>God and the Angels also encourage us to investigate, but they say don\'t go in without them. If these people work with a lord of their own, you can be sure that their is a Lord on the other side. His name is Jesus Christ and any of us can call him anytime...even if we\'ve had no contact with religion. His name clears all spaces and neutralizes fear. Archangel Michael is also on hand, non-denominational, and available for all who call him at all times. He wishes to protect us all now. </p>
<p>They say, &quot;This is not just a dangerous fight...this is THEE most dangerous fight. It cannot be won...not within this current justice system, paradigm, and way of life. This is the karmic resolve of generations of magical misuse. No one can hear your cries just as you cannot hear the cries of the children tucked away in bondage. The best thing you can do, for yourself and the planet, is to keep yourself safe, enjoy your time here on this planet. For you may not believe it just yet, but your smiles and joy emanate a forcefield that shields you from all harm. Why do you think entertainers are protected, even if they occasionally lash out and whistle blow. We are here to protect you and keep you safe. You made the commitment to come back to Earth and fulfill your mission as a lightworker. Remember we are here to assist you with the light, in every breath.&quot;</p>
<p>wow. That\'s not how my ego was choosing to process the information I\'ve been processing these last two days. I thank all of you investigators and youtubers who have given so much time and dedication to dissecting all this information so that sensitive ones like myself can get a lot of info in a short burst. I am ultimately grateful this is happening. My prayer is that sooner than later these heathens will be brought to justice, and we as a people will be able to keep a better eye on the happenings in the world around us. I believe this contrived notion of living can be completely erased off of this planet. My prayer is that more of us begin to vibrate at a high enough level to dissolve this. </p>
<p>I believe that I have now found the balance between rabbit hole, and heaven on earth. It hurts every part of my being to learn about this, but the silver lining is us coming all together. I mean...it brought me out of my internet shell. That\'s huge. </p>
<p>Thank you for anyone who reads this, and if anyone is connected to David Seaman and/or Vanessa Bates (Max Spiers mother), please respond to this thread. I am a safe reader. No witchcraft (not that all witchcraft is bad, I have learned from a few good witches who I love). I work with Angels under the guidance of a benevolent Consciousness that loves us all very much.</p>',
