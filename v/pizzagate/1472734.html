<p><strong>side note</strong>
After watching the video if you read the comments from George, who from what I gather is close to the intelligence agencies makes a very bold and frightening claim ( that even as he admits is unverified ). That Hillary has moved her Stinger Missile cache to Mexico since her Albanian cache was found. He claims that FBI and Russian Intel were worried about a potential attack on LHX or PHX by terrorist cells on command from Clinton. Which got me thinking about the FBI announcement in LA the other day about an impending attack on the red line.

<p>Anyways I hope some of you find it interesting.</p>',
