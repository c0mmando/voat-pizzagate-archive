            Racine — Samuel Curtis Johnson, a member of the Johnson family that has led the SC Johnson &amp; Son Inc. company in Racine through five generations, was charged Thursday with one count of repeated sexual assault of a child.

           <p>
            Johnson, 55, a billionaire son of the late Sam Johnson, appeared Thursday afternoon in Racine County Circuit Court on an allegation that he inappropriately touched a girl, now 15, beginning in June 2007.

            This is so true.  This is how they are going to change our Children and their whole outlook and how they will be brainwashing them into submission.  I am sure there will be more coming forward.  Hopefully parents are paying attention.  STEM and Common Core are Evil.

              I know. We had all that in school and now many are saying we can't afford libraries or music or art.  Those things are important to round out a Child's life and interests.  It is the dickering with subjects that messes them up.  All those tests and new age math.   No more math books either.  Confound it.

                The Children are so kind hearted and open their arms and love all.  This is what they are pinning their hopes on.  They are easily taken over to accept the trans and others that need so called love.  It's really criminal.  They have NO Right to Our Children.  People don't realize they are stealing their Hearts and Minds right out from under them.

                 They always have. The past few centuries has been about quantifying the effect for monetary gain. Post WWII is about even more. The dissolution of social order to form a Marxist type of Luciferian Utopia. These people have been absolutely clear about their desires for a very long time. Society in general has been conditioned to ignore this and call it all conspiracy. Nonsense out of some Hollyweird movie. You present people with all the evidence and most will not read anything. The few who will are mind-blown and most walk away, trying to ignore reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I found you people and do what little I can to help out. I've no interest in television. Reality is far more intriguing. I sincerely hope this database all of you are forming, serves to aid in exposing these people and serves future generations. That they may study strategic tactical maneuverability and psy-op warfare deployed globally over multi-generational exploitation.

                  OK that last sentence made me glaze over.  I had no idea they had been doing this until I came here.  They really were able to gain more traction to hoodwink people when the CIA came up with the phrase Conspiracy Theory.  That was monumental for them.  Right after Kennedy was killed.  They all had forgotten everything they were told before.  Everything was a lie unless from the govt.  Stupid.

                   C.I.A...............chosen illuminated adepts..........modern, less secretive than many of the older masonic groups. They openly exist now and covertly move against anyone that can expose their "mystery school knowledge". The clandestine(clan destine) are virtually everywhere. Knowingly or not.

                   Words hold power. They mastered this centuries upon centuries ago. Mastering terahertz for domination is part of modern era conquering.

                    Wish we could come up with something as monumental - wording I mean.  Something that will knock their socks off and sit up and listen or at least question the CT comebacks.  Very frustrating fighting now since FB has even decided what is true and what is not.  I can't believe so many people are allowing some rich mogul tell us what to believe or not.  God are they stupid.

                      Books make the best gifts for Children.  But we must research them first.  I give books to a few young Children still that I used to know and they love them.  Actually they have small book cases now to hold them.  Many are second hand so don't cost much.  People have to stop giving electronics.  Everything for Children has a battery in it now.  Kindles are awful.  I hate them.

                     I've tried pointing out the epigenetics and electrosmog factor to people. I've read some peer reviewed articles about epigenetics and all the scientists do is debate on what criteria they should be lab testing. Mostly to provide pros to pursued law makers to allow them to move forward with more unethical destructive, haphazardly created consumerist crap.
