<p>If the FBI  can track guns, cars and horses, why did the Federal Government chose NOT to track missing kids or child pornography crimes?

<p>So, I had to ask myself if the FBI can track cars, guns and horses, why would they chose NOT to track missing kids?  Why would the federal government, which wants to control everything from healthcare to education to the internet, chose NOT to control the center for missing children and the collection of child pornography evidence?  Why is that the one service they enacted a law to privatize?
And how can a private organization be allowed to do something illegal like store child pornography?

            I am a new poster, but not a new user. I was given some interesting information on NCMEC and in particular the state of Virginia. It appears that Virginia has a larger than normal amount of missing children that have no picture attached. I had this infographic appear in my timeline and tagged for me specifically
            <a href="http://i67.tinypic.com/11tstn4.jpg">
             http://i67.tinypic.com/11tstn4.jpg
            </a>
            which led me asking the original poster where his info came from. That led here
            <a href="https://8ch.net/pol/res/10588784.html">
             https://8ch.net/pol/res/10588784.html
            </a>
            which led to here
            <a href="http://www.vsp.state.va.us/CJIS_VMEC.shtm">
             http://www.vsp.state.va.us/CJIS_VMEC.shtm
            </a>
            which led to here
            <a href="http://www.missingkids.org/missingkids/servlet/PubCaseSearchServlet?act=usMapSearch&amp;missState=VA&amp;searchLang=en_US&amp;casedata=latest">

            .  This seems very odd to me as less than half of these children have pictures. If you click the link to see the poster of the child, still no picture. OP of  /pol/ thread called NCMEC and asked why no photos and they stated that
            <a href="https://8ch.net/pol/res/10588784.html#10588962">
             https://8ch.net/pol/res/10588784.html#10588962
            </a>
            they can't post pictures without parents/guardians permission. This seems as if it is PG related as Brian Podesta is NCMEC Senior Analyst
            <a href="https://archive.is/wnmLe">
             https://archive.is/wnmLe
            </a>
            , with a security clearance of of TOP SECRET-SENSITIVE COMPARMENTED INFORMATION.  This is the highest security clearance there is.  Why would this guy need security clearance that high? and at the NCMEC? WTF is this guy into? And why?

            True, it might take a few refusals to get on the bad side of America... But then, you start doing things that are completely irrationap, all of our news agencies repirt you did these things, and the gov't begins to retaliate tenfold for these things the news says you did. It doesn't need to be constant violence to be a threat of violence.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              This
             </strong>
             is is one of the major reasons for privatization.
            </p>
            <p>
             They never want activist organizations like Judicial Watch getting their hands on internal documents.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Another reason they want to keep it private is so that they don't have to follow government hiring standards
             </strong>
             . Being private gives them latitude to hire and promote who they want (including pedophile plants) rather than having to follow government policies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also,
             <strong>
              they don't want to have to follow govt policies about firing
             </strong>
             . You can't just threaten to fire a govt employee to intimidate them, because there's a whole bureaucratic process involved. It takes a long time, and there are extensive records kept, which can be accessed by FOIA request. Basically, being private allows them to fire people quickly and at will, and the employees know that getting out of line can quickly cost them their job.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Is this also why the govt contracts with a private company to issue Amber Alerts
             </strong>
             ?
            </p>
            <p>
             That company hired child kidnapper Laura Silsby!
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
             These are the reasons govt insiders want anything to to with child trafficking and pedophilia to be privatized.

            Of course the government is behind it, and not just the US government.  Why else would the LBGQTP  crap be so in your face every day.  The nutcase prime minister of Canada made anal sex with boys under 18 legal.

            simple, if they were a part of the government then all of their records, files, and information would belong to the public and would be available through foia requests. can't have us learning their secrets so easily.

            Normally, I'm for privatizing industries. However, this monopoly of the missing kids organization seems worse than being under government control. Not only do they have no competition, they have no direct oversight by the elected officials.

             Why would a "people's" government operating in the interests of the public and 
using taxpayer money want to privatize any service the government requires?
            </p>
            <p>
             Save money?  You can't ADD a profit line to any business without increasing the costs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Plus -- when you privatize an industry the public loses control and accountability of
that industry.  Like with Charter Schools.
            </p>
            <p>
             Note that what our Founders actually did with the Constitution was to create an Elite Patriarchy,
endowed it with land grants, gave them immense influence and control over our people's 
government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.
We were "set up" for private control of the nation long ago by the Founders.

              For sure. Costs of everything that's been privatized around here has gone way up and service way down. They cut corners, staff and wages so they can make a big profit and they don't give a hoot for doing a good job. Roadwork, hospital cleaning, care homes and more all gone to hell in a handbasket.  The private contracts all went to the big donors of the government crooks who privatized too, go figure.

               Agree - 
And there are actual lives being lost in the lack of care and very poor care which
Americans are getting.

              <p>
               But it is laughable when they suggest that "privatizing" will save money.
How do you save money by adding a profit margin?

              Your charter school analogy is flawed.  Every metric has privatized schools (parochial especially, but charter as well) out performing public schools by light years ... until niggers and vouchers are put into the equation.

               That's false as Charter schools -- which, btw are not "private" in the sense that they are financed by US taxpayer 
money, while they are unaccountable to the American taxpayer -- are constantly failing.

               Plus religious schools are not Charter schools which were a new avenue intended to destroy public education
for the masses.

              <p>
               Rather Catholic schools are also failing as parents have moved their children into public schools.
And as Americans have moved away from male-supremacist religions.
However, Catholic schools have also long tried to attract as much government funding as they can,
actually against our Constitutional mandate for separation of church and state.

              the fact the US government chose to assign very inexperienced people widely opens the possibility that the audits are a complete hoax.

              No question re: the overstatement of gold but imho children hoarding is a stretch unless we can prove travel lines in terms of underground tunnels (beyond routes leading to other parts of the military compound). These would likely be removed from any accessible satellite (or otherwise) imagery so maybe seeking out a whistleblower in this respect would be best [not sure if there is already testimonial to this effect at this point in time].
