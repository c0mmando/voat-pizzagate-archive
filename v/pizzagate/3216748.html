<p>RELEVANCY: Keith Raniere used NXIVM as a vehicle to ensnare sex slaves, traffic women, and allegedly molest underage girls. He was charged with sex trafficking and crimes related to that charge. However, a few days before his trial started, he was charged with possession of child pornography found on his computer. The relevancy also extends to Raniere also having connections with high-ranking political figures so this definitely fits squarely in the center of the zone for this subverse. As for what this post is about, I\'ve been following the story of this sex cult since it broke, and have read a lot of information about it, but I ran across an article the other day that blew my mind. It was written by Omar Rosales and shared on The Frank Report. The Frank Report has been all over NXIVM from the beginning and has more than established credibility. So for them to share this article by reposting it on their site, made me take notice. The claims arise out of testimony given about Keith Raniere in the trial that is now taking place. The lead the author, Rosales, has made some connections and draw a linkage / parallels between Raniere and occult practices, a secret hierarchy, The Zodiac Killer, and Aleister Crowley. While I would have banked on the occult, the rest is news to me. After all, we pizzagaters are well aware of the elite cabal being involved in occult rituals, and this further provides evidence that Raniere was part of that inner circle and the inner circle\'s belief system since it is one he shared I did initial digging on the topics mentioned by Rosales, but came across way more than I bargained for. It\'s why I\'m going to divide this topic up in sections. It\'s just too massive to handle on its own and some of the directions it led were shocking, so here we go. Here\'s Part I. </p>

<p>Rosales: The Photographs Were Not Sexual — Keith Obtained Pleasure From the Torment</p>

<p>This right here, folks. You remember all the times we tried to we tried to get a handle on why the cabal was torturing kids? Yeah, the adrenochrome theory arose out of SRA, but this .... we forget these people are wired differently from us and sometimes the torture boils down to pure pleasure for them. It resonated throughout the Ted Bundy Tapes on Netflix. It was the torture that did it for him. It ticks all their boxes like nothing else does. Even to title something in this way shows to me that the guy is onto something and what he\'s onto is this: </p>

<p>Keith was a student of esoteric religions. He knew about Tibetan Buddhist meditation rites as well as references to Western mythology. His book was titled ‘Odin and the Sphinx’. Why did he compare himself to Odin? Did he consider himself to be the Allfather?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good question as is the raising of the specter of Odin. I gotta say that if I mentioned that name to anyone of my friends, colleagues, or family, they\'d be hard-pressed to tell me exactly who Odin is. They\'re not that big into Norse mythology, but why is it that anyone involved in a sex cult, torture cult, sexual killing spree is? And I\'m not leaving out black magicians. Yup, they all know about Odin, and in case you don\'t, Odin is the one-eyed god. You know, one eye like all pop stars covering up one eye and holding up their hands in the shape of a triangle ... pyramid really that symbolizes the all-seeing eye. </p>

<p>Raniere wrote another book besides ODIN AND THE SPHINX. He co-authored, THE SPHINX AND THELXIEPEIA. Thelxiepeia is the name of a siren of the sea. In other mythology, they are referred to as mermaids. But the Thelxiepeia was a half-woman half-bird creature whose songs caused seamen to crash. The sphinx is half-woman half-cat and featured prominently in Egyptian mythology. This comes into play later on when we delve into the Egyptian mysteries. And here ... here\'s a reversed shot of Allison Mack under the inscription: \'\'GOOD TIME CLEOPATRA.&quot; </p>

<p>Note the Kabbalahistic path as denoted by the inverted triangles. There are the two pillars also. The inscription: \'\'FROM NOTHNG COMES SOMETHING.&quot; There\'s \'\'NEW\'\' and a series of letters I can\'t make out. Is it AAIX? AA would be interesting since that is Aleister Crowley\'s \'\'spiritual\'\' organization. Probably devoted to the bettering of man ... right, but to get back to the article. Here\'s where Rosales gets into the Zodiac Killer </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Zodiac was a serial killer who terrorized the Bay Area in the 1960s and early 70s. Although never caught, the Zodiac was known and became popular for his taunts of the police. Zodiac would mail cyphers with clues to local newspapers and wait for the publicity. And Zodiac loved to be in the spotlight. One of his more famous notes was the Halloween Card of 1970. On October 27, 1970, San Francisco Chronicle writer Paul Avery received a card from the Zodiac. The card was a Halloween greeting and contained the phrase, “By fire, by gun, by rope, by knife…SLAVES FOR PARADICE”.</p>
<p>Paradise was intentionally misspelled as Zodiac loved puns. In the card, the Zodiac hand drew several symbols to show it was he and included his body count up to that time – 14 victims. He also said, “Peek a boo you are doomed.” Whomever the Zodiac was, he knew about mythology and literature. Zodiac read Milton, knew about theatre, and he could make cyphers. But, he also believed he and his victims were linked due to his victims’ painful deaths. That the psychic trauma created a bond, where the victims’ souls were forever linked to the Zodiac from the violent deaths – by fire, by gun, by rope, by knife. So why is Keith making slaves of women and telling them to, “Feel the Pain, Think of your Master”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, why. Plus \'\'FEEL THE PAIN\'\' is very close to \'\'EAT THE PAIN,\'\' the infamous quote from the Marina Abramovic in the Spirit Cooking email. </p>

<p>More from Rosales: </p>
<p>Other ancient civilizations buried slaves with their Kings and Queens. This was a common practice among ancient Egyptians, Vikings, Maya, and Aztecs. The belief was that the war captives or slaves would serve the King in the afterlife. To solidify the bond, the captives were killed at the funerals of the venerated rulers and then placed in the graves alongside their masters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Zodiac was also assembling Female Slaves for his afterlife. 
... 
In one of Keith’s computers, he kept a backup file of all the pictures of women that he posed for his ‘studies.’ The pictures were of women on Keith’s bed, with closeups of their vaginas.</p>
<p>What if it wasn’t a study, but more of a trophy? An assemblage of all his victims. And this is where Keith’s psychopathic tendencies start to take over. He had to keep trophies. He could not help himself. That is how he gains pleasure – by tormenting women and later on reliving the torment.</p>
<p>Keith was happy to see Sylvie cry and squirm when he ordered her to spread her legs and be photographed. The photographs were not sexual. ... Keith obtained pleasure from the torment. ...  it was their suffering, pain, and anguish that made Keith aroused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the article refers to &quot;Sylvie&quot;. For those who have not followed the trial, I\'m attaching a link to &quot;Sylvie&quot; to tell a little about what she suffered. </p>

<p>Vicente told jurors he was involved in an all-male group, called the Society of Protectors, who used &quot;dark, hateful misogyny&quot; to terrorize Nxivm\'s female members</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe one of the things to notice is the incredible level of misogyny going on. It\'s exactly the same thing with the agenda this elite cabal is carrying out. They are using surrogates to \'\'breed,\'\' thus stripping the right of motherhood from wives/mates and reducing it to a paid juggling act. This also reinforces that wives are consorts and must look good and maintain their bodies. There is also the transgender entering women\'s sports and dominating. Women\'s records are being smashed and women\'s efforts reduced to pathetic in comparison with these male \'\'Amazon\'\' counterparts. </p>
<p>Since I\'m running out of space, I would also like to post a couple of links between Egyptian/Freemasonry/Satanism. They are one in the same with the gods being identical. Yes, Freemasonry gods are Egyptian gods and that should tell you why the current elite are giving them preference. </p>

<p>Personally i equate the origin of the Osiris myth in the Near east, perhaps Anatolia, where farming first spread across the west. I think I almost support the theory that an early form of Indo-European language accompanied the cult of farming, and that the neolithic farming cultures of Old Europe believed in a similar vegetal deity. In this respect I\'d say that both Odin and Horus, Osiris and Yemo/Mimir are all descendants of a very early prototype, which is why the Grail myths and the Egyptian myths seem to be closely related.</p>

           I believe one of the things to notice is the incredible level of misogyny going on. It's exactly the same thing with the agenda this elite cabal is carrying out. They are using surrogates to ''breed,'' thus stripping the right of motherhood from wives/mates and reducing it to a paid juggling act. This also reinforces that wives are consorts and must look good and maintain their bodies. There is also the transgender entering women's sports and dominating. Women's records are being smashed and women's efforts reduced to pathetic in comparison with these male ''Amazon'' counterparts.

           Since I'm running out of space, I would also like to post a couple of links between Egyptian/Freemasonry/Satanism. They are one in the same with the gods being identical. Yes, Freemasonry gods are Egyptian gods and that should tell you why the current elite are giving them preference.

            Personally i equate the origin of the Osiris myth in the Near east, perhaps Anatolia, where farming first spread across the west. I think I almost support the theory that an early form of Indo-European language accompanied the cult of farming, and that the neolithic farming cultures of Old Europe believed in a similar vegetal deity. In this respect I'd say that both Odin and Horus, Osiris and Yemo/Mimir are all descendants of a very early prototype, which is why the Grail myths and the Egyptian myths seem to be closely related.

            A siren is known as a harpy because they lured the sailors with music. Another lesser known version is the Selkie, amongst many other variations. Almost all the stories are about forcing the female into marriage. In Latin, sylva means "wood" or "forest," and the related Sylvanus is the name of the Roman god of the woods and fields—a god sometimes identified with the Greek god Pan. These words gave rise to English sylvan in the 16th century. The English word was first used as a noun meaning "a mythological deity of the woods," eventually taking on the broader meaning "one who frequents the woods." The adjective sylvan followed soon after the noun and is now the more common word. Some other offspring of sylva (which can also be spelled silva) include silviculture ("a branch of forestry dealing with the development and care of forests"), sylvatic (a synonym of sylvan that can also mean "occurring in or affecting wild animals"), and the first name Sylvia. Not sure if Sylvia is her real name. Pan also has many aliases. These freaks actually worship this stuff. The hardest part is explaining to others who are not well read.

             Yeah, it's hard for us pizzagaters to keep up with all these terms and nuances. And, yes, these cultists actually care about this. They care they give to coordinates and numerology and astronomy is incredible. That line, "If only you'd devoted yourself to good instead of evil," runs through my mind when I read about some of this. The rituals ... the chanting and ceremonial pronouncements ... I'd never be able to remember all that ... and yet they do. And, evidently, some people are up on this.

              I forgot to add how one can launder a lot of money through horses just like the art. The Green Monkey is a thoroughbred out of the sire Forestry and the dam MagicalMasquerade. Padua Stables bred the horse, which was foaled in 2004 and sold two years later for $16 million to Susan Magnier, Derrick Smith and Michael Tabor. Then you have to pay for the upkeep?

                Think about it, million for foal, foal dies, where are the horse police? They are not in the IRS. I doubt they are checking all stables for living foal. Money laundered, tax relief. I could come up with more scams, were I inclined. Just watched the Bernie in Russia tape and towards the end there was Astro Pizza first American Pizza in Russia. The main one I could find is on Long Island. Who else lived/stays there? Many famous people have resided in or owned second homes in Amagansett through the years, including Paul McCartney, Scarlett Johansson, Kathleen Turner, James Frey, Jerry Seinfeld, Harvey Weinstein, Christie Brinkley, Diane Sawyer, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, Liev Schreiber and Naomi Watts, Alec Baldwin, Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, Peter Mayle, Jann Wenner, Suzanne Vega, Howard Stern, Lorne Michaels, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, Shane McMahon and Mitch Kupchak. At the end of the last ice age, Amagansett stood at the eastern tip of Long Island. At that time, Montauk was an island on its own in the Atlantic. In the intervening several thousand years, ocean currents, or littoral drift, filled in space with sand. That means they could have tunnels.

                 Actually, there was someone on Twitter. Why don't I remember the account? Or why didn't I write it down would be the more pertinent question. Anyway, it was an account robustly denouncing Trump in a very sarcastic way ala Bill Maher. And they joked about the wall. Said something about not doing any good because they'd only take the underground tunnels and it wouldn't impede the flow of traffic. I was like, "Hot damn!" That was a decidedly odd thing to say, but, no ... no it wasn't. Think about all the drug cartels and the huge tunnel they found was it at the beginning of last year?

                    Talking about Aragansett in Particular.  During Operation Pastorius, a failed Nazi attack on the United States staged in June 1942, during World War II, four German spies were dropped off from a submarine on Atlantic Avenue beach in Amagansett, where they made their way to the village's Long Island Rail Road station and boarded a train for New York.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    A Coast Guardsman assigned to watch the beach noticed the suspicious strangers on the beach and notified the police and the FBI. In the spring of 2007 the original Coast Guard station, which had been moved to a private residence in 1966 to protect it from demolition, was moved back to near its original location at Atlantic Avenue beach. Why there of all places? Fast forward and, performance artist Laurie Anderson and her husband Lou Reed divided their time between their Greenwich Village apartment and a house in Amagansett. She worked with Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsburg(NAMBLA). Those Tunnels can be extended to modern sewage and subway. Jefferson Port and Bridgeport are on my radar.

                     Oh, yeah, Leary. The Most Dangerous Man in America. He claimed he was carrying on work of another scumbag. Name escapes me at the moment, but talk about social experimentation. And Lou Reed ... now there's a character, You wonder in a place like NY if apartments in certain cabal-owned run buildings are connected also.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I have no doubt that if someone went down there and really looked, they'd find lots and lots of tunnels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     And now that you're bringing up the German spy story, you wonder what it covered up. Was what they put out propaganda. McCarthy knew things, and he was publicly destroyed when he went after PedoWood.

              I could not possibly put out all the information that this team has. I have a hard time just keeping up. I see the mythology in brands in the grocery store instantly, because I studied that stuff when I was a kid. Almost all the sun signs are devoted to Akenaton/Ra.He is one of the main ones for them, and reputed to be half woman/man.Look at the images of him and you will see why. I just cant believe I missed this! How, in your face.

             There's a book, "Monkey on a Stick." It documents the Hare Krishna movement in America. It lead into occult practices, the Process Church, decapitations ... grisly stuff. The book is written from the viewpoint that the monk who exported the religion was innocent and didn't know what was going on. I believed it at the time and didn't question that the people in America were infiltrated by these dark forces, but now? I have to sincerely wonder if he knew exactly what was going on and that it was yet another religious cult used for indoctrination.

              Have you seen Jay Dyer's recent work on cults? If not, I highly recommend it. I'm a scholar as well so I appreciate his work as a peer.

             Appearance can sometimes alter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Adults under pressure can experience their physical appearance changing, but then some people don't really show what they're going through.
            </p>
            <p>
             But if you're asking if a nose or cheekbones can physically widen or alter, no, I've never heard of that. Not unless there's physical abuse to go along with it.

             Hey, did you see my new post? Do you remember Isaac Kappy? He committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was wondering what he was doing. Jump made a splash and disappeared.

              <p>
               What video was he talking about? And he knew Macauley Culkin? That right there is a shame. A nice, sweet, talented kid like that defiled and corrupted. And he had no one to protect him. And now, ALLEGEDLY, he's a predator? Too sad. But if you did know Kappy, who was he working with? He had to have a group behind him, or in front or to the side of him. He couldn't do this alone because what was he doing? Really, nothing except making allegations. And that would have been fine if he were working with a group. He infiltrates the pedos ... hangs out with them ... collects the real evidence and feeds it to this "GROUP" while letting us know the barebones of the situation. Like Portland, Oregon. Hell, yeah, it's corrupt, but how? What was being done?
              </p>
              <p>
               I really thought he was disinfo because of his association with Bernie Sanders. Sanders is bad news, man. Very bad news and very evil. Dark, dark, blackness evil. He has no compassion ... no kindness ... I can see that in his eyes and tell from the way he speaks. Especially in the good old days when he was forging alliances with Russia and probably groups that will never be named. But pls talk to me. What do you know about Kappy?
              </p>
              <p>
               PM me if you need to, but I'm interested.
              </p>
              <p>
               Oh, and from what I saw this morning on Twitter ... yeah, he was murdered. There were witnesses out in nowhere land that are testifying as to how he died? And that bridge. No one would jump off that thing to commit suicide. Makes no sense.

                I think that he was working for whoever Q really is. Isaac used to refer to it as a "disclosure project," which I agree, the only thing I disagreed with was that they had the public's best interest at heart. I think it's a psyop and the beginning stages of the "strong delusion" Jesus prophesied would come in the last days before Jesus' soon return. I think Isaac may have finally realized this and he may have tried to leave and warn people that it wasn't for the public good. I think I know the identity of the "good man" the "powerful" man Isaac referred to repeatedly in the video that he offended which it appears led to his murder.

                I also noticed in Isaac's last Periscope video that At 45 min. and 15 seconds, and then again at 3 minutes past the hour, in Isaac's last Periscope video, he makes a throat-slitting gesture across his neck, the second time after someone asked him if he was set up or got "caught in a trap." The way Isaac kept looking at a certain part of the room (which he never did in the dozens of vidoes he'd previously posted) and the way the dog was crying (which it had never done in previous videos) tells me that there were people in the room with Isaac holding him captive.

                </a>
                I think that one reason why Isaac was talking about God so much in his last video was because he was trying to stir the consciences of those holding him captive, and also because he knew that he was going to die. I am glad I was able to speak with him so much about Jesus and the scriptures before he passed away.

                 Think you're onto something there. Never occurred to me, but, yeah, that could very well be. Especially because he was so uncertain about doing another video. I do remember that part seemed odd. He cocked his head and recanted and said something like, "We'll see." Maybe he thought he could change someone's mind? But this Q thing, then you think Q is disinfo? If Kappy was into a disinfo psyops, and Q was working for the same people, then Q is disinfo psops? Then how would Q get so close to the president as to take shots of signatures on bills and aerial views? They were aerial views but not from Air Force One?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I don't know about Q. He has been wrong, but if his job is to be a provocateur, there would be reason for him to say misleading things. It would be to rattle the cabal. So much to guess at. I just pray everything comes to light. We have all suffered enough under these scourge's hands.

                  I think that Q is being run out of the Department of Energy as a psychological operation to manipulate the public into doing the will of the New World Order. Trump is clearly serving the New World Order. He is clearly a Luciferian Illuminist

                  I think that Isaac fell for Q, thought they were real (because I think he actually met some of them, which is why he called them a "disclosure project" which is a group of people and not an individual. I think they recruited him to tell what he really knew and used him like a pawn. I think Isaac thought he as serving his country and didn't know it was a plot of the NWO, the coming Beast system which will arise once Jesus comes to take his people off the earth during the Great day of the Lord. I think that Isaac then offended a mutual acquaintance of ours who always seemed like a spook or undercover agent working for Q/DOE and that that's the "mistake" Isaac keeps referring to. I think Isaac finally sensed something was wrong with that guy and got into some kind of conflict with that guy. It's just an educated hunch. The guy in question always seemed dangerous and I was always worried that he seemed to hover around Isaac like some kind of handler. The person was extremely manipulative and posted messages that sound like what was written in Isaac's alleged final note on Instagram. pushing Q harder than  I've ever seen anyone push Q, harder than I've seen most Christians promoting Jesus. The guy seemed beyond a fanatic, like he was actually employed by whoever Q really is. Q IS the DEEP STATE. The only solution to anything is Jesus Christ and Jesus wants me to tell everyone that he is coming back sooner than any of us can imagine and he will take the repentant, and the pure in heart, and the children, in the soon-coming resurrection of the dead and living in Christ. Don't be left behind to face the Great and Dreadful day of the Lord. Jesus said to watch and pray to be worthy to escape these things. The imminent resurrection is our escape. Q and Donald Trump have tempted alot of people to commit the sin of idolatry. America needs to repent of idolatry. Trump can't save anything. 1 Thessalonians 4:17 and Luke 21:36 "Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man." - Jesus Christ

                   It really seemed like he committed more of an offense than offending someone. Plus he said it was a trap. He did get that much out. It would be hard to "trap" someone into offending someone so that doesn't ring right to me. A trap was set and it had to be something forbidden or something he'd been told / or been able to figure out would be punishable. Hence the no more videos.

                 Think- just sent me a link to the last Periscope. He says he did something. He said he trusted a friend and that he shouldn't have done it and was talking about not doing any more talks because of it. He said he wasn't being blackmailed, but if the incident had just happened, maybe they didn't have time to blackmail him.

            The reason fhe elite torture and use children is NOT the andecrond BS everyone keeps pushing, it is to keep them from feeling anything and being in a psychopathic mind state. To keep them completely desensitized and powerful. They do this regularly.

             I'm afraid that is only a myth, and a misunde-standing regarding Egyptian pharaos having the same hablogroup than somewestern Europeans.
            </p>
            <p>
             I recall only one more or less credible story of an Egyptian princess that might have fled to Ireland iirc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Otherwise, some Egyptian pharaos have the same hablogroup as some Europeans because of the Hittites (area of today's Turkey, before the Turks invaded it).
            </p>
            <p>
             TL;.DR the Egyptian pharaos had the same genes as-some people in today's .Turkey, since ancestor's might have married Egyptians.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is aotherwise no direct genetic relation between western Europeans and Egyptians.

              There are no castles throughout Europe before 1000 AD. Switzerland has MANY people with pharonic DNA. The Egyptians “disappeared into the sea” double meaning being the sea of people up north. The English language originates from ancient Egyptian words this is a dead giveaway.

               Probably due to migration from the area of today's Turkey, those people had the same hablogroup as some of the Egyptian pharaos, as I said above.

             It's posts like this that I don't know about. Are you deliberately posting disinfo? Or are you really sincere in your belief what you stated is factual because it's not. And you're wrong right out of the gate about something that is well-researched and correct. So for me, everything you say after that is just a crock of whatever brew you're drinking today. So as concerns your opening statement:

              I stand behind what I say and couldn’t care less whether you believe me or not. I know a fair bit about Egyptian occult pertaining to Illuminati, Freemasonry, Kabbalah and Satanism. Freemasonry is the worship of Set or Luciferian the Light. No doubt there is an Odin but he is not the one the elite are worshipping it is Luciferian/ Set. They love the symbolism which is rich in Egyptian occult. And YES 1000% true about the child abuse I mentioned. They are not just torturing kids and killing them for adencrome which u saw in the Vegas movie. It is for much deeper purposes which you obviously know nothing about nor understand. Just because your so called facts differ from my truth doesn’t mean I am wrong. Stop trying to start something u cannot finish.

            Do you suspect this can be connected to “mass trauma events” (as a taken to its horrible logical conclusion) inflicting immense psychological/emotional pain on a very large group of people all at once.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you look at one of the murder cases I’ve been looking into, I have a theory that inflicting such a thing was one of the motives for the murder (collect the public’s emotional energy via a mass trauma event). Given the most likely true date of the murder being 7/27 (grand climax).

             One other thought on this entire subject, the infiltration of religion by satanists is a natural. Religion, by its nature, is devotional. A congregation believes and follows the minister of leader of that church. So you have the mindset of a sheep in going along rather than having to establish it. A devious person could feed off that and use it for whatever purpose they liked.

             Again, pretty much each group / religion has been infilrated. There are plenty of Christian churches erected that serve as fronts for Satanism.

               I will be getting to a lot of things.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know if this specific topic is covered, but there are some pretty big revelations ahead. If not revelations, then bizarre, weird behavior and beliefs. One of these I did not know and, as I said, it's connected to a huge event. But I never heard this spoken of. Never. It was covered for obvious and not so obvious reasons. I think the covering was to stop from ruining someone's reputation, but that the real reason was to not have the entire issue discussed so that someone could get to the bottom of it. Like with the Freemasons. You keep hearing it discussed,but does anyone get to the bottom of exactly what they do? Who they're connected with? Who's a member?
              </p>
              <p>
               So like I said, I never heard of this one particular piece of information and it was pure instinct that made me search for it. I just wondered if there was a connection and there sure was.

             Tantric sexual practices from the East did not 'use women'.. quite the opposite.... that is a bastardisation from the West.  The Dalai Lama is CIA and involved with the the whole New Age movement driven by Tavistock and the intelligence services.

              I think I disagree here. Initially, in the first centuries, there was a lot of female empowerment going on in tantric cirlcles, but this seems to have decreased over time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then misogyny took over.
             </p>
             <p>
              Additionally, there is a dark left hand path connected to the tantiric tradition in Tibetan Buddhism, which literally lets initiates of the highest grades get away with murder.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tibetan Buddhism has its own sexual abuse crisis, too, which is not surprising considering that some children are given to the monks when they are still babies or toddlers, by mostly poor parents, who accept the monks and the Lamas as spiritual authority. Tibet used to be a theocracy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes, the Dalia Lama is ouf course a clown asset, but it's not only him. It's inherent in the spiritual practice imo, where men need female spiritual energy.
             </p>
             <p>
              sexual abuse of adult women is rampant too.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is an excellent website about it by a former Tibetan Buddhist, will try to find it later today.
             </p>
             <p>
              TL;DR - the tantric tradition might have worshipped 'the female' at first, and might still do so today officially, but over time it became problematic, and the emphasis was more on sexual exploitation.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's how I see it.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I am open to any reading suggestions, and to have a discussion with you. :-)

               In the TV series Kung Fu, John Carradine was accepted to a Tibetan monastery as a young boy. Fatherless he searched for his half brother. Notables are Harrison Ford, Leslie Nielson, John Blythe Barrymore, Jodie Foster, William Shatner, Pat Morita, Don Johnson, Carl Weathers, Wilford Brimley (the oatmeal man), Gary Busy, and Dean Jagger amongst others. The boy was played by Brandon Lee, son of Bruce Lee. Maybe not coincidentally Dean Jagger also had something to do with Bruce Lee's last film where he died on set before completion. Just food for thought.

                Tantra, or more properly tantrika, is a diverse and rich spiritual tradition of the Indian sub-continent. Although in recent years, in the Western world, it has become almost exclusively associated with sex, in reality this is one aspect of what is a way of life. In India itself, tantra is now, nearly always, associated with spells and black deeds.
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 Neither of these views is correct, and each wildly underestimates the wide-ranging nature of the different traditions.
                </strong>
                Further, there remains an ocean of tantrik and agamic literature still to be discovered and translated, spanning a period of time which at least reaches back to the 10th century of the common era (c.e.).
               </p>
               <p>
                The tradition, or perhaps better, the traditions, underwent many phases and schools over this period of time, ranging from an extremely heterodox viewpoint to, in some cases, a very orthodox standpoint. Refer to this page to see the vast diversity of thoughts and practices subsumed under the word "tantra". Much of the material on this site is related to the Kaula tradition in many of its guises. The work kaula is cognate with clan and the communities venerated a huge number of gods (devas) and goddesses (devis).

                <strong>
                 The divine feminine worship
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                The first tantric civilization with a female matrix dates to around 7,500 BC. Women had a place of honour as much in the profane as in the religious world, centred around the worship of the Mother Goddess. Sexuality was experienced with great freedom, without shame and guilt and with the awareness of its positive influence on the individual and social physical, emotional and spiritual well-being. All ancient cultures have traditions that praise the power of women as initiators – Egypt, Greece, Arabia, Tibet, and China. The woman was considered the embodiment of beauty, sensuality, and vitality as well as the guardian of the potential creator.
                <strong>
                 In Tantrism woman represents the energy of transformation, change, evolution. Men represent pure consciousness.
                </strong>
                The formidable power of women as initiators is enormous and lies primarily in her attitude to sexuality, which she considers only in the spiritual sense.
                <strong>
                 Tantra is the cult of femininity, the worship of the Goddess and women.
                </strong>
                Its origins are lost in the night of time. Tantra is the development of sensitivity, the experience of loving intensely, without fear of loss, completely fused with the beloved. It is the ability to transcend the superficial and the apparent aspects of reality, as the tantric way is never about collecting superficial love relationships.
               </p>
               <p>
                ..In the Tantric vision, the entire physical and mental universe is perceived as being like a fabric in which the single parts are united in a whole, and in which the whole is reflected in its single parts. In Tantra Yoga, sexual energy is discovered, transmutated and sublimated to allow the individual to reach high states of consciousness leading to perfect communion with the Universal Consciousness. ..
               </p>
               <p>
                ..In Tantra women are considered sacred and adored as such: they are the expression of the Divine on Earth. Knowing certain secrets of their own nature makes each woman irresistibly attractive: beyond her physical appearance she emanates joy, vitality, and sensuality.

                all this is anathema to keepers of the Shaiva Tantra tradition of the foothills of the Kanchenjunga, where a man who raises his voice in disrespect of any woman is required to undertake a day-long fast in reparation, and the house in which a woman resides is considered worthy of the same honour as any temple.

An offending woman should not be beaten even with flowers.  A woman of any age, even a girl, or even an uncouth woman, should be bidden a respectful farewell after salutation. (Chapter X)

                 <p>
                  The Vajrayana school of Buddhism is one of the latest to evolve within the various Buddhist schools of thought.
Founded in the late the 8th century by a figurehead named Padmasambhava, this sect involves practices of Tantra that bear a great similarity to the Tantric practices found in Hinduism. While Tantra has developed a modern-day reputation for being merely sordid sexual practices, there is a vast array of practices that largely fall under two main categories: the right-handed path (dakṣiṇāmārga) and the left-handed path (vāmāmārga). The right-handed path generally follows a method of substitution and visualization for some of the more esoteric and radical practices of Tantra, including meat eating, consuming alcohol and sexual union. However, the left-handed path tends to engage in these practices viscerally and literally, and often within the relationship between a teacher and a guru (Young web).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As a means of self-realization, the practices of Tantra within Vajrayana Buddhism are generally taught by a qualified teacher to interested students. However, because these practices often involve sensitive activities that take place between the guru and student, the question of appropriateness and respect within these sacred dynamics is a critical one to ask. In the case of Yeshe Tsogyal, female student of Padmasambhava, we find tales of abuse, rape, an arranged marriage, and even an arranged relationship to her guru, Padmasambhava....
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The popularity of Eastern practices, such as yoga and Buddhism (both of which include methods of Tantra), has skyrocketed in recent years and was fueled by the arrival of a few key teachers of various Eastern lineages to Western shores.
                  <strong>
                   One notable teacher of Vajrayana Buddhism escaped the horror of Tibet to arrive on Western shores in the 1960’s. Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche is probably the most notorious of Buddhist teachers and his movement and school in Boulder (Naropa University) can arguably be seen as the foundation of Buddhism on American soil

                    Yes. I'm glad I heard about a Tantra tradition that seems to be still rooted in the initial Hindu tradition, and really appreciates women.

            The pleasure derived from torture reminds me of what Anneke Lucas, a survivor of elite child rape in Belgium (the Dutroux circle, but she was an earlier victim) said in a video - these people are addicted. They cannot live without raping and torturing children or adults anymore.
           </p>
           <p>
            And we know that men who started with average hardcore porn featuring adult women drifted more and more into a dark world of violent porn, and then child porn.

             Research shows that watching porn makes men more accepting of rape. Also, virtually all pornography websites have child pornography as well as tons of rape videos. Even the stuff that appears consensual. Many pornography actresses speak of violence, threats, coercion, and rape on set.

              Yes, that can be easily seen on submissions which cover rape, they get spammed with comments like "she deserved it" "she was asking for it." etc:

             I do remember her speaking about it. And if you can generate terror in an adult ... imagine what you can do to a child. I think there was another case recently. Something about a woman's boyfriend wearing a mask and abusing ... was it a two-year-old? Let me see if I can find it. Yup! Here it is. And note the opening in the video ... this is not the first time the suspect has been accused of this:

              ESCAMBIA COUNTY, Fla. – “It’s the thing nightmares are made of and no child should ever be subjected to this.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Those were the words of Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan as he described the way 37-year-old Andrew Ross Celaius would allegedly torture his girlfriend’s 2-year-old daughter after she fell asleep.
             </p>
             <p>
              Morgan said video evidence from surveillance equipment found inside the home, as well as Celaius’ cellphone, shows him burning the girl with a blowtorch, shocking her with a dog collar and throwing a full water bottle at her as she slept.

             <p>
              “The level of terror that this child was put through, our abuser would wear a mask, a werewolf mask and the collar that the chief described is a tasing collar for dogs,” Morgan said. “If you want to think of something you could do to a child to terrorize her, this child lived through that.”
             </p>
             <p>
              The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office opened an investigation after Celaius’ girlfriend brought her daughter to the hospital for treatment of what she thought was ringworm.
             </p>
             <p>
              “When she took the child to the ER, the ER physicians who are well versed in spotting child abuse quickly determined that that was not any form of ringworm, it was abuse,” Morgan said. “In this case it was burn marks.”
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             There's no reason for this other than to terrorize. None. These people are so sick that we can't even fathom the depths of depravity. It's why the dismissals of this as a conspiracy theory are laughable. Here it is. Here's a case where someone did exactly what pizzagate has claimed.

            Hard to imagine that millennia of forgotten pagan religions are still being practiced in one form or another.  Nice work on putting all of this together.

            I read something the other day which said Raniere was rendered impotent from herpes, I think.  That must have been one scorching case!  This is why most of the sexual interactions seem to be oral sex only.

            All that said, there are some people who derive serious pleasure out of torturing people.  The more innocent, the better the gratification.

             It is. But the current Ecosexuals seem to be aligned with that bunch of crazies.

             As for the torture, you are correct. When I watched the Bundy tapes, it's what he was about. Torture. Yeah, there was sex thrown in, but it was the torture because you can find lots of people that are into bondage/domination games. But you can't find too many who will agree to take it to the level of death .... so he could have had sex, but he would have had to stop and not receive the gratification derived from torture.
            </p>
            <p>
             And when I started investigating this, some of the stuff is just wild ... shocking ... but there is one thing I uncovered that will put a whole new slant on a pretty famous event we all know.

                 Yes, and that was the only thing that I did not like about the Ted Bundy Tapes .... besides they didn't tell the entire truth ... and that was not broadcasting exactly what he said about pornography. I distinctly remember he said his grandfather had introduced him to violence pornography at a very young age and that it adversely affected him. He said it absolutely influenced him. Now I also think he was sexually molested, but he never admitted to that. But the media is complicit in not getting this out there. They didn't in the case of Elizaeth Smart either. She railed against pornography and point black said that the monster who kidnapped her used to watch pornography for ideas on what to do and to have her copy what was done.

                 Pornography is smut. That's why they call it smut. It has nothing to do with love. It has to do with sex and the two are not necessarily the same.

                  Pornography in and of itself, isn't terribly harmful on a normally adjusted human.  Porn, especially at its extreme, is incredibly damaging on susceptible individuals - victims; SSRI consumers; sadists; etc.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Porn is generally not considered art, FWIW.  It takes creativity and ingenuity to arouse the darkest of souls.

                   But it does have an addictive quality that is not spoken about. Heightening expectations through the release of adrenaline overstimulates, and like is said, the newer higher level demands it be met. But, no, not with everyone.

                  Elizabeth Smart was hidden away and raped alright.  But it wasn't the two sent to prison.  They released the woman but I believe the man is in solitary.  Can't talk to anyone for a reason.  Her husband is a Freemason from Scotland and he wears a kilt

                Ecosexuals Believe Having Sex with the Earth Could Save It
From skinny dippers to people who have actual intercourse with nature, ecosexuality is a growing movement taking a new approach to combatting climate change.
               </p>
               <p>
                Amanda Morgan, a faculty member at the UNLV School of Community Health Sciences who is involved in the ecosexual movement, says that ecosexuality could be measured in a sense not unlike the Kinsey Scale: On one end, it encompasses people who try to use sustainable sex products, or who enjoy skinny dipping and naked hiking. On the other are "people who roll around in the dirt having an orgasm covered in potting soil," she said. "There are people who fuck trees, or masturbate under a waterfall."
               </p>
               <p>
                The movement's growing prominence owes much to the efforts of Bay Area performance artists, activists, and couple Annie Sprinkle and Elizabeth Stephens, who have made ecosexuality a personal crusade. They have published an "ecosex manifesto" on their website SexEcology and produced several films on the theme, including a documentary, Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story, which depicts the "pollen-amorous" relationship between them and the Appalachian Mountains. And while touring a theater piece across the country, Dirty Sexecology: 25 Ways to Make Love to the Earth, they've officiated wedding ceremonies where they and fellow ecosexuals marry the earth, the moon, and other natural entities.

                When my friend told me about fuzzies I was very skeptical, but it actually helped me understand the stickers on the back of vehicles, and the strange interactions with city folk that I have had in the past. He always likes to be at the forefront of the new, trendy, and strange information.

                OMG.  I don't even know what to say.  They have completely flipped.  People have gone nuts over their pets dressing them in Bridal Attire, Trick or Treating them.  The world has gone nuts, but this is really perverted and sick.  They are testing the waters maybe?  People will not be as shocked and sickened when it happens to Children.  How nice.  While people take their Children for a walk in the woods they can get Sex Ed I II and III.   How nice.

                 To think human beings are becoming feral dogs and want to hump trees. Although, I don't even think dogs do that. Think they hump everything they see, but not trees.
