<blockquote>
<p>Gavin Christopher Newsom was born in San Francisco, California, to Tessa Thomas (née Menzies) and William Alfred Newsom III, a retired state appeals court justice and attorney for <strong>Getty Oil</strong>.</p>
<p>Newsom\'s aunt was married to Ron Pelosi, the brother-in-law of former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.</p>
<p>In December 2001, Newsom married Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former San Francisco prosecutor and legal commentator for Court TV, CNN, and MSNBC and later became a prominent personality on Fox News Channel. The couple married at Saint Ignatius Catholic Church on the campus of the University of San Francisco, where Guilfoyle attended law school. The couple appeared in the September 2004 issue of Harper\'s Bazaar, a fashion magazine, in a spread of them at the <strong>Getty Villa</strong> with the title the &quot;New Kennedys.&quot;[4][93] In January 2005, they jointly filed for divorce, citing &quot;difficulties due to their careers on opposite coasts.&quot;</p>

<p>The end of the Peter-Jacqui Getty marriage looks like a fine mess, a reminder of the truth in the old cliché access to fortune and fame is not the same thing as access to a happy and fulfilled life. That said, a nice chunk of his parent\'s money would certainly help Peter Getty preserve some of his dignity by bringing the divorce proceedings to a swift end, assuming Jacqui Getty is in the market for a nice settlement as we suspect. And, who knows, maybe his parents will leave Peter Getty with enough spare cash to follow in the footsteps of <strong>his old buddy Gavin Newsom</strong>, the San Francisco mayor and prospective lieutenant governor, and get some rehab for his alleged addictions — and his image...</p>

<p>Gavin Newsom isn\'t someone that I haven\'t seen mentioned. He was the Mayor of San Francisco and is the Lieutenant Governor of California. Does he directly tie to pizzagate? Not as yet, but there are all these little hints that he\'s part of this cabal. Like the donation from JA.</p>
<p>&quot;On his way out of office due to term limits, Brown anointed Gavin Newsom as his heir apparent. When Newsom’s campaign was faltering in the face of the remarkable grassroots surge for Matt Gonzalez, Brown called a meeting of African-American pastors where he called Gonzalez “a racist.” But he knew that race was not the issue.&quot;</p>

<p>This woman has ties everywhere. Here is her Instagram again. Just look at who all she is pictured with. Obama, Corey Booker, Gavin Newsom, Willie Brown, Bill de Blasio, Al Gore.</p>
<p>I found all kinds of news articles on her. She had a foundation named Chez Panisse Foundation but a scandal called the Chez sludge involving Gavin Newsom brought her to change the name. It is now named The Edible Schoolyard Project. James Alefantis sits on the board. The SF chapter of TESP is operated through the Boys and Girls Club.</p>
<p>She knows HRC really well. Her daughters godmother is Susie Tompkins Buell. Susie\'s husband is board chairman of Chez.</p>

            All these shooting events are staged hoaxes and I don't suspect any were even false flags. This goes back to Sandy Hook and possibly even Columbine. They even made domestic propaganda legal back in 2012 by repealing the Smith-Mundt act. So it is not even illegal to lie to us in the "news" anymore, and being that it is propaganda, they don't need to disclose that it is propaganda.  All media is run by CIA, they are even in the NFL. It is after all televised.

            As usual, you have done everyone's work for them. The only thing I can add is that there was a similar program to the Chavez incident (probably caused the flesh eating bacteria on lettuce and other crops in the marketplace at the time) in Sarasota County, Florida. They called it affluent waste, farmers were encouraged to spray this on fields, and there were brown rings on the trees after floods. They said it was treated. Sure I have said this before but,  Panisse is a culinary specialty from a region in northern Italy, but it is equally known and appreciated in south-eastern France. It is made from a base of chickpeas which are fried or baked. Slang for we cook small children.

            . Newsom is a former mayor of San Francisco. Apparently he and Alice Waters were involved in spreading toxic sewage to gardeners in San Francisco. It was known as the Chez Sludge Scandal.

            Two names should be added: Diane Feinstein and her husband Richard C. Blum. Blum has been involved with Nepal for years (a back door to China) and set up AMERICAN HIMALAYAN FOUNDATION (501c3) which has educational programs to help keep girls from being trafficked. This region still has a high trafficking rate.

            "As part of the Global Poverty and Practice Lecture Series, the Blum Center for Developing Economies was delighted to host Erica Stone, President of the American Himalayan Foundation, who shared her experience as a leader of a major non-profit organization in a presentation entitled, “Do Good, Be Kind, Have Fun: What it’s like to Run an NGO and What it Takes to Create Positive Change.” Stone, also a 5th degree black belt, a former chef at Chez Panisse, and a UC Berkeley graduate, began by explaining the inherent complexity of running an NGO."

            FEINSTEIN'S CHINESE SPY EMPLOYEE Russell Lowe
           </p>
           <p>
            "We do have a presumed identity. The Daily Caller discovered that a Feinstein staffer named Russell Lowe, listed on the senator’s payroll as an “office director” as of 2013 before he was let go, matches the description of the Chinese asset.
           </p>
           <p>
            It appears Lowe continues to operate freely in the United States. A year after he was removed from Feinstein’s staff, Lowe spoke at a conference on Chinese investment in California. In October 2017 he visited a South Korean publication’s office with former Rep. Mike Honda (D-CA), indicating he still had access to political figures."

            Interestingly, Kimberly Guilfoyle is now dating Don Trump Jr.!!! Much older than he is and odd to say the least. The Getty families on the other hand are all beyond messed up, especially the under 35ish dependents. Pia Getty who is now divorced has some fucked up kids who refer to citizens as “vermin”. How lovely.

            The local ecosystem there is chapparel (think Mediterranian climate). Fire is a regulatory factor in such ecosystems. Said information is most certainly being used as part of the cover up regarding the current fires there. They are most certainly DEW.

               I'll take "Who are the Pilgrim Society?" for 100.

               "In the late 1800’s, the Illuminati began to reconfigure its outward face. The higher levels started creating innocent sounding cover organizations to hide their meetings behind. In 1901, the Astors contributed toward the creation of the Pilgrim Society, which was the cover organization for American &amp; British 6° Princes of the Illuminati. I believe at least five Astors are now members of the Pilgrim Society. The Pilgrims had recently included David Astor, John Jacob Astor 8th, and William Waldorf Astor 3rd. And during the 1970s, Baron Astor of Hever was the President of the London branch of the Pilgrims. This implies that Astor of Hever was at least the next level up in the chain of command. The Astors also have been very prominent in the Group’ which is Britian’s equivalent to the Skull &amp; Bones Society in Britain, the Astor, along with about 20 other families dominate the Group, just as certain families like the Whitneys in the U.S. help dominate the Order of Skull &amp; Bones. Again, as was earlier pointed out, the key to understanding Satanism is the bloodlines."

              Career[edit] Prior to founding Endeavor, Emanuel was a partner at InterTalent and senior agent at ICM Partners (ICM).[6] He began his entertainment industry career as an agent trainee at Creative Artists Agency (CAA).
             </p>
             <p>
              Emanuel has hosted fundraisers for the Democratic Party.[18]
             </p>
             <p>
              Controversy[edit] An April 2002 lawsuit by agent Sandra Epstein against Endeavor Agency brought forth accusations by Epstein and other Endeavor employees against Emanuel.[19] In the court filings, Emanuel is alleged to have allowed a friend to operate a pornographic website out of Endeavor's offices.
             </p>
             <p>
              Art philanthropy[edit] Emanuel has in the past been active on the board of trustees of P.S. Arts, a Los Angeles, California-based nonprofit organization that works to bring art education programs to Southern California schools. He has also helped the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, establish MOCAtv, a dedicated YouTube art channel. In 2012, he joined the museum's board.[

             <p>
              "That there’s a powerful homosexual clique in the entertainment industry is no secret. Perhaps the most infamous “outing” of Hollywood’s Gay Mafia was that by former Hollywood powerhouse Michael Ovitz, “the man who once was king.” In 2002, in a series of interviews with Vanity Fair magazine’s Bryan Burrough, Ovitz blamed his downfall on the vicious backstabbing by Hollywood’s Gay Mafia.
             </p>
             <p>
              Note: Ovitz is a Hollywood talent agent who co-founded Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 1975 and served as its chairman until 1995, after which he briefly was president of the Walt Disney Company from October 1995 to January 1997.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to Burrough, a “driving factor” in Ovitz’s decision to do the Vanity Fair interviews was his “burning need to name names, to throw light on the shadowy Hollywood cabal he believes did him in. He calls it the Gay Mafia, though several of its ‘members’ aren’t gay, and much of what he says about these men is nasty and unprintable. In Ovitz’s eyes the cabal’s demagogic leader . . . is [David] Geffen, laying waste to all Ovitz held dear, spreading rumors about his family, at the same time he was poisoning the business deals that would have saved AMG [Artists Management Group]—all things Geffen denies.” Geffen’s partners in crime, Ovitz alleges, include former Disney C.E.O. Michael Eisner, the New York Times, and Ovitz’s onetime protégés at the Creative Artists Agency, Bryan Lourd, Kevin Huvane, and Richard Lovett."
