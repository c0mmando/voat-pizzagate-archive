<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Been following this pizzagate thing since the jump. Never bothered to make an account here, but I\'ve recently come across some very disturbing information that I don\'t know what to do with.</p>
<p>A while back, poking around the internet, I kept coming across comments/rumors about a certain production company in the southwest of America that was said to produce child snuff pornography. What was baffling to me is that there were people naming names, yet it still seemed to be a sort of urban legend. I made a post about it on another form. I got a few private replies from people saying it was true, but without saying much more than that. One person told me they\'d tell me their personal story about it, but never did.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, this person sent me a video they made, detailing their personal experience with this company/people involved with this operation. I just watched it. I don\'t know what to do, because it sounds like this person\'s life is in danger. I want to help this person get their story out, but I don\'t want to further endanger them.</p>
<p>It doesn\'t sound like the police can be trusted. From some cursory research, it\'s more than likely they\'re complicit. This person says that they\'ve reached out to every governmental agency in the state they can think of, and nothing has been done. All of us on here know the people involved in these things reach high-levels, and I\'m personally distrustful of just about every governmental organization when child-abuse is involved. We know that CP didn\'t become a billion-dollar industry from broke bois are purchasing the videos.</p>
<p>So, I\'m in a bit of a bind. This is one of those things where I feel like I\'m complicit in allowing evil to flourish/exist if I don\'t try to do something, but I also don\'t know what to do. Does anyone know of a trust-worthy organization that I can reach out to or put this person in touch with? Was thinking about e-mailing Timothy Holmseth and seeing if he could do something, as he\'s been pretty fearless in putting pedos on blast. We\'re talking about hardcore criminals that have the Hells Angels on their bankroll here, so I want to approach this with the upmost caution.</p>
<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated. (also trying to be vague here as I know pedos lurk this board, and I don\'t know who knows, etc.)</p>',

            I hope u made sure the person who sent u the video was well aware of your intentions and possible exposure. Yes, it is true the Hells Angels are paid to protect these people with money in all parts of the world (look at Amsterdam and even Thailand). They know what’s going on but turn a blind eye, they just don’t care, they’re ruthless pieces of shit. Why not email the crazydaysandnights blogger lawyer about it as they may have additional knowledge.

            Make sure there's a back up copy. You might try contacting Judicial Watch or Project Veritas or both to ask for help. I dont know the people at these places, but I cant recommend Wikileaks because it might be compromised.

             Those are actually two organizations that get shit done, and are very trustworthy.  And you're right, WikiLeaks appears to be compromised, that could be a huge trap so avoid it until we can sort out that it's trustworthy.

             This is someone who has encountered/been involved with one of the people involved in this organization, and has witnessed this person in possession of children who have since disappeared, and has subsequently been gang-stalked and had their life threatened.
            </p>
            <p>
             Police are part of it, by all accounts, including the person that of the person contacted me. What do you do in that situation? I feel helpless.

              Others have handled it by getting as much proof published in as many places online as possible -- if the information is already out, there is less to gain by killing the person who holds it and risking further exposure from a murder investigation.

              We'll go ahead and leave this up. However, I would recommend you do a fresh post that is more organized, with as much information as possible in the title and body of the post, simply because our search engine only crawls the title and body text of the post, not the comments. This post will become virtually impossible for people to find again as time goes by because none of the key words are in searchable places.

            There was a discussion about such a group in AZ.  This was several years ago.  Allegedly Henderschott (sp?) of the Maricopa county sheriffs office was involved.  They would film at a house in Glendale.

              Sheriff Joe Arpaio.  He headed the "cold crimes division" which pretty much proved Hessein's birth certificate was 100% a forgery.  You can trust him.

              I know SV pretty well.  It wouldn't surprise me that a ring was operating there.  Nearly wide open border. Lots of mules operating there. Minimal police and border agents other than the one control point leaving out on Highway 90.

             I want to post the video, but I don't want to endanger this person. They were very naive to post what they posted in a public way. Luckily no one has seen it and I've advised them to take it down. It's just someone telling their personal experience with someone involved with Midnight Productions in AZ that they became associated with. I don't think there's been this incriminating of a story posted about MP before, and taken together with the rumors that already exist about them online, this should definitely cause further investigation to be undertaken on a group who (as of now) have only been mentioned through anonymous comments online. Autists could figure out who the person involved with MP is based on the info provided, but it works both ways....the MP person being talked about would know immediately who the person that made the video is, despite their (weak) attempts to disguise their identity.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd like this person to get to a safer location and then maybe I can post the video with their permission.

             Down in comments on the wordpress one I noticed Tom Dizdul, who lived in Ca. Glendale, and is currently in Phoenix? Then this ,5 tries at boat smuggling in week - Orange County Register
Jackie Dizdul, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection in San Diego, said there are a number of possible reasons why smuggling of people and contraband - most often marijuana - is on ...
Search domain www.ocregister.com/2010/04/16/5-tries-at-boat-smuggling-in-w...https://www.ocregister.com/2010/04/16/5-tries-at-boat-smuggling-in-w...    Now is this person whoobviously worked for the government in 2009 the same as, FTC Alleges Illegal Internet Sales of Contact Lenses ...
A company and its owner selling contact lenses directly to consumers via three Web sites are settling Federal Trade Commission charges they violated federal law by failing to verify consumers' prescriptions as required by the Commission's Contact Lens Rule. I am really surprised that both similar names are in positions that have to do with trade in the Obama administration. One busting rival gang members, and the other rival '?' members. Also curious is how little is on the internet about this official spokesperson. Small family also keeps off the radar. John Dizdul is 64 years old and was born on 12/13/1953. Currently, he lives in Morrisville, PA; and previously lived in Washington, DC, West Nyack, NY and Washington, DC. Sometimes John goes by various nicknames including John E Dizdul. His ethnicity is Caucasian, and religious views are listed as Wiccan/Pagan/Druid. John is now widowed, and also has 8 children. Other family members and associates include Jason Dizdul and Diane Dizdul. He has a reported annual income of under $10k and a current net worth value of less than $1.  Not saying any of this is accurate, but all the very small group of family members seem to have lived in the same places. DC and surrounding driving distance being a start for a political agenda.

            <p>
             First u have to get out of the game ...
Set ur status right so that state authorities and courts cant touch u...with their billion or more statututes...
            </p>
            <p>
             For that u should be willing to give up a few dollars at the debt reduction department of the US treasury..
I have emailed them ...they accept anyones currency...
Before u do that u should confirm with them that they will accept ur dollars in exchange for acknowledging ur surety rights over the US treasury...
Ie ..the US becomes ur debtor in direct..
When they reply in the positive, which they will...u then confirm the consequences of surety rights...ie ..that they will discharge any charges in ur name ...
...and then adter they confirm that in the pisitive ...u will know they cannot charge u in courts..
The lien in ur name is lifted since u no longer are olaying the debt game..
U can then instruct the US to privide protection to u...as well charge any official for derliction of duty ..with liens attached to their personal priperty ie ...each individual office holder cannot plead immunity of office anymore...they will be charged to the US treasury debt reduction department ...
U see ur name is like a game token...it is a contract with the US to take care of u...ie the US is binded to u at berth...u then take that valuable commodity and lend it to the debt game and banking ssytem..
There is the other game without debt ..where when u directly deal with ur own treasury ..they will have to stand by the contract created by the berth title...ie ur name..
            </p>
            <p>
             If u cant email the US treasury debt reduction department ..andcant spare a few dollars after them confirming they will back u up..as ur debttor....
Then u r wasting ur time i side the debt game...because as u have noticed they co trol it ...they control it becuase they can charge u with any one of the billion statutes..
Constitutor means someone who shifts debt into a third party
..ie the constitution and its statutes are a means for them to shift ie delegate thier debt onto u, the surety to the debt game...
            </p>
            <p>
             To get out of the debt game ..u have to agree to reduce debt ...ur status changes overnight from the debt game to the peace side...
            </p>
            <p>
             ..i hope u understand what is the only safe avenue for u...
U will have  trust and authority handed to u in wrriting.from.the US tresury..
Instead if relying on unkown actors who r powerless themselves...
Do u want to control the US ..and shift the ibligation to protect u...
U will be able to walk around with a machine gun to protect urslef..bit more so u will have the backing of the US military ...
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the only remedy goven toneveryone.on this planet with a birth certificate..
            </p>
            <p>
             The emails.will.take less than ten minutes to write up..the response will be immediate...and in the positive..i assure.u..
U can post the exchange of email with the US treasury here in this forum...
It has already been done form various corners of this planet...
            </p>
            <p>
             I assure u this is ur only confirmed remedy...
            </p>
            <p>
             I would recommend forming a.group..but its not.necessary...but it helps ur anxiety about going into the unkown...
We fear ...becuase we r in ignorance of the remedy given to us..
The US is us..
Trust me ..
I will guide u what to write to the debt reduction department ..PM me or be open on this forum with the pedovores watching ...i dont mind ...
Even the remedy isnoffered to them...but they will be trapped because they will have to be in the open as tonall their actions...no privacy...
Even though they exercise their remedy they will be under common law ...so the US can bring direct action against them...eventhough they r US sureties..ie military tribunal for taking life..
They r trapped..there only safe place is the debt game...but with good people realsiing how to control the US treadury from outside the debt game ..and funding it by bringing charges against corrupt practises ...the debt game becomes a liability for these pedovores..
            </p>
            <p>
             ..u and i are in totla co trol of the game..the US treasury are jsut our book keepers...we just lend our control to a debt game..we set up a debt game so the US set up a book keeper called the Fed and its banking franchises for that debt game..
..
The police , fbi , etc are merely slave accountants for that debt game..outside of it they do not have jurisdiction..
