            I have heard that again and again, and although there is logic in there, the thing is that the name has stuck - and will stick. As long as we point to good websites, this should work, don't you think?

            It has already reached a thousand times more people than were aware of this problem only 6 months ago. It is working, now it's time for Trump to put up or shut up. He must allow law enforcement to investigate this, then mainstream media will be unable to ignore it. But of course the powers that be will try to limit the damage. This is a long term investigation that has to keep the heat on from now on.

            Most normal reporters are not ever going to touch it because:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Their are young and still paying off student loans. They can't risk losing their jobs.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              They have been conditioned to be very pro-gay and many extremely powerful gay men are involved in this. (Not being anti-gay, just speaking truth to power on the facts.) They are afraid if they report on this they'll come off looking like homophobes.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Their editors will not ever, in a million years, allow them to write these stories.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Lots of these young reporters, like at Politico and such like, are extremely liberal. They are also gullible to the rumors that Pizzagate is some kind of Conservative hit job. So they won't touch it even if their editors would allow it.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>

             I politely disagree, because even though your points are plausible, we are giving those journalists at least the chance to think things over, to contact other journalists, to think about the best way to approach this whole thing. We have to try.

              Forgive me for being a fatalist. I've seen reporters cover up so much and refuse to touch honest stories that I'm jaded.

            Everybody should network and create their own cells of operation to inform people. Don't rely on anybody else to create change, especially not as we all recently learned HOW DEEP the media is corrupted.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm heavily networking for the last month since decentralisation is the only option we have that isnt easily corruptable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Additionally we are currently in the works of building up a a new platform for indipendent journalistic work, problem is we are getting heavily censored everywhere where we try to raise funds, even here. Reasoning here was "we are not allowing any fundraisers"... yeah what. Feel free to read about it, I can't link to it directly here.

            My suspicion is, that the more prominent people on the project are flagged as thoughtleaders and have eyes on them, which would confirm what we know from insiders how Correct the Record works. We will release before inauguration day though anyway.

             Decentralisation is really key! Thank you for the link. Keep up the good word. Informing prominent people now may not result in immediate action or success, but if can give them time to think about how to approach this ...

             In past scandals and investigations there were always a few who seemed to get it out there. Eventually shot down or dead by now or switched careers but probably some still living who could be helpful.

             That's true, of course, but it can't hurt, can it???? As outlined, you can inform them anonymously. And if you provide them with a good link, like here on voat, they can - maybe for the first time! - see how seriously people are working here.

             Looks like I am good at many things other people aren't :-) but this meme thing is beyond my grasp. I now know how to create one, but I cannot for the life of me come up with an idea on how to meme my post. Guess someone will have to do this ...

            This is good stuff.  We have just under 3 weeks until the whistleblowing climate changes for the better.  I say compile all the data and hit send on Jan. 20.  Nothing will be done until then.

             I really like the idea of coordinated "attacks" of information. Also I think Jan is still Human Trafficking month? We are just helping increase awareness and who could argue with that?
