<p>Coincidentally, a few hours ago I decided to go check up on the possible connections between Charlie Hebdo, the newspaper that got attacked by ISIS in Paris, and pedophilia. It turns out they had published a few cartoons about the Catholic church, nothing surprising about that.</p>
<p>But more importantly, one of their columnists back in 1977 publicized a trial of three public figures who were accused of having sex with minors aged 13 to 14.</p>

<p>I\'ll translate into English, so you get an idea of what\'s going on in here:</p>
<p>&quot;If you love the small girls and the small boys when they still have their backpacks on their backs, if you follow them on the street, if they look at you and wait for you at the bus stop, if they come to sit right in front of you, if they rub on your knees inadvertently without excusing themselves, if you talk to them, if they come in your room, if you discover the heavens of tender cookings without hair, their dismay and yours when they tell you &quot;you&quot; and you\'re their trusting friend, their complete friend, if you go together in the woods, in the clearing, behind closed shutters where the light filters through, if you photograph them to prolong life, to make it permanent, because she escapes and she\'s too short and you\'re too in love, go defend Bernard Dejager, Jean-Claude Gallien and Jean Burckardt, in prison for three years, taken to Assises de Versailles court the 27th, 28th and 29th January at 1 p.m. and risking five to ten years of reclusion for loving children.&quot;
Victoria Thérame</p>
<p>Disturbing is an understatement.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, this highly publicized trial went on to spawn a petition against age of consent laws, signed by various influential figures in the media, philosophy and letters.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_petition_against_age_of_consent_laws">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_petition_against_age_of_consent_laws</a></p>
<p>&quot;Michel Foucault stated that the petition was signed by himself, Nobel Prize laureate Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and André Glucksmann, Roland Barthes, by the novelist/gay activist Guy Hocquenghem, the actor/play-writer/jurist Jean Danet, writer and filmmaker Alain Robbe-Grillet, writer Philippe Sollers, pediatrician and child psychoanalyst Françoise Dolto and also by people belonging to a wide range of political positions.&quot;</p>
<p>So there you have it, this is the connection to existentialism, there is a subculture of these people infiltrated in the highest ranks of academia, the military, government, etc who are intent on giving &quot;ethical&quot; legitimacy to their sickness, their sexualization and abuse of defenseless little kids.</p>
