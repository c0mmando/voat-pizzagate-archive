            Great job finding an archive of the guy's bio page and posting it,

            . Perhaps others can cross-reference it to other pedos in some of those organizations where he held a position.

            Also, to make this not come through as a wall of text that's hard to read,
            <em>
             you have to hit "enter" twice
            </em>
            . You can use the "Preview" button right below the text entry field to take a peek at how it will look on Voat before you post it, too.
