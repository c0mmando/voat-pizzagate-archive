<p>This is another update of the story of Gemmel Moore, a young sex worker who was found dead at Ed Buck\'s home. It was initially ruled a suicide, but as you probably all know, at the mother\'s insistence, the LA Sheriff\'s department has reopened the Gemmel Moore case based on new evidence. Here\'s the link that corroborates that. </p>

<p>“It was like a little porno place,” he continues. “A little place. A movie little porno place and he walked up and you know he’s checking and he’s looking.  Checked me out. Got in his car. ...  I didn’t know his name was Ed Buck. I didn’t know that was him.”</p>
<p>Blake who is 30-years-old, says that on his first meeting with the wealthy LA Democratic donor they sat in his car negotiating. He says that Buck asked him if he did crystal meth and was interested in “PnP.”</p>
<p>“PnP” is short for Party n’ Play among gay men. “Party” refers to drug use- most often meth and “Play” refers to sex. </p>

              Nobody has publicly identified more pedo fronts (locations and codewords) than me.  The fact that I cuss and believe it's more intuitive that an ETHNIC rather than purely OCCULT group would seize political power through blackmail to ensure its survival in no way indicates I'm a shill.  That is pure intellectual vanity on your part:

              <li>
               Dismisses possibilities a priori, which is bad form

              <li>
               Ignores brainwashing from educational system and popular culture to which we are ALL exposed (even I was very pro-israel until PG and my first 2 months of posts are about Arabia, Catholics in Latin America, random shit like that)
              </li>
              <li>
               Holier-than-thou attitude which helps nothing

              <li>
               Ignores biology (women are provably more empathetic than men and thus hesitant to single out a group for blame no matter the evidence -- I'll admit to poorer communication skills for the same reason but I will never accept that emotion is equally important as logic i.e. occam's razor.

             Yeah, right? Where did Podesta have a place in California? Wasn't it near the cannibalistic Donner Trail? They'd have had to have contact. Maybe it'd be good to do an event search. If not Podesta, Alefantis.

             On Nov. 18, 1978 in Jonestown in Guyana, a city he started and was named after him, the “Rev.” Jim Jones induced 912 of his followers to “drink the Kool-Aid” spiked with Valium and cyanide, which is where we get that phrase. (Some accounts say it really was Flavor-Aid; other accounts say both drinks were used.)

This group controlled the Bay Area and demanded unwavering loyalty from anyone who sought political office. George Moscone, Willie Brown, Diane Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi were some of the leaders of this group. Pelosi had become the state Democratic Party chairman for northern California came from the city of San Francisco.

             Amazing how the dems can rewrite history. Their connection to Jim Jones and that whole cult is essential to understanding what's happening now. Somebody needs to dig, dig, dig on Jim Jones and Jerry Brown's/Pelosi's intimate ties with that madmen. The same tactics of rousing people to behave like mindless zombies are at work now. I'm praying Assange delivers the goods. If the leaders of this cult are arrested, it'll go a long way in destroying. crushing, and #drainingthe swamp!

            Here's a West Hollywood (WEHO) Times article with comments about Buck by local politicians as well as a sex worker called "Damar Love" who provides pictures he says he took during an encounter with Buck:
            <a href="http://www.wehotimes.com/allegations-death-sex-worker-plaque-influential-west-hollywood-political-insider/">
             http://www.wehotimes.com/allegations-death-sex-worker-plaque-influential-west-hollywood-political-insider/
            </a>
            Edit:  Openly gay former West Hollywood Mayor Steve Martin is interviewed and seems to know Buck well.  From the article:  "If there was ever anybody in West Hollywood whose bed you expected a dead body to turn up in, it was Ed Buck.”
           </p>
           <p>
            I can't help but wonder whether ex-Mayor Steve Martin is the same "Steve" identified by "Blake" in the link provided above by quantokitty
            <a href="http://www.jasmyneacannick.com/after-gemmel-moores-death-new-victim-comes-forward-and-recounts-ed-bucks-gates-of-hell/">
             http://www.jasmyneacannick.com/after-gemmel-moores-death-new-victim-comes-forward-and-recounts-ed-bucks-gates-of-hell/
            </a>
            From this link:  "Blake talked about Buck’s friend Steve who lives in the same apartment building.  'That’s his [Buck’s] buddy.  Every time there’s an issue or a problem with the cops he always running to Steve.' ”
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not find evidence that the ex-mayor ever lived in the same building as Buck, but the fact that the Steve referred to by Blake apparently had influence with the local cops does make you wonder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit:  Here’s a data point that ties the Steve named by Blake as Buck’s neighbor a bit more closely to the ex-mayor:  The ex-mayor was working to preserve a 1915 era home located just one block away and across the street from Buck’s residence on N. Laurel Avenue in West Hollywood and have it designated as a cultural landmark.  He would likely have been there frequently.
           </p>
           <p>
            From Martin’s website bio:  “After leaving the City Council Steve was drafted into the efforts to “Save Tara”, a cultural landmark on Laurel Avenue.”
            <a href="http://www.stevemartinweho.org/bio.html">
             http://www.stevemartinweho.org/bio.html
            </a>
            The address of the Tara building is 1343 N. Laurel Ave.  Buck lived at 1234 N. Laurel Ave.  This WEHOville article gives Buck’s address and unusual life history--also, by the way, mentions Voat and Pizzagate:

             Amazing work. When I re-read the link, yes, it does fit that Buck would run to Steve to run interference with the cops. And maybe he didn't live there. Maybe he kept a crashpad there so they could party. Martin does try to be distancing himself from this. Talking about Buck's erratic personality disorder. If he's the "Steve" mentioned, he has a pretty huge personality disorder himself!

              Thanks, Q.  You've been doing great work on this, as you always do.  I too thought Martin went overboard on the distancing of himself from Buck.  If he actually was found to be Buck's "fixer," I imagine he'd be looking at some kind of obstruction of justice charge at least--if the local authorities weren't compromised--so that's a big if.  I wondered the same thing about a crash pad.  The meth epidemic is a mystery.

               It talks about Twin plagues: Meth rises in shadow of opioids. OPIOIDS? Oh, dear Lord, I found so much on the epidemic of opioid addiction. It was linked to the dems and I never got around to writing the post. I don't know what I did with those links, but I hope I can find them.

               Definitely, this was planned out and is well-financed. As for Gemmel, I fought for his story. I knew it was big and that if followed would lead to that scummy underbelly of pizzagate.

                Quanto, yes, I believe it is planned out, and this could be a big reason why (taken from your aol.com link):
               </p>
               <p>
                "Kristin Korpela, head of the Dunn County Department of Human Services, recalled having one of her social workers visit a young mother in jail, where she voluntarily gave up her three kids.
               </p>
               <p>
                "Meth," the mom told the social worker, "makes you forget that you ever had children."
               </p>
               <p>
                Next door, in Chippewa County, Human Services Director Larry Winter has seen out-of-home placements for children surge from 28 in 2013 to 103 in just the first five months of 2017. Three-quarters of those placements are related to meth abuse, he said."

                 Super post, factfinder2.  The kids are like low hanging fruit waiting to be picked.  You can bet DCSF is in on this as well as some family judges.  Poor drug-induced parent has a paper shoved in her face to terminate her rights.

                 This is so disturbing. And it looks like disadvantaged families are being affected which hits the entire community and destabilizes it.

                  Great work! They always go to the weak, drug-addled and poor. Those kids are just sitting ducks waiting for all the "love" they will receive from their new foster family.  It's all part of the plan.
