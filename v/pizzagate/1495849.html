<p>First, Queen Victoria School has many reports of sex abuse of students</p>
<p>&quot;Glenn Harrison was a housemaster at Queen Victoria School in Dunblane when he became concerned about a group of powerful individuals having access to his pupils.</p>
<p>He made a report to the old Central Scotland Police but officers responded by breaking down the door to his flat and removing computer discs, papers and other evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His claims centred on a supposed cabal of individuals known as the ‘Friends of QVS’, which was said to include high profile members of Scotland’s political and legal circles.</p>
<p>They apparently enjoyed unfettered access to the school and would often take boys away for the weekend, with the pupils returning “distressed but flush with cash”. &quot;</p>

<p>Dunblane killer connections to this school:</p>
<p>I have been able to independently corroborate 3 of the 4 main allegations made
by the housemaster, namely that:</p>
<p>1/ Thomas Hamilton was a frequent, and influential visitor to QVS.

2/ Numerous complaints about bullying and abuse were made by the
housemaster to various authorities to no avail because of the lack of a thorough
investigation by the authorities.</p>

<p>June 5, 2005, The Daily Telegraph;
&quot;I believe that Hamilton was a major provider of pornographic photographs and videos to a ring of men prominent in Central Scotland, including police officers who protected him from numerous allegations of physical abuse at boys\' camps and clubs he ran. They protected themselves after the massacre which conveniently ended in his suicide.&quot;

<p>&quot;Alan Milburn, a close ally of Tony Blair, also resigned dramatically from the senior benches of the Labour Party government shortly after Scotland Yard’s anti-paedophile investigation was suppressed by the Blair administration, citing the need to “spend more time with my family”. </p>
<p>For some reason, the abduction of Scottish children for the purpose of rape and murder, always closely linked to senior Labour Party political figures, continues unabated. </p>
<p>I can now bring to a close all speculation as to the name of Tony Blair’s most “highly placed and senior politician” who fell not only under the scrutiny of Scotland Yard for crimes against children, but was also identified by the FBI as an active member of the paedophile ring; Gordon Brown &quot;</p>

            Hi guys, this could be an important part of this world wide paedophile ring. Just noticed this sign near my home, with the international paedophiles symbol (like a triangle) YWCA Jesmond House, in Newcastle Upon Tyne, England (Clayton Road, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE2 1UJ ) 
This building is in an affluent part of the city, and is a hostel that caters for vulnerable single people and recently released prisoners. Check out the symbol at the top of their web site
            <a href="http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php">
             http://www.neywca.co.uk/jesmond-house.php
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly this place was opened by H.R.H. Princess Alexandrea on 27 sept 1984.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the sign I seen from the street

            I Pray and Hope someone with more know-how then me be able to dig some more, little children could be at risk now.Thank you. 
I would also like to thank Victurus Libertas VL, for recently making this video about this matter
