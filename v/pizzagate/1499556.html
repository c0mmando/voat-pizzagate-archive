            The motivation is indeed deeply rooted in the esoteric. This is a deep topic and I am writing a well sourced expose right now which reveals the information you seek but it is not yet ready. I will give you an idea however because it is apparent you are seeking truth. And now some history:
           </p>
           <p>
            Lucifer, the angel of knowledge, wisdom and illumination declared that he wanted to rule above God. He convinced 1/3 of the angels to join in his rebellion. They got their butts kicked and were cast down to earth to live out the rest of their days until the end times. Shortly after this God created Adam and Eve in the Garden. The Serpent was not content with his defeat so he convinced man, God's newest creation, to defile himself in the eyes of God. Adam and eve were ejected from the Garden where the Serpent continued to communicate with them and deceive them. In order to further foil the plans for man on this earth by the Lord, Lucifer convinced Cain to kill his brother Abel (it was using jealousy over their sister Luluwa who was betrothed to Abel, not Cain). This was the first murder and Cain had become Lucifers first earthly disciple. After Abels death Cain and Luluwa fled to the west were they were regularly visited by Fallen Angels. These fallen being taught the tribe of Cain Science, Astronomy, Math, Alchemy, Vanity and esoteric knowledge of magic. Furthermore the angels were taken in by the beauty of human women and began to procreate with them creating a hybrid race which is now commonly referred to as Nephilim. The reason for the flood was to wipe out these abominations off the earth. So at this point in time there were essentially two root-bloodlines on the earth: The bloodline of Cain, corrupted by angels and now something other than just 'human' and the bloodline of Adam which was pure. Yet, shortly before the flood Noah took a wife, "Namaah", who was the last female listed in the lineage of Cain. So Namaah had Nephilim blood and likely grew up around Fallen-Angel-Science/Magic/Teaching. Noah and Namaah had several children, So after the flood subsided these children each went their own way to colonize a different part of the world. One of his sons, Ham, gave birth to Cush who was the father of Nimrod.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nimrod was the ruler of Babylon during the tower incident and was a worshipper of Molech. (Molech is just another aspect of Lucifer, in disguise). As you may know Child sacrifice to Molech was common at that time. Now Nimrod had married his own Mother, Semiramis, who was deeply involved in the esoteric. When Nimrod was killed, his body was cut into 13 pieces + his penis and sent to the corners of the realm as a warning. You will notice this exactly parallels the Isis/Osiris/Horus story of egyptian mythology - no accident, they are the same thing. Semiramis gathered all the pieces but could not find the penis and placed them all near an evergreen tree stump. When the liquids from the parts reached the roots of the tree the tree sprang back to life. (This is the real story of the Christmas Tree, as Nimrod's birthday is recorded as Dec 25). Now at that time Semiramis had another son who she claimed was an immaculate conception and the re-incarnation of Nimrod. She named him Tamuuz and declared herself the "Queen of Heaven". So here we have a triune God story, a resurrection story and a story of immaculate conception. Babylon was a den of mystics and esoterics who were working diligently to promote the first "One World Government" and religion. They did this using the mystic knowledge that had been passed down to them thru the Cain bloodline which was taught to them by the fallen angels of Lucifer. The goal for using these tools was the same as it was in the beginning of time: To Attain Godhood/Ascencion (To rule as Gods). Now Lucifer is the angel of knowledge, so it makes sense that esoteric knowledge was the vehicle in which they attempted to elevate themselves. Babylonians were also the first "Social Justice Warriors" of record. What happened to them, as they say, is history. Yet their traditions and esoteric knowledge were passed down thru the ages and continue still today in what we would deem "secret societies" and "mystery religions".
           </p>
           <p>
            TLDR: Magic is real and is a Luciferian Science. Magic was taught to man as a means to 'elevate himself' to godhood but also because Lucifer wanted to corrupt something pure and innocent which God had created on this earth in his own image. Lucifer is a counterfeit who pretends to be God, promising knowledge &amp; immortality. The greatest joy for Lucifer is to corrupt what is good and twist it to his own desires. What is more good and pure than children? Now tampering with human DNA is also a big part of this, and I believe there is science/magic behind these ritual sacrifices which is being used to attain "immortality". The Serpent Seedline is a real thing. Many people walking around today are from the bloodline of Cain, maybe even you. Perhaps this is why we need to die and be born again before we can go to heaven, as our bodies are now totally corrupted by the Serpent, genetically. People into these ritual sacrifices and esoteric teaching believe that they can harness energies from other beings thru ritual murder. Harnessing energy is important because many of these magic rituals require a great deal of "life force" to excercise. Especially the most potent ones. The purest and most potent energies are found in children, which is another reason they are targeted. I believe the sex aspect is only periphery, a layer of obfuscation which hides the true nature of this beast. But if it is NOT, then the implications are that they are selecting and harvesting children based on genetic traits which further lock in and promote their own serpent seedline - which to me is quite horrifying. The greatest power is creation...and Lucifer lusts for that power - therefore the DNA tampering could be his attempt at a counterfeit creation to create a species in 'his own image'. I could go on...but I think this is best left to my future thread.

            For the same reason the Nazgûl, or Ringwraiths, wore Sauron's rings. They think it will bring them power, privilege, and place- when really it corrupts and enslaves them. They end up powerless and empty drones.
