Amanda Bynes was discovered @ &quot;The Laugh Factory Comedy Camp offers underprivileged inner-city children from Los Angeles, ages 8 to 16, the opportunity to learn about standup comedy. Since 1984, Jamie Masada has recruited the hottest comedians to teach their craft. At the end of the 10 weeks, after a final performance on the Factory stage, each child receives a certificate of completion.&quot;
Her dad was a dentist so doubtful she was &quot;underprivileged&quot; but this gets more interesting.</p>
<p>&quot;His parents could barely make ends meet, but they were “rich in love and caring,” he says. His father was an entertainer, accordion player and sometime cantor when a congregation needed a good voice. He made sure to bring his young son with him to the parties he worked. Masada’s job was to tell jokes. “I wasn’t a good joke teller, but I was very thin, and they had food there,” Masada recalls.

At one such event, an American producer was watching. He saw Masada perform and assured his parents he ha a future in show business. His mother and father saw it as an extraordinary chance and somehow found the money to pay for a plane ticket for their son.
“America was the land of opportunity, and the man was telling my father it was a ticket to get out of poverty, Masada explains. And so, with $850 in his pocket and propelled by his parents’ dream, the 14-year-old flew fro Israel to Los Angeles.
On arrival, however, Masada learned that the producer his parents trusted with their money and his future was long gone. “I never told my parents because it would make them feel guilty,” he says. Instead, he befriended a apartment manager who let him sleep on a couch in a garage just a few blocks down Sunset Boulevard from where his comedy club stands today. To make ends meet he worked various odd jobs. Within nine months, he had rented an apartment and was going to school to learn English.&quot;
So he came to America unable to speak English with basically no money.  So one day when a building came up for rent one Sunset he asked a &quot;friend&quot; and opened the Laugh Factory.  Gee wasn\'t that easy?</p>
<p>Fast forward:  &quot;He is not a particularly religious man, but “we get [inspiration] from our roots, absolutely,” he says. Since 1994, Reform Rabbi Bob Jacobs has collaborated with Masada to offer High Holiday services at the Factory to Jews seeking a communal experience. Jacobs conducts the free services along with Cantor Sue Karlin. “Last year I ha 600 people come for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur,” Masada recalls. “People stood on the sidewalk and we p monitors and speakers outside.” He also opens the Factory for free meals on Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Masada’s other philanthropic efforts include visiting sick children in the hospital. It was just such a visit that go him caught up in the Michael Jackson molestation trial last year. Masada was a witness because he had arrange the original meeting between Jackson and his accuser, a cancer patient whose dying wish was to meet the pop star.&quot;  So these were quotes from his bio on his LF page.<br />
Now  a article ran by NY Daily by Brian Kates Aug 16 2008 - about how Masada and Basciano( who worked for the Gambino family allegedly known for CP) had opened a Laugh Factory in NY and they had a falling out.  But Basciano is quoted as saying basically they had hoped to clean up the Times Square and to make millions from a Disneyfication.<br />
So if you read CDAN there was a post about kids involved in a movie where they were taken to what is believed to be Wonderland and many were molested.  Then there was the big falling out between SS and MJ.  So could it be that the Pedos in Hollywood thought MJ was one bc of how he acted and when MJ found out what happened to kids at his place that could have caused the rift- so bring in the &quot;creepy handler&quot; to set up MJ?<br />
I mean according to Crispin Glover in his &quot;What is it?&quot; and the CDAN blind about the set of Back to the Future where they claim kids were abused on set leading to CG and the girl who played Marty\'s gf not returning for sequel bc they spoke up, it is interesting.  Maybe MJ was guilty and the falling out was over something else- playbook would still apply.<br />
Is there a team of pedos in HW who frames anyone who might expose them with their own victims?  Is the phrase &quot;underprivileged kids&quot; pedo code for unprotected kids?  According to MJ bodyguard the mother of that kid was pushing the kid on MJ if you watch &quot;What Happened to MJ&quot; part 74 I think it is.  Anyway just thoughts about some very weird connections.

            Good post. Any further info on the actress from Back to the Future who complained? The Crispin Glover essay is gold. Also, I don't think the term "underprivileged children " is an actual pedo phrase, but that is the group of kids they prey upon most often.

             Just what CDAN said which was she was basically blacklisted.  They also tried to blacklist Crispin Glover but apparently enough people supported him that even though he lost his A list career he was still able to have one.  Which I think is good bc I always liked him.

            I think there is some really weird stuff going on with the setup at Laugh Factory.  Just Sayin.  C'mon really?  And this guy goes to visit Children in the hospital?   Idk, Jimmy Savile kind of guy.  There are some things that really stick out.  Gambino crime fam?  You can't make this stuff up.

             I never believe these over night rags to riches stories either.  I mean really someone loaned him enough money to get property on Sunset?  even in the 70's and 80's you are talking serious money.

              Just happens to know someone connected to the Crime Family.  Yes.  Hmm.  Once you deal with them, you are in for life.
