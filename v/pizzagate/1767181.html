             That apology to Alefantis the DAY BEFORE the DC Pizzagate protest I bet lost a good chunk of his audience.  Nice gesture but timing stinks sorry.
Alefantis is dirty as heck.

            I think Jones realized his audience saw his apology to Alefantis as being a straight up slap in the face to Pizzagate redpillers.  I sure as hell did.  Now he is trying to backtrack ala Starbucks hiring veterans to try to win back Conservatives.  It's not working.  I am off the bus.  His coverage was always old and with  a few glaring mistakes.  If there was ever a thing NOT to back down on THIS IS IT.  I think his divorce changed him.  I think the google demontization changed him.  Nawh, the truth comes from mouthy nobodies like us.  Integrity is important to me.  Just can't with him anymore. I still watch Watson and Knight though.

             He only caved on pizzagate, not pedogate. He's been talking about pedophiles in government for the last 20 years, and most likely before you even learned about this stuff

             The supplements he sells are very good. I know this because I eat the specific foods which contain the same minerals and nutrients. My high testosterone diet works extremely well! I'm like a new man again!

              Yes I think his vitamins are fine but let's be real. He makes his real money from youtube ads.  That why he freaked out with the Google demoneitaton going on to anyone covering this. THAT'S why the apology.  To get his money back.  I thought he was great for awhile too but now  I see him just like Wolf Blitzer or Megan Kelly.  Another bobblehead..

             To recapitulate yet again, over the last twenty-two years of broadcasting, Jones has devoted more airtime to tell the sordid story of satanic child sex slavery than any other person, living or dead. And every one of the charges you make against Jones in the post you linked is challengeable. To do so in any way that could be considered complete including citations would require something like six hours of painstaking work, and no one is going to commit that kind of time in this forum. However, I am so sickened by the constant vicious attacks on Jones's efforts to combat CP and satanic child sex slavery, I am very tempted to post a stand alone thread at VOAT that contains a quintessential demonstration of how shortsighted you and other Jones bashers are. Yes, even better than how I destroyed you at the conclusion of our dialogue in the first one above.

              I remember how devastated he was last fall when this was getting out, he was weeping knowing what was being done to kids. I have a good bullshit detector, and Jones is sincere. Something happened behind the scenes and while I think Alex wouldn't be intimidated by threats to himself, he would be if people he cared about were. Look how Milo and Cernovich were slammed and smeared, ((they)) are systematically discrediting the most well known of what they labeled 'alt right.'

              He bashes himself. If you're sickened by people pointing out the obvious, rethink your hero worship cause it's getting unhealthy for you.

             <p>
              Your argument makes no sense: over 20 years of broadcasting, if he's only 60% correct, is still going to mean he's one of the most prolific shock jocks on any topic he's covered. Do you know the definition of a limited hangout disinfo operation? Because you've just described it, in part. but you claim you can account for every mistake or misstep, which is dishonest. To say you won every debate on this topic is also dishonest. You simply decided that when Jones lies, it's OK but he mostly tells the truth and why am I being so hard on him.  Silliness.

                 Hmmm... I'd watch the holy part.
                 <em>
                  To be perfectly honest, I believe that the only thing that can stop this is God. Jesus, to be precise. But we can help by continuing to shout and awaken our fellow man to the reality that involves someone who almost became president.
                 </em>
                 Jones is a ferocious defender of Christ, and Christ knows all of Jones's many faults, but they are offset by his deep desire to stop the worst crimes against children. If you were remotely Christian, as you seem to imply, you'd pull back on the attacks for this reason alone.

                   Hmmm... It must be acknowledged that your video is highly edited, meaning I have no context whatsoever of what prompted the remarks. Mind you, I have an imagination, which means I believe someone probably said something highly enraging, probably something along the lines of what you've been saying about him at VOAT time and again. The fact that the video is edited and does not include context is proof of intent to misrepresent. Why not include it? This is typical of the kind of tactics used by his enemies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Regardless, Jones is human. This is raw human emotion any of us can experience, especially when we're being attacked. It's not pretty, but it's inevitable on occasion. So far as my opinion of Jones and his commitment to God and protecting children, your video demonstrates nothing to change my mind.

                 These are very favorable remarks of yours about a recent guest on Jones's show. Jones had Cernovich (who you like) on for a reason. The reason is, Jones wants arrests of pedophiles as much or more than you do. The previous sentence is true or false?

                  For FUCKS SAKE. You are really stretching here. Find me a place where I ever claimed that anything Jones has looked at, touched, interviewed, was guilty by association. In fact, I have said he is a limited hangout. LIMITED meaning he does speak truth but in a limited way, like Wikileaks. The CIA isn't going to make it obvious, they have to make it look like he's their enemy. But dude, his own father and half his family is CIA. Come ON. He acts ridiculous, yells and then calls Alefantis innocent, making up a story about the govt probably dropping fake emails to frame him, without offering evidence. He says we shouldn't look at Comet, and that he'll take the reigns from here, as the pizzagate community has obviously been led astray. NO THE FUCK WE HAVEN'T. And we never "ran to Comet" to the exclusion of other leads from Podesta emails, as Jones states. Nor did he, as he also claims. He needs to step the fuck back, he's already admitted he's not going to be fully exposing pizzagate, so why would anyone follow what he says about it now?

                   You're a lost cause V___Z. The fact Jones has connections to some who have been in the CIA is called
                   <strong>
                    an asset
                   </strong>
                   . It's the ability to get information that would otherwise not be available. Would you like some dork who knows no one and therefore nothing doling out your deep state truth for the day? There are several former CIA agents working tirelessly for the last decade to get the truth out. They put their lives on the line for the rest of us, but fools like you don't put any faith in them because you buy into the line that once with the agency always with the agency. I have news. The agency created this myth to make agents who go rogue impotent. Their particular names escape me at the moment, but I might update once some come to me. At least two have been on Jones's Show and also John B Wells's show. You're a dupe of the system V____Z. They've got your number real good.

                   In so far as the CPP Alefantis retraction, I've explained it in detail elsewhere. Don't pretend you didn't read it.

                   Re: Those ex CIA saying death defying things - Kevin Shipp and Ray McGovern. Scott Bennett also comes to mind, although Scott was Army Special Ops Officer and Psych Warfare Analyst. May update again as other names come to mind. You can add William Binney to the list. Not CIA, but worked for nasty alphabet agency nonetheless, and thus is a solid demonstration that not all former alphabet agents are working for the agency from the outside.
