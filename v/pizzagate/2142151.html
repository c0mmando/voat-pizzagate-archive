<p>The Enlightened Society of Oculists has been discussed before on Reddit, 4Chan, and only one prior submission in April 2017 to pizzagate which provided little to no info. The reason being is probably due to the extreme difficulty trying to find out what this society is all about, who its members are, and what role does it play in today\'s society. It does exist with HQ in NY, NY. Based on everything I have discovered, my assumption is that The Enlightened Society of Oculists (ESC) is the step above Freemasonry, a subsidiary of it, whose function is to act as Freemasonry\'s watchdog and overseer.</p>
<p>After discussing ESC, I will then discuss the eyeglass company, Warby Parker, that certainly appears to have Oculist ties or connections.
This is a long submission, but the subject matter is very involved and mysterious and would not make any sense at all otherwise.</p>
<p>So, moving on with my &quot;discoveries&quot;...
The ESC\'s &quot;Bible&quot; is a treatise called &quot;Copiale Cipher.&quot; For more than 260-years, the contents remained secret, as they were in coded manuscript. Here is the story about it.</p>
<p>In the 1990\'s, in Berlin, a Christine Schaefer and a Wolfgang Hock, philologists (experts in ancient writings), would often meet at an Italian bistro to discuss dead languages and obscure manuscripts. In the fall of 1998, Hock was leaving for a job in the linguistics department at Uppsala University in Sweden. Before he left, he gave Schaefer a &quot;good-bye&quot; present, the Copiale Cipher.</p>
<p>Schaefer worked long and hard on cracking the code but became frustrated and put it aside until 13 years later.</p>
<p>In 2011, Schaefer attended an Uppsala University conference on &quot;computerized linguistics.&quot; One of the speakers was Kevin Knight, a University of Southern California specialist in machine translation - the use of algorithms to automatically translate 1 language into another.</p>
<p>A copy of the Cipher arrived at Knight\'s house a few weeks later. He was hesitant as a lot of alleged ciphers turned out to be hoaxes. This one was not. Schaefer assisted him in his efforts.</p>
<p>Schaefer found a phrase that was familiar to her in the Copiale text referring to a &quot;light hand&quot; being required to be a master of a society. She dug-up an academic article she had read sometime before about a secret order in Germany that called itself &quot;The Great Enlightened Society of Oculists,&quot; and the &quot;light hand&quot; was mentioned in their bylaws. </p>
<p>These &quot;oculists&quot; were not eye doctors but passed themselves off as eye surgeons for a long time because historians simply ignored documents like this due to not having the tools to make sense of them.</p>
<p>Much of these secret societies power back then, as it is today, is their ability to stay anonymous and keep their communications secret. Schaefer believed The Copiale was one of the more extreme groups. There is explicit talk about slaying the tyrannical &quot;three-headed monster&quot; which &quot;deprives man of his natural freedom&quot; and a call for &quot;general revolt.&quot;</p>
<p>On 0ctober 25, 2011, the NYT published a story about the Copiale, focusing on Knight\'s code-cracking techniques. A flood of media attention followed, including Masons warning Knight to stop spilling &quot;dusty&quot; secrets or claiming that Lucifer was really the Freemason god.</p>
<p>The Oculists seemed to be watching Freemasonry\'s every move. From page 27-78 the Cipher details the rituals performed by the highest degrees of the Masonic order.</p>
<p>Before the Cipher was broken, the Oculists were practically unknown. The only thing known was that the society was led by Count August von Veltheim who died in 1775. In his will, he left specific instructions for his son regarding his oculist heirlooms. He had locked all of his oculist objects in a leather trunk and ordered his son to make sure the seals remained unbroken until the local duke or 1 of his descendants said otherwise. The trunk wasn\'t opened until 1918, and its contents are now at the state archives in Wolfenbuttel and have rarely been examined since.</p>
<p>The author of the article I am referring to as I write this post, Noah Shachtman, made the trip to review these items with Professor Jan Snoek, a suggested mentor from Knight and Schaefer. Snoek was a high-degree Mason. The contents discovered were a silver-dollar sized seal of the Oculists; a bone-handled cataract needle; luminescent green aprons that members wore; 5 oval amulets with raised blue eyes; and a tiny cylinder, covered in jade and gold and inside was a tortoise-shell cup holding an eye made of ivory and horn that came apart like a Russian doll - pupil inside lens, iris on top of pupil, etc. - each layer more exquisite than the next.
Last in the artifacts were 9 copies of a 4-page document written in a mixture of old-German, Latin, and Copiale\'s coded script. In every set, the message was identical, &quot;Die Algebra.&quot; Rows of cipher on the top of page one, a primer on the &quot;old way of calculating&quot; with rows of cipher letters lying beneath. The 3rd page mentioned the Jewish Cabala, whose mystical meaning is derived from the numerical value of letters. It appears that the Copiale symbols don\'t just represent words and letters but that they stand for numbers, too, but thus far, the meaning is unknown.</p>
<p>Snoek believed the Oculists guarded and transmitted Masons\' deepest secrets, using a mixture of ritual, misdirection, and cryptography. To this day, the Oculists\' secrets have not been fully pried loose.</p>

<p>Warby Parker - an eyeglass company, was founded by 4 college students - David Gilboa, Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, and Jeffrey Raider - while attending Wharton School of The University of Pennsylvania. The name Warby Parker was derived from 2 characters that appear in a journal by author Jack Kerouac. </p>
<p>These 4 guys received $2,500 seed investment from the Venture Initiation Program at Wharton and launched their online inexpensive eyeglass-selling business in Fenruary 2010. In 2013, their annual revenue was $35 million. In 2015, annual revenue was over $100 million. As of April 2015, the business is valued at $1.2 billion. They have not yet gone public.</p>
<p>Currently they still sell online but also have 46 retail sites and plan on opening 25 more this year. In 2018, they will begin accepting vision insurance.</p>
<p>How does an electronic start-up company become this rich this fast not only selling inexpensive eyeglasses but also gives them away as well? For the most part, the company is non-specific about the math saying, &quot;You make it work.&quot; Sales figures are not discussed. Regardless, this company has nothing but praise and accolades everywhere online, and one might think they are the second coming of Christ.</p>
<p>Something just isn\'t right. There is a website, www.theocculists.com, that is about Warby Parker claiming they are the oculists with reference to the society and the secret document cryptography. The article states, &quot;Like the oculists, the engineers at Warby Parker restore sight, hunger for knowledge, use advanced technology, and welcome all who can help.&quot; Last link provided below.</p>
<p>In summary, more information is needed about the &quot;modern-day&quot; ESC, IF it exists, and more investigation is needed into Warby Parker and their connections. Is it just luck, hard work, and perseverance that made them into a billion dollar company within 5 years, or is there something more sinister?</p>

            I always noticed at the physical location that the logo resembled the Freemasonry symbol but only after walking past it dozens of times did it occur to me that something was off on the design.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then today after reading this post I went to their website and realized it is the star and crescent symbol.  The star portion is not on the logo outside their building.
           </p>
           <p>
            This strikes me as more than a coincidence.

            I do not know what to say.  I am a Christian and a Buddhist, in that I believe in Christ and Buddha's teachings which are similar. Lao Tzu is also on my believable list.  I believe what you are saying is that goodness will overcome evil.  Please forgive me for being so basic and elementary.  All of this  has changed me, and I just wish it would all end, as this evil I never knew existed prior to 11 months ago.  What I have learned since last October is nothing less than traumatic to someone who never knew any of this craziness ever existed.

            The thing that stood out for me was money laundering for the Freemasons just as some use art. I agree does not sound feasible to be making that kind of money so quickly online.  Of course, who knows.

            Investigating groups like the Scottish Rite, Shriners, and Jesters are going to probably be more fruitful in regards to ending pizzagate.

            The main thing that bothers me is that the fellow I saw kept on a huge heavy thumb ring (Scientology has similar) which looked like a bacteria reservoir. And he was doing corneal thickness studies with this thing he hauled from King Tutts underpants going thud on the equipment. Potential for corneal infections. You can be a cult but keep the bling out of the exam room.

            Interesting write-up. It's worth mentioning the Illuminati's place in history here. The Free Masons are a large and ancient society. The Illuminati was a secret society formed during the Enlightenment era, attempting to promote secular progressive values. They formed an alliance with the Free Masons, which seems to have had limited success. But due to the clash of ideals between the Illuminati, and the Church &amp; state, secret societies where outlawed. The Enlightened Society of Oculists is believed to be a branch of Freemasonry who were attempting to continue their organization by disguising themselves as oculists.
