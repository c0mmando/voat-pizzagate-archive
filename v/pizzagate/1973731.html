            There are those who think that the missing Pentagon trillions and a huge black budget are funding what they call the Breakway Civilization.  Given that the elites are ignoring the fact that this planet is in crisis (population, resources, infrastructure decline, vulnerable nuclear plants, possible nuclear war, climate change, evolving diseases, etc) one can conclude that the elites are insane OR that they have an exit plan.  Some very bright people think they have an exit plan.  I suggest that the idea that we already have colonies on mars may not be as whacky as some think.  Whatever our military says it has now you can be sure they have much more.  What that might be we can only guess.

             ..."The Lockheed Executives Comments On Space Travel
            </p>
            <p>
             Rich was the second director of Lockheed Skunkwork’s from 1975-1991. He’s been called the Father of Stealth, having overseen the development of the stealth fighter, the F-117A nighthawk. Before his death, Rich made several shocking open statements about the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials.
“We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects, and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity. Anything you can imagine, we already know how to do it.” (1)
            </p>
            <p>
             “We now have technology to take ET home. No it won’t take someone’s lifetime to do it. There is an error in the equations. We know what it is. We now have the capability to travel to the stars.” (1)
            </p>
            <p>
             “There are two types of UFOs — the ones we build and the ones ‘they’ build.” (1)
Where Quantum Entaglement Comes In
            </p>
            <p>
             When Rich was asked how UFO propulsion worked, he said, “Let me ask you. How does ESP work?” The questioner responded with, “All points in time and space are connected?” Rich then said, “That’s how it works!”
            </p>
            <p>
             Interesting to think about, isn’t it? Perhaps the vast distances that exist between planets, solar systems and more isn’t really as much of a barrier as we thought it was.
            </p>
            <p>
             What Are The Sources For These Quotes?
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the sources is aerospace journalist, James Goodall, who wrote for publications such as Jane’s Defense Weekly, Aviation Week and Space Technology, and Interavia. He is an accomplished speaker specializing in the history, development, and operations of the world’s only Mach 3 capable, manned air breathing aircraft, the SR-71 family of aircraft. (1) (source)(source)(source)
            </p>
            <p>
             He is also an author, as well as the Associate Curator at the Pacific Aviation Meseum, HI. He was also the restoration manager at the Museum of Flight in Paine Field, Everett, WA.
            </p>
            <p>
             Goodall interviewed many from the classified black budget world (read more about that world here.) He claimed that some of his contacts told him that “we have things out there that are literally out of this world, better than Star Trek or what you see in the movies.” (1)
            </p>
            <p>
             From his work alone, James Goodall knew Ben Rich well. In a video interview, Goodall stated that he spoke to Rich approximately 10 days before he died:
“About ten days before he died, I was speaking to Ben on the telephone at the USC Medical Center in LA. And he said, ‘Jim, we have things out in the desert that are fifty years beyond what you can comprehend. They have about forty five hundred people at the Lockheed Skunk works. What have they been doing for the last eighteen or twenty years? They’re building something.’” (1)
Another source comes from John Andrews, who was a legendary Lockheed engineer. He had written to Rich, stating his own belief in UFOs, both manmade and extraterrestrial. Andrews has asked Rich if his own beliefs covered extraterrestrial as well as manmade UFOs. Rich’s reply was as follows:
“Yes, I’m a believer in both categories. I feel everything is possible. Many of our man-made UFOs are Un-Funded Opportunities. There are two types of UFOs, the ones we build, and the ones they build.” (1)
In Rich’s reply, he underlined the U, F, and O in “unfunded opportunities.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Thirdly, Jan Harzan, a senior executive with IBM, along with Tom Keller, an aerospace engineer who has worked as a computer systems analyst for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discusses a talk Ben gave some time ago. On March 23rd, 1993 at a UCLA School of Engineering talk where he was presenting a general history of Sunk Works, he said this:
“We now know how to travel to the stars. There is an error in the equations, and we have figured it out, and now know how to travel to the stars and it won’t take a lifetime to do it. It is time to end all the secrecy on this, as it no longer poses a national security threat, and make the technology available for use in the private sector. There are many in the intelligence community who would like to see this stay in the black and not see the light of day. We now have the technology to take ET home.” (1)"

                    I did. That's the Deep State's black budget to fund shit like Smith-Mundt mass shooting hoaxes and for DC think tanks to come up with insane ideas that will discredit any legitimate investigation into things like using children to grease the gears of Brownstone Operations world wide.

                     Do the math, DarkMath. $6.5 trillion amounts to $20,000 for every man, woman and child in the USA, or $65 million for each of 100,000 shills, very unlikely. Nor is it likely that the Smith-Mundt mass shooting hoaxes could account for the $6.5 trillion, but a Secret Space Program would account for it and is consistent with what credible whistleblowers, including Ben Rich former head of Lockheed Skunkworks, have revealed at great personal risk. Look at these facts, unless you're shilling for the Deep State to control the narrative and keep the Secret Space Program secret. Good luck with that.

                       $6.5 trillion is an enormous sum, and you're correct that it's over many years. It probably began around 1947 with the creation of the CIA, and really got going in later decades, so we're going back 7 decades, but it's still an unfathomable sum that could buy a tremendous amount of R&amp;D and secret technologies. President Eisenhower warned of the dangers of the military-industrial complex during his farewell address: "This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. . . .Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. . . . In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist." JFK warned about the dangers of secrecy to a free society in his address to the Press:
                       <a href="https://youtu.be/97n-uqJC2Jw">
                        https://youtu.be/97n-uqJC2Jw
                       </a>
                       . I have no doubt about the existence of the Secret Space Program, but of course you are entitled to your own opinions. We can both agree that there exists the scourge of institutionalized pedophilia and that it's global in its extent.

                        No it's not. The United States has a GDP of 17.5 trillion dollars. Think of it as a persons yearly salary. Say they make $100,000 per year. One third of that is $33,000. That's 4 months salary or GDP for the U.S..

                 Having worked for the NSA/NRO etc, I find it highly unlikely but not impossible that there is an elitist attempt to break away from Earth or that they transport children to Mars. I'm not discounting it completely.

                <p>
                 Its much more probable that human based "experiments" occur in the Antarctic. I'm not saying that is the case at all, but something is going on in Antarctic. There is absolutely no logistical reason to have so many bases at the south pole except for it being a remote location. The expense must be astronomical. That's got to be the latest Manhattan Project.

                 Once upon a time youtube comments had instant language translation. That was removed with the intent of keeping people isolated by region, there's no other explanation possible. Think of how useful Twitter, FB, youtube would be to us if it were social media without language borders.

                  You took the bait hook line and sinker. You need to be more cynical. Virtually everything in the MSM is fake these days and what is real is spun to manipulate with disinformation.

                  So in the case of Antarctica I have no doubt there is some shit going on down there but the Alien bull shit is a cover. What's most likely happening is the WASP Mafia is doing something nefarious like storing nuclear waste or mining for uranium or any number of things they couldn't get away with up here.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I've even heard they might be launching satellites down there on the cheep. I'm not sure why but if I had to guess it's because some of the cheapest rocket fuels like
                  <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=892&amp;tid=181">
                   Amonium Perclorate
                  </a>
                  are toxic and
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc_nnnBmMbM">
                   highly explosive
                  </a>
                  There would certainly be a huge monetary incentive to do some rocketry on the cheap down in Antarctica either launching or manufacturing the fuel.

                 <p>
                  Starting the get the picture? All this disinfo like child slaves on Mars or Aliens in Antarctica is in the public consciousness for a reason: it's covering for some really bad shit TPTB shouldn't be doing.

                   There is no government program "on the cheap."  US MIC employees are the most inefficient and ineffective people in the world. I know this first hand. They are part of a "jobs program" and don't even realize it.

                    What I meant by that is any private factory producing Amonium Perclorate for example is going to pay an insanely high amount of insurance. We're talking AP is toxic to humans AND highly explosive. Those are two facts a private company doesn't want anything to do with given the liability.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I'm not saying they're making AP down there. I'm just saying they're probably moving things that are too expensive to do domestically down to Antarctica to save money bypassing insurance and regulations etc.
