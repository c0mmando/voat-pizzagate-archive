            I commented on an article posted pertaining to George Webb that the BS is like cellophane = I can see right through this BS.  First, the comments start discrediting George Webb, also saw where someone is now discrediting Goodman, and in this posts comments, someone trying to discredit Liz Crokin.  It's old, stale and the "look the other way" comments are no longer working....not that they ever did.

            You don't have to open your door for anyone. No one has the authority to demand you open it ... not even a police officer UNLESS the police officer has a warrant. End of story.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Golddigger Liz, a Hollywood reporter covering celebrities, contracts genital and cerebral herpes from her multi-millionaire BF. After he dumps her, she sues him for millions of dollars. Then she writes a book about it to disparage him publicly and to portray herself as a "victim." Even though, according to her book, she was in a consensual relationship with him and he never sexually assaulted her, she becomes an "advocate for sexual abuse victims" (for some reason).
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Not sure what you're not getting. If someone withholds medical conditions from a "consenting" sexual partner, they are guilty of a crime. Just because Liz Crokin agreed and was willing to have sex with said fat, old, dirty man, doesn't mean she consented to be infected with a disease. Come on now, you must know this. Why are you obscuring the case by saying the relationship was consensual? The case hinges on what Crokin consented to. If it was sex, they had sex so that's not the problem. But if this old fart was infected, knew he was infected, and, further, knew that the transmission of said disease could be spread through sexual contact and didn't tell her, he is guilty of a crime. Pay up, asshole.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just as an aside, I love the way women still get the brunt of condemnation for relationships with the heathens in Pedowood. It's like the given in these situations is that everyone in Hollywood is a Babylonian, depraved freak out Satanist and that anyone having anything to do with this perverse crowd is obviously a fool slut and out of their minds. Then in the next breath, we have one of these Hollywood brethren standing up and spouting their beliefs on the current political landscape and we're supposed to believe them because they're saints and representing righteousness and all that is holy in the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Makes no sense.

            I notice this person below commenting on herpes.  Sounds like someone trying to discredit someone's story through trash talk to me   I do believe people are in danger who are looking into this story.  Too many accidents and firings happening.  I don't think they can stop it though the volume of interest is very high.

            WND said they are actively covering the Seth Rich murder.  Crokin said on her Twitter feed that she wasn't going to cover the Seth Rich story out of fear for her safety.

            Oh the DRAMA!
           </p>
           <p>
            Golddigger Liz, a Hollywood reporter covering celebrities, contracts genital and cerebral herpes from her multi-millionaire BF.  After he dumps her, she sues him for millions of dollars.  Then she writes a book about it to disparage him publicly and to portray herself as a "victim."  Even though, according to her book, she was in a consensual relationship with him and he never sexually assaulted her, she becomes an "advocate for sexual abuse victims" (for some reason).
           </p>
           <p>
            After covering celebrities and hanging out (partying) with them for years, Liz suddenly declares that she's a conservative.  She has a new "conservative" persona despite continuing to live in uberliberal partytown Hollywood.
           </p>
           <p>
            02/18/2017 - Liz claims she was assaulted by HRC supporters, fears for her life; has received assassination threats

            Liz was canned by the New York Observer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Liz was canned by Town Hall (hardly a liberal rag).
           </p>
           <p>
            Liz was canned by WND (hardly a liberal rag).  LC coauthored articles with Alicia Powe, who is such a lame "reporter": she never even mentioned that Seth Rich was transported to hospital after he was shot (Hagemann Report).
           </p>
           <p>
            "Smart" Liz is so ignorant she doesn't know how to handle a process server at her front door, becomes hysterical and calls her mother (!).  (This sounds like a standard process service attempt to me.)
           </p>
           <p>
            "she was forcibly confronted "  YOUR OWN VIDEO DOESN'T SAY THAT.  LMAO!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are we getting this UBERDRAMATIC "story" secondhand from this faggot instead of from Liz herself?  It's because Liz has already cranked out so many DRAMATIC videos that she has her buddy do it for her to elicit sympathy and attention in her stead.

             your full of shit.  forcibly confronted involves the woman banging on her door demanding her to open it, banging very forcibly.  confronting her..  watch the video dumbass.  Im the faggot who made the video, have any questions for me?  You are ignorant, and YOU are dramatic.  I did this video for her protection.  And anyone with the slightest bit of of a brain will find it very odd that one would represent hersself throught he door as a cop, show a badge, and then minutes later deny herself being a cop.  "smart" liz, you dont sound too smart yourself there.

            I was going over the firing of Hannity in my head yesterday thinking hmmm .. ok .. every single person who mentions this on TV (the main place the world gets its news from) disappears. Every time showing an "example" to anyone or any station who is thinking about doing the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then it's got me thinking .. what is about to happen next that they need to "not be covering in MSM" .. then I remembered Brock getting the IP addresses of us all.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have literally no idea the numbers that follow PG does anyone else? Could anyone even make an educated guess? Seth Rich petition was signed pretty quickly by over 20,000 last time I seen it ..
           </p>
           <p>
            So I guess my paranoid, worrying thought is this .. and we all now know these guys are capable of anything .. "
            <strong>
             Do you think these guys could cull us, make us all disappear
            </strong>
            ?" Do we need to devise some sort of insurance?

             At 1:03:00 in this interview for Project Camelot, George Webb and Kerry Cassidy discuss "slow kill."
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMyaknxv0">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAiMyaknxv0
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             "Slow kill" is ruining a person's life by making accusations to their employer or their church, and they use large groups of people to repeatedly accuse someone in order to build doubt in everyone's mind about that person. They destroy marriages by sending altered pictures. It is similar to the "brownstone operation" which is a sex scandal entrapment technique. J. Edgar Hoover used this against political enemies. Bill Clinton signed a Presidential order in 1998 called a "disruption program." So --- if you've ever had someone shame you in public or accuse you out of the blue for nothing at all -- you might consider the possibility that you are now a "TI" or targeted individual. Learn about your rights and demand that they are respected.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kerry Cassidy says she has experienced this "slow kill." She and her husband practice certain techniques of confusing them so that it is hard to stalk them or eavesdrop on them.

               Can you cite exactly where you got the notion that men associated with Alex Jones offered her protection, because it's certainly not in that 19 minute video. Just who are these men V____Z?  Now you stoop to an all time low by insinuating that Jones has a hit team out there pretending to offer protection but are in fact preparing to harm Liz Crokin. V____Z, you are appalling. You're an embarrassment to the ideals of truth and integrity. You're a man on a futile mission to destroy Jones, but you are only destroying yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
               As to the story itself, at 2:25 the speaker says Crokin has been fired from

                multiple

               news outlets. This is a red flag that there may be something wrong with her. Much more information is needed before making any determination as to why she was let go.

                  I don't agree about accepting Alex because sometimes he's useful. He lies, and has hurt - purposefully - our investigation. He announced it was bunk the night before our big protest in DC. He made up a story (like Webb does) to protect the real perps, saying the emails implicating comet et al were probably planted by "the government".

                   Why does Jones still identify Podesta guilty as charged? If you actually listened to Jones you'd know he's said this at least six times since the Alefantis retraction. Alefantis and co. identified Jones as the ideal party to apply maximum pressure for a retraction as a proxy for all other pg commentators. You don't have a flying clue what took place behind the scenes with this veritable Rothschild and what kind of communication took place between JA and/or his lawyers and Jones. Even you acknowledge Alefantis is almost certainly from the world's most ruthless clan. Jones did precisely what he had to in order to have Infowars remain viable. Why can't you see that? Jones is a father, and a good one. Given the opportunity, he'd gouge the eyeballs out of any pedophile. Twenty-two years of an impeccable record savaging the elite for being satanic child sex torturers, someone who a platform to people like Ted Gunderson and Nancy Schaeffer over and over again, and you want to destroy him for one thoroughly unavoidable tactical decision.

                  <p>
                   Here's something you do not know which might come as a surprise. I too wish Jones would have stayed the course on Alefantis. He had been on top of CPP for two solid weeks before having to take the action he did. However, I do not hold it against him because I recognize the value of Infowars on
                   <strong>
                    every other
                   </strong>
                   battle front. There are other people who have the Alefantis angle covered. Jones exercised self preservation, and he did the right thing in order to fight another day. You're going to learn the truth some day V____Z, one way or another.
