            Why is FBIanon so important to you? It is highly likely that the majority of people in these discussions are other anonymous agents and former agents from around the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Read more and post less, till you have come up with something. Be a part of the discussions instead of posting sub-verses and cluttering the main feed with junk.

             "anonymous agents and former agents from around the world." Are you for real?  Too bad its mostly the public who's on here. People that are fathers, brothers, uncles and people that are teachers, firefighters and mostly its just a bunch of average dudes who are fucking sick of the bs. FBIanon isn't important to me he is to the case. Don't tell me what to post either. Why are you pushing the narrative that he's not important?
            </p>
            <p>
             It was Jerome Corsi. Not Joe.
And yes FBIanon did mention him he said "Jerome Corsi is much closer and has more facts."
Contribute what?

              And then you go and answer your own question, so waste a sub-verse to ask. You could have asked that in a related thread. The Mods are working hard to keep this place tidy and aligned to facts. Don't be so emotional.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the hardest thing anybody will have to deal with in their lives and the most emotionally challenging, but people have to be able to leave their emotions at the door. Direct your passion to investigating, communication and stay focused.
             </p>
             <p>
              It makes collaboration difficult when 5 out of even 7 sub-serves are nothing more than a single sentence. Do some digging around and then when you have something, make a paragraph or two. Give the sub-verses some value!

               Good point, I apologize. Honestly I was laying in bed and half asleep it was 330 am but now I realize I didn't mention why the name rung a bell, I heard the sheriff say his name in the Obama birth certificate press conference earlier in the night. He said that Jerome Corsi had done some investigating on the Obama birth certificate and I couldn't remember where so that's why I asked. I won't post anymore half asleep like an idiot.

                Its OK. You raised a topic that has been one of my focus of attention for 8 years.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'll start by explaining this, if you look at Obam, I mean really look at his features, and get out of your head that they say he is mulatto and really look...
               </p>
               <p>
                I am good at spotting a persons race, even the region or tribal back ground, but Obama is NOT black and white, nor is he Middle eastern. He grew up partially in Indonesia. Now watch this 6 minute video!
