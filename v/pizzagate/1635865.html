<p>33 girls, 20 of them minors, were rescued.  Initial reports were that 18 adults were arrested, including Americans and Canadians.  Then that number was reduced to 12 arrested, and now reports say 9 Haitians have been arrested, according to the Haiti Sentinel : <a href="http://sentinel.ht/2017/02/08/defiant-kaliko-beach-uncooperative-child-trafficking-investigation/">Defiant Kaliko Beach Uncooperative with Child-Trafficking Investigation</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Article excerpts:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (sentinel.ht) – Haitian authorities say the proprietor of the Kaliko Beach Club hotel is being uncooperative, defiant and boastful even. And although 18 arrests were made on Sunday during the police operation, as of Monday evening only, nine, all Haitian nationals, involved in the child-trafficking ring were still in police custody.</p>
<p><strong>Senator Jean Renel Senatus (PONT/Ouest) believes the foreign participants somehow escaped.</strong> None the less, he congratulated the police units which participated in the sting at Kaliko Beach Club. Senator Senatus said the first information he received was that foreigners were involved in the child-trafficking.</p>
<p>Through interrogations with the girls at the Central Directorate of Judicial Police (DCPJ; Haiti’s FBI), the girls, police say they learned that some were coaxed with invitations by the Haitian suspects to take part in <strong>a party on a yacht and take flights aboard a helicopter</strong>. Police say neither of the vehicles were confirmed to be in the area. The suspect the foreign parties had intended to take the children out of the country where then they could be subject to kidnapping, sexual exploitation and/or organ farming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More information on the uncooperative Kaliko Bay proprietor is given in the video above. That covers the owners of the resort pretty comprehensively, pointing out ties to Paret Petroleum, an import/export business and Capital Bank.</p>
<p>..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>I noticed that the diving club at the resort is named Pegasus Diving Services or Pegasus Exploration.  It is run by Jose Roy, who describes himself as an ex-mercenary for the French and Italian governments.

</blockquote>
<p>The Travelers\' Century Club, or TCC, is a club for people who have visited 100 or more of the world\'s countries and territories. The organization was founded in California in 1954 and now has more than 2,000 members throughout the world.  It\'s president is <a href="http://www.gbsan.com/san-diego-society-events/masterpiece-gala#!Charley_and_Gloria_McCoy">Gloria McCoy</a>.  Her Linkedin profile shows that she obtained a Chemistry degree from University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.  I haven\'t looked much further into her yet.  However looking through blog posts, members of this club travel to some pretty interesting places, including <a href="http://www.lajollalight.com/sdljl-north-korea-marathon-2016jun01-story.html">North Korea</a>.  The club seems like an exclusive version of the Roraty club and reminded me of this post: thread <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1503369">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1503369</a>.</p>

<p>Now the Kaliko Bay Hotel is right next door to Club Indigo Plage et Hotel where Bill &amp; Hillary honeymooned.  (More information at this reddit thread: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5si4q7/huge_child_sex_trafficking_bust_occured_in_a/?st=iz08i0cc&amp;sh=718deb5d">https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5si4q7/huge_child_sex_trafficking_bust_occured_in_a/?st=iz08i0cc&amp;sh=718deb5d)</a>)</p>
<p>I believe that it would be worth our while to look at the stretch of resorts along that section of the coast.  The following webpage includes the list of neighbouring resorts, including the newly opened Obama Beach and Hotel which is apparently, a favourite destination for UN forces in Haiti !!</p>

             I went back to Hillary email archive typed in Bill Clinton and got the 2001 instead of 2010 year again. It is from Chelsea: Please do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.

             How bizarre. I've just this moment been listening to a video that mentioned that refuge.  Synchronicity. Thanks.

            And there's the Barak bar at Rue Gregoire, Pétion-Ville, Haiti which also, apparently is a quiet favourite for different US 'Alphabet' operatives. It's open from 7am till 4 am, 7 days. 
Have a look at the photos.

            No, moderators aren't compromised!! At least the majority of them aren't and the majority are trying to do their best to keep this place free from submissions that detract from the investigation or could damage PG's credibility in the eyes of skeptics and newcomers/be used by the media at some point in the future to attack us. People seem to think that just because they might disagree with a decision, or a mod made a mistake, that it automatically means they're compromised or evil or something. Its not true and its kind of unfair to accuse them when they really want PG to result in arrests and justice and in victims being saved as much as, or more than, anyone!

             People seem to forget what
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
              r/pizzagate
             </a>
             was like on reddit. It was a good place, but BOY....did it have some issues. People would post to some random website that, while the content was great, looked like shit, and that fact was used by shillls to ruin threads that otherwise were just doing some good discussion of the content. I remember the day reddit banned it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everyone came here. None of us knew who the mods were...Actually, who the (singular) mod was, because there was only one. I made a post, or a comment, don't remember...laying out some ideas to avoid the problems
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
              r/pizzagate
             </a>
             had.  One idea was to have text posts only, even if all you wanted to do was link to a website or video. So...if you wanted to link to a video, you'd have to explain why it's relevant, why it's important, and why, even though it may look like a shitty video/ website, you should still take it seriously.  This was all done to avoid shills being able to ruin an otherwise great and interesting thread.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some time has passed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe the mods should make a new post explaining why the rules are the rules...let it get to the top or sticky it or something. Let's have a great discussion in the comments. Maybe we'll change some rules...I'm not opposed to that.  My point is, there's a reason we have the rules we have. I had a post removed yesterday because I asked a question and there's a sub for that. I honestly didn't know that was rule, now I do, and I just reposted in that sub.
            </p>
            <p>
             I get it, this place is for research and discussion of research and relevant breaking news.  If you don't like that, or think it's flawed or whatever...that's great...just go make a sub that is what you want it to be. No one is stopping you, and no one wants to stop you.  Maybe it will be better than this place. More power to you.

              It's starting to look that way..still seems pretty swampy if ya ask me. I'm giving sessions a week before I freak completely out. I was hoping they're developing a careful case, even circumstantial evidence can put someone away.

                Not from today, basically his week woulda been up Wednesday. I wanted to wake up that next morning to large scale arrests, both big and small. However, a week was too long, you're right. Weekend raids like the ICE ones, might as well do it now. A week is honestly too long, hell another HOUR is too long. I'm putting myself into the poor kids seat and thinking on that.

            If figures the Haitian-Canadian pimp royalty were released. They probably had a whole house full of 14-16 year old white runaways framing up rich Canadian and American tourists.  Can't let a valuable intel asset like that get away. 
Did anyone see that story where an airline stewardess busted a black pimp flying a 14 yr. old white runaway from Seattle to San Francisco? link:

              9Or as I call it "pinging".
             </p>
             <p>
              It's an old propaganda trick to establish the climate of the public or show the level needed to move forward... and to appear to look like their taking action while the big fish asses are covered and free.
             </p>
             <p>
              The pingback reactions determine their moves.
             </p>
             <p>
              Still I'm happy if a few little biys and girls go free, but the sad thing is they've likely been  groomed to accept this and know no other life. (Stockholm syndrome)
