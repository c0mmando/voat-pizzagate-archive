            Hmmmm.  From her website:
"0017_Brio Photography
Brooke Axtell is the Director of Communications and Survivor Support for Allies Against Slavery, a non-profit devoted to ending human trafficking. She also founded Survivor Healing and Empowerment (S.H.E.), a healing community for survivors of rape, abuse and sex-trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            As an advocate, Brooke supports survivors through their recovery process with a focus on creative expression. Her work as a human rights activist led her to speak at the United Nations and the U.S. Institute for Peace.
           </p>
           <p>
            She is a member of the Speakerâ€™s Bureau for Rape, Abuse, Incest, National Network (R.A.I.N.N.), the largest anti-sexual assault organization in the U.S. Brooke, also, serves on the advisory board of The Refuge, the first long-term therapeutic care program for survivors of child sex-trafficking in Austin, Texas. She spoke at the 2015 Grammy Awards. Her speech has been shared around the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Her work as a writer, speaker, performing artist and activist has been featured in many media outlets, including the New York Times, LA Times, Rolling Stone, Time Magazine, Wall Street Journal and CNN. Brooke has published several award-winning poetry books and released three CDs of original music to critical acclaim."
           </p>
           <p>
            Those organizations she works for- are they the kind that are just a front for trafficking?  Didn't we find stuff on The Refuge?  I hate to say this, but if so, she may be a recruiter.

            I'm suspicious of that too.  Maybe she's clueless to they're most likely being involved in trafficking - Katy probably mk ultra or illuminati etc.

            she could be attention seeking though?
