            On the same day, Aug. 4, 2009, that Bill Clinton was in NK, posing for the picture with Kim Sung Il on the white magnolia rug that Q has posted several times, Hillary launched a 7-day tour of Africa. On Aug. 5, The Witch visited the Kenyan Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) in Nairobi, Kenya, and
            <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/1144020855/clinton-step-up-research-for-food-security">
             announced
            </a>
            that she
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             wants Africa to invest more in research and technology to tackle food insecurity. Speaking at Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (Kari) yesterday, Mrs Clinton announced a $3.5 billion grant from the US Government to develop agriculture in various countries. Clinton painted a grim picture of the global food crisis, saying chronic hunger affected an estimated one billion people, with one in every three victims being African.
            </p>
            <p>
             Could this be connected to the "slave gardens" Q was talking about and growing people as a crop? Was Bill Clinton helping to launch a people farm in NK while Hillary launched one in Africa?

             Please note that the lady in blue behind Hillary at the Kenyan Agricultural Research Institute is the activist Wangari Maathai. Another picture

             with William Ruto, then Kenyan Minister of Agriculture.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wangari Maathai was an environmentalist who started the
             <a href="http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/media-that-set-us-free/the-green-belt-movement-the-story-of-wangari-maathai">
              Greenbelt Movement
             </a>
             in Africa, planting trees.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In the mid-1970s, Maathai, in an effort to meet the basic needs of rural women, began to plant trees with them. Her non-governmental Green Belt Movement has planted 30 million trees across Kenya, many of which still stand. In 2004 her work was internationally recognized with the Nobel Peace Prize.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Now, I hope her work is as innocent and wonderful as it sounds, but maybe we should dig (pun intended) a little more into the life and career of this lady who was so beloved by people like Oprah and the Obamas.

           <p>
            FIRST: Can we establish that NK has been portrayed by the west as an extreme form of dictatorship? Examples of this include documentaries showing families must have a photo of their beloved leader and fawn over it. All US reporters and travel groups MUST be accompanied everywhere they go. Kim Jon Il's funeral required all who attended to cry hysterically. Kim Jon Il had his relatives eaten by dogs. Etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            SECOND: In the context of the above consider this. About 5 years ago I watched a video on I believe LiveLeak which began apparently right after 2 women had parked and exited their car and had been approached by 2 North Korean police officers. (Yes, I said women and yes I said car.) The policemen never spoke a word during the 3-4 minute video in which the women both screamed at and continued to shove the men repeatedly. At the time, I found it unusual that these women could exhibit such disdain for the law, assuming they had committed a simple parking violation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recently, I learned that communities of people into extreme sports can't wait to go each year to NK because it has the best spelunking. At the same time I learned that Iran has 9 world class ski resorts. Shhh.
           </p>
           <p>
            FINALLY: I noticed years ago that during apparent periods of slow news, NK would suddenly threaten the US to continue it's nuclear program or with even direct attack.
           </p>
           <p>
            My theory is that geopolitics in general is far friendlier than is reported and the world is not divided by national boundaries, but security clearances.

            When Q mentioned flower and deflower, it made me think of my Grandmas garden, was reminded of it 3 dys ago with bone meal as to what you can do with bones
           </p>
           <p>
            When a plant flowers, it is a sure sign of seeds being made, as in the next generation of that plant, being dormant until planted next season
           </p>
           <p>
            So I took Flowers as being the next generation, being children
           </p>
           <p>
            As for deflowering, could that be sterilization?
           </p>
           <p>
            I read a story how they put sterilization meds in  innoculations in Africa

            The girls that were journalists doing story on sex trafficking got arrested in North Korea. We're freed by obama or state department ? Same girls in pic with child and pizza,  captioned it doesn't get better than this. Also  one of the girls is sister of someone on the veiw, and my memory....they basically may have been helping get sex slaves and that was their job that's what it's looking like.

I recently found APACHE is also the name of porn server. Not knowing if that is the same Apache on the secure drop post. Secure drop Aaron shwartz suicides...

               Yes Aaron was one of the inventors of Secure Drop.  The other one (his name escapes me) just died.  Go figure.  Poppies, Mangoes etc.  all Code Words.

                 They are always Sending Subliminal Messages.  In movies and now in paintings.  These are only evident to those that are aware.  Thank you for all your hard research.  I know that I speak for every researcher here when I say that you are one of the best. :)

            The rabbit hole is long and deep.  The famous Korean War "brainwashing" of POWs was a parallel project to MK Ultra in the west.  At the top, the "scientists" reported to the same (((people))).  Much of what is done at Gitmo today was developed in NK.  What NK is now is what the satanists want to do to the whole world.  It was a tedious art house movie, but the reveal at the end the movie "Cloud Atlas" shows enslaved cloned family restaurant waitresses being disposed of at their expiry dates by been converted into food for the younger waitresses in neo-Seoul ... in a unified Korea.

            The North Korean government sells their people as slaves in China and Russia.  They would have no problem giving Bill Clinton and John Podesta some young girls on their last visit to get a better nuclear deal.

            Asia is a major hotbed of human trafficking. TVPA passed in Clinton administration might need looking into.

             “Secretary Tillerson has called on all countries to fully implement all U.N. Security Council resolutions, sever or downgrade diplomatic relations, and isolate [North Korea] financially, including through new sanctions, severing trade relationships, expelling guest workers, and banning imports from North Korean,” a State Department official told Fox News.  THIS is good news, but can it be implemented.  Let's hope so.
