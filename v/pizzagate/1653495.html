            , I'm tempted to agree with you, since I deal with people's post-removal tantrums all day every day. However, it's when the fight goes out of people that it's time to worry. Now, I have to remove this from
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            per Rule 4, because you did not write it as a source-linked, research-backed post satisfying the submission guidelines. You can make a go at doing that and repost here, or post as-is to
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Or, you can add it to our new weekly
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1640929">
             Open Discussion Thread
            </a>
            where you can post unsourced stuff like this on the main board and get comments. The more people who post in it and upvoat, the more it will be seen and used.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe you can start your comment with a headline to make it stand out by typing whatever you want to title it, hitting return twice, writing your comment. Then you highlight the title part and click the 10th button that looks like an H and it will make it a heading.
           </p>
           <h1>
            Looks like this (H1)
           </h1>
           <h2>
            Or this (H2)
           </h2>
           <h3>
            Or this (H3)
           </h3>

            If you are on mobile and can't see the buttons, go to your browser settings pulldown and choose "view as desktop" or "request desktop site."

            Your post will be deleted because you don't have a link and what are you referring to specifically?
           </p>
           <p>
            1) There are shills everywhere so no matter where you go you will find some division caused by them.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) Sometimes people see things differently. We can fight the same cause but disagree on certain issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) There are numerous people who can't stand Seaman who are not shills. They can't stand his ego, ranting, whining, lack of research, no credit given to the researchers, the bitching of all of his accounts being locked out with out proof followed by asking for donations just to talk about others work and his flip flop attitude.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now when you tell him or others how you feel. He says Voat is a joke they are just trying to discredit me. (yes there are many shills but also lots of good hearted people who do some good fucking research)
           </p>
           <p>
            Now if that is what you are referring to than it's just the way it is. We will still fight and research pizza gate but I am not going to lick this guys asshole just because we're fighting the same cause. (still not sure if he even truly gives a shit about this or it's for publicity/money or to be the gatekeeper. He does have some sort of tie to Soros if what I read a little while ago was correct.

            disagreement can be healthy. the truth won't be revealed in an echo chamber or circle jerk. skepticism is healthy and not everyone is a shill for asking questions that seem necessary to them.
