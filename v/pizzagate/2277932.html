<p>Below the living areas, there are tube trains. Tube trains that go to the other underground bunkers.

<p>The last level is the most evil. They have a Satanic Temple down at the bottom. There is human sacrifice going on down there. Every year, over 100,000 children go missing as well as the homeless. He states that these elitists think they are gods. They are polytheists. They worship the Egyptian Gods, the Greek Gods, and the Roman Gods, and they are very much into this stuff.</p>
<p>The crown and the elite are very concerned about the public finding out about it. All these guys report to the crown, such as the Templars, the Bilderberg’s, etc. In the book, “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion”, there is a chapter about the underground cities. In chapter 9 Re-education it states, “if they guess what is going on before the time comes; but in the West we have against this a maneuver of such appalling terror that the very stoutest hearts quail – the undergrounds, metropolitans, those subterranean corridors which, before the time comes, will be driven under all the capitals and from whence those capitals will be blown into the air with all their organizations and archives.” Mr. Kelley pops the question, “What does this mean?” There is a nuclear trap door at Getty. If a million Angelinos decided to come, they will fight them off the best that they can, close the nuclear blast door, and hit the button. There goes the Getty Museum turning into glass, which will close off that elevator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The architects and ultimate inhabitants of these underground facilities are “elite” international and intergenerational satanists. Kelley refers to them as “cavers”, and regards the facilities themselves as “castles” because of their Caligula-like opulence. Much has been published about DUMBs – Deep Underground Military Bases – but Kelley is the first to give us a clear picture of what the writers of the Protocols of Zion called their underground “metropolitans”:</p>
<p>You may say that the goyim will rise upon us, arms in hand, if they guess what is going on before the time comes; but in the West we have against this a maneuver of such appalling terror that the very stoutest hearts quail – the undergrounds, metropolitans, those subterranean corridors which, before the time comes, will be driven under all the capitals and from whence those capitals will be blown into the air with all their organizations and archives. (Protocols 9.13)</p>
<p>According to Kelley, the “crown jewel” of this network lies deep beneath the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. Constructed of thick travertine atop the largest concrete foundation pour in history, the Getty is actually a fortress designed to withstand ballistic assault. It sits atop a hill overlooking L.A. Visitors park at the base of the hill and must take a tram to the main entrance. Inconspicuously located nearby is the smaller entrance to a security corridor. This corridor leads, eventually, to an enormous elevator situated behind nuclear-blast-resistant doors.</p>
<p>The elevator descends to the castle, over a mile underground. The top level is a spa facility of Caligula-like decadence. Below the spa are opulent residences. The lowest level is a satanic dungeon where people are tortured and ritually sacrificed. Radiating outward from the residential section are tubes whereby cavers may travel to other underground locations around the planet via the mag-lev trains.</p>
<p>Of all the “metropolitans”, the one below the Getty is the most luxurious. (Think solid gold commodes to get the general idea.) It was built by the J. Paul Getty Foundation for Queen Elizabeth and now houses much of the loot once hoarded under the Vatican. </p>

            The Getty Center has a vault to house art as well as original materials pertaining to their business of hoarding all the photographs they can get their hands on. This takes a lot of room (think Iron Mountain). If the vault has other purposes besides storage, the waybills and contracts for construction and outfitting would be very strange. And that goes for all underground storage facilities.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is information missing in your piles of conspiracy theories about nationwide underground cities linked with maglev train tunnels... the insane amount of logistics and materials required, as well as workers, to accomplish this. Even if your assertion seems impossible from a logistics and resources standpoint, such efforts require tons and tons and tons of paperwork and employees.
           </p>
           <p>
            We already know that businesses tied to legal matters or even construction firms are HELLA INSECURE, yet no leaks have provided useful info about such things. This is the same deal with NDAs or blackmail material related to brownstone operations (for the benefit of anyone, not just the official 3-letter agencies). I was super happy to find references to the Tilapia Museum at Andrew's Air Force Base in State Department e-mails, but that turned out to be a nothingburger...

            No evidence is presented at any point. PG is littered with circumstantial evidence and relentless series of coincidences. The getty center is just a story about what is below it. And that's it. Give me something or there is nothing.

             Oh I don't know. Hmmm. Try going and visiting the place. Find your way around. No?

            <p>
             PROOF about most things is practically impossible here. If only it were that easy. If you need absolute proof then you aren't gonna find it in pizzagate. It's like a puzzle. You can collect everything and try connecting the pieces to complete the puzzle. If we only posted PROOF here and not leads or possibilities, then we would get nowhere. If there was proof, then we wouldn't need this forum.

            I believe this but then after being aware of pizzagate since it broke on Reddit then was shut down I find it sick and sad hat this could even exist but I believe it. 
Side note: I have a very close friend whose family lives in Missouri and she told me that they were talking about these vast underground cities that exist in Missouri. They said it was sort of an open secret as in many knew but no one knew about why they were built and most know that they can’t go near them without consequences or clearance

            I wish I could be there documenting. Somebody better go take pictures. If you have drone cams get them out. There is no way of knowing for sure unless we get pictures. Sounds like tis is an opportunity to save kids.

            Very interesting that Chelsea Handler had to evacuate her house today because of the wildfires, which she blames on President Trump:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Just evacuated my house. It’s like Donald Trump is setting the world on fire. Literally and figuratively. Stay safe everyone. Dark times.

            Chelsea Handler was evacuated. The fires are at a lot of places in Southern California. Strange fires that slip houses and buildings and leave trees untouched. Just like last month in Northern California.

            I am not doubting all of this is true, but really?  If things are really this bad, and again, I do not doubt that they are, what hope, what chances do we have?  How is insurmountable, indescribable, horrific, nightmarish, all-encompassing evil stopped if not for a Savior?  There is no guarantee, is there?

             The problem with burning down a sketchy house (Murdoch's house is reported to have burned) is that it would expose underground structures. Unless the area is secured to keep out scavengers. So the whole Illuminati burning down Santa Ana with Moon lasers isn't very engaging.

             *I am referring to stories of tunnels linking megahomes in Los Angeles area with each other or the Getty.

              Just think of every state having one of these sort of buildings/structures. Just outside a big metropolitan area/near a state park, etc. I wouldn't doubt every state with the elite's chosen ones have a bunker like this one in California.

               Most definitely. However, given the location of this one, I cannot find one possible reason it could be anything other than what it is. It is rather a hangout point just outside of a very quiet and happy community. There are no other anything's nearby to connect. There is nowhere to hide vehicles that approach...what is it that made you zero in on Vista House? Oculus Anubis is less than 20 miles away and has many many reasons it is suspicious. This is NOT to doubt you, I am interested in figuring out what I missed.

                It was untouched by the Eagle Creek fire just like this structure would be too. Now that you mention Oculus Anubis I'm gonna look into that.

            Yes, Getty Museum has tunnels. I've been in the tunnels myself when Getty used to be a client of mine. Didn't think much of it at the time, but when I went to visit we went to an underground conference room through tunnels. They have some great art at the Getty museum (I'm not talking about weird modern stuff). Hope the art is protected from the fires.

              These demons I believe use the art as a shield...No one wants to harm or molest the stuff that is one of a kind or done by masters and they use that as a defense shield. Gosh I loathe these fuckers!!!

             All of the very expensive art being brought into the place is a major red flag too.

             We already know from many other research threads here and elsewhere that valuable art is allowed customs exceptions and is apparently how many children are trafficked and allowed to bypass customs agents. Alefantis is big into expensive art too remember, and by some weird ass people.

             J. Paul Getty had that museum built on his private property himself before he died. He was an oil industrialist that had his hands in everything and was declared the richest man in the world by Fortune magazine in 1957 (not that that would have been any truer back then than saying Bill Gates or whatever other non-banker lightweight is the richest guy in the world today).

              As in? Getty's entire purpose is to house art perceived to have monetary and cultural value to the history of the United States. Sure, art is a medium used to hide criminal transactions at the very top... but these are mostly facilitated via commercial art galleries and brokers and the percentage of trash art (the more dubious of modern art) is under-represented in their collection.

              The art donation game is a tax haven scheme. If you perceive this to be used for influence, access, etc. you can probably support it by making a list of donors and seeing if it's full of usual suspects.

             Good, glad you can confirm the tunnels. Steven Kelley talks about it and I can't help wondering if it is true. But the way he keeps yelling about it....he must know
