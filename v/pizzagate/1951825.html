<p><strong>In Montreal, there is boy of 8, Nemis Quinn Mélançon Golden, who is a &quot;drag queen&quot;, who is saying &quot;if your parents don\'t let you do drag, you need new parents&quot;:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/06/13/8-year-old-drag-queen-lactatia-says-if-your-parents-dont-let-you-do-drag-you-need-new-parents/">http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/06/13/8-year-old-drag-queen-lactatia-says-if-your-parents-dont-let-you-do-drag-you-need-new-parents/</a></p>
<p>Apparently this child is now known and popular all over the world, even in New Zealand, and \'stole the show&quot; in this drag queen LGBTQ extravaganza:</p>
<p><a href="http://bestkeptmontreal.com/werq-the-world-rupauls-drag-race/">http://bestkeptmontreal.com/werq-the-world-rupauls-drag-race/</a></p>
<p><strong>Are people so corrupted and desensitized that they are not shocked or disgusted by the pizzagate type implications of a small, prepubescent child dressing as a $10 whore and displayed before a crowd of homosexuals, not to mention broadcast on TV? Is this not a direct promotion of the pedo agenda?</strong></p>
<p>Notice the stage name of this child: &quot;Lactatia&quot;-- a play on the word &quot;lactation&quot;--the process by which mammals nurse their young. It comes from the Latin word <em>lacto</em>-- meaning &quot;to nurse&quot; or &quot;<strong>to entice or lead on</strong>&quot;. Do you really think that is just an accidental name &quot;his sister invented&quot;?</p>
<p>No doubt you are horrified to see the parents who are promoting this: <a href="https://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/lactacia-2.jpg">https://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/lactacia-2.jpg</a>

<p><strong>Notice that in each photo, the child is always dressed in Satanic red and black</strong>.</p>
<p>What is more sinister is that <strong>children can be removed by the state</strong> if it is deemed (by some &quot;social worker&quot;) that the parents are discouraging the child from cross dressing or from identifying as trans to their original birth gender, taking no consideration of the fact that one is born XX or XY and that\'s all there is to it.</p>
<p>A Canadian province has passed <strong>a law that gives rights to the government to take away children from families that don\'t accept their kid\'s chosen \'gender identity\' or \'gender expression</strong>. The Supporting Children, Youth and Families Act of 2017, also known as Bill 89, was passed in Ontario by a vote of 63 to 23. The measure repeals and replaces the Child and Family Services Act, which governs child protection services, as well as adoption and foster care services.</p>

<p>&quot;In Canada, freedoms of speech, press, religion and association have suffered greatly due to government pressure. The debate over same-sex marriage that is taking place in the United States could not legally exist in Canada today. Because of <strong>legal restrictions on speech</strong>, if you say or write anything considered \'homophobic\' (including, by definition, anything questioning same-sex marriage), you could face discipline, termination of employment or prosecution by the government.&quot;</p>

<p>Back in 2012, the govt of Canada made it illegal for homeschoolers to be told that homosexuality is a sin, even if their religion says so. One might well ask--how will they monitor homeschooling? Will that become another reason for children to be kidnapped into CPS?</p>

              I don't know the backgrounds of the people in the audience, but what I see is the weird look on their adult faces.  There didn't appear to be any people in his age group.  I wonder how much of  this is an agenda pushed by adults and not children?

            I watched the he/she on HoneyBee's YouTube channel. It makes me sick that anyone would accept this coming from an 8 year old! It's only going to get worse. The kid says that if the parents don't like it, they should get new parents. What a little joy.

             What kind of parents would "market" their child and allow him to be a mouthpiece for the occult elite agenda?
