Curiously, this report continues, US authorities, and while being able to track this Clinton “hit team” since 7 July, only confronted these assassins yesterday—and who before being captured, engaged in a gun battle with US federal police forces firing their fully automatic weapons before being trapped and surrendering just blocks from the US Capitol and White House. &quot;

            This would be hilarious but for the fact that Seth Rich is dead, really dead. He died in a pretty nice neighborhood where town houses sell in the 400,000 to 700,000 range and where you would not expect to see hoodlums prowling aimlessly at night looking for potential robbery victims. I thought he had been at the Wonderland Ballroom after Lou's because Wonderland stayed open until 3am where as Lou's closed at 2am. Wonderland is a known dive with an Alice in Wonderland theme, hmmm as in pedophelia?? It seems to attract a normal hipster crowd and annually hosts a transvestite night. It was within walking distance albeit a long walk for time of night. Since it closes at 3 it didn't really tell you where Seth was between 3 and 4:19 when he was shot.

            "It says that the feds were tipped off and using a tracking device to find the suspects."
           </p>
           <p>
            That's all you need to dismiss this story. This was when Obama was in office. I find it hard to believe "the feds" or the DC police were too keen on finding the real killers. Reminds me of similar effort one OJ Simpson made to find the "real" killers.
