            OP's summary at the time:
           </p>
           <p>
            "I was watching the film "Bad Neighbors" on Netflix last night, when I noticed that for around the entire first third of the film Seth Rogan is wearing this Wolfgang T-shirt (the clothing brand of Tyler the Creator) which contains the odd imagery of 'wolfgang' in the style of what seems to be a cartoonish pizza parlor sign... Under this there is an equation of symbols that seems to depict "Rocket - Pizza = Boy". I found this particularly odd as throughout the beginning of the film while this shirt is worn the characters have sex in front their own baby, decide to take the baby out partying with them in a chant of 'Baby first rave' and then leave the baby unattended in their home for the entire night to join the frat party next door where they stay till the morning getting 'comically' intoxicated on numerous psychedelic drugs, and alcohol. These acts by themselves seemed to me clear child abuse and I found no humour in their depiction despite the film advertising itself as a comedy. Following a screenshot of the T-shirt I typed into DuckDuckGo, "Wolfgang rocket - pizza = boy" and could not believe the results. Link after link to "gay young boy porn videos' on sites like pornhub. I typed in absolutely nothing sexual to receive these results only the simple yet odd symbol equation depicted on Seth Rogan's shirt. These symbols obviously have hidden meaning representing very sinister themes that people are certainly intentionally using. How is this is so open for all to see ?"
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "EDIT: I realized that the porn results are much more prevalent in the search when you type in "Golfwang Rocket - Pizza = Boy". Adding "Golfwang" to the equation brings slightly different search results."
           </p>
           <p>
            ""Golfwang" and "Wang" are actually two completely different entries into a search engine alogrithm. That is like googling "pizzagate" and expecting pictures of actual gates to show up in the search engine.... "Golfwang" is the clothing brand of Tyler the creator, if you search for the word "Golfwang" alone this will not lead you to any porn as you would not expect it to. It is the combination of adding the said equation on Seth Rogan's shirt that alters the results."

            "This post just made me think of a seth rogan side note:
           </p>
           <p>
            Broad City Season 2 Episode 1 "In Heat"
           </p>
           <p>
            Seth rogan guest stars and gets 'raped' by Abby after he passes out from the heat whilst having sex. later in the episode Illana and Abby hunt down an air conditioner in their old dorm room and end up getting high and 'partying' with the dorms current residents except after making out with one of the boys they learn this kid is literally still a kid in high school just visiting thus underage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rape + Pedophilia + Seth = coincidental? probably. a reoccurring hollyweird theme? definitely."

            "The backwards N on his shirt is used when someone is trying to tell you to crack a code. Weird as shit"
           </p>
           <p>
            "from some webpage - The shirt Seth Rogen is wearing in the above image (while playing Mac in Neighbors) is an Odd Future store shirt. It has the address of the store on it; 410 N Fairfax (Los Angeles, CA). I couldn’t find this shirt anywhere; I don’t think it i produced any longer.
           </p>
           <p>
            also ck out Tylerthe creator on twitter.
