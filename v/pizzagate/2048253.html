She was going to be AUCTIONED OFF for porn in the dark web.

<p>How she escaped, I haven\'t read yet but this kidnapping hit a chord with me from what I was reasearching from the Hampstead Case. As we know, after the SF69 dump, several new accts came on here, posted strange vids specifically geared towards Hampstead. But it appears, the common theme they were saying was it is all tied to US as well.</p>
<p>My gut is telling me there is a gigantic human broker ring. Kids, women, men...HUMANS are either lured to them through these modeling &quot;agencies&quot; or actually kidnapped. It is then determined what group they would get the most dollar for: porn, snuff films, scientific research, psychological warfare experiments, sacrifice rituals, organ harvesting...then auctioned in the deep web. Maybe some of these dark, evil buyers use the humans for multiple purpose like porn, ritual sacrifice AND organ harvesting. Two are big money businesses and also satisfies their dimented lives of ritual sex and sacrifice. </p>
<p>Ricky Dearman of the Hampstead case is connected to the royals, used his own kids and has several different &quot;company fronts&quot;. One is media-specifically on line. It also appears he was a model &quot;recruiter&quot;</p>

<p>He also has ties to a building in U.K.- 88-90 which was involved in diamond heist. This particular area of the building (i assume was the basement) had a forwarding Mailbox set up, with MULTIPLE different directors that were set up and switched out.  One of them was Ivor Cooke (there were a ton of different directors. One tied to Oxford, others I haven\'t figured out who they are yet)</p>

<p>Doing a bit more digging, it appears this Mailbox Unlimited was originally set up by Paul Carter. I haven\'t found out who this is. There was also a connection to a company called Tollgate. I came across a vid on YT that almost appeared to be a training vid on how to use a website but it was weird because no one spoke on it. And it looked like a car dealer website ( around 4 months ago, someone posted here on voat a car website that actually had a child in the picture...no car...it was quickly removed off the car website) </p>
<p>Who is Paul Carter?

<p>When these clue first came out, these people stated that this same info ties to Martha\'s Vineyard, look for the Wiki email that says Debbie. </p>

<p>And it has to do with REAL ESTATE. This is where I\'m drawing a blank. Looks like Wyss owns a lot of real estate in MV that could be used for pizza parties, but not sure if there\'s a tie to U.K. </p>

<p>One of the Wiki emails about the map was found at the &quot;Field House&quot;. I found a house for rent on Field Drive owned by Motley Crew LLC. Still, can\'t figure out the connections to U.K. This rental states it has : The garage doubles as a “party room” complete with a ½ bath and Ping-Pong table.</p>

<p>I do know that McDonald\'s which was close to Hampstead case and ironically shut down in that area, is more into real estate than burgers. But commercial versus residential. I don\'t know much about the Ronald McDonald houses or locations

<p>Lastly, I thought real estate in a bigger way like large brokers- Sotheby, Berkshire Hathaway or the like. Maybe connected by both the realtor mentioned in the email and renting out &quot;pizza houses&quot; for use? Then this story broke about the model and being &quot;auctioned off&quot;. A BIG auction house that\'s world wide also tied to art, real estate and has online auctioning...Christy\'s.  I think they maybe worth diggin into. I\'m not sure if Christy\'s own property to rent but they surely have access of properties soon to be auctioned off. </p>

            The Italian and UK police are doubting the authenticity of her story. Even her friends are saying that all she wants to do is be famous. She was still posing for the camera's and i mean posing when she was being interviewed by some reporter. Claimed she was released when they found out she was a mother...ummmm i don't think so. One thing that is odd is how the kidnapper dobbed himself into the police. WTF

            The kidnapper just happened to be Polish? When poland are going against the eu in regards to migrants. I honestly never knew human smugglers were so kind what with not wanting to hurt a mother and all the brand new life jackets and rubber dinghies they give to "refugees".

            I had my suspicions from the off when she claimed they had released her once they found out she was a mother!  Ridiculous, like such a gang would have a conscience!  This is a good breakdown of the BS:

            Regarding the Black Death Group, I'm not entirely sure if it's a real entity, or if this Polish chap is making it all up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a post made in 2015 on a dark web chan by the group:
            <a href="https://imgur.com/a/swP0U">
             https://imgur.com/a/swP0U
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is their pamphlet (allegedly found on the man who took her to the embassy):
            <a href="http://imgur.com/a/70h2e">
             http://imgur.com/a/70h2e
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The artwork used comes from an Anna Hoffman on Flickr, and was first uploaded in 2008. Some sources have alleged the group has been operating since 1994, but obviously, if the image is newer they've gone through some kind of reshuffle:
            <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/annaehoffman/2346548900/in/photostream/">
             https://www.flickr.com/photos/annaehoffman/2346548900/in/photostream/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Additionally, there's something called UD - it's a directory for various websites/services on the Dark Web, and we can see that this apparently terrifying group essentially posted "DELET THIS REE" multiple times after being made public:
            <a href="http://imgur.com/a/pyEqr">
             http://imgur.com/a/pyEqr
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            That's all I've managed to discover regarding them thus far. Seem to be hitting dead ends.

              !!!!!!!   I  POSTED 3 DAYS AGO ABOUT THIS SAME SUBJECT &amp; SOME MOD 'REMOVED' IT, SAID THIS MODEL WAS 20 YEARS OLD, AND PIZZAGATE POSTS ARE RELATED TO KIDS ONLY; I HAD 5 HOURS OF RESEARCH TO ADD ABOUT THE GROUP WITH ARTICLES/ REDDIT POSTS FROM JOSEPH COX , THE JOURNALIST  WHO WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE BLACK DEATH GROUP.

              "I've just seen this article for a day or so. Didn't think it was what you call a typical kidnapping, so i wanted to post it. It appears more like a Pedo/satanic 'snatch &amp; grab' to me!
The article presents the kidnapper as having 2 ways to attempt to get $ ,first from her agent and then from the 'dark web', which one is it? Something seems off here.
- "Her kidnapper allegedly threatened to auction her on the internet while trying to extort €300,000 (£270,000) from her agent."
Either way, this is a pedo/satanic 'rat line' : Milan , Turin

               Your last link doesn't work,  but got me thinking a bit. Stratfor in Wiki has email after email, XL after XL spreadsheets of names and payments made. Has anyone figured out what these payments are for?

            When I read the 2 dailymail articles (the other one is about the victim with an article full of her semi-nude pics, weird), I thought why would that guy turn himself to the police?! It doesn't make any sense. I feel like there's more to this story.

            Also, i just watched the Hostel movies for the 1st time. Maybe the director Eli Roth knows something... also, they are "presented" by Tarantino.

             Thanks for the info. I need to read more up on this model case/story as well. But it doesn't seem too far fetched people are auctioned off to the highest bidder. The movie that reminds me of this is 8 MM with Nicholas Cage. Horrific movie and truly I feel life imitates art on that one.

             And ya, Hostel was sick as hell. Completely forgot about that one. I'm sure there are some sick assholes that like to either watch a snuff film or actually do the killing themselves.

              That movie was so bad I walked out in 8 minutes. Read the comments it's a fake story to get rid of the dark web at all control butt coin etc.. The girls way too happy. and it's such a sickly sweet pizzagate thing to say they gave her back from the black death auctioneers cause she's a mom.

It's a nice place to visit, with lovely shops and friendly people. That is unless you are single, young, healthy and good looking! It's even worse if you are a female of childbearing age. The town has a very lucrative underground and Internet business specializing in selling human organs for transplant, selling babies to loving couples who are barren and auctioning young women into sex slavery. They also have specialty shops which do a brisk business in antiques, leather crafts, custom wigs and used automobiles. The town's patriarch, Jacob, is in control of everything and rules the town with his nephew, Johnny, that is until they kidnap the wrong girl. Unbeknownst to Jacob and his followers, they kidnap a popular, well not popular in the United States yet, Brazilian Hip Hop Star named Bella. What follows is their attempt to dispose of this "Star". Complications arise when her friend and bodyguard Donny turns up in the town looking for his friend Sam who also disappeared. GPS units, cell phones and other modern gadgets, threaten the existence of the town itself. What will Jacob and his followers do? Who will survive?

               The book ''La Chair Disparue'' (1999) and the series it spawned by Jean Jacques Pelletier is the most complete literary work that I know of on human traffic and shadow groups in governments. It ties it all so well over 4 books gradually zooming out on the big picture. Shadow government, crowd control, media manipulation, war, profit...
              </p>
              <p>
               The starting point being a human traffic agent working for the US governments finds his kids emptied of their organs as a retaliation to his work against the mafia groups, the main protagonist gets redpilled progressively the more he learns about the various organisations involved. He first realize how the mafias, usually known to fight for territory, started to work more and more together, with each ''mafia'' owning their own region of the world.  However the deeper he goes into the rabbit hole, the more things unfold and the line between mafia and government starts to blur. It talks of almost all the things we see on this sub, it's way ahead of it's time and was made at the height of the human traffic crisis in Thailand. He spent years documenting for writing his stories which I've always seen as documentaries disguised as novels. It has everything this sub is about, satanic shit (shamanism),artwork trade linked to illegal activities, human traffic and the role of geopolitics in all this.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's so good it would be a great way to redpill people because he makes it so believable with a slow but steady stream of revelations that are actually grounded in reality. Unforutnately it was never translated. I feel like this sub would really appreciate his work.

              This feels like a bullshit story, even though I'm sure a group like this one exists. And the model seems eager to enjoy the publicity of this traumatic event. That's a bit strange IMO. Edit : Yeah I need to rewatch 8mm, cause I don't remember what it's about.

               Ya, thinking maybe this story is a bunch of BS w/this girl, but I'm sure this shit really does happens. And watch 8mm on an empty stomach. You don't see a lot, but your mind takes you there.

                Yeah, the question is : why feed the media with that BS story? I wonder what is the point of it? 
By the way, the comments I tried to post on the Daily Mail article questioning that story were censured.

                I got 8mm along with a bunch of old vids from a friend.  Had no idea what it was about until watching it... omg.  That went straight into the bin when I was done watching.
