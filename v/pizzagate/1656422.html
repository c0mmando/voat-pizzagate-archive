            So I googled "NSA headquarters." The result: Maryland.

            This guy pretty obviously works for the NBA. He's like a real life good will hunting.

            Confirms what FBIanon said, that nobody in the intelligence agencies want Hillary to win (except CIA leadership under Obama)?

            He is clearly Sigint/Crypto related intelligence agent that does seem to learn towards our side after having a good read through.

            He's just saving his job and anonymity. They used all the right words for someone employed in that sector.

            forgot to look at the post submissions but theres nothing there that I think adds anything. he has a habit of getting into exchanges with smug cucks across reddit and being underestimated... and after a week or two of cucks telling him he didnt understand the oh so brilliant nate plastic silver... all while not bothering to mention his own background... he seems to have lost it and posted the most brutal nate plastic smackdown ive seen:

            One clue for you: The author is  ardently pro-Israel
           </p>
           <p>
            "..trying to blame Syria on Israel."
           </p>
           <p>
            Israel is absolutely to blame for Syria. Not only Israel but, yes, Israel.
           </p>
           <p>
            The psychopaths in the Israeli government have long been involved in or behind everything happening in the middle east (and everywhere else). Their psychopaths work with American psychopaths. These days they're actually the same people.  The US was hijacked by that mutual cabal long ago.  This seminal 2008 book on the topic  should be required reading for every American.  "The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy"  by John J. Mearsheimer  and Stephen M. Walt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary had her own goals - power, $$$$, control.  Israel has long wanted to create the greater "Greater Levant". (can be googled) Toward that end, Israel secretly became besties with Saudi Arabia.  The plan, interrupted by the Trump win, was outlined by General Wesley Clark in 2011, "And he said, "I just got this down from upstairs" -- meaning the Secretary of Defense's office -- "today." And he said, "This is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran."
           </p>
           <p>
            If Hillary had won that's exactly what would have happened.  Also, Poland and Ukraine would have been taken out and be taken over by the EU, which would also have lead to taking out of Russia. This is why Russia swooped in the save Syria. They're not stupid; they knew exactly what going on and where it was headed. Russia was the "good guy" in all of this. Trump knows it. While he may appear to some to be a buffoon, I assure you he is not. He uses it to his advantage because then people underestimate him.
           </p>
           <p>
            After all those countries in the ME were destroyed - and that's a HUGE land area - it was going to be split between Israel and the Saudis. What the Saudis didn't realize was that soon after that, they were going to be taken out, too.  Israel would then control the entire Middle East - and it wouldn't stop there,  but I digress.
           </p>
           <p>
            The author is clearly uber smart (intellectually/math/computers, etc, that is) and very well educated. There is NO one at that level who hasn't thought about this for 5 minutes who doesn't know exactly what's going on with Israel.  Israel is 100% responsible for Syria (along with 100% Hillary's US folks).
           </p>

            The only people who deny it are those who are pro-Israel.

             Yes, I agree with all this.  Watch Christopher Bollyn videos to learn how Mossad did 9/11.

            Well, I can't understand sub kernel information and have no PhD in math, although I did do a semester of Advanced Calculus and dated a Several Complex Variables guy 11 years.

             I wouldn't say "no one." I'm definitely interested. He has to be NSA or similar SIGNET (Signals Intelligence, I found out) due to his constant reference of the term along with his understanding of their capacities.

               Are you someone that would be familiar with intel agencies?
              </p>
              <p>
               My understanding of it is that it encompasses agencies that intercept data lines and decipher the information that is being broadcast through it. That information can be encrypted, so you have to be a person that has a deep understanding of mathematical principles to write a code that would decrypt (is that a word?) the information.
              </p>
              <p>
               I mean, it makes sense. You have to imagine that with the level of protection people, the people they would want to track anyway, put on their devices, that intercepting the signals would just be a more logical tactic for collecting intelligence.

                Gotcha. Yes, decrypt is a word. That makes sense, because I am relatively well informed on most intel agency activity, but I am admittedly not well informed in encryption. I was under the impression that 256AES or whatever is virtually impossible for any computer thus far to crack in a human lifetime.
