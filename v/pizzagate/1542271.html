Whilst everyone debates whether the threats were real or not, we also need to consider the sheer foolishness of the situation. The video poster knowing that the person he was talking to is 1) a human trafficker, 2) a pedophile, 3) a rapist, 4) a murderer and 5) 49th most powerful person in DC, decided to ask said man for an interview AND SOON AFTER post an greatly incriminating video in connection to him.</p>
<p>Even if this situation is purely hypothetical, there\'s still something the rest of us can learn something from this. And that is, don\'t ever do what <a href="https://voat.co/user/IsThisGameofThrone">/u/IsThisGameofThrone</a> did. What did you think Alefantis would do as a reaction? Give you that interview you\'ve been pestering him for after you\'ve monumentally threatened his pedofile empire to collapse? Lol...</p>
<p>Whilst <a href="https://voat.co/user/IsThisGameofThrone">/u/IsThisGameofThrone</a> did make a great video it was at the cost of endangering him and his family\'s life. Likewise, Alefantis is now on red alert and probably going to be super careful about anything he does from now on. This will definitely affect the future of our investigation in a negative manner. </p>
<p><strong>All of this could have been avoided if simple precautions were just followed...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Never meet up with Alefantis, Podesta or any other incriminated figure with the intention of discussing Pizzagate or any other topic that could possibly aggravate them to pursue you as a target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never contact the aforementioned regarding Pizzagate that includes on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Email etc. Leave all correspondence to the cops. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you\'ve made a discovery, post it on Voat as an image that can be archived and quickly downloaded. DON\'T make a video where you state your name and use your real voice. If you must make a video make it WITHOUT sound and use a burner YouTube account that isn\'t linked to your real email. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you\'re going to post on Facebook about Pizzagate matters (memes, videos etc) then make your account private and only post to your network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alefantis watches voat and he is particularly attentive towards the most inventive of our investigators. That means when posting, make sure there are NO sources of information that can be tracked backed to your real identity </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As such DON\'T talk about where you live, your personal life, your friends, your family, your job or even your hobbies. Keep all messages strictly Pizzagate related. We are not the only people who can deduce facts from information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can afford it, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN</a>. A good VPN with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)#Tor_Browser">Tor Browser</a> and good anonymity skills will make you virtually impossible to track by most people. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important point is just being smart about what you post. The people we\'re up against will crush you if they wanted to. If they can get away with epidemic levels of child trafficking and other heinous crimes, you think they can\'t murder you as well? </p>
<p>Be a hero, by all means do it, but be an anonymous hero. That is what scares these people the most. The fact that they can\'t pin us down and threaten us. As long our identities are safe, we can keep investigating and building this movement to stop them. If we repeatedly slip up then things will slow down. </p>

            Sadly, I fear that this pizzagate shit is so deep and so evil that when it finally all comes out it will lead to the fall of the united states. When the world wakes up to the fact that the united states federal government has been running the largest criminal enterprise in the history of mankind and that said enterprise included the rape/torture/murder of CHILDREN then the stars and stripes will NEVER fly again. Sad but true. What comes after it, I have no idea, but I and everyone I know would absolutely refuse of be connected in any way shape or form to child rapists. I would never pay one more cent of tax to the government. I will never again obey a law issued by the federal government. I would never again obey an agent of the federal government. I will not acknowledge the federal government in any way. I thank my lucky stars every day that I live in Texas.

            Putin the man and I like and respect him a lot too. However, if I have learned anything from my pizzagate research, its that we are living in the age of deception and NO ONE can be trusted. Not Putin or Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not religious at all but I have a weird feeling that we are living in the end times. This whole thing is bizzaro-world level crazy. Wish I had never taken the red pill.

            There should be an organized effort to educate the community on techniques and what to be worried about. Just general and, maybe if it sticks, more specific how-to's. The do's and don't's of pizzagate research. Disseminating knowledge is the only way to grow the quality and quantity of good faith research exponentially. Want to defeat the shills? Outnumber them. Teach, teach, teach.

            You know, it's really really strange, but every single ridiculous shill comment is made by a member that has been a member for exactly 1 month. Not 1 month and two days ... not 1 month and 3 days ... 1 month. Now what do you think the reason for that is? Zeitgeist?

But, that's Texas for ya... go big or go home.
Not always big on pre-planning though, a he appears to   a  little too much emotional reaction,  but gotta love the spunk.

            I made the mistake of posting on LinkedIn when PG first hit (about 2 months ago is when I posted). Killary is an "Influencer" on LinkedIn and there was a pic of her with many supporting comments and I attacked her about Pizzagate, Haiti etc. and the next day a an "alphabet" agent viewed my profile (not FBI). This agents location was listed in South America so I thought it was odd but its too late now.
           </p>
           <p>
            I researched him and he is involved with many cases in Haiti as well. I have no idea to what degree I am on the radar because I live in a large city where many of these agents live and work so I bought a 9 mm last week. Not much else I can do at this point as he has all of my info now.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have an FBI contact that I did some informant work for regarding underage trafficking several years ago and reached out to them sending an email about the LinkedIn stuff asking for help / advice and mentioned Podesta and the "alphabet" agent viewing my LinkedIn profile and the FBI agent finally replied to my email yesterday after 3 weeks.This person acted like they didn't know what I was talking about and asked for more info. I don't know if I should follow up or just forgot it and keep watching over my shoulder. Any suggestions?
           </p>
           <p>
            I am older (little over 50) now and have had a great life and if it helps save some children or puts more spotlight on these subhumans its all worth it to me if something happens. I am still very active on FB and twitter constantly posting under fake names.  After finding out about this shit and the killing, raping and trafficking of children I have not been the same. I am not afraid to die either.  I pray I see the day these parasites are exposed and punished. Never give up!   God bless you all and I am so proud of everyone.

              I don't know if this looks like somebody fearing for his life or not. How am I supposed to judge that from a video?
             </p>
             <p>
              The point is that this is a hard claim. This should break in one way or the other, and our speculations won't change the direction it breaks.

             I think it was a desperate way of trying to make some lurking youngsters around here afraid , probably already worked with quite a few , I saw quite a few saying Goodbye after the alleged threat and a couple of hours ago there's all this comments on poor James and this whole thing is just to much for him to grasp on and that type of CRAP!

            That is an excellent post, I was thinking of putting up the same today. I watched gameofthrones expose video last night and my heart was racing. This guy should have keep this identity anonymous. I recommend a good VPN, Kaspersky secure connection is very easy to use. 
Tor is also a great browser to use , especially when contacting or digging around any of these alleged pedophile devil worshiping child sacrificing sickos.

             </p>
             <p>
              Notice how these  shit-heads  all have the same convo technique?   I noticed it in the Belgian article and UK article too. 
They use words like  "this is unfathomable",   it's  "wildly unbelievable"     "absurd",       etc, etc, while omitting any comprehensive investigation....  this technique being to attack a person's  confidence with insults and shutdown  intelligent data-driven  investigation.

            "Hi I'm Ryan. I woke up bored this morning so I had a fun little idea. I decided to totally trick my YouTube fans and ruin my reputation and make my previous investigative work into Pizzagate no longer trustworthy. You're not going to believe it you guys! I went on my YouTube account and claimed that I was threatened by James Alefantis! 
I thought I'd really piss off the the powerful satanic murderer that is friends with other powerful Satanic murderers that all have connections! I used my real name too! That way it looked like I wasn't faking.  Don't worry honey, I'll protect you. This was all in fun!
           </p>
           <p>
            So anyways! I took the day off from work and set aside hours to get everything set up! I set up a new facebook account, did some photoshopping, some HTML, thought of a full conversation that me and my friend can send each other in messenger and make it look like it was me and The James Alefantis! Then, I made this great video using all of the things I set up previously!
           </p>
           <p>
            Thankfully I have great acting skills! I acted scared shitless! Ha, it was priceless! I got everyone good by making it look like the phone number I typed in was really JA's phone number. Darn it, they didn't believe me so I had to make a 2nd video and then a 3rd to make it look even more convincing! No biggie. I finally had a little time on my hands because when the family was having dinner, I ran down to the police station and made a police report! That will make them REALLY believe me. Don't worry! I won't get caught for making false claims!
           </p>
           <p>
            I ended up having a great night just like I knew I would. I told a little fib tho earlier. The real goal was to go thru all that work because I didn't want people to believe me. Got ya!! Guess what? Most people did NOT believe me, I was called a pussy, and was told how stupid I was I can't even remember how many times! I was told how weak I was and had so many insults thrown my way! It sure did make my day. I'm wore out and am going to sleep so peacefully tonight!"
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it people. He's not faking.

             It's good but as most VPN there's a big possibility if you are in the US that any vpn company could possibly get a hold of your real IP with simple AGENCY request. , be smart if you don't have the knowledge in cyber security or your country's laws in cyber crime then stay as lurkers there is nothing bad or illegal in that and we still need as many lurkers as possible ,  stay smart stay educated

            this is a fake, they are trying to make money off of pizzagate and in the process are shifting the investigation away from the CF with all that JA bs. We know what he is, he exposed himself enough already and he's gna fall down with the dominos, but remember, follow the M O N E Y. this also is what will make the masses UNDERSTAND.

            Great advice. Thank you. I disagree tho about Alefantis being more careful now tho. I think he's getting scared and has started to self destruct.

            should have been more careful, I think he deserves more respect than some here are giving him. We should see him as a brave member of our family and protect him as best as we can. Speaking of him like he was an idiot, or that he doesn't have what it takes to investigate pizzagate is just insensitive and mean.

            I bought a Wikileaks shirt from spreadshirt for Christmas. Spreadshirt was just recently hacked and sent a security email yesterday saying that some accounts info have been taken...then I tried to login to my email and I'm locked out (finally got back in) 
Might be unrelated but sounds like they're trying anything and everything cause we're so close.

             I think you are very close. Your experience is very interesting. But do not worry too much. Just become more and more attentive in the future and protect yourself all the time. But it would not be good, if people become too scared. Maybe that irritating Alefantis-Videomaker-conversation was set up by the "pizza"-people to scare the researchers down. It was maybe not even Mr. Alefantis himself. It could have been anyone, as far as I can see it.

             Know, that buying a wikileaks shirt is not forbidden, you did nothing wrong.  Keep that: do nothing wrong or illegal. And you will be safe. Know, that the end does not justify the means. This is the strength of the majority, the people on the "right" side. The wrong side is strong. But the right side is the majority and the wrongs have no chance. Yet only if the rights do not fall into the trap and become "wrongdoers", then the game is lost. (There are exceptions though, if something is necessary, to be brought into light. I would say, there could be laws, which protect wrongers so much, and if there is no other way to stop them, then things around legality could maybe in rare cases be justified, I am thinking of Assange and Snowden of course. If the legal system in itself is rotten, like it was already e.g. some 70 years ago in Europe: National-Socialism. Too complicated to discuss here and not on the theme.) I don't know, why I preach that to you, maybe just because - I don't know. Don't want to distract, just to be a kind of "complete" or so. Sorry. It's not personal.

            We should really use this posts as a guide on how to proceed in are professional and safe manner. Those who are serious about this investigation need to exercise caution not only for their anonymity but for others as well. Don't understand IsThisGameofthrones reasoning at all and his reckless behavior gave us an appearance of foolishness and lack of cohesion. Anonymity and cohesion will create an imposing force.

             It is real and I'll tell you why. JA communicates with certain people on this (pizzagate) and has for a while off and on. He's had a hand in getting certain people kicked off Instagram and YouTube when they discuss certain things about him. I know this 100% because I've seen a few of the chat logs and he talks in riddles the exact same way as shown on the YouTube video as he does to the individual who's convos I was sent the screenshots of. He's on here as birdzeyeview. Interesting choice of screenname, as if he's above everyone else looking down. Or maybe at Pegasus on the roof top looking down at the kiddies in the playground.

             I'm already labeled a shill according to

             </a>
             , so I'll just go ahead and say this:
            </p>
            <p>
             Although this could be real, it feels fake to me.
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              This guys reactions felt like bad acting.
             </li>
             <li>
              I'm guessing anyone at a level as high as Alefantis is suspected is well versed in public relations, and wouldn't make rookie mistakes like this.  He has connections for threats
             </li>
             <li>
              Alefantis seems well educated and well spoken.  While I can see him losing his temper and speaking like a dick, I'm guessing he'd be a little more calm and sound more intelligent
             </li>
             <li>
              The guy is actively trying to make money off pizza gate.  I think it's great, and wish luck to anyone like that, but it automatically throws any "controversy" involving you as suspect.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             I hope I'm wrong, hope this isn't made up and that JA really messed up like this, but my gut says otherwise

            And - just in case - please never ever order anything from anybody who promotes stuff regarding "Pizzagate". It could be someone, who just wants not only make out money from this stuff, but collect the very identities, complete with adress and maybe credit card info, of people obviously being critical about pizzagate or those powerful people, who are said, to be involved in it.
           </p>
           <p>
            And maybe some of them indeed are. Just imagine, you were someone of them. Would you not absolutely by any means, want to find out, who is connected with this critical movement? Or shows sympathy for it? What would you do, to collect adresses of people who are against you, who are actively working against you or who are at least interested in the theme, which could lead to your complete ruin? Would you not just try and set up some "cool" stuff, everybody wants to have and is willing to pay for? Thus you could easily and effortlessly find out a lot about your enemies. In case, there is something so evil going on, that is. Be very careful, please. Do not order anything from anybody here, unless you are 100% sure, that this person is legit.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many very legit people working on this and they, I think, are even open for donations or so. One can spot them out, but it takes time and some kind of experience imho. Yet, if you have any doubt about anybody may it be the smallest, do not give away your id in any way. This does not mean, that I mistrust specifically that video-maker. It is just way to dangerous to give away your id in any way. That shop could be hacked, or whatever. And - besides - it could be a good decision, not to go around with that kind of word on your chest, your neighbourhood could spot you and it goes on and on.
           </p>
           <p>
            I see the charm of it, and see, it would be great to show the solidarity with people who work hard for the good side, but it is not the right time to show your strong support on shirts or cups. Maybe it is just me, but anything, which could mean a weakening for this propably really huge thing which is going on and which is so complicated to be brought down, should be completely avoided in the moment. Not to speak about your personal security.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do not stop researching, digging, publishing, posting your findings, discussing. But stay safe and anonymous all the time and for the hard deals, like phone calls or so, just let that do the police or other professional people. You do, what they cannot do. They do, what they can do. Each side does her best.

            While it is true what you are stating, i do not anonymous research and postings on twitter. It is a choice i made. I fight under my own name the 1% NWO because by fighting anonimous will save me some years maybe, but will not stop their end goal of depopulation
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones">
             95% humanity
            </a>
            . 
I also want to disable other people's opportunity to say "Wir haben es nicht gewußt" and if i can know, everybody can.
           </p>
           <p>
            I make no compromise in that, even during the time i had a job by justice department i had a "9-11 inside job"
            <a href="https://youtu.be/jYwFhyT85Nk?list=PL36756D76F7CC4892">
             motorhome 9 years ago
            </a>
            parking on personal parking spots and dropping dvd's on nightshift places, played department sportevents in 9-11 inside job t-shirt, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know they easily bring a complete packed plane down just to get one person, that is THE reason why i fight under real name, (or, atleast like here easy tracable). Even if you are anonimous or complete uninterested you can and most likely will be a victim of them, then just rather with my own clean soul. Just like most sitting still waiting for their beheading, i would not sit passive, if i die, they shall work for it and maybe i can break a knee are something from the beheader(s) in the process.

               Of course we want the number, but it would be unwise for him to publish it on a public forum.  It would be seen as a violation of privacy and incendiary.  Now that he is identified, legal charges are a bigger threat than anything else.
               <br/>
               Anyway if he had the number it would just prove he had the number, not that the communications were authentic.

            @ Vigilantes .You guys are fucking WEAK. Stop acting like your James fucking Bond, you're citizens who are trying to do this case like everyone else. Getting yourself killed won't do shit, don't live through this case to make yourself feel like a fucking god, you're a human, bring your bloated head down to earth, acting like Zeus, how immature! Act like a man, you're not Vendetta, and you'll get yourself killed like a sow.Wanna see a real dude, look at Julian Assange, whom is locked up all day to sacrifice everything to release emails, and here you arrogant guys are, spitting in the face of basic privacy like you're half brained. If you don't like Assange, I can name more, get a damn grip, release whenever you get info, but don't go charging like a buffoon, it's stupid, and so childish. And accomplishes NOTHING.                          Ps: I know I was extremely aggressive, but I had to get this off my chest. I'm not talking about people like David Seaman that make vids, but people in the forum that act like they're going to go and fight Alefantis himself, and save the fucking day like Superman.

             When someone threatens your family, it's hard not to react in anger. It's good advice to keep your cool and contact the authorities first. But if your under an active threat, you should behave accordingly. If this is real, then the gloves are off. and we are all targets now.

              I don't disagree with gloves off, it's just some of the guys are saying privacy and what not is stupid, and are literally endangering themselves even though it helps and achieves nothing, maybe their own pride.
You can be smart, effective, and cautious at the same time, with gloves off as well.

             I believe some of these are strategies employed by the opposition to stoke the fire of violent action. Imagine how many different fingers of the various alphabet gangs are in this pie... FBI, military PSYOPS, CTR, etc. all with slightly different tactics.

             Could work both ways. A lot of psyops have both sides built into them. Look at all the racial shit that's happened over last few years.

            No, dumbfuck. You're supposed to be prepared for this kind of intimidation. The "exposures" must come from people whose mom is not easily accessible through google-kun.

            I think maybe there are people who kind of don't see this as real life and see it as a sort of game or something. I guess it can feel like that if you are at your computer, and sometimes it seems like there are little clues and nuggets of info people have found that were just waiting there as part of a puzzle. But it's important to realise, really realise, like actually have it hit you that t's real realise it's real.

            You're supposed to take care of your (and yours) safety before any big exposures, dumbfuck. The selection is not natural and you're supposed to use your brains to tilt the scale - before you put your dick in the machine.
           </p>
           <p>
            This exposure is a good move but please tone down the "authorities will fix it" narrative. It's embarrassing.

             My my pizza boy, you have quite the insults. Head over to the forum "PJW" also known as Pizza Justice Warriors. You may respond that I'm making light of the investigation, but you're writing absolutely embarrassing stuff, instead of talking like a man and not a boy, you sit here and criticize OP because he's giving you helpful advice, you may disagree, but you don't have to slander this post like he told you he likes pizza. This is a community of investigators, not SJWs. We can fight full force, but to go apeshit on good advice makes no fucking sense, if you don't like it, go elsewhere?👌

            I don't mean to disrespect Ryan but now that I think about it, it seems far fetched that Alefantis would get photos of his girlfriend and that other personal information. Seriously think about it. It seems VERY far fetched that Alefantis would do this.

              Am I right in thinking Alefantis did this all from his car? That's what Ryan said, he facetimed him for 2 seconds and saw Alefantis driving. You can't copy a link direct/save a photo like that from a mobile afaik. You can screenshot but that would mean James screenshotted the images and cropped them into frame whilst driving. I thought it was real but the longer this drags on the more I think it was all faked.

            Ryan posts on at least one Facebook group under his real profile. There are thousands of members in the group and he posts voat threads. Not hard for someone to make a connection. A person may be somewhat "anonymous" here on Voat, but if you're linking your Voat submissions to a Facebook forum before creating a fake profile, you've set yourself up for exactly what happened.

             I think he literally used his main Facebook profile to actually send a message directly to James alephantis. So... not hard at that point to deduce who is messaging you.

              OH...ok I watched the video at like 4am this morning &amp; missed the fact that he initiated the conversation through FB messenger. Ok well that was either ballsy or outright stupid. I'm going with the latter. So he contacts JA, gives him his YouTube channel, then posts the KillRoom video after the fact. JA has still not responded to the AMA requested at that point. Sees the video then loses his shit.

            Yeah, it looks like he was trying to setup an AMA with Alefantis just to promote his tshirt bs. Those guys who showed up and toured comet and talked to Alefantis and friends last month were also like this guy. Easily swayed and not prepared. I think they inspired the gunman false flag so I wonder what false flag this will inspire.

            I disagree with almost everything in this post. What Gameofthrones did paralyses them - they know that their every move is being watched. They know we all have cameras. They know we're are multitudes but they are few. They are shit scared and that's the way it should be. THIS "Likewise, Alefantis is now on red alert and probably going to be super careful about anything he does from now on. This will definitely affect the future of our investigation in a negative manner" IS BOLLOX. Alefantis is now completely paralysed all thanks to this brave soul. He now can't move - hide - remove evidence. HE IS NOW A LIABILITY TO THEM, and we all know what happens to liabilities in your world, dont we James??? He is weak and we know it! Keep throwing stones and you will hurt him - words will not, only hard actions like this will bring justice.

             I agree. This paralysis is also why he cant just come out and defend himself, unscripted. It forces him to act guilty knowing that the tiniest slip up will be noticed. An innocent person doesnt need to watch their words. They can spew forth anything and not incriminate themselves because they are innocent. James cannot do this. Any seemingly unimportant word caught on camera and be used against him in a court of cyberlaw

              It does not matter for the investigation. He is just one of many. This is not gone be concealed. Every move of Epstein will be documented, every connection he will make will be quested. Same for James, Podesta, Marina, etc, etc.

              If it is CIA, Clinton foundation on its own, Global Mafia a combination of those or other parties does not change the (for me) fact that Comet is just one of the multiple similar cells. We now have a insight and education in the matter we (me) did not have prior the podesta emails. I knew/suspected satenic rituals linked to bohemain groove, but now i think it is not older but larger, more open and more powerfull then i thought 3 month ago.

            Your telling us to all hide and cower? That is the absolute most wrong thing you could say!!!! Get out there and fight!!!!!!! If this is real it is the first stone to crack. Talk is cheap - Action = results. This guy is the bravest person on the planet right now and he got results. Make no mistake this is a fight. People have been hurt, thousands of them. Make no mistake, we will have to fight to stop it.

            Yeah sure, that's pretty much exactly the kind of guy I'd want to piss off.  If this whole nest of vipers is in the business of corrupting the system through the means of trafficking/exploiting/killing kids, then fml, don't care about my legacy.

             Absolutely. All these evil old rich men FEAR for their legacy, because even with their money and power no one gives a fuck about them.  No one will remember them kindly.  The world will forget, destroy and rebuild in their absence and humanity will be better for their loss.

            This guy was just a jerk on so many levels that it's ridiculous. I don't know why people are harassing JA. Having numerous forums and sub forums devoted to investigating what JA and JA's friends are doing is enough pressure. But people are actually calling him drectly? Why? What do you they think they're going to get out of him. I'm finding it difficult to believe it's JA that Ryan spoke to. Especially since Ryan didn't report anything to the police. You mean, someone threatens your life and family over the phone and you don't report it? But you come on Voat and blab about it? Without even confirming the phone number is his? I'm not ruling out it's JA. Just don't believe it at this point.

              Oh, dear Lord! He didn't report it when it happened! If you go to the first thread, you'll see people TELLING HIM TO REPORT IT! Now I understand that he started THREE DIFFERENT THREADS? This guy is hopeless. I cringed watching that first video. I'm sure he's a nice enough person, but someone who's a jerk shouldn't do the things he was doing. End of story.

I've done that before and gotten into a lot of trouble for it, so I understand his problem.

                 Excuse me!! I took on an account when pg blew up and reddit pg was banned and came over here. I'd never heard of this place before. The funny thing is that you're accusing me of having a 1 month old account. check your account data, it's one month too. Do you see me calling you a shill for being a member for 1 month. not 1 month and 4days, etc etc.

             The Ryan guy is obviously out of his element and isn't he thinking things through.  Putting "lol" in his exchange and putting little taunts like he already figured out the walls were the same just broadcasts out he doesn't know real consequences in his life. He was scared shitless by the threats and his friends advised him to make the situation transparent to protect him.

             Well yeah it seems to me, that James thought it was funny to hide his secrets out in the open, but he didn't realize we're a bunch of smart perry mason motherfuckers and we will see his hints...

            Seems like some of this would be common knowledge, but people get comfortable with YouTube and seem to think that there is some safety in exposure. While the maker of the video or public comments may be safe because whacking the person would be too suspicious, the family is not safe. It's the ultimate threat and "accidents" happen all too easily. 
I can see where it would be easy to get caught up in being a part of history to expose something like this, but not at the expense of your life and those you love.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good post, good reminder. Be safe...and remain lawful so as not to discredit yourself or the great work people are doing to expose the truth.
