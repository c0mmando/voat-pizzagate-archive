<p>I looked into the ICMEC a little bit more and want to share a few notable things I found.</p>
<p>1)    The ICMEC (International Center for Missing Exploited Children) It turns out that Jeff Koons is more involved with the ICMEC than most people realize. In fact he is on the Board of Directors
<a href="https://sli.mg/NCTZR7">https://sli.mg/NCTZR7</a></p>
<p>2)	It doesn’t end there, the ICMEC has a research wing headed by Justine and Jeff Koons – The Koons Family Institute
<a href="http://www.icmec.org/koons-family-institute/">http://www.icmec.org/koons-family-institute/</a></p>
<p>3)	The Koons Family institute focusses on research into child trafficking and child abuse as well as creating legislation to combat child pornography.</p>
<p>PDF file: 
<a href="http://www.icmec.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Child-Pornography-Model-Law-8th-Ed-Final-linked.pdf">http://www.icmec.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Child-Pornography-Model-Law-8th-Ed-Final-linked.pdf</a></p>
<p>4)	Pictured with the Koons in this photograph is Maura Harty who worked at the State Department from 2002-2008 as Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs. Harty also worked at the Office of Children’s Issues (develops and coordinates policies and programs related to international child abduction) now works as CEO of ICMEC. </p>

<p>5)	The ICMEC was created largely due to the Dutroux Case.
<a href="http://www.icmec.org/history/">http://www.icmec.org/history/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/CuvnMP">https://sli.mg/CuvnMP</a></p>
<p>In this photograph from the ICMEC website we see Hillary Clinton and the text below champions ICMEC’s role prevention of child trafficking, abuse and exploitation.</p>
<p>6)	The board of directors at ICMEC is a long list and I haven’t dug very deep into the other members but something that stuck out was Costas Yannapoulos of Smile of the Child a Greek anti-child trafficking organization (probably worth investigating further).
<a href="http://www.hamogelo.gr/1.2/home/">http://www.hamogelo.gr/1.2/home/</a>
This website is in Greek. I have not read anything suspicious or unsavory about this organization I just think it should be looked into, especially considering what we are starting to see concerning these ‘anti-trafficking’ organizations. 
I did a quick search in English for Smile of the children and the firs image that came up was this one (Smile of a Child).</p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/i7zKTl">https://sli.mg/i7zKTl</a></p>
<p>This is in relation to a fundraiser “Smile of a Child tv”
Maybe it is completely unrelated to “Smile of the Child”</p>
<p>7)	Also, I think it’s worth mentioning that several PDF documents concerning Koons/Koons Family Institute are ‘unavailable’ at this time.
<a href="https://sli.mg/LY47K6">https://sli.mg/LY47K6</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/SLuSE4">https://sli.mg/SLuSE4</a></p>
<p>So, we have ties from the State Department and Clinton to the ICMEC and previous diggers have connected Koons, Alefantis and Brock. </p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1431715">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1431715</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, ICMEC and NCMEC have an obvious bond and through the NCMEC we have connections to Laura Silsby (arrested by Haitian police trying to extract 33 children at the border of the Dominican Republic). Perhaps these connections explain the intense interest displayed by Clinton and the State department regarding Silsby’s arrest.</p>

            Don't forget that Jeff Koons was highly involved in the design of Lady Gaga's album ARTPOP. So now I have to go back and start analyzing videos and artwork of hers. Makes sense why she would put out music and video's about rape when she is probably secretly endorsing it.

            This guy goes to the Whitehouse and has a majority of Greek connections on his FB. He sent the email asking for a "Thelema". There is something to this guy. I know it.

            I forgot to add this - via NCMEC website. NCMEC corporate sponsors include: Facebook, Google, Old Navy (GAP) all with contributions of $400,000 or more. The GAP was part of the 'rebuilding' effort in Haiti (CARACOL industrial zone) after 2010 earthquake.

            More proof that our entire child protection network IRREFUTABLY has very organized channels of communication extending into known pedo circles like : CIA, NCMEC, Booz allen, FBI and FAR too many private organizations with shady backgrounds and individuals on the board.

            Who justified a child kidnapper in NCMEC? Who's lawyer was a KNOWN and indicted sex trafficker?  -Thats not suspicious?  -Thats insane.

            ---Links between Dutroux, Franklin, Finders case. &gt;&gt; Leads to CIA/military connections. This might seem irrelevant on surface but I am about to fig further and I am convinced Jeff Koons will link these 2 threads. So hillary will be linked straight to Dutroux...
