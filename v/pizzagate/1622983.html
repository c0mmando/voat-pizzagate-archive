<p>Well, all of a sudden, Wikileaks has tweeted out three (arguably four) cryptic tweets about &quot;#vault7&quot;:</p>

<p>Many people believe that these tweets relate to 9/11. For example, the third tweet says &quot;When is #Vault7?&quot; It shows a picture of a Whitney F119-PW-100 engine. Wikileaks also tweeted a video with an image of the 9/11 WTC crash and the text &quot;friendly fire.&quot;</p>

<p>Here\'s my theory: all of the #pizzagate activity, and the WL #vault7 tweets, are connected. FBIanon said that they <em>hope</em> and expect the arrests this week, but they are not guaranteed.

<p>Threaten to expose that 9/11 was an obvious false flag operation conducted by Mossad with the permission and knowledge of the neoconservatives in power during the Bush/Cheney administration, to essentially hijack the U.S. military for wars in the Middle East.</p>
<p>WL doesn\'t want to just drop the documents, because it would be hugely destabalizing, and could lead to war, even World War 3. That\'s what FBIanon said too.

            The seed vault may be an oblique reference to the Pirate Server area in Norway, which is deep underground below rock and which contains the servers of Wilileaks and of Assange.

            Vault7? no idea.. "Bld 7" World Trade Complex is also known under the name of the British Bank "Salomon Bros. Building" in London.
The building was completely rented to the U.S. government offices. Silverstein had just taken the lease a few weeks before the event. And Giuliani had built a Security Bunker there, for his office - but against rational logic and many critics, he built it on an upper floor, not in a basement.. Speculation has been: That very bunker was the control station for the operation. Giuliani was said to have been told to get out of there, by his own admission told that the Towers were coming down, before the Towers disintegrated - which implies, at the very least, that he got himself out but did not warn others.

           </p>
           <p>
            It refers to 9/11 - Why ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Firstly because they planted the plane parts - including the alleged jet engine; which did not match the brand of engine which would've been on the "craft," said to have hit there.

            I want you to look at that image again and notice the FASCIA pole laid neatly along the gutter next to the cleanly-severed landing-wheel

            That is their little "calling card" - They love to mock. They love the jokes.
           </p>
           <p>
            I investigated that fascia - style light pole.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was no such light pole anywhere near that area of Manhattan. It was not from that street. They want you to assume and believe that the engine flew down and knocked over that light pole.
           </p>
           <p>
            They may have had some sort of light pole like that one next to the Mayor's Park i.e. "City Hall Park" sometime in the past. And it was saved.  But that was years ago and those with that style weren't even there, at the City Hall Park anymore, at the time. City Hall Park, in any case, is way up the hill from there.

            You can see above by the image list provided that the alleged plane did not even make a clean-cut of the entry hole, yet somehow magically disappeared into the building. They love their "magic bullets?".

            Most of the aircraft fell to the outside as one would expect and stayed outside, which follows some observations by the ancients about physical behavior : ~ "Two things, two materiel objects have their own space ie. don't take up the same place at the same time" - Hume.

            Some people with special sensitivity and neurological systems, can see it right off.. Even right off the TV without slowing it down.. They will see something is wrong and tag it as a  "dramatization" or "dramatic recreation."

            The beauty of this is that is right out there in the open. 
It's right in front of every single person, but just as many can not figure out that murdering Muslims in their homes, bombing them dead for years, is worse then turning them away at the border..,

            It seems strange that they would have to hide something that is already completely out in the open.. But that is part of the point.

            I felt Wikileals was bullshit from the start since most things that are public knowledge, if you bother to check, and obvious - they never bring up.. Assange never even spoke out against the bogus "War on Terror" money - pit proxy war. Webb does admit they were not for the good of U.S. Yeah, the whole "terror war" was fabricated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also Assange was brought up and likely sold from a pedo cult. Anne Hamilton - Byrne "The White Brotherhood"
           </p>
           <p>
            My take on the latest side - swipe by Webb against so - called "9/11 Conspiracy Theory" [lol] is that whoever they were blackmailing, gave in.

            I don't have much more evidence than that. You might want to check out some Chris Bollyn youtube videos, he talks about the theft involved in 9/11 (so do a lot of other videos). But they probably don't have any hard evidence or smoking guns.

             But this "Bld. 7" meme is total red herring.. "Bld 7" was demolished / brought down by its leaseholder Mr. Silverstein. He total the story himself on TV.. So they get the mainstream truthlings to repeat "Bld. 7" over and over as if it were evidence ; when it is not evidence.

            If the thermonuclear explosion was muffled by 70 yards of vaporized bedrock, you betcha, you can find some paper even after the heat, especially considering the buildings are however hundred of feet tall, leaving the top offices almost 1/10th of a mile above the explosion.

             The controlled demolition theory spawned the 911 truth movement. This was possibly anticipated by the perps. At any rate the movement became so popular that it was infiltrated. That's why it's so non-taboo to talk about it. It is now very safely controlled opposition, to keep people from the truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             The movement despises Dr. Judy Wood (for good reason). She is taboo, maligned, trashed, and has no Wiki page (and she should). Jessie Ventura likes her, but was shut up by Alex Jones when he brought her up on Jones' show. Even Fetzer has opposed her (Mr. Freethinker ... although I do like him on some things).
            </p>
            <p>
             If one can ignore the sensational aspects (they can be off-putting) of the below clip, it is a fairly good intro to Dr. Wood.

              There are other names, I cannont remember at this time. People were also viciously attacked for "No Planes at the Pentagon" which in retrospect is extremely obvious.
             </p>
             <p>
              John Judge outed himself as a controlled-op over the Pentagon Plane issue /~05. He was a central figure in the control of the JFK research group for over 40 years. He's gone now. A very "nice" and extremely likable man - certain varieties always are.. They fought against you on two fronts: The Pentagon event an the "controlled demolition" observation.
             </p>
             <p>
              I figured later that they do whatever they can, in their power, to slow down the realization of the true narrative in the awareness of the population. They work on the leaders of research and hijack the followers [ people who read and follow the research but don't do it themselves].

              The 9/11 Truth Movement existed way before the "Controlled Demolition" theory. In fact that theory was fought against viciously by 9/11 "Truthers" who had control of the movement and everyone's ear..

             <p>
              The shills know how to get the attention of the crowd, establish [bogus] credibility in the eyes of the crowd and have the money to spread their lies..
             </p>
             <p>
              If you believed in "Controlled Demolition" you were villified and demonized as a government operative / shill. "You are bad for the movement" they told us..
             </p>
             <p>
              Names? Some "still around" Nick Levis / John Albanese.. All these people who took initial control of "9/11 Truth" called you names, harassed you , mocked you - if you mentioned the anomalies around the destruction of the Towers.. -

              The book is a must have "Where Did the Towers Go?" Though she doesn't go into the exact weapon used, it's inferred by her forensic analysis. That is her training and specialty.. I won't go into the technical details but everyone should get the book -

               Also the "# 7" is a total mind - fuck.  But the controlled-op "truthers" go on and on about it, as though it's the best evidence!

               "#7 - Salomon's Bros. blld, was destroyed by its owner, Silverstein! He announced it publically on TV , no less; And the clip has been up on the Internet for over 10 years, supposedly to show the government / Media story to be a lie ?!
              </p>
              <p>
               ... so miracle of miracles 15 years later they finally announce it..

               The leaseholder claimed it / owned the demolition at the time !

               And we were told it was rigged ahead of time for normal  high security reasons. D'uh. That's how dumb the mainstream 9/11 "Truth " Movement is. And deliberately .

               People who can not put 1 and 1 together think it's a big revelation? 7 was purposefully demolished?

                Yeah this is my most successful post. But I'm not even confident that WL is posting about pizzagate. It could be posting about releasing its DMS in response to the threat of JA losing asylum.

                 Yes, isn't that weird. It is fuzzy isn't it? Time will tell. Everybody's soooo anxious for something to happen, bigly. It was a great conversation outlet, for many. Congrats regardless of what happens w/ Wikileaks, etc.

                  Yes, pizzagate is frustrating because there is a MOUNTAIN of strongly suggestive, circumstantial evidence, and yet still no smoking gun.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And... if you talk to previous SRA victims, they will tell you how frustrating it is how there can be huge scandals, investigations, tv reports, documentaries... and yet nothing happens. We're afraid that will happen again. But, there are signs of hope (I have a separate thread listing 11 data points that something is happening this week.) We'll see.

                   Yes. Sorry to bother you again, can you link to your other thread? Also, Trump is a whole 'nother animal. New sheriff in town. I believe he is willing to risk everything (you should read his old Playboy interview, though he wasn't as religious then as he has become lately), there's a paragraph where he contemplates his mortality and is resigned to it (his Mum was hard-line old-school Scottish Presbyterian).

                   Right now I'm watching livestream the confirmation of Sessions. De Vos already confirmed, we're almost there. Gonna be wild, what's her name in CA (not Pelosi) is bashing him (Sessions) at the moment.

                    I'm the biggest Trump fan in the world. He is smarter than me. But when I see him bomb Yemen, and tweet about Iran, I think he hasn't figured yet that CIA and ISIS are the same thing. He needs to have a long talk with Cynthia McKinney, perhaps with William Engald. Trump also has ties to Israelis and DynCorp too (Feinberg). So the jury is still out.

            Yes interesting idea.  The Vault 7 picture in Norway does look like a server.  And I think seeds could be threats of seeding a torrent of new info or the torrents already sent out.

             The servers of Assange are under rock, way under ground,  in an old military site , bunker. Run by a neo - Nazi "Pirates" something. I saw a vid with a tour of the place.. Creepy, fer sure. [ link is on our Forum which was downed 12 - 10 - 16 ]

            What is Wikileaks trying to tell us by WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHO? Every tweet is a question, but they're not really cryptic, are they? I mean if you can figure out what the pictures are and get answers to them, you can then understand what they're saying.

              WHAT is #Vault7? (picture of a VAULT, or BUNKER in Norway.

            Edit: Found answer to tweet #3. 'When' question : Feb 22nd.
           </p>
           <p>
            This could mean, prepare yourselves and get to your bunkers, or go underground because on Feb 22nd, Germany and possibly Norway? is going full attack and going to bomb the shit out of some place or country, possibly Russia?

              I am becoming suspicious of that acct.  he subscribes to some anonymous twitter handles that aren't ok.  Also one video has what looks like a photoshopped pic of Trump behind Satanic symbol.  I think that it is a PsyOp although initially I was hoping for better things from that channel.

            Granted the FBI was very obviously involved in the 1993 original attack on WTC which either didn't do what it was supposed to do in leading to an attack on Iraq, or it was a practice run.
But why would 9/11 be a threat to the FBI?
Clearly, Cheney was orchestrating the day -- protected by the Bush family -- but certainly it was a military operation -- maybe Blackwater(CIA) -- where they got to test some unconventional stuff, I'd suggest.
           </p>
           <p>
            FBI might be threatened in the cover up?

             It's not so much the FBI, but the CIA/JTTF/Clinton/Bush cartel, which seemingly control leadership roles in the FBI and DOJ, like McCabe or Kadzik.
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of the FBI seems to be good guys, who were battling the DOJ and rest of the government. Here is a mainstream source on that:

             Hey, I just posted a comment very similar and I hadn't seen yours yet! Thanks for the When tweet answer. I didn't know this event took place on Feb 22. Could the second tweet, 'where tweet' answer be Germany? If yes, then maybe WL is saying this: Prepare your bunkers, go underground, because on Feb 22nd, Germany is going full attack and bombing the shit out of some country (probably Russia)?

            K, First time I've done research here so please bear with me. Recently, Wikileaks has tweeted some really cryptic questions with even odder images. What is the purpose of these tweets?
           </p>
           <p>
            The first question, What is vault seven. is with this image of a doomsday seed vault in Norway.
            <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Svalbard_seed_vault_IMG_8894.JPG/1280px-Svalbard_seed_vault_IMG_8894.JPGJPG">
             https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Svalbard_seed_vault_IMG_8894.JPG/1280px-Svalbard_seed_vault_IMG_8894.JPGJPG
            </a>
            . Also, note that the FBI collects its research in groupings referred to as vaults.
            <a href="https://vault.fbi.gov/">
             https://vault.fbi.gov/
            </a>
            The latest FOIA releases from the FBI came in six parts labeled 1of 6 to 6 of 6.. I believe Wikileaks is asking the FBI, where is part seven, indicating that there is more than what the FBI has released as part of the FOIA. Perhaps they are insinuating that Wikileaks itself is a vault of information, in the sameway that the FBI library of FOIA releases is called a vault. Also, a doomsday seed vault, like the one pictured in Norway is a kind of life insurance for the planet, The information that Wikileaks has is a kind of life insurance.
           </p>
           <p>
            The next question is Where is vault seven? Where is the rest of the relevant information of the emails and information regarding corruption. The image is this:
            <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/research/holocaust/images/111-SC-205409-xl.jpgJPG">
             https://www.archives.gov/files/research/holocaust/images/111-SC-205409-xl.jpgJPG
            </a>
            This is an image of Nazi loot vault. The gold, paintings and other priceless things are on record as the largest store of treasure ever found. I think Wikileaks is telling the FBI, that they, wikileaks has this 'treasure' would of course be a load of information. Perhaps the 650k files on Wieners laptop? That would be the biggest wikidump of all time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The last question, When is Vault 7 is illustrated by this image:
            <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3-N_BxWEAAoS8u.jpg:large">
             https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C3-N_BxWEAAoS8u.jpg:large
            </a>
            This is an image of an engine, which is the engine for the Lockheed Martin F-22. I believe that February 22 is the answer to the question when. I believe that Wikileaks is saying we have the files from Wiener's laptop and if you don't release it by this date, we will. So, what do y'all think?

            I have information here that may help move this forward. I was deep in this year's ago, you need to look for building 6 of the world trade centre complex US Customs House (Building 6). FEMA footage leaked by Kurt Sonnenfeld in 2009 official video videographer and one of the first people allowed on ground 0.

            - not sure about source just grabbed good like for reference, seems to do fair summary.
           </p>
           <p>
            People believed that wtc 7 had vaults which turned out not to be the case they were using a secure vault under building 6.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vaults below building 6 were used for storage for many important things, and documents relating to many investigations. Vaults were found intact, open and empty. Whoever did that knew well in advance, it would be the smoking gun of detailed foreknowledge of the event.

             Yep there was also a truck with gold found abandoned going out via a tunnel.. A few days later people came to retreive it. Nothing much was said publicly, just that it was on it's way out of the area when the event , dustification of the Towers, happened.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also  if you look into the Kennedy family: there was an archive there of their photos. It's looks like much of their family history was falsified and that the vault that had the cache of their documents / photos was un-broken but empty.. The claim was that the photos were burned.. [ If you are interested in the family photos of the Kennedy's , the forensic evidence therein, and the JFK event of '63 , I suggest this article -

             -]
            </p>
            <p>
             If you peruse Dr. Judy Woods book, "Where Did the Towers Go?" you will find the evidence which shows that the area under the Towers was not highly impacted. The Mall area below the Trade Tower Complex  was still functioning/available, no collapsed roof below ground!. -

             Right, it looks like the vault was under building 6, not 7. But see the correction at the end of the NYT article:
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/01/nyregion/a-nation-challenged-the-vault-below-ground-zero-silver-and-gold.html">
              http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/01/nyregion/a-nation-challenged-the-vault-below-ground-zero-silver-and-gold.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, if 6 has a vault, it's possible that 7 had a vault, and it just isn't well publicized.
            </p>
            <p>
             The other theory for vault7 is that it refers to a seventh batch of FBI leaks from the FBI records vault. But I still prefer the WTC vault theory. I will watch the videos.
            </p>
            <p>
             BTW, it's pretty clear that it was Mossad. Watch a Christopher Bollyn video on youtube.

              Mossad appeared to play their part but there were many who stood to gain. Gold and silver are nice but why not take power if it's available to you.

              In 01 there were always some form of physical off site data backup. This is where they stored their data. Kurt found only dust in the opened vaults used by the occupants of wtc 7.

               There were massive bank transactions run through the computers there, within the Two Towers,  in the minutes between the explosion and the dustification. Some hard drives were salvaged and examined at great expense, but the details of what was found was not released. The Insider Trading that took place the week before was traced to Deutche Bank by the 9/11 "Commission" but they rejected the evidence since the bank was not "terrorists" - they claimed.

                Seems to me someone got greedy and sloppy, I doubt they have many friends but id say they probably had a lot of pizza related blackmail footage of a very wide range of people, if we are to accept the legitimacy of cia brownstone operations.

             Condensed bombs, massive fireball, radioactive residue.

            <p>
             So a uranium bomb basically.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe they were real nukes only because the science is pretty clear here.  Occam's razor literally comes into effect.
            </p>

             The big picture of evidence and scientific theory supports the atom bomb idea.

             It just a uranium cap in a rifles chamber hitting a uranium anvil.  It's a heavy element.  It release energy in the form of a big shockwave and fireball with a br of radiation.  It wasn't
             <em>
              that

             big.  Mostly heat energy, fireball, fire.  Most Hiroshima building were weak construction.

              If your going the "occam's razor" route, you have to at least use it right.
             </p>
             <p>
              Occam's razor actually suggests that nukes were/are hoaxed in order to give a super power more perceived power and to end wars before they start. The science might be there but that doesnt make nukes real and practical.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you look at the whole story of the Manhattan project, everything just screams BS. Its a nice fairy tale happy ending that turned out just swell for the Allies. Convenient they had Freemason Einstein solve their Nuclear dilemma on the last minute, constructed a Hyper-bomb with said science and won the war for them with just 2 drops. Occam's razor suggests that its way cheaper and easier to just hoax the thing instead of actually building it using untested cutting edge experimental physics.
             </p>
             <p>
              Almost everything we were taught about WW2 is complete shitbull. From Hitler to the holohoax, you have been spoon fed garbage since your pre-k ball-Earth indoctrination began before you can even say MaMa.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's entirely plausable, even probable that the Nuke hoax was carried out as one of the biggest successful psyops in human history. Governments lie with impunity to perpetuate whatever agenda they have on the table. It really shouldnt be a surprise to you or anyone even remotely awake.

               It's possible, but I've studied college physics and seen tons of Hiroshima evidence first hand.  That uranium can make a nuclear reaction, and that the allies could have had one (Hiroshima bomb is not big deal, pretty small a-bomb) is not unreasonable and fits the existing evidence strongly.

                You've seen 'WW2 in color' right. Soooo, they gave thousands of Joe Blow soldiers cameras that film in color with a higher picture resolution than the camera they put on a plane to film the first ever nuclear explosion used in combat that scientists will want to study?  A mushroom cloud superimposed on top of the first one creates the low picture resolution because they had to overlap the film in those days. No radioactive wasteland for a half life of how much?

            The past decade I have gone from a news watching American thinking the worst that was in DC was some pork barrel spending, to extreme pessimism and anger regarding the "fairy tales" of 9/11, Sandy Hook, the Gulf Wars, Libya... as well as Crichton, Breitbart and Clancy's untimely demises. The fact they kill even authors who write against their agendas, for heaven's sake, is insane.

              Crichton died unexpectedly of lung cancer in 2008. His family was devastated.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was 1/3 the way into a sequel to "Next", his awesome cautionary tale regarding gene patenting. Gene patents are a HUGE murky moneymaking business.
             </p>
             <p>
              He redpilled thousands if not millions with State of Fear regarding man made climate change. That was my personal favorite.
             </p>
             <p>
              Every book he wrote was awesome. The man was brilliant and has no problem exposing the horrible things going on in science and tech. He was wildly popular, as you know.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most people only discovered his death when googling when his next book was coming out! A hugely popular author, on the level of Stephen King with his fans, and his death barely made news.
             </p>
             <p>
              The CIA can give people disease to kill them. I know it sounds crazy but it's true, and George Webb mentions it in his videos- he maintains Steve Jobs was killed by the CIA too.
             </p>
             <p>
              You are right, it is almost impossible to even find discussion of the idea this happened online or any posts questioning  his abrupt unexpected death from cancer.

My point being, this shit about the truth being destabilizing, yeah so what?  It is the price to be paid for people believing so much bullshit.

            What, flat earthers will freak out when they find out we do in fact live on a globe?

            People that denied the existence of the Illuminati will freak out when it is exposed globally?

            People that think man walked on the Moon will freak out when that is acknowledged to have been a hoax?

             So you can see that NASA is a hoax, but not that the purpose of the hoax was to fake the round shape through a portal? Look up Bart Sibrel's documentary 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon' They were in a high altitude mock up. Same Mason's who are all tied up in PizzaGate did the moon stuff too.

              Provide your personal details and I will see what I can do about raising funds to send you down to the 'Ice Wall' in Antarctica personally, so you can tell us what lies beyond it!  Everyone is dying to find out.  Good luck, and I hope you enjoy the fame and fortune that awaits you!

            When the destabilizing shit happens I want Trump in power.  I don't want a liberal or neocon (but I repeat myself), I want a populist with America's best interests at heart.  In 2 months he may be dead, especially if the powers that be know something like this is coming out, getting rid of Trump will probably be mission #1.

             No, he's being protected for a reason. Also, He was for Hillary! But events overtook them. There is no reason to kill him, but he may retire since he only signed up for a two - year acting gig, and getting the job wasn't part of the plan  [fake assassination is possible. They have no reason to get rid of him, actually].

             You can never really know how corrupt Trump is. But it seems to be a really good sign that the CIA, Hillary Clinton, National Review all hate him, and he's writing letters to shut down Federal Reserve operations.

              I had a humorous but relevant thought when I realized hey- when huge number of senate and congress creeps are arrested- there will be a huge number of open seats. There will be a lot risked in those elections! Could be good or could be horrible. At least opens chance for the D and liberals to participate

             I thought so but someone else corrected me. That's Norway. So, if it's talking about Antarctica, then that's a pretty big jump.

               I don't really know. It's the first vault7 post, and it is the most mysterious. Could be related to Antarctica. There are conspiracy theoriests who talk about the elites wanting a breakaway civilization that nukes the world and then lives on in tunnels (Denver, Switzerland, etc.).

              <p>
               Watch this and you'll see how suspicious some of this stuff is:

                 Yeah just search youtube for "Switzerland occult ceremony." Comes right up. There is also another great video where someone goes minute by minute, analyzing all of the occult/blood imagery and code.

              Can't vote in de Vos without Sessions' vote.  It would be his last vote before his swearing in and it is a squeaker.  Besides, de Vos is Prince's brother.  She is fully red-pilled and aware of the left's agenda.  That agenda is the foundation of the NWO - "Give me your children, and I will give you the future."
             </p>
             <p>
              The left doesn't want the sister of the Holy Christian Crusader, Prince, stepping in to start dismantling what they have built the last 30 years.
             </p>
             <p>
              And for them to go public with this, would only beg the question of someone with half a brain - "why should that have to do with de Vos?".  They know why...

                Every GOP vote is needed, which will still result in a tie, in order to confirm de Vos.  VP Pence will be the tie-breaking vote, as he is the President of the US Senate.  Also, one of those needed GOP votes belongs to Sen. Jeff Sessions, the inbound Attorney General.  If he is confirmed and sworn is as AG prior to de Vos, his seat is empty, triggering another constitutional crisis and without question, delaying the vote for possibly months.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Dems know what is about to come.  Even if they personally are not complicit, this rampant corruption and pedophilia is probably well-known among everyone on Capitol HIll.  They are delaying the inevitable.
               </p>
               <p>
                And as much as I would like to see de Vos get sworn in, Sessions needs to take the helm now!

             That's why I never trusted Wikileaks. Also Assange was brought up in a child trafficking cult.. Anne Hamilton - Byrne.

             Revealing to the world that Mossad did 9/11 could potentially:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              destroy the credibility of Wikileaks, if the masses of people simply refused to believe it (for example, for emotional reasons, in response to a CIA counter-message)
             </li>
             <li>
              trigger a civil or foreign war, with gun loving Americans turning on their country, turning on Israel, or Israel feeling very threatened and vulnerable
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             That alone would justify keeping the information secret, at least for some time.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is also amazing blackmail material, which could help explain why Assange seems to be alive and not corrupted (although it is debatable if he has been corrupted).

             I honestly don't know enough about Israel/U.S. military confrontations to say. It just seems like, if country X discovers that country Y performed a giant false flag to kill 3000 people and hijack country X's military, then country Y might expect country X to attack it. And then country Y might want to do something to stop/preempt/defend such a retaliation.

            It is not a direct threat. The "threat" is a hypothesis, which is trying to explain four different WL, which are otherwise cryptic and bizarre and confusing. Three of them mention "vault7", one of them has a picture of a seed vault in Norway. One of them has a picture of a Nazi gold vault. One of them has a picture of an airplane engine, which has a model number that is basically 9/11/01 in reverse. That tweet, with that model number, says "When is Vault7?" - note the use of the word "when". There is another tweet, which does not have the #vault7 tag, which has a video with the 9/11 WTC crash on the cover, and the text "9/11" and "friendly fire."

            Is this smoking gun proof? Of course not. It's a working theory and incomplete circumstantial evidence, like everything else on this forum.

            Firstly, I'm going out on a limb saying this (about nuclear weapons/bombs) so I want to be careful not to offend (and be called a shill). Secondly, I was only trying to give some hope to the OP who feared such an exchange and thus annihilation (of family etc.). Thirdly, if true the footage is fake (it would not be the only fake footage we've been fed).

              Yes, Firebombs.. Look at docu "Fog of War" on McNamara ; Listen carefully, he will not speak about nukes, but states it was firebombing that was "worse" -

              - I saw the film when it was first released in NYC and the director was there. He said you could not tell from the movie itself but that 99 out 100 questions asked the General, only one was answered.. Most of the interview was silence. The director has to work a long time to compile an entire movie.

              Some experts have plainly stated that it simply looks like massive fire-bombing. But it is just my opinion after having checked into it a bit. Seems plausible for several reasons but that's just me. Edit: By footage I mean films of nuclear explosions, tests, not Nagasaki.

               The Hiroshima bomb wasn't
               <em>
                that
               </em>
               big.  The shockwave wasn't that powerful, but Japanese construction was weak.  Mostly, the release of energy by the bomb took the form of a massive fireball.  Hence, why it all looked like firebombs.  The radioactivity and radiation disease was very real.  And the eyewitness testimony was pretty consistent.  A single bomb on a parachute, exploding in the air into a point of white light that became a fireball brighter than the sun.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's actually fucked up because unlike the pure energy (allegedly) annihilation of a big H bomb, the Hiroshima bomb was just a big ol fireball.
              </p>
              <p>
               An entire downtown area was engulfed in it, and people who were somehow sheltered still became engulfed in pure fire.  There were tens of thousands who jumped into the river to put out the flames and the river ended up filled with bodies.  Look it up, not a pretty picture.
              </p>
              <p>
               Actually in real firebombings small rivers would sometimes actually boil so people would jump in them to put the fire out only to be boiled alive.  Babies would melt and fuse into their mother's backs.  Peoples' skin would fall off from like "5th" degree burns.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sick shit.  At least the Axis used gas and bullets to kill people rather than recreating a literal inferno on earth opening the portal to hades.

                There are big things we've been lied to about. There is one
                <em>
                 really
                </em>
                big thing. If you can handle it, go for it.
                <strong>
                 If not, I don't suggest it.
                </strong>
                If you have a spiritual grip, the 'ride' is easier. As for me, I DO NOT want to be lied to anymore.

             it would be nice to believe that. but so much other horrific shit is real, a big nasty ole bomb seems the least of it. I'm not so afraid of nuclear war as much as more incidents like fukishima. All our old nuke plants are ticking time bombs and we enthusiastically put them in our front yard.

             There was a story in the National Tatler in 1974 that David Rockefeller bought the gold that was in fort Knox through back channels at the federal reserve. This story was relayed to them from an anonymous source that overheard Nelson Rockefeller telling the story. Nelson Rockefeller’s executive assistant (59 yo Louise Auchincloss Boyer grandaughter of Col House - the real president during Wilson’s presidency that brought us the fed (income taxes and the precursor to the CFR) and cousin to Jackie Auchincloss Kennedy) was later found to be the source and died from a fall from her hi-rise apartment in NYC three days later.

               This is probably also true. The Federal Reserve has no money and simply prints trillions to fund DynCorp and CIA.

             Thanks for posting here. I was wondering what those WL tweets were in regards to. I also immediately thought Antarctica, but after releasing volume 6 of the emails, it makes more sense that vault #7 would also be some type of file disclosure.

            Woo! My favorite Scary CopyPasta cum real-time Political Thriller author. Never been gripped by something so hard in my life. That most of it turned out to be real was just a bonus on top of that first insane experience.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope this new round is true too of course, if only so we get the whole drama in book form at the end of all this. It's going to be stunning reading. Jack Ryan can go suck a fuck. This is Le Carre level shit, routing out traitors and monsters in your own ranks.

             Amen.  Truly has to be the most epic thing that ever happened happened on the 'net.  Also, I think this really is FBI Anon and not a LARP.

             According to multiple reports, they are not even waiting for that. Arrests could happen Mon/Tuesday, Sessions is hoping for confirmation later this week.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, if you arrest Democratic Senators, you make confirmation easier, yes? Not sure if any of these reports are actually true.

               Seriously if there are republicans then absolutely good point. But you got to take the worst criminals and ignore their affiliation. And don't get me wrong I bet there's at least ~10 republicans in the list...

                I agree here. They have to make bi-partisan arrests; And there is plenty to choose from, certainly.

                People are brainwashed, but likely too lackadaisical and apathetic to create a civil war.. If there is a "civil war" - It will be for TV only /staged to make an excuse for business as usual.

                They are brainwashed to the extent that they will claim they are partisan arrests.. Can't you see that from 10 miles away? The Mass Media control is affective.

                Pete Seeger was a Liberal and Communist but wrote some great songs. One line I remember is:
"Who knows but G-d has  a plan for the people to win, with a little this and that"

                 Arrest them. Actually let's arrest every fucking one of them that has commited either crimes against children, violent crimes, or pay to play and drug schemes as well. Get rid of all of the truly corrupt ones. Which is probably hundreds of them...

                The policy is the same no matter who is in office. institute fear, feed the corporations, protect (and bailout) the banks, use taxpayer money to support illegal wars (don't forget the kickbacks to CF and other cronie NGOs), increase mass surveillance, drain state &amp; federal pensions, ignore election tampering. Just look at the last election, the only popular candidates were Trump and Bernie (populists), and DNC stole the nomination from bernie, so don't look for either party to support the people's interests.

                    That is just what people are told by the Powers that Be. They convince people of that so they will never be caught and so it will always be their "business as usual" If things are set right, no one will be pissed.. Everyone will be releved, joyous and hopeful not to be subject to their vicious nightmare projection. This is another fear-porn, another nightmare projection onto peoples' minds.

                    Can you prove that? That is just an excuse to keep the liars fooling the shddpies.. If the perps were caught. No one would be pissed. If the perps are still smiling on TV , yes, people might be pissed - especially at the heads of the TV networks and the Media Corporation. They are lynch pin to the operation. In Africa, it is said, when a population found they were punked with the ";War of the Worlds" fake alien broadcast - are said to have torn up the radio station. Americans though, no, very passive. They may or may not have really "bought" the broadcast - they were just told everyone bought it. People are told what "everyone believes" what "everyone will do" and it's not usually correct. Because they are liars, know hypnotism, know how to suggest things and know how to work a crowd.

                     You make a fair point. And I'm not actually completely certain that it would happen. But I don't think it's impossible that it would happen. Don't forget there's an entire world of corrupt out there. If we as a nation collectively get out heads out of our asses we are now at odds with 95% of the first world.

             A comment by Morgan Reynolds from over 6 years ago; It's coming up on VOAT because folks are claiming "It will not be good if the truth comes out. There will be civil war" which is of course is the Propaganda promoted, since the JFK, among insiders to keep their own quiet

             "Second, what really is the worry? Isn’t this what we are working for, the prospect of justice obtained by exposure of the truth, the prospect of stopping the killers in their tracks? Yes, it is. Anyone fretting over the triumph of truth should ask this question: what do you do with a family dog who kills a family member? The dog was acquired to protect the family and instead it kills someone it was supposed to protect. The services of such a dog would no longer be required, to put it as gently as possible. That’s the situation we have with the DoD, NSA, CIA, FBI and a murderous array of government agencies, including the 9/11 Commission."

              Nuclear weapons may not even exist. I was much more relaxed after I researched it. I think it's a good possibility. Don't know if that helps you or makes you think I'm nuts :)

                Right. Never been an 'accident.' None have ever gotten into the "wrong hands." Communism of the cold war was the boogeyman that "terrorism" is today, and the great fear of extermination kept us all in check. Took me a while to figure it out.

                I don't fear nuclear exchange at all anymore. If everybody really hated each other they'd skip the ground wars etc. and just hit the button. Surely some trigger happy leader would've lost their temper by now. The camera footage is probably fake, and supposedly Hiroshima and Nagasaki were just big time fire-bombed.

            That's exactly what it looks like to me too.  It is crazy that in this timeline Wikileaks is essentially blackmailing the FBI to do the right thing.  Not that there is anything wrong with that IMO.

             Yeah I've been swallowing a lot of red pills about FBI and CIA government corruption ever since CNN and the WSJ confirmed the Clinton Foundation investigation that FBIanon predicted four months earlier. That led me to Sandy Hook, which led to me 9/11, which led to Operation Northwoods, MK-ULTRA, Mockingbird, Phoenix, etc. Along the way, George Webb did a mountain of great work. It has been a very depressing ride for me, but Trump and FBIanon give me a glimmer of hope.

              Then I have something for you:
How is
JFK - Warren Commission - magic bullet
and
Concentration camps - Buchenwald - movies - Hollywood director Hitchcock
connected?
             </p>
             <p>
              Fasten seat belts: the same people who presented the world shrunken heads from museums, lampshades and typhus-corpses as people starved to death, 18 years later were in the magic-bullett-Warren Commission...

              Surely only one of those strange coincidences like collapsing buildings in free-fall, Iraqs WMDs and much more, which always somehow turn out to be a huge problem for patriotic politics and helpful to expand NWO...

               They chose the right movie-maker, Alfred Hitchcock. I think that was a propaganda piece. Edit: As I'm sure you believe also.

              Can you recommend a good source or starting place on Sandy Hook? I'm pretty much convinced on all the other projects you've mentioned but I never could latch on to the Sandy Hook theory.

               Learn to read and concentrate. This book is by someone who was a professor of the History of Science, Philosophy of Science, Logic, reasoning, how we know what we know.. How to detect a fallacy.. How to reason.

               He put this book on Amazon and they banned it. So he put it out for a free download.

               Fetzer''s written scores of books and achieved over 60 awards for his teaching abilities.. He has facts at the tip of his mind . This book is just definitive about "Sandy Hook" -

               I knew right away because I study this stuff and know what to look for and I don't watch Mainstream Media at all.
              </p>
              <p>
               First thing jumped out at me; they change the narrative.. First he's gone to the school where his mother works to kill her. then , she doesn't work there. Then, we have no motive as to why he drove so far to get to that school . Then you find out he's anorexic and on the autism spectrum and couldn't hold up the gear he was supposed to be carrying in there.. Then you find out the hole he supposedly punched in the glass was not big enough for him to walk through will all his gear.. Then you hear his body was left in the school but the machine gun was found locked in the car. Then you find the car wasn't even his, wasn't registered to him nor to his mother - By this time I gave up.. I didn't even bother . It was so obvious.
              </p>
              <p>
               So I missed the part that seemed to wake up a large number of other people , which is still pretty amazing.
              </p>
              <p>
               One Dad who came out, "Parker," was grinning.. The parents didn't insist to see their child's bodies.. But what really woke people up was the grinning parents..
              </p>
              <p>
               Crisis Actors go all the way back to 9/11; but it was known only in a very minuscule research group. These Sandy Hook Crisis Actors were really bad actors. So much to the affect that it woke - up some TV watching public.
              </p>
              <p>
               There was suspicion of Satan worshippers or something at some point; all a mystery - How could they manage that large op - could it really be *just about gun control? [ They did make a *lot of money from the donation request pages which were uploaded in some cases too soon - even before the event!]
              </p>
              <p>
               . But it didn't really click hard until the Pizza Pedo revelations / and trafficking knowledge surfaced..
              </p>
              <p>
               That explains the number of children they had at their disposal there; and how they had an whole community that was a cut -out.. They are very desperate for this one to remain secret from the public and hope the truth does not spread widely on it,  for the reason of the trafficking and "grooming" of children for service to the State. , I believe.. Desperate really..
              </p>
              <p>
               It was a very poorly done job.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hillary called people who didn't believe children died , "blackhearts," which seems strange. If you thought the children were alive you were a "blackheart" ? How strange.

                There's more connections between Obama and "Sandy Hook" His fake SS# was obtained from the Fairfield hospital in that neighborhood. The Sandy Hook parents brought one of the allegedly killed children to see Obama at the White House, wearing the same dress she was photographed in earlier.. "Emily" And yes, these people were all smiles.. Very weird.

               We Need to Talk About Sandyhook is good, I agree with LA_Trump. Even if I discount everything I saw in that documentary, I can always go back to the fact that SH is never talked about anymore. It's not a concern. That's bc it didn't have its intended consequence of disarming us. A false flag is supposed to be an operation where the people are happily going along with the desired result. Examples would be our reaction to Pearl Harbor or 9/11. United as a nation to DO something.

                What about the notion of witchcraft practitioners embedded in New England society?
               </p>
               <p>
                Salem as a false flag of sorts to shift attention away from real satanists to scapegoats.  Magical world view: talismans, archangel ceremonies, etc on the New England frontier.  HP Lovecraft dark New England fuckery of the 19th century.  And modern no-kidding "Wiccans" today.  I heard the Sandy Hook community was full of them.
               </p>
               <p>
                Is American society, the "13 colonies" nothing but a long term project of a Satanist shadow society?
               </p>
               <p>
                That's the enduring question I ask.

               The best piece of evidence is Sloppy Sniper:
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPdFoEE4_A0">

              </p>
              <p>
               But I am not a Sandy Hook expert. One guy wrote an entire book about it. Sloppy Sniper was the thing that got me (and my girlfriend) to put the odds over 70% for a CIA false flag. It was kind of mindblowing to me at the time.

               "I was recently asked [] how I stay sane. I told him he was asking the wrong question. The
question is how all the people who don't know the truth stay sane. The answer is, they don't. It is
being caught in the Matrix that drives you insane. It is the blue pill that causes insanity, not the red pill.
The truth can be painful, and sometimes be temporarily disorienting. But it is the lies that cause
permanent disorientation, and eventual insanity. The truth, however painful, is clarifying. " from "Obama's Geneology" by Miles Mathis -

               Very tough waking up. But it is fully worth it. One can envision a very bright future with Trump and it is exhilarating if we focus on the positives: the children are going to be saved, less fighting for resources, more cooperation etc.

               Sure is.  It's downright uncomfortable, which is what the other ignorant side doesn't want to feel.
Is it better not to know?   Absolutely NOT.
All civilizations throughout time have had horrendous things happen.  We've been mollycoddled, as if it could never happen to us!   We are too civilized now....ummm...NOT.

                  What's crazy is I have been doing this for almost 20 years, and you will spend thousands of hours on something and thing you know it all, then you come back years later and look again, and you missed some huge stuff you can't believe you didn't see, then you come back years later and you see more stuff each time amazing that you didn't see it before again. It just keeps getting deeper and deeper and deeper until movies like the Truman show or the matrix become more realistic than the consensus reality that most people believe. It's a "cosmic trigger" and if you're not prepared for it, it can completely ruin you, and cannot.m be unseen unless you're strong enough to convince you're self it was all in your head so it's not real. Which is obviously almost impossible or could even be described as ptsd or trauma based disassociation. But hey keep looking I'm sure there's more. :(

                   My hub thinks I have lost my mind. 
I finally figured out that I have to relate it to something he thought of or something he's really interested in for him to even acknowledge it. period.

               I started waking up after sandy hook too. That really got me to start questioning things and it snowballed from there. I went into a little bit of a depression. It's really hard to learn that basically everything you have ever been told is a lie. I snapped out of it and then just got really pissed! I'm still kinda stuck in pissed!

                 There are various subcultures on the internet that teach politically incorrect truths, to help men succeed with women. For example, "women say they like liberty, autonomy, nice guys, and flowers, but women really respond to bad boys who tease and somewhat-control them, who are dominant and take charge, and women actually tend to dislike guys who are really nice and buy them lots of presents." That's a politically incorrect truth that you will not find in a romantic comedy.

                 It's probably the most common use of the term "red pill":

                  Roger.  Strange that that would be the most common red pill meaning... although, now that I think about it, maybe not; what is more fundamental than survival?  The estrangement of the sexes is perhaps the biggest threat to that right now.

              I know what you mean...I still don't want to believe 9/11 and that the Bush's are evil...but it is looking that way.  Even when I was still a fan of GWB, I couldn't understand why American citizens were getting sexually assaulted to ride on airplanes, but the border was wide open.  Now we know.

              On the bright side, we now have a President that actually loves this country.  That should be qualification #1 for the job, and it's been far too long since we had one.

               Yes, it too "funny" how they are able to fool people. They are often smiling and personable, as W. Bush often appears, even endearing.. Amazing. Cold blooded sadists / killers / who get off when they sign a death warrant. They know how to fool people. -

                Right. And Bush (senior) was CIA since he was a young man. This can be proven, and he was a close associate of Oswald's CIA handler, this is documented as well.

               "The powers in charge keep us in a perpetual state of fear keep us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor with the cry of grave national emergency. Always there has been some terrible evil to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it by furnishing the exorbitant sums demanded. Yet, in retrospect, these disasters seem never to have happened, seem never to have been quite real." - Douglas MacArthur

                  What I just wrote on another thread which speaks to the question :
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "I don't agree with the YouTube vid I linked above - It claims Israel is behind it which is not true.. There are many nationalities involved. The "Neo-Cons" are not Jews, but belong to their own cult which is gay [homosexual] and secret.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Whoever made the vid is trying to blackwash the info as "anti - Semitic" Truth is I think England Bankers and German Bankers are much more behind it than "Israel" [Palestine] Truth is : England royals and English created "Israel" and Zionism. English Jews.. Honestly many alleged "Jews" are not practicing and believing Jews, but have some other allegiances. I'll try to find a better vid but its not easy with my site gone."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The historic "Israel" is not even where they are telling you.

                  Of course people in our own government are going to blame it on "Israel" and the Mossad.. Mossad is very good at what they do, so they definitely needed Mossad for this.. It's also true some people who attend and sing at Syanagogue were given a tip not to go to work that day. The event was very long in planning.. Certainly the entire "Octopus" was involved.

                     Fox News is owned by Murdoch, who parties with Epstein. Murdoch bought a bunch of newspapers with Rothschild money. Why do you think Megyn Kelly interviewed James A.?

                     I'm guessing Guiliani was compromised, but I don't really know. George Webb says that he slowfooted the Marc Rich investigation.

                    <p>
                     The theory isn't that nobody outside of Mossad worked on the case. The theory is that Mossad planned it, orchestrated it, heavily compartmentalized it, and used a small number of non-Israelis to help execute it. So let's not talk about a straw man. I know that Cheney and Guiliani aren't Jewish. That doesn't change the contradict the theory. FBIanon said the same thing.

                      "Second, what really is the worry? Isn’t this what we are working for, the prospect of justice obtained by exposure of the truth, the prospect of stopping the killers in their tracks? Yes, it is. Anyone fretting over the triumph of truth should ask this question: what do you do with a family dog who kills a family member? The dog was acquired to protect the family and instead it kills someone it was supposed to protect.
                      <strong>
                       The services of such a dog would no longer be required, to put it as gently as possible. That’s the situation we have with the DoD, NSA, CIA, FBI and a murderous array of government agencies, including the 9/11 Commission."

                       Mossad is not a police force. It's a secret intelligence organization, parallel to the CIA.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The problem with your theory is that it doesn't help the United States to spend $5 trillion fighting and destroying Israeli's enemies in the Middle East: Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan, Iran, etc. But it makes perfect sense for a small country, with a high IQ, surrounded by enemies and threats, to ramp up Muslim false flags to rally the U.S. military to help protect it.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The other problem is that 9/11 happened after the heavily Israeli neoconservatives got into power. That indicates that Israel was controlling the U.S., not vice versa. If the U.S. was just hiring Mossad to pull off 9/11, you don't need to fill your federal government with Israeli-connected neoconservatives.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Nobody is saying that "the Jews did it" or that all Jews are bad. We're saying that Mossad is corrupt, the same way that the CIA is corrupt, and Mossad did 9/11, with the permission of neocons. Of course, there are Skull and Bones, Wall St., and secret society connections (Rothschild). But the evidence for Mossad doing 9/11 is overwhelming. Not just executing it, but planning it for decades, and planning it for obvious motivations that benefit Israel.

In a hub-and-spoke conspiracy this large, most participants did not know in advance the scope of the planned “terrorist” event. On hindsight, some of the participants are appalled at what they participated in. They are going to spill the beans. Furthermore, virtually everyone across the world inside intelligence services, the military, airline pilots and other technical experts know full well that the U.S. government and selected outsiders did 9/11, not nineteen incompetent Arabs at the behest of a couple of cave dwellers in Afghanistan. Upshot? The dam is going to break, and probably sooner rather than later.
There will be casualties on our side before the whole traitorous truth is broken wide open. Michael Zebuhr, a Clemson engineering graduate student and student member of Scholars for 9/11 Truth was murdered under highly suspicious circumstances in Minneapolis on March 18 and was almost certainly a 9/11 casualty. We are playing for the highest stakes imaginable. The sooner the truth breaks out in the open, the fewer innocent lives lost.
So will justice be done? I strongly believe it will. Sure, some of the perpetrators will get away with their crimes, but we are going to win. The American commitment to an impersonal legal process is deep and wide, so I am not concerned about any kind of vigilantism or mob “justice.” Yes, we will have a “constitutional crisis” of sorts, but it is going to be orderly and peaceful. We need to think through what we are going to do with that victory. My initial thought is that we must safeguard the 9/11 convictions by removing one privilege from the presidency, namely, the presidential pardon of convicted criminals like those in the Iran-Contra scandal. The fact that presidents traditionally issue pardons on Christmas eve when almost no one is watching says all we need to know about their social value."

                         There was U.S. government involvement. I never said there wasn't. So, right off the bat, you are not accurately representing my view.

                          sorry if I missed your point or mis-represented you. I just don't agree that "It was the Israelis" - that's a very one - dimensional viewpoint and one that is bandied around quite a bit. The Israelis are puppets of Bankers.. Israel was put there for a purpose. They are not rulers of the larger scheme. If I'm not clear about your "higher level argument" maybe it's because it doesn't make sense?

                           If Israel did 9/11 because of bankers, like the Rothschilds, pulling its strings, then I agree with you. Obviously, we don't know the full ground truth of what happened. Of course, there are going to be many, many people inside of Mossad who puppets, who are either brainwashed, or raised since childhood, or blackmailed, into doing things that normal people wouldn't do.

                            Yes, and there are many in the U.S. who would do the same, for money or position. And many mercenaries who are employed by private companies, who were also involved.

                  Bollyn did not keep up with the research. He dropped out 10 years ago. When he came back it was the same bullshit; he had taken it no where. And he's on about "the Jews" this "the Jews" that.. And that is "blackwashing" .. I just wrote something about that "Jew Question" and I will copy and paste here. He also attacks good researchers.. I pay no attention to him since I already wrote him off years ago and do not trust him.. Him and Robert Steele..

                   I am new to Bollyn, but I know that he moved to a different country and was assaulted and charged by the police, so that might have slowed him down.

                    They had American Drills on that day.. The fighter jets were sent out over Canada.. Nobody scrambled those alleged jets. That's not Mossad.

                Some of the "JFK to 9/11" is a little off, on Kennedy. For a great history lesson take a day or two, if so inclined, and watch at least the first several hours of Evidence of Revision. Rare footage you won't see anywhere else.

                 It's the only JFK video I've seen - never looked into it before, so I had no way to vet it. Completely blew my mind. Multiple snipers, Mark Lane, body switching. It seems so obvious in hindsight.

                  So you are not going to catch up on it all in one afternoon.. There are 3 books from the '90's that are basically definitive.

                 <p>
                  FUNNY! THE LINKS ARE BANNED BY voat / So you will just have to google the titles.
I also just got blocked from doing a search, by Google..which happened once before, i.e. yesterday.  If there is nothing to hide, why censor? Lucky there are alt search engines available.. Somdbody's scared?

                  People have been working on it for over 50 years, non-stop.. There are a lot of false "gateways" - It was super - designed, and the Intel pulled out all the stops for the cover-up, psy-op and mind control to get the public and younger generation to believe their stupid "Roger Rabbit" narrative.. The term "conspiracy theorists" was revealed to have been invented [via a FOIA request] by the Intel to dis-credit skeptics.

                 <p>
                  There was at least one more shooter that can be seen in the lense flare of the zapruder film. But also the zapruder film was edited in big ways.. here is a video that proves this.

                  Anyway these were some of the newer analysis I have seen that I found interesting. Seems to be actual physical proof to me that of course Oswald story is bs.

                   The Oswald story is BS. The biggest way we know this is that Oswald had a CIA relationship. That is the golden thread behind most true political conspiracy theories. Oswald was CIA. Bin Laden was CIA. Hillary Clinton and Pizzagate are CIA (Mena Arkansas), etc. It's always CIA.

                  Yeah I tell everyone always go back to the beginning, start w/ Mark Lane. Later move on to the autopsy. There was indeed a casket switch but officer Tippet being used as a double is demonstrably wrong. It gets deep. Research the autopsy. It is well-documented by Douglas Horne and others.

                   I will have to check it out. Although part of me wishes that Trump would clean house so we can all put this behind us and move on, save me the effort.

                   One thing people don't realize is that Trump is JFK's spiritual successor. Bannon made the entire transition team read the Best and the Brightest, about the mistakes of the Kennedy administration.

                I'll check him out.  Yeah, obviously JFK...I'm no fan of the Kennedy's (mainly because of Teddy, the only one not worth shooting)...but I watched a JFK speech on YT recently and damn...he would be way too conservative for any party right now.  How far our politicians have fallen is stunning.

                 I never thought too much of JFK either until I listened to some of the last speeches he gave and learned that his last executive order was to create our own currency and essentially end the fed. He was killed right after and guess what the first EO his successor signed? To undo JFKs EO. I think he was a part of their club, but for whatever reason he woke up or had a change of heart. He tried to save us from our enslavement and they killed him.

             You won't say that when your skin peels off from radiation. I hate the system. I hate their lies. I hate that 9/11 was perpetrated by our own govt. But more than all of those things I still love being alive.

             I agree that this shit needs to be out there. But I don't believe it'll destabilize us. We're resilient. The majority of us smelled something was off, badly off, about Hillary. We're not children. We can be trusted to handle it.
            </p>
            <p>
             We'll get angry, for sure. We'll demand the death penalty. But we
             <em>
              need
             </em>
             this. We need to face what's been going on. And we're not going to descend into chaos if we see justice, hard justice, served. In fact I think it would be a massive cultural bonding experience for The West in general.

              It's so obvious they spread the story "But of course, *we all know it, but we can't tell *them because chaos would surface and our country would be destroyed" ; Which is an obvious self - serving lie! They love to hoax. They love to lie and they love to trick the suckers. They told the insiders that about JFK too. But any boob could tell the JFK line was a total joke. People just don't know how to think.. .And believe me, the perpetrators / jokers do not want anyone to learn!

             <p>
              I believe it's possible that the only reason any of the Pizza revelation has come about is because many harden killers, criminals, mobsters can't stand to know children are being hurt.

              Trouble is: when you pull on a thread the whole sweather becomes unraveled. They work very hard to keep people dumb. It's been very successful.. Why ruin a good thing? Dunno.

              Using 9/11 as a blackmail tool seems so ridiculous because it's anyway so obvious, on its face.

               Agree with your thoughts -- but they'd have to have some evidence about 9/11 to release.

                The trajectories of the cartoon airplanes in the different vids do not match.. YouTube has taken down the large and complete collection of vids from that day, many years ago by now. Perhaps they will surface. I know people with Media jobs came up to me when I was passing out fliers and told me they had material which had not been released and which they share among themselves.. So it's possible the video will all surface.. The controlled opposition wants everyone who's figured out that the physics of the event is wrong, to solve the problem with holograms..

                They are desperate that the role of the Media Trickery be hidden. It's important to them that the extent of Mass Media mind control be denied. Once people realize it, they will not have the power which they have now.

                 samhara -- I didn't look at your video links because I know there were no planes -- 
Though what they did to the reporter they sent to cover the Pentagon -- and he was there long before any story of a "plane" hitting -- 
finally they just forced him to deny his story.  Name is Jamie McIntyre if I recall correctly.  You can probably still catch his video where
he is standing outside the Pentagon repeating over and over again "No plane hit the Pentagon."  And, of course, it didn't.

                 Yep - it's still there!
McIntyre was there very early and he knew there was no plane.

                 The number of Americans who still trust our MSM/Fake News is dwindling very quickly -- 
you see that attitude on the internet every day.  But they don't always carry that attitude over to 9/11.
And I think it's because of the fake videos.  Otherwise they have to admit that they weren't only lied to on 9/11,
but that the networks used FAKE VIDEO to lie to them.  That's the hard part for them to get over.

But, I'm with you -- 9/11 was a fake.

                I have loads and loads of evidence and arguments and have spent double 10K hours over 13 years. The Forum I worked on, in a group effort, was defaced and vandalized Dec 10th, soon after I began linking my Pizza research over here; and soon after the viewer count doubled. The easiest proof is this: The Mass Media was in on it. They were reading scripts. An airplane can not fly through a wall and not break to pieces. An airplane can not hit a wall and not crush. An airplane is not Caspar the Ghost.. It's not top secret. It's right in front of everyone . That is the best evidence. But there is much more evidence. And the evidence that it was done by the alleged 19 hijackers: 100% missing, except for what was poorly fabricated.. Once you understand the premise: That everything you know about it you were told by the Mass Media.. And once you realize they were in on it, then everything will fall into place. -

                 I don't agree with the YouTube vid I linked above - It claims Israel is behind it which is not true.. There are many nationalities involved. The "Neo-Cons" are not Jews, but belong to their own cult which is gay [homosexual] and secret.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Whoever made the vid is trying to blackwash the info as "anti - Semitic" Truth is I think England Bankers and German Bankers are much more behind it than "Israel" [Palestine] Truth is : England royals and English created Israel and Zionism. English Jews.. Honestly many alleged "Jews" are not practicing and believing Jews, but have some other allegiances. I'll try to find a better vid but its not easy with my site gone.

              Don't get me wrong though, I am 100% in favor of traversing this rabbit hole as far as it goes regardless of how horrific things become as it almost assuredly will be necessary for things to get worse before they get better. IMO, exposing the entirety of the truth remains necessary if we truly want as much justice as is possible in this life.

               Agree with those who are for "all out" -- and that includes everything -- 
The human/child/organ trafficking is the most emotional and urgent, of course -- but so much more corruption.  George Webb/YouTube has been very helpful there.

               We have to understand that economies are created by the people -- but they are manipulated by financial institutions, banks, for the benefit of the few.

               The truth is very easy. It's lies that need a lot of work. That's why these assholes can never rest.
              </p>
              <p>
               From "Obama's Geneology" by Miles Mathis
"I was recently asked [] how I stay sane. I told him he was asking the wrong question. The
question is how all the people who don't know the truth stay sane. The answer is, they don't. It is
being caught in the Matrix that drives you insane. It is the blue pill that causes insanity, not the red pill.
The truth can be painful, and sometimes be temporarily disorienting. But it is the lies that cause
permanent disorientation, and eventual insanity. The truth, however painful, is clarifying. "

               True, but what's above Royalty?
Once you've reached level of British Royals, who are the higher ups?
This nation has been thoroughly betrayed -- from the Constitution to Operation Mockingbird -- which has to be linked with Operation Paperclip and Operation Gladio in order to understand the total effect and total betrayal.  This stuff was being written two years before the end of WWII and was then run out of the CIA under Allen Dulles.  Essentially the German Gestapo was brought here as the CIA -- WWII hasn't ended yet.
              </p>
              <p>
               After that, it's taken a great deal of right wing violence to keep all of this covered up and the assassinations, black jobs have continued on and on.
              </p>
              <p>
               Consider that the stuff that's above top secret -- about nuclear codes, etal -- is Roswell/UFO stuff - ET's.  Some of them quite nasty as some tell us.
              </p>
              <p>
               Links -- 
See:  Operation Mockingbird — scroll down to “History” — which was being written two years before the end of WWII.
              </p>
              <p>
               See:  Operation Paperclip — Wiki’s figures are low — at the minimum 64,000+ which included families but more likely 200,000 according to Kay Griggs/YouTube.
              </p>
              <p>
               See:  Operation Gladio — US program to keep right wing governments in place in the countries over which they had control after WWII — Germany, Japan, Italy.  In Italy, US actually resurrected the Mafia in order to ensure the plan would be carried out.

               They all give their consent . Yes! And they only are planning to arrest 72, according to the informant.. So that will not cover it all, by any measure.. So they will be playing "musical chairs" .. I'll tell you who *my favorites are.. I 'm making a list but just didn't have time today.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's not just 9/11 - its the whole fake "War on Terror" - These staged events have stopped since Trump came in, and I think they will not re-start..All they can afford now for their staged Propaganda is the random alleged hate crime. They just don't have the budget now.
              </p>
              <p>
               Even with all the money Soros and the Rothschilds possess, they will only be able to do little ones ["terror events"], having no longer the backup of Homeland Security, FEMA , and the Military.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you don't think there has been a long list of staged "Project Gladio" - style events? You better get more abreast of the rackets they are pulling.. And without the Pedophilia - and the sado - pedophilia, they may never have been able to get this far with their idiocy..

                Within 5 minutes of popping the lid off PG I knew how 9/11 and all the false flags were pulled off.  I always suspected blackmail was used and had been aware of the Franklin Scandal since it broke when I was in college, but that was the Eureka moment for me.  You're right, without the consent of the President, domestic false flags will grind to a halt and move abroad ( Canada ).

               This has become so crystal clear to increasing numbers of people and it in a way seems to be stalling at the current level of idiocy since inauguration.  I lost heart when I saw FBI anon expected number of arrests as it is clear those are not even close to the number of people needing to be arrested. Hoping it is just a start. The media is the clog in draining the swamp

             Don't know about you, but I'd rather not become the country who collapses into a nightmare that other countries want to prop up on one side or the other and fight over, like we've been doing to Middle Eastern countries.

             If FBIAnon was serious about the extent of this, it needs to be a controlled demolition that eventually does root all the swamp dwellers out, rather than an overt desk flip.

              This sounds responsible, but, the FBI has been for many years enabling and covering up this stuff. How can you trust them, who is to say that they are not part of a black mail  operation, just like in the FBI early years. It has to be full hammer, with the FBI also brought to justice for their part in these scandals. Then maybe they can mysteriously find those 80 videos that accidentally disappeared of the OKC bombing, compliments of Eric Holder and Bill Clinton.

              Well exactly, this is the exact business plan that Soros has, cause enough turmoil to take over a country and completely pillage it. We can't allow that to happen or our fighting of the beast leads directly into its mouth.

               A clever way of saying it is safer to not expose things so we can avoid chaos. Bullshit is all I have to say to you. Only the guilty want crimes hidden. Safety is for cowards who would allow others to be brutalized so nothing happens to them.

                I think the whole point flew way the fuck over your head. I didn't say that and now you're putting words into my mouth. I was not saying do not expose things, what I was saying is to do so in a smart way. Those who play chess and come out and attack one piece at a time lose, it's a loss of timing... if you develop each piece and concentrate on the center then you can win.. throwing one piece at a time at then in an uncoordinated attack does nothing but allow your offense to fizzle and you eventually run out of steam and lose. Its all about timing dude.

               This is dead on accurate. People should look into CSC/DynCorp which has the pillaging part down to a fine art.

               On second thought -- Maybe do not look too close though unless you want to be "suicided" via two shots to the head or to "accidentally" pass away via a freak free weights mishap or even be "Paul Walkered" if they happen to be in an especially creative mood.

               Look, America has already been taken over and pillaged.  Those are the shackles we are trying to shake off!  And if the whole thing has to be burned to the ground, in order for us to rebuild, we have to stand ready to see that occur.  Remember the phoenix rising from the ashes?

              i disagree. putting time and distance between situations gives the guilty party time for others to forget. i don't want to know about something 30 years after the fact. i want to know now. and i want justice now.

               Don't know about you, but I'd rather not become the country who collapses into a nightmare that other countries want to prop up on one side or the other and fight over, like we've been doing to Middle Eastern countries.

              I think it's good to have this feeling in a way. It makes us feel more empathic towards other less powerful countries and the 'unfair' fates they've been forced to live and endure. Somehow, Qaddafi, Hussein and Assad don't seem as despotic and as tyrannical as they once did.

                But they are put in by the CIA, for the purpose of being exploited or later taken out. Saddam Hussain kept 3 different factions reined in better than what's there now (chaos) and we know he had mustard gas because Rumsfeld sold it to him in the 80's. I was told this by an ex-marine, I don't have a source but I don't think its farfetched.

                 I heard that same thing. I think the gas was discovered around 2013. A lot of people haven't heard of this. It's funny because it turns out Saddam really did have WMD. Nobody talks about this (it's kind of irrelevant - neocon/CIA topples and exploitation of Middle East countries is a horrible idea either way).

                  but the anthrax, the aluminum tubes, the mobile units, the yellow cake was all bullshit, but the gas was okay, because anyone who looked into it would have found the Rumsfeld connection.

                 Zionism right? Or something else? Or a combo? Man that looks like one weird movie they're showing. And that beheading (what in the world is that from?) is gonna give me nightmares!

                 Of course there is a difference between power hungry banker and money-loving Zionist, and Talmudic Jews, and other 'common' Jewish people. My main problem w/ the Jewish 'faith' (or at least the leaders thereof), would be that they rejected Christ, their Messiah, and have suffered because of it.

                  In my opinion the "Jews killed our Jesus" is Propaganda to keep who love G-d fighting each other; meanwhile the real "fallen angels" can do their thing unopposed.

                   I disagree, but I hear what you're saying. I do believe in fallen angels, they are the demons mentioned in the NTestament.

                our freedom to destroy and rape them. To behave as imperialists while claiming a moral high ground. All the people (I know a Veitnam Vet specifically with this position) who "defend the troops" actually think its so that we have the right to burn the flag!

               It is extremely likely that only first responders died from radiation poisoning. This low reality death count (50-100 max) was necessary to get some of our intelligence agencies on board. Suspend your disbelief. The goal of 9/11 was to cover up Project Hammer and missing Pentagon dollars, and to pit the population with the most guns and largest military on Earth, with Islam (unambiguous religion that poses large threat to "their" slave society).

                       I don't want a website of bullshit about people who know what happened. Look at the fucking facts. Watch the video with Simon Shack. They literally copied and pasted the towers from video to video lol, and changed the background. It is laughable. No holograms. No planes. Just really shitty CGI which was aired as supposedly being "live", some explosives, and a shit ton of actors and "amateur videos" released over the period of 2 years.

                      If you're open-minded you should at least check out Dr. Judy Wood. She seems to be correct as to how the bldgs. came down. Just a suggestion.

                       When a nuclear bomb goes off 70 meters below the ground, its heat simply vaporizes the surrounding granite. The buildings then fell into this vertical crater. 250,000 people have cancer because they thought that the radiation wouldn't get above ground. They were retarded.

                        What you're talking about is 'kinetic' energy, it would have been incredibly destructive. What Dr. Woods hypothesizes is that it was a precise surgical hit, by an energy weapon. Thus the buildings appear to be vaporizing and smoldering (turning to dust) rather than collapsing in on themselves.

                        This preserved the Hudson River dam next to the towers, which would have flooded Manhattan had it been breached. The dust made the first responders and others ill. You should check her out, I have come to believe she has it right, as do others (who are not busy ostracizing her).

                         No. It was a thermonuclear weapon underneath the buildings. This aligns with isotope studies, especially tritium concentrations in the water, which can only be explained by a nuclear event, not by lasers or regular bombs. This is why 250,000 people have cancer.

              Anybody know any good Bible chapter and verse numbers based around the trashing of Sodom and Gomorrah? Or some other situation where someone was diverted from the brink?

               The other Biblical story that comes to mind:
              </p>
              <p>
               The Revelation / Apocalypse comes at the end of the book .
               <strong>
                The Genesis
               </strong>
               comes at the beginning.. They are the book ends which frame the story.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Satanists who created their domination of the planet love to invert things. 
So instead of "Revelation to Paradise" 
They give us "Paradise to Revelation / and therefor destruction"
However when "Revelation" comes it will only destroy their ugly little spider - like corner.
              </p>
              <p>
               Genesis is about the beauty of Creation and what was given to us; its perfection, vastness, stunning in its comprehensive dimensions and full richness.
              </p>
              <p>
               The human was created by "them" as part of that completeness and perfection of the entire Creation.
"And it was Good"
              </p>
              <p>
               Human as created in the image of Creator was told not to refrain from evil - and when human did so anyway, was thrown out of Paradise and cursed.

               I'm not sure of your suggestion, but the obvious Biblical reference to what is happening now, a quickening of awareness, an awakening: obviously? Revelation.. People are recognizing what is going on around them .. Also , Apocalypse, which does not mean "destruction" except for those who are welded to the "evil business as usual" - The word means "dropping of the veil" - in other words "Destruction of Delusion / Illusion"
              </p>
              <p>
               That is:  because the old world is destroyed, not physically. A new perception arises which changes the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               The veil is dropped from in front of the eyes and the truth is seen.
              </p>
              <p>
               Each of us live in a world molded in large part by who our information sources are: so when the false perception of the world is destroyed and changed, the world is thereby changed , though nothing physically is harmed.
              </p>
              <p>
               And this analogy of the clarification of vision is accompanied by the rising of the Great Beast from the Water - so that it can be seen for what it is.. That Monster is the "Octopus" When it rises from the water it can be seen. When it can be seen, it can be destroyed.

               how is pissing off "progressives" supportive of your end game? You cannot still think that this is a "party issue", the corruption benefits and is conducted by both sides.

                I think ya'll are kinda saying the same thing as far as progressive/globalist vs. nationalist/populist...it just that we are in very short supply of nationalist/populist politicians.  No such thing as Republican or Democrat anymore IMO.

              Yeah, when people start talking about breakaway civilizations, I start to get really depressed. It's like living in Moonraker, but there's no James Bond.

             the niggers aren't your enemy. Maybe you've personally had issues with individuals but that wouldn't justify killing all of them. The current political system is designed to create animosity and distraction while the real policy is instituted that rewards the rich and corrupt. The  enemy is the rich and corrupt, we would do better to enlist the niggers as allies to help take down the corruption.

              Genetics dont care if you are rich or poor. They only care about your genes and the person genes with which you intend to birth a child.
             </p>
             <p>
              Niggers arent my enemy. But they are a massive ball and chain atrapped to humanities ankle.
             </p>
             <p>
              They are also a threat to every white person around. Even the dumbest (shittest gene'd) white is better than the average nigger.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Oh but theres a smart nigger here and there!" Like that somehow makes it worth it to keep niggers around?
             </p>
             <p>
              Niggers were good farm equipment. Nothing else. They provide nothing else. They just take and breed and take and breed.
             </p>
             <p>
              You cant undo millenia of breeding garbage into the genepool. It cant be done.
             </p>
             <p>
              And while the Jews and their version of "capitalism" is certaintly skewed to favour the rich - its a system we
              <em>
               will never
              </em>
              abandon - unless we get nuclear hellfire - and even in that case, as soon as individual populations pass Dunbars number we will see a new form of capitalism instated.

             <p>
              No my friend, genetic hygiene is the only thing that can save us now.

               Are you seriously advocating eugenics? Can't you see that this subverse is all about how the most powerful in society are secretly eliminating the most vulnerable (many if not most of whom happen to be brown) for kicks on a global scale? What makes you any better than them if you want to wipe out an entire race of people through some misplaced notion of superiority?

              So much of modern dysfunction in African American communities is caused by government policies and corruption. Just look at what the CIA did to Haiti (watch George Webb). Or read the letter that the FBI wrote to MLK, before it (probably) assassinated him. African Americans were well integrated into U.S. society, and have the deepest roots here with Anglos and native Americans. Their society was partially destroyed by FBI and government corruption, and it is possible to restore their communities into a healthier condition. Thomas Sowell wrote a lot about this.

                 You're entitled to your opinion and your free speech. But there is a difference between race realism and racism, and your racist views are disgusting, and they embarrass the entire forum and the citizen investigation that we do.

                  Racist is a non-word. It has no real meaning.

                  Im a Speciesist. Niggers are a Sub Sapien Species.

                 <p>
                  Most Niggers wouldnt agree to being a genocided - self interest

                 <p>
                  Most chinks wouldnt agree to entire Nigger genocide - actually they probably would.

                 <p>
                  Most whites wouldnt agree - no shit. What is brainwashing, virtue signalling and confirmation bias.

             It is extremely likely that only first responders died from radiation poisoning. This low reality death count (50-100 max) was necessary to get some of our intelligence agencies on board. Suspend your disbelief. The goal of 9/11 was to cover up Project Hammer and missing Pentagon dollars, and to pit the population with the most guns and largest military on Earth, with Islam (unambiguous religion that poses large threat to "their" slave society). Additionally, it served as a symbolic masonic event, with symbolism beyond my understanding.

              Not only do the two towers invoke the Masonic pillars, but WTC had an unambiguous Masonic third pillar on the grounds.  The symbolism of the pillars as the gate to the new world is unequivocal.  Frightening really.  The implication was that the towers were design with the intent that someday they would be brought down.  Makes me wonder if the engineering was selected for controlled demolition in the first place- i.e.: strategic weak points built into the structure.  These fuckers.

               No -- reports are the WTC towers were going to have to be brought down as they were put up -- with scaffolding which would have cost a huge amount of money.
There's precedent for this as one of the NYC towers has been brought down this way.
Unfortunately, I no longer have the info on that and couldn't turn it up in a search so probably difficult for you to believe -- but true.
But, the WTC towers were to be brought down because of Asbestos problems -- they were also White Elephants which weren't renting.  Heating and cooling the buildings were an immense problem.  Demolition wasn't to be permitted.
              </p>
              <p>
               The WTC towers were built to withstand not just one commercial jetliner flying into it but a number of them.
              </p>
              <p>
               Notice that they've scrubbed references to "built to withstand a number of jets flying into them."
And that's true as the designers made clear after 9/11 -- describing it as "flies flying into a screen door."

                I mean, they were secretly designed with a weak spot.  I'm certain that the towers fell because of explosives internally at these weak spots.

                 The WTC towers were designed to withstand more than one commercial jet fully loaded flying into it.
The designers made clear that it would be like flies flying into a screen door.
They had the example of the plane which flew into the Empire State Building and well knew that they WTC
had to be extremely safe or they would not be rented or supported.

                   The WTC were built to withstand any number of commercial airliners flying into it.
What brought the towers down was demolition and probably some other stuff -- possibly nuclear -- they were testing.

               According to the Russian officer, they were intended to be brought down with nukes, when they were built. That's why it worked so well. It was the designed method.
