             I am getting suspicious of their being involved in just too many organizations for kids. Protect a Child, Boy Scouts, Foster Family, Fostered Exchange Student, and a Deacon and Father of the Year?   What a great guy.  Maybe there is just a little too much though. I am hoping he is just a great person, but it should be looked into.

              Yeah, I am still trying to find some more information on the Protect-A-Child Inc.  But a lot of similar background to what we have seen in other persons of interest.  Could be a coincidence, but lately there are too many of those to go around.

               Another thought I had is that maybe the father was involved in something and while the son lived in Haiti he saw a lot of things he did not like.  Maybe something happened to him.  He might really have wanted to take it out on somebody.  There are many scenarios.  We must take time to investigate an not just all run to one side of the boat at once.  Just sayin'.

            Scroll down to the Muslim lawyer who witnessed it.  There's a photo of his arrest there and odd info about the lawyer who specializing in the international movement of 'goods and people.'   Remember the Saudi connections from earlier today as well.
