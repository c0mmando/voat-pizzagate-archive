            Purity of spirit en mass is a fallacy. I'd say Downs Syndrome kids show us love without judgment..but not all. I know one that raped a child.

            I do think Trashcan Man made an active choice...was the choice merely a continuation of his madness? The next step in his devolution? I don't know...it's a choice really even in how to view him...I guess that there was a part of him still wired into destruction for good...(actually Kali Ma/Pele, renewal through destruction) or was he merely acting from a sense of betrayal. I see him through my lens...that perhaps hopes that should I ever be drawn into that dark night and choose to act on that side of the symbol (yin yang) that there would be a part of me that would draw back and rethink..then perhaps act as the man on the inside...in some ways "savior"...haha I have just diagnosed myself with a messianic complex :D

            ok... I don't believe in Comey. I watched the last minute of the video you posted and all it is is Comey responding to Gowdy's criticism by essentially saying "I hope you realize I'm right someday" without any response to the specific criticisms. Do you honestly not believe that Comey's decisions have been politically motivated? I'm asking because I'd like to understand, not trying to start an argument. Can you post something that gives us a quick rundown on what you've learned about Comey, and how you've come to conclusion that he's a "straight shooter"?

            Math is life :) I don't see it as an operation of conduction, but a  demonstration of true perpetual motion. The perfection needs no operator or conductor, it merely goes on with it's business. Since humans need leadership, seek leadership and power/dominion, they project their ideas of operation and control onto a perfect operation. In many ways, we are a science experiment gone wrong. I like the movie Avatar...beings in balance with their environment...until Humans came along :D

             just wanted to chime in and let you know I found your string of posts extremely fascinating. I'm a grad student in math myself (also have a background in cs), and am really curious about some of the stuff you posted and was hoping you could explain a bit more. For example, you described the force which pushes back on the pendulum if it's pushed to one side or the other - and I follow that, and understand it's a result of basic Newtonian physics (equal/opposite reaction), but what I'm having trouble with is how exactly those principles are applied to things like the will of collective consciousness, which I think is essentially what you're describing as the pendulum sliding to one side, no?

              Yes...you are close to understanding. Thought energy is powerful. The old saying "all thought is creation, the minute you begin to THINK something is the minute you begin to create the possibility it will manifest" or the good old bible.."as a man thinketh, so is he"
             </p>
             <p>
              Those philosophies are falsely linked to "manifestation" cults. Because they leave out the rest. Ancient wisdoms teach that the minute you focus on a manifestation, what you will get is the opposite...the push back. This is very difficult to explain in this limited format. So...let me try...let's say the entire Clinton Cult was doing endless manifestation ceremonies however they believe...imagine blood rites, sacrifice etc...they are emitting an energy that can literally never go anywhere...so it creates a "bubble"..pretend a balloon around them..because inside the bubble everyone is feeding on that energy so for a while, everything seems to be going their way...so they keep manifesting....pushing against the bubble...they believe they're winning unopposed. On the other side you have an entire group in a bubble praying for Trump to win. They're forming their own energy bubble because they are focusing their WILL on the opposite side...both sides are doing exactly the same thing, blood rites literally have zero power in that circumstance...and prayer in that way is the same thing the Clinton side was doing..so we have two sides of expanding bubbles or energy heading towards each other. Eventually one side or the other's bubble/balloon will not be able to contain their energy and it will blast open..coming directly into contact with the opposing bubble..the reaction begins. As you see now....the sides are literally bouncing off each other...and escalating. When one side seems to be "winning" the other side pushes back harder...the pendulums are in wild motion and are unlikely to stop any time soon. There are some "practices" that have partially caught onto this...like the "be careful how you pray because the Universe always says yes" cults..."Dear god I need____" and the Universe says "Yes, you need"...but that's like...baby talk...it's partially correct.
             </p>
             <p>
              The idea that "good" always wins or who you perceive to be good...is a fallacy because in this instance, both sides completely believe they are in the right.
             </p>
             <p>
              Focusing on revelation of truth is a way to remain neutral and not create a push back. Remember, thought energy is powerful, and these opposing sides BOTH believe they are right...that "right energy" is powerful.
             </p>
             <p>
              Truth is blind...meaning..if you focus in revelation of truth you cannot then seek to control what truth it reveals. You have to be willing to take the truth however it shows up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Collective conscious is much more difficult to explain. It's a human based consciousness at the root. And not all humans have physical bodies that can manage the energy of a soul. Merely being able to host soul(ar) energy does not mean that energy will be positive or negative. It is necessary to always have a balance of both...so there will always be "bad guys"..so to speak. Human nature is the same thing as...like the nature of a dog or plant...it is distinctly human. Some thought to collective consciousness is that all human thought exists simultaneously and all that has ever been thought or "invented" is there. It is energy after all. Energy never dissipates, it merely changes form. Most humans lack a working bit of the brain...and I cannot say too much more on that as that is dangerous territory..not the science that humans only use blah blah 10% no, literally there is a bit that does not work in I'd say 99% of humans. But when a person has that bit, and it works...let's just say...that it is genetic, and when it works....that would be something certain factions would love to figure out and control. That's why DNA data bases are very dangerous.

              Recommend an excellent book to get your math/physics juices flowing is Split Second. The dude is brilliant the way he mixes physics theory of his..into his novel. Theory is theory..right? You know that...but damn if he hasn't been slammed 6 ways to Sunday for his "crazy" theories. Well...not so crazy to me. I was like OMG so that's how...I actually use that book to teach certain people...I don't TELL I will have them read and see where they go with it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Other than what I've written, I literally cannot say more. It's not a case of nananana I have a secret, it's that 1. no one will understand 2. if someone understands, I don't want any attention.
             </p>
             <p>
              I was thinking last night about writing an article on Greed, Gurus, and the Gullible...but..probably not. EVERYONE who makes their living off or has "followings" and sets themselves up as "teachers"..don't even...because they're literally all frauds. If a bowl of rice is filled with individual rice grains...and someone pulls a grain out and waves it and tells you it's the whole meal...it's a lie right? Same with the Gurus.  Humans have a need to follow, to find that one thing that will unlock what they perceive to be their great mystery....that's not how it works.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've seen people fuck themselves six ways to Sunday doing that. You can only watch. I've seen people get on the ..jaysus I even hate typing it cause some tard will go read the Internetz and start doing it...and end up destroying their brains...but let me use Ayahuasca as an example. People think OMG I must drink this to find the mystery. White people have zero business drinking a medicine gifted to and meant for indigenous South Americans...the use there is generational, the understanding of the plant is genetic memory...now they're selling it to stupid white people who literally have zero knowledge of how intelligent plant medicine works...they believe it is something outside themselves and their ego gets involved...I know people drinking that stuff every week hoping that some way they will blast through and find the secret of the universe...instead...they are fucking themselves.  Gurus claiming to have THE secret...jaysus I could list thousands of that asshattery on ytube...
             </p>
             <p>
              The ascension cults are most amusing to me..that and the aliens love us and are coming to help us...both are literally reworked Abrahamic religions...savior? check (aliens) rules? (check...if you don't do the ascension meditations you get left behind) the "energy is shifting to rainbow fairy farts" cults..the channelers ...they are really idiots. There is no such thing as an all white world, that would be as dangerous as an all black world. Actually the yin yang symbol is a world in balance with itself.
             </p>
             <p>
              I did a bit of an experiment recently and am still working on sorting out the meaning/outcome...regarding psychic predictions of this election cycle and outcomes. LOL there are a lot of devastated psychics. Psychic energy is FLUID not "carved in stone" (if you read that book you may get where I'm going)...outcomes are choice oriented and the second you make ONE choice, the fork in the road opens right back up again. So while a psychic may see where you've been..if any psychic tells you where you're going..they have just made that choice FOR you or...told you YOUR story. This is incorrect. No one should ever tell someone their "future" as that is thought energy and...all thought is creation, the words come through human filters...
             </p>
             <p>
              I have to do some more talking it through before I'm able to work out exactly how the perversion happens but in one case a psychic (gay) was anti trump..his entire energy was focused on Clinton winning because of his personal fear/prejudice which has zero to do with truth. Fear is energy...and it's very powerful..which is why we see so many snowflakes et al falling apart. Clinton fed that fear and fed on it. That expanded their bubble.
             </p>
             <p>
              Wow this is so hard to put into words.
             </p>
             <p>
              Life is both math, and circular :) Physics not woo...there is literally zero woo. And, as science is, for the most part, not able to operate on the level of Spooky Action at a distance beyond where they're at with it...it is unlikely they will ever understand it...which is probably a good thing. Naughty scientist is what got us into this situation in the first place:) But if you want to think on this...go look at the science videos about spooky action (observation..meaning observation changes action) and think on that regarding thought...and what I explained above. Their concept of spooky action is so limited and minute...it's almost a relief :)
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason we are working towards and living in an out of balance all black world that will implode again, as it has before...is that when ONE SIDE pushes the other side pushes back...so all those idiots doing these rainbow fairy fart ceremonies and manifestations are actually creating the means by which the other side pushes back...and escalation. This is so far out of the realm of understanding for most human minds that the very idea of being in harmony with both the negative and the positive aspects of all things living..is ridiculous and must be stopped...and yet I have never seen a battery run..with only the positive node connected...

            LOL I'm not focusing on humans at all, they are, as I've said, part of Nature. And Nature trumps humans every single time.  Of course, once the "banging into" each other is finished, all pendulums will eventually come to rest in neutral, which is perfect existence (peace/at rest) until someone exercises their will and off they go again. Humans are only as important as they believe they are. (belief) And they think they're pretty damn important. Each time they get too full of themselves, Nature puts them back in their place...and they're at rest/peace again, until their nature takes over...and they start slamming into things again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Humans believe they deserve something, that they have rights over the earth...LOL that bible passage sure was a bit of trickery wasn't it? Dominion over the earth...not partner, dominion. Well how's that been working out for us? My guess is someone lied on purpose :)
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the Universe? we should not pretend to fly so high, or that any life forms that may be out there...are any better than we are :D All things living are beholden to the Universal Law...the Universal Law trumps the Law of Nature (on earth) :) We discover that each time the Universe hurls a few stones our way :D Or the sun farts in our general direction.

            You may have brought that practice forward from a past life as a Monk, especially since you began it as a child. Ah, the Neanderthal...the first musicians. Many European have Neanderthal genetics, and R1b1a is the most common gene pool on earth (which oddly King Tut belongs to). You know...the genetic testing...that they are searching for something. It is in epigenetics let's hope they never find it. Having DNA tested...not exactly the best idea...too many government peepers.

            LOL maybe they're trying to teach you something.  Nature of reality, Einstein's Spooky Action, Newton's 3rd Law, String Theory, Dark Field/Force...it's just science...Nature has Laws...energy has no beginning or end. It is doubtful most humans will ever be able to sort that out. Human nature, Law of Nature, and Quantum Physics :) well, they're trying :D But stepping into the flow, and harming or perverting the will of others...especially focused in large groups, is choosing a side. If the pendulum isn't moving it is not affecting the pendulums on either side is it? Once it starts to move in a direction, it is met with a force that pushes it back. And back and forth it bangs, until something stops it. Nature is literally the strongest most honest and complete force on earth. When we bump into that force, we will never win. Hopi call it the creations. That humans have risen up and fallen 4 times before (aka destroyed themselves).

            A lot of cults believe that. If you feel it works for you, hey..what can I say. However you are as a fact of existence, human, which makes you nature. Law of nature has "created" a function for ejaculate that is in balance with need. So when people make these "discoveries" and being a practice, they are not likely to discard it because of what they believe about it. People create beliefs out of a need to control things. Control is an illusion.

            Ah no....LOL the OT is just reworked Sumarian myths of the Annuaki. The NT is a mishmash of created mythologies.

           <p>
            What I wrote, is physics.  Doesn't have a thing to do with religion. Scientists who don't understand call it quantum woo.  It's Law of Nature, physics...once anything gets so out of balance it's almost upside down, nature resets. When humans misuse/misdirect energy, thought//whatever (as they do in those stupid ceremonies) in an attempt to control things, by their very actions they have created Newton's Third Law.

            I've tried getting several friends and family to do some research on pizzagate but I'm finding that its silly sounding name and its disgusting subject matter makes it hard for the average person to get interested.

            This is how it is described..in a particular "school" of mysticism. There is the plan, and there is the opposition to the plan. Each time one or the other gets out of balance (and it's really simple for humans to slide completely to the dark) there is and always will be a "reset" or a purge. The time for this is quickly approaching. 2016 was to be the year of revelation of truth. The only thing we are permitted to focus on is that one thing, revelation of truth. Not a person, not a side, not a candidate, no prayers for "what we want" but solely the revelation of truth. Sending energy anywhere else will cause exactly what we see...violent push back which will eventually lead to more violence.

            I do not share your confidence in the FBI. When a hard working grunt finds evidence on pedos and turns it in, that grunt may find his or herself in jail...when the boss doesn't want an investigation, there won't be an investigation. Source? ME, from someone I may or may not know who ended up in federal prison for what I wrote...and is only free because a fed. judge didn't buy the gov. story. The only people who really get sent up for this are the people that 8chan uncovered on The Tribe last night...and they only bust them to say OH HEY LOOK we're fighting human trafficking/child porn/abuse...they literally run their own rings.

            What they believe..is of no matter. They are rank amateurs when it comes to this stuff. Newton's third law says for ever action there is an equal and opposite reaction. These people are literally idiots. When you manipulate ANY energy in a particular direction, there will be an equal and opposite reaction. What they're practicing is top level bullshit. Energy is eternal, it never dissipates, it merely changes form. When people use rituals to manipulate an energy and bend things to their will by whatever means, there WILL be a reaction..opposite. That's why the elders laugh at "the secret" and manifestation, and why absolute neutrality is taught in the ancient wisdom schools. This is not information you will find online or in books, in fact all you're going to find online or in books is support for manipulation. For me to explain beyond this ^ would be to violate the ethics of the original medicine. Neutrality...or for grins, the Tao of Steve: Be DESIRELESS, Be EXCELLENT, BE GONE.
           </p>
           <p>
            When someone tells me they are using that shit to get something...I just laugh. A temporary win for eternal failure.

            Blood work is very strong. But if you use it for ANYTHING other than revelation of truth, you will suffer in the long run.

            This is obviously not "smoking gun" evidence, or even incriminating evidence. Obviously, I think we all know that. These are just facts.

              LOL semen. The only magical thinking about semen is in some schools the very act of releasing semen is draining of energy hence the teaching of reverse ejaculation. In other schools sex magik is powerful, as gnosis is the most powerful emission of energy a human can have, learning to control avatars created during gnosis is something people seek to do. However, once an energy form is created (as science is discovering with AI) the ability to control it grows less over time. Guess what this energy form consumes/attacks first, once it gets too strong? The creator. Dicking around with this stuff will get most people fucked up beyond repair.

            I feel whats important to also note is that if these people are still free and about they will be destroying evidence and covering up tunnels and so on just like what happened with the Ted Gunderson cases..
i am hopeful that yes the good guys in the FBI and other related alphabet good guys are on top of this and stuff is getting done. Im sure they are here and utilizing these pages to also help in their investigation, even if they need to remain hidden we cant underestimate the importance of the info sharing and dot joining we are doing here :)

            On Alex Jones, different guests high up that have access to FBI and these emails have said that the FBI knows about pizzagate but the Justice department has tried to stop them from going forward. The good news is that people from the NYPD know and said they will come forward if the FBI does not. I just hope that it does come out because I guarantee you that people are blackmailing each other right and left. If any of the sadistic perverts feel threatened, they will stop at NOTHING to not be caught. As we know, murder is a good way to shut people up and teach others a lesson.

            alright dude, we're aware of the satanic/occult connection by now, and anyone who has looked into it certainly understands how these people view "energy," and that the term "energy vampire" probably is accurate to a certain extent (I know you didn't coin the term, I've heard it many times before)... but to assert that "right now, they are sacrificing children at an unprecedented rate" is total speculation. I agree that this is a critical time for the investigation, but let's stick to the facts and evidence please. That's the ONLY way this investigation is going to stay credible, and will eventually reach the normies.
