             How is this a troll post . He said "Accessing .onion sites on the dark web doesn't take advanced computer skills."  And its more than true! If we can find these sickos the police sure as hell can ! I'm not recommending anyone click on the link , I didn't , so I don't know where it will take me .

              I have a question.  I am a dork when it comes to the net and tech stuff.   I was doing a little research on that article about the mother that filed a lawsuit against backpage and when I clicked on something I hit a porn site.  Whoa.  What a shock.  I immediately got rid of it, do I have to report this to the FBI.  I have heard others suggest that.

               What are they doing with all the reporting pizzagate has been doing is what I say. Nothing so why report? Have you seen the FBI report site. You fill out a report and you never hear anything back. It's like a front of a building with a comment slit in the door.

                Not every one of them is an empty suit.  There are some good men and women working there.  I still have faith in humanity.  Some days it is hard to focus on that, with what I read all day, but I believe it to be true.

                 I believe also that there are ones who care. Can you imagine what they go through everyday. The big white elephant in the room that all these big fancy investigators know what's going on but do nothing about it. Tax payers art paying big bucks for FBI. There are pizzagate investigators that would DIE for these children and ARE. I'll never forget when I saw someone filming in a tunnel, in a video, and the light brushed up against these child's bare legs approx about 9 years old. When the light was going to the child the flashlight just showed the legs of the child. The legs got up rapidly and they acted very agitated. That's when I saw all these nickel sized bruises covering both of this little ones legs. The legs where covered. That has given me nightmares, that is what is happening here. These children endure torture  because a sadist can not have an organism without hurting the person they want to rape. It's impossible for them to finish thier sex routine without this sick demented practice. they use these kids for many different sessions until the child just collapses begging for death. All those little marks were from a small hammer or something that could produce the same design over and over with force. I am so angry that I feel Like I could take a bullet and die while trying to protect these kids. We will never know the full story. That is my theory of what is behind the saddest legs I've ever see. It would have been better to not have legs at that. I wonder will these kids get help. When will the good guys do something. Are they willing ,,,the good FBI and the good cops,,,,,,,to die for these kids?

                  We think of these horrors every time we read a story like yours.  There is nothing we can do except report what we see.  We now have phones and can take pictures when we encounter something we know is wrong.  I think that every LE person goes out there thinking and hoping that they will not die when serving this Great Country, but sometimes they do.  We have to depend on them.  Some have hands that are tied, others are part of this horrid game, and others will end up doing the right thing.  If there are good people at the top right now organizing something, remember there are many trying to stop them.  We can only do what we can do, we are only human.  And our hearts are in the right place.  Pray for that child every night, the one you saw with the beaten legs, it will help both of you.
