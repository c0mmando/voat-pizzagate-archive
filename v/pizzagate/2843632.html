<p>At least 1,400 white Dutch girls are sex-trafficked every year by nonwhite “immigrants” from Morocco, Turkey, the Caribbean and Gypsies from Eastern Europe, police in the Netherlands have admitted.</p>
<p>News of the scandal has emerged after a joint peroration between police and “Watch Nederland,” one of the Dutch government’s Department of Social Welfare organizations, the Center against Child Abuse and Human Trafficking (“Centrum tegen Kinderhandel en Mensenhandel”) was reported by the Dutch newspaper <em>Algemeen Dagblad</em>. The investigation showed that the nonwhites first groom the girls to be their sexual partners, and then film themselves having sex with the girls. The videos are then used as blackmail – if the girl doesn’t agree to become a prostitute, then the video of the girl having sex is released on social media.</p>
<p>Police specialists in human trafficking, Marijke van Overveld and Esmee Huijps, told the Alegemeen Dagblad that the traffickers are “Moroccans, Turks, Antilleans and Roma.” Immigrants from the Antilles come from the “Netherlands Antilles,” a number of islands in the Caribbean Sea located due north of the South American coast. Most of the nonwhites there are descendants of black slaves imported during the 17th and 18th centuries. Many of the girls being abused are in the Dutch social care system or come from run down housing estates, which is a situation very similar to that in the UK where nonwhite gangs also engage in the same practice.</p>
<p>It is believed a trafficker can earn up to €800 a day pimping out a Dutch girl, who is usually kept against her will in a suburban apartment, or even in a garden shed. The traffickers use adverts on secret chat groups on social media to bring in new customers. Recent figures shows that only one out of every ten abused girls receives any help from authorities, and so teachers, doctors and community leaders are being trained to spot the signs of grooming in their local jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has very liberal laws when it comes to sex; the country is famous for its sex tourism and red light districts, and the country has very relaxed attitudes to casual sex amongst teenagers, something which has caused STI rates in the country to soar and puts girls at risk from adults who pose as teenagers. Laws made it difficult to prosecute grooming gangs in the past, with several high profile cases collapsing because the gangs used legal loopholes to avoid a conviction. However in recent years the laws have been tightened and conviction rates are increasing.</p>
<p>Authorities in the Netherlands are now starting to crackdown on the grooming of girls, with fake ads being placed by anti-trafficking organisations which lure criminals into a trap. They are then arrested by the police and prosecuted. Police in the Netherlands revealed that the profits from the pimping out of underage girls are used to fund greater criminal operations abroad, and are also used to fund Islamist networks across the world, including the Muslim Brotherhood and Chechen terrorist organizations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>16.4% of the total births in 2003 were to parents of non-European origin, although they account for only 12.4% of the population in the 25-34 age group. For example, 3.8% of the births were ethnic Moroccan, although they were only 2.26% of the 25-34 age group. Respective figures were 3.27% and 3.0% for Turks. The TFR for Moroccans in 2003 was 3.3 while the general TFR was 1.73. TFR was 2.3 for Turks, 1.7 for Surinamese, 1.8 for Arubans, 3.0 for Africans and 1.8 for Americans</p>

<p>Yeah, fuck the Netherlands. Germany has more hope for fuck\'s sake.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/Mtizq07.jpg">The Netherlands</a> has been so kiked and <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/QSX9hya.jpg">pozzed up</a> for so many decades it seems that they are <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/ljkuRYY.jpg">hopeless to rescue</a> at this point.</p>
<p>Which is a tragedy that angers me on a personal level, because I\'ve been to the country many times. In spirit they are cucks and race traitors and simpleton pastoral bumpkins who are naive and easily brainwashed by the kikes/Commies. The best thing that could happen to save the lost Dutch people would be for the tanks and jackboots of real Europeans to march through their streets and clean out all of the pests and mongrel garbage.</p>
<p>Which brings me to <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/NKugJlG.jpg">pedophiles</a>. Netherlands is probably the 3rd biggest den of pedophile gangs, with America being #2 and the UK being #1. I\'m not talking the odd stray pedophile in Amsterdam. No, I\'m talking some of the most organizaed pedo gangs in the world who call the Netherlands as their home base. They have some of the most blackmailed and infiltrated judiciary, police and government – who are all pedos. And the Dutch give harbor to the worst of the worst pedos–<a href="https://imgtc.com/a/0m7YCQg">baby rape gangs</a> who produce millions of photos and thousands of films. <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/3pplCwE.jpg">Snuff</a>, murder, <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/MGiUVvj.jpg">torture</a> and <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/mbdSbHI.jpg">imprisonment of kids</a> recorded on video and then sold via Tor hidden services. </p>
<p>If you research the history of pedo gangs and if you keep tabs on these vile degenerates, then you already know one of the most infamous pedo gangs called the <a href="https://imgtc.com/a/ckExx7H">Pedophile Information Network</a>, which was <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/dF2gU8s.png">an open political group in the UK</a> in the late 1970\'s, and which flew under the coat tails of the Faggot Liberation Movement to sneak into Parliament and Westminster, and after a few years of being untouchable then the tides turned and people began asking &quot;WTF?&quot; then many of the leaders of PIE fled to Amsterdam. The Dutch have been complicit in one of the longest running and biggest global spanning pedo movement in history. It will be very hard to forgive the weak-willed Dutch for this because the Dutch have enabled (((forces)) which have erode traditional White Christian families in all EU nations.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I will say that anytime I see some FAKE NEWS about the great skill of Dutch intelligence and a long con tale about how they helped (((NSA))) and (((GCHQ))) foil some plot, I just laugh at how shitty they are at their jobs and how moled up and how compromised and infiltrated the Dutch glowniggers really are. </p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, the Dutch are an honorary member of the FVEYs for all of the Epstein-esque pizzagate pedo elites they have unwittingly assisted by not rolling up the pedo gangs in their own back yard and not throwing the book at all of the pedos who have sought safety in escaping to the Netherlands. Someday the Dutch glowniggers are going to pay a very heavy price for their treason. The only true hope is when the 4th Reich marches through their streets someday soon, at the very least all of the spies and intelligence officers will swing from the lamp poles.</p>

28th Decemeber is Dyzymas Day and used to be associated with beating children.. so bring all children that are available..sounds kinda omnious..

               I havent found anything relating her directly to Dyncorps sex trade, organ harvest in Bosnia and Kosovo and Croatia.. but she was in the circles of power at that place at 2002, in Belgrade, Serbia.. acting as liason to major donor countries and she interacted between embassies and international organizations representatives....
I find it difficult to believe that she wouldn't have known what was going down...
Following section for context : some info about the horrors of the UN mission in Bosnia..backed up by Dyncorp..
              </p>
              <p>
               The OSCE Mission in Kosovo (OMIK) was established in supoprt to the UN UInterim Mission (UNMIK).  The 500 American mebers of the UNMIK police were Dyncorp employess under contract from the US State Department..DynCorp; Vinnell, a subsidiary of TRW; SAIC; ICI of Oregon; and Logicon, a unit of Northrop Grumman
For information reasons..

               The OCSE chose WHO got sent to Bosnia/Yougoslavia..Resumés were collecterd and studied and only the finest pedophiles were sent..
In Bosnia, employees of DynCorp were found to be operating a sex-slave ring of young women who were held for prostitution after their passports were confiscated. In Croatia, local forces, trained by MPRI, used what they learned to conduct one of the worst episodes of "ethnic cleansing," an event that left more than 100,000 homeless and hundreds dead and resulted in war-crimes indictments. No employee of either firm has ever been charged in these incidents.

            First of all, we don't have council estates. It's not England here. These guys are known as 'loverboys' and they prey on poor damaged girls and turn them into whores, basically. It's been a problem for a while, and of course it's shitskins doing it.

            I don't know what the fuck your problem is other than that - if you've really been to my country before, you've clearly never left de Randstad, which is where we keep the human garbage. Your pedo claims are just retarded Anglo newspaper bullshit. With all the problems in The Netherlands we're still doing a lot better than Murrica. We know enough to keep our refugees in camps, buddy.

              I lost the book. It was a original conspiracy book written in the 1950's. It is probably still in Mena, Arkansas, unless they burned it in a fire. Trust me.That old book was about people who were there, and were not at the same time. Gypsies: Kings of Con - Article - POLICE Magazine

            And i like how you blame others and not parents who don’t give a shit about their kids cause they’ve been manipulated to believe in diversity and propaganda. I’m tired of people blaming everything instead of looking at themselves as horrible parents.

             You're missing the point that the marxist bullshit propaganda is designed to break apart nuclear families.These parents are a symptom of the (((problem))).

              Feminism does NOT promote pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The feminist movement has been at the forefront of getting the public to see and believe how widespread and how damaging child sexual abuse is.

                  Make me a whaa burger. I was referring to G. Dubya's constant adding of extra vowels. It was a joke that maybe was before your time, but easily recognizable to the people who were in that time frame, and read/watched the news. If you get that bent out of shape over that, then you will have some kind of nervous breakdown. Sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying

               The investigation showed that the nonwhites first groom the girls to be their sexual partners, and then film themselves having sex with the girls. The videos are then used as blackmail – if the girl doesn’t agree to become a prostitute, then the video of the girl having sex is released on social media.

              lmao if you actually believe that.  so embarrassed about fucking one darkie that she agrees to fuck dozens of darkies for money.  more likely they hook them on the hard drugs famously permitted by Dutch law and society.

             <p>
              you have to face the fact that historically white women had a reputation for a much higher sex drive and were prized as concubines for partly that reason.  White women have spread legs for every invader AND occupying ally in history.  Indian women killed themselves to avoid rape in similar circumstances.
             </p>
             <p>
              and Dutch girls are known to be the sluttiest in Europe, except of course for British, whose parents typically reward them with an all-alcohol-included graduation trip to the club-resorts of Ibiza or Mallorca just because they're cheap.
             </p>
             <p>
              Europeans deserve this for their hedonism, selfishness, substance abuse, and complacency.  Why did you even include the birth rates?  Are you outraged that the immigrants don't break up their families too?  The Muslim birth rate in Europe is not very high; the problem is WHITE girls having basically ZERO because we allow them to.
             </p>
             <p>
              You're also wasting your time trying to red-pill people in this boomer/woman-infested subverse whose mods literally express pro-Jewish views.

              You just said it: these girls are ghetto trash of SINGLE-MOTHERS (+900% risk to children for sexual abuse)who CHOOSE that lifestyle because they are subsidized by the state to do so.

              the common denominator to all these problems INCLUDING immigration is that women are weak and stupid.  They make stupid decisions because their brains aren't designed for responsibility of any kind.
  Do you think any woman would support confiscating bastard-children from these sluts to place them in foster care?  Of course not, poor lady, don't judge, blah blah

                  the orthodox jews in Israel and Jew York have sharia patrols for jewesses dressed like sluts or dating non-jews, gender segregation to prevent premarital sex and cheating, homemakers, and a high birth rate.

                   I don't care about that. I don't care about shitskins. Jews need to be eliminated before anything else can happen. Don't stray from the most important aspect.

                    muslims are cleansing france of jews.  40% of UK jews said they'd consider emigrating to Israel if the muslim-backed Corbyn became PM.  and muslims are only like 6% of UK.

                    if UK patriots were smart they'd be using the grooming scandals to publicize the degenerate Jewish role in debasing your girls to the point of regarding their sexuality as worth only candy, booze, and loose cigarettes.  The average 21 y-o UK girl has had 9 partners.  two more than avg boy of same age

                    but UK patriots are not smart.  they are in fact extremely stupid, enough to fight in the streets for an obvious kike shill like Tommy Robinson just because he's anti-Islam.  Oi, hes a foighta!  'E's a regular working-class bruv, 'e likes 'is football and noights at the pub!

              If you take time and be patient your children will learn. People are lazy and let the tv control the narrative. It always is the parents in the why? Because they control every aspect of child’s upbringing and they blame everything else except themselves.
