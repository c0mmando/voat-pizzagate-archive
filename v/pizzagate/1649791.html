<p>&quot;Gulftainer’s (a UAE company) exclusive arrangement with Port Canaveral was negotiated in secret under the code name ‘Project Pelican.’...<strong>The 35-year lease grants Gulftainer exclusive rights to operate an intermodal container terminal inside Port Canaveral, near sensitive Department of Defense and NASA installations.</strong>...Recently-installed Port Canaveral CEO John Walsh concealed the Pelican Project and the identity of Gulftainer from the public until June 24, 2014, by which time Gulftainer officials from the UAE had already arrived in Florida for a signing ceremony.</p>

<p>Jack Lew was the same person the Clintons put in charge to &quot;oversee the investigation&quot; of DynCorp sex trafficking and other related charges.

<p>John Walsh CEO of Port Canaveral bears investigating as does Jack Lew.</p>
<p>I don\'t have a smoking gun or direct link that this forum demands between pizzagate child trafficking specifically and the illegal exotic wild animal/animal parts trade.  So if this has to be deleted so be it.  But I think it is important to bring up the animal trade in connection with the shipping of children and all other shipping of contraband as well.  Pizzagate has opened the door to a far bigger picture for must of us regarding the illegal global criminal network operated by those put into postions of power by the public trust - our elected officials and those that they choose to literally conspire with.

<p>Perhaps some of you here would be willing to dig to see if we can connect some of the names in our shipping posts to the trafficking of children and animals.</p>',

            I was thinking of correcting your "pelicans symbolize delivery of young children" sentence, thinking no, that's
            <strong>
             storks
            </strong>
            . I searched "pelicans deliver babies," so see if I was missing something. I found a children's story. I'm not trying to make anything of it, just thought it was a weird story, especially in light of this sub.

            In 2015 they are working on getting that node connected right up to the Florida railway system.  Working so hard at it that CEO John Walsh pushed too hard and had to step down:   "The port began to take more cargo ships last year when Dubai-based Gulftainer Corp. started operating a new terminal. The Port is seeking permission to connect the cargo operations to the Florida East Coast Railway. It’s part of ongoing expansion of cargo operations at the port, which has been more focused on cruise ships."

            Very Good Post.  Wonderful, Actually.  I will give you a clue.  Check into SHODECOSA.  They are located in Haiti right near the Port-au-Prince Shipping Port.  They also are serviced by DHL and have large warehouse.  I have had this on my radar but am too busy with St. Louis.  I really think this is a connection.  If I remember correctly, they also have houses that they seem to rent out, but they don't look too luxurious, if you know what I mean.  Check it out and let me know what you think.
