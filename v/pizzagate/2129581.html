<p>It has been about six months <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1671832">since my last post</a>. The post got 563 upvotes and 12,424 views (mostly because I replied to every comment).</p>
<p>I now want to write a follow up to elaborate on my most recent conclusions.</p>
<p>Everything I say below is based on the mind-blowing article, <a href="https://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/trump-controlled-by-mossad/">Donald Trump Controlled by Mossad</a>. The article has three parts (<a href="https://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/trump-controlled-by-the-mossad-part-ii/">part two</a>, <a href="https://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/2016/11/19/trump-controlled-by-the-mossad-part-iii/">part three</a>). In my view, everyone on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> should read all of them, especially if you want to become clinically depressed.</p>
<p>Before I go any further, let me explain that I was Donald Trump\'s biggest fan. I wore the t-shirts. I wore the MAGA hat. I read The_Donald on reddit religiously. I made bets on Trump keeping his campaign promises. I lost friends over my support for Trump, because they think he\'s racist. He\'s actually much, much worse than racist, as I will argue below.</p>
<p>I was already putting a lot of pieces together before I found the Donald Trump Controlled by Mossad article. First, I realized that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4x6a21/wikileaks_is_a_limited_hangout_theory/">Wikileaks is a U.S. intelligence limited hangout</a>. To see this, I recommend the excellent four part series on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2WSI_M15-k">Wikileaks by Richard Hall on youtube</a>. In fact, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQwCjFkhLbdpsu1xUDm7oGA">all of Richard Hall\'s work</a> as one sane voice in the alternative media that I still trust. If you don\'t want to watch the videos, I will just point out three facts: (A) Julian Assange was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/20/growing-up-with-the-family-inside-anne-hamilton-byrnes-sinister-cult">raised in a cult called The Family</a> that dosed innocent people with LSD, the famous MK-ULTRA mind control drug, (B) Julian Assange has <a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/wanted-by-the-cia-julian-assange-wikileaks-founder-28548843.html">publicly endorsed the official government story of 9/11</a>, which is preposterous, and (C) Wikileaks has never published anything that really damaged the CIA (although the CIA loves to pretend that Wikileaks damages it).</p>
<p>Take &quot;<a href="https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/">Vault7</a>,&quot; which I was so excited to see this year. It turns out to be a collection of spyware that any reasonable person would expect the CIA to have. Discovering that the CIA has spyware is like discovering that the NBA has basketballs. It\'s completely unremarkable, which is why the media scarcely even reports on Vault7.</p>
<p>As a second example, consider Assange\'s <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/julian-assange-clinton-foundation-isis-same-money-saudi-arabia-qatar-funding-a7397211.html">famous interview with documentary film maker John Pilger</a>. In this interview, Assange describes &quot;the most significant email in the whole collection.&quot; What does this significant email state? It states that the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar finance terrorism. And yet, everyone already suspected that. Anyone familiar with the missing 28 pages of the 9/11 report knows that. This email is what some people would call a &quot;nothingburger.&quot; (And it \'t distracts from more interesting emails, like those referencing Molach, Minerva, pizza, and hot dogs.)</p>
<p>After you realize that Wikileaks is a limited hangout, then you realize that Wikileaks threw the election for Trump through the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/dnc-emails/">DNC</a>, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/">HRC</a>, and <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/">Podesta</a> emails (as well as <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-30/wikileaks-warns-it-launching-phase-three-its-election-coverage">an additional set of emails that were threatened, but not released</a>). Wikileaks <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/304964-assange-denies-backing-trump-liking-either-candidate">says that it didn\'t receive any information on Trump</a>, which is silly considering his past with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/donald-trump-roy-cohn-relationship">Roy Cohn</a>, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/04/jeffrey-epstein-trump-lawsuit-sex-trafficking-237983">Jeff Epstein</a>, underage sex lawsuits, and <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/report-queasy-aussies-killed-trumps-casino-bid-over-mafia-connections/">Mafia casino money laundering</a>. What Wikileaks should have said was &quot;we\'re just releasing the information on the Democrats, because we\'ve decided that we want Trump to win this time.&quot;</p>
<p>Now consider the other narrative we were sold - this time from the FBI. On October 30, 2016 (in the middle of the Podesta emails), the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5aqvr4/this_is_the_secret_of_the_fbi_tweets_this_is_what/">FBI starts tweeting about Trump, Clinton, Tesla, and the Clinton Foundation</a>. These tweets clearly refer to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5abcwa/remember_fbianon_on_4chan_here_is_fbianon_thread/">4chan insider FBIanon</a>. The tweets are being <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-emails-doj-inspector-general-investigate-fbi-comey-actions-n706186">investigated by the Inspector General</a> (allegedly). One of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ao7p1/looks_like_they_delivered_the_goods_right_on/">FBI tweets was predicted in advance on 4chan</a>, further confirming the authenticity. John Podesta has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-podesta-something-is-deeply-broken-at-the-fbi/2016/12/15/51668ab4-c303-11e6-9a51-cd56ea1c2bb7_story.html">written op-eds against the FBI</a>. Whatdoesitmean.com (famous disinfo site) has <a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2299.htm">published an article claiming that agents inside the FBI are loyal to Trump\'s AAG, Rosenstein</a>, after his successful prosecution of the Clinton Foundation fake HIV drugs company. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/georgwebb">George Webb</a> repeatedly says that field FBI is filled with good, patriotic people, and there are only a few bad apples at the top.</p>
<p>All of these data points suggested that, yes, there are good patriots in the FBI. And those patriots were tweeting out to us, trying to get us to investigate pizzagate to prevent Hillary Clinton from becoming President. The problem is that this narrative is bullshit. There are no patriots inside of the FBI trying to save the country by electing Trump. In fact, Trump is no better than Hillary Clinton when it comes to #pizzagate. Anyone really familiar with the FBI should have recognized that. It\'s an organization that was founded, and controlled, by a famously corrupt director (Hoover) who was compromised through sexual blackmail, just like Trump.</p>
<p>In fact, I conclude (based on the above) that Wikileaks and the FBI Twitter/FBIanon events are part of the same disinformation campaign. Take this statement from FBIanon in response to the question &quot;Tell me the dirt on Trump&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trump has donated to the Clinton Foundation in the past, though for fairly innocuous things like building permits and such. He is smart, so his tracks are covered well. But if any prosecutor wants to go very in-depth Trump would be brought on bribery charges. He could easily get out of the them, but he would be charged nonetheless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That statement (I\'ve read the FBIanon transcripts dozens and dozens of times) make Trump sounds so sweet and innocent. He tried to bribe a corrupt government bureaucrat to overcome government red tape and build a skyscraper? Who gives a fuck! That makes him sound like the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>Yet that statement is so woefully incomplete. What about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yRVhOCw3LY">Roy Cohn, Trump\'s famous longtime Jewish lawyer who engaged in child sex blackmail operations</a>? What about <a href="https://fitzinfo.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/donaldtrumpghislainemaxwell.jpg">Trump repeatedly partying in NYC with Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, the woman who procured underage girls for Jeff Epstein? What about the <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-dropped-230770">document filed in federal court accusing Donald Trump of violently raping a 13 year old girl</a>, and the two other witnesses that corroborate that story? What about Trump\'s <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/report-queasy-aussies-killed-trumps-casino-bid-over-mafia-connections/">link to mafia-casino money laundering operations</a>?</p>
<p>Funny, FBIanon doesn\'t mention any of that shit. FBIanon sounds just like Julian Assange, who says that Wikileaks didn\'t receive any dirt on Trump. That\'s because they are (I submit) part of the same U.S./Israeli intelligence operation to sway the public to Trump.</p>
<p>I\'m not going to repeat the entire Donald Trump Controlled by Mossad article here. You should read it all yourself. But, for brevity, I will just point <a href="https://fitzinfo.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/trump_daughter-ivanka_creepy_01.jpg">one picture</a>, which is worth a thousand words. The picture shows Donald Trump with 15 year old Ivanka. She\'s wearing a &quot;butterfly&quot; shirt that is suggestive of CIA Monarch programming. The skirt, shirt, and hand gesture all seem to sexualize her. And they are sitting next to a statue of two parrots having sex. This potentially explains why Ivanka talks in the same slow, emotionless, disaffected monotone that Julian Assange does.</p>
<p>My conclusion is #pizzagate is a limited hangout that selectively exposes Trump\'s opponents.</p>',

           . The article has three parts (

            published an article claiming that agents inside the FBI are loyal to Trump's AAG, Rosenstein
           </a>
           , after his successful prosecution of the Clinton Foundation fake HIV drugs company.
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/georgwebb">
            George Webb
           </a>
           repeatedly says that field FBI is filled with good, patriotic people, and there are only a few bad apples at the top.
          </p>
          <p>
           All of these data points suggested that, yes, there are good patriots in the FBI. And those patriots were tweeting out to us, trying to get us to investigate pizzagate to prevent Hillary Clinton from becoming President. The problem is that this narrative is bullshit. There are no patriots inside of the FBI trying to save the country by electing Trump. In fact, Trump is no better than Hillary Clinton when it comes to #pizzagate. Anyone really familiar with the FBI should have recognized that. It's an organization that was founded, and controlled, by a famously corrupt director (Hoover) who was compromised through sexual blackmail, just like Trump.
          </p>
          <p>
           In fact, I conclude (based on the above) that Wikileaks and the FBI Twitter/FBIanon events are part of the same disinformation campaign. Take this statement from FBIanon in response to the question "Tell me the dirt on Trump":
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Trump has donated to the Clinton Foundation in the past, though for fairly innocuous things like building permits and such. He is smart, so his tracks are covered well. But if any prosecutor wants to go very in-depth Trump would be brought on bribery charges. He could easily get out of the them, but he would be charged nonetheless.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           That statement (I've read the FBIanon transcripts dozens and dozens of times) make Trump sounds so sweet and innocent. He tried to bribe a corrupt government bureaucrat to overcome government red tape and build a skyscraper? Who gives a fuck! That makes him sound like the Virgin Mary.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yet that statement is so woefully incomplete. What about
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yRVhOCw3LY">
            Roy Cohn, Trump's famous longtime Jewish lawyer who engaged in child sex blackmail operations
           </a>
           ? What about
           <a href="https://fitzinfo.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/donaldtrumpghislainemaxwell.jpg">
            Trump repeatedly partying in NYC with Ghislaine Maxwell

           <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-dropped-230770">
            document filed in federal court accusing Donald Trump of violently raping a 13 year old girl
           </a>
           , and the two other witnesses that corroborate that story? What about Trump's
           <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/report-queasy-aussies-killed-trumps-casino-bid-over-mafia-connections/">
            link to mafia-casino money laundering operations
           </a>
           ?
          </p>
          <p>
           Funny, FBIanon doesn't mention any of that shit. FBIanon sounds just like Julian Assange, who says that Wikileaks didn't receive any dirt on Trump. That's because they are (I submit) part of the same U.S./Israeli intelligence operation to sway the public to Trump.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm not going to repeat the entire Donald Trump Controlled by Mossad article here. You should read it all yourself. But, for brevity, I will just point
           <a href="https://fitzinfo.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/trump_daughter-ivanka_creepy_01.jpg">
            one picture
           </a>
           , which is worth a thousand words. The picture shows Donald Trump with 15 year old Ivanka. She's wearing a "butterfly" shirt that is suggestive of CIA Monarch programming. The skirt, shirt, and hand gesture all seem to sexualize her. And they are sitting next to a statue of two parrots having sex. This potentially explains why Ivanka talks in the same slow, emotionless, disaffected monotone that Julian Assange does.
          </p>
          <p>
           My conclusion is #pizzagate is a limited hangout that selectively exposes Trump's opponents.

            Trump isn't a Rothschild asset at all, the Rothschild's are furious about Trump getting into power. What's going on is actually very simple, we have Gloablists Vs Zionists, the Globalists are the ones who prioritize setting up a UN world government funded by climate taxes - Rockefeller, Rothschild, Soros are key players, Hillary, Obama etc work for them. UN and EU is all part of this agenda. The Zionists are the ones who prioritize Israel-first, protecting Israel and taking control of the countries surrounding them . As long as you leave these guys alone, they won't bother you, unless you are a neighbor. Some of the top ones aren't very visible, the more visible players are Rupert Murdoch, Breitbart, Infowars, WikiLeaks, Trump, Brexit campaign etc. These guys all used to work together, but now that the globalist plan is in it's advanced stages, Soros and Co had decided that a firm hand would be needed with Israel, as otherwise nobody would trust the world government if Israel could get away with whatever they wanted. The Zionists weren't happy with the way things were going, so they've now started to dismantle bit by bit the Globalist project for world government. That is what Brexit is about, that is what Trump is about, that is why Trump is not going along with the climate change agenda.

            Great post. I'm only through the first part of the article, but the evidence is overwhelming. I have always been really disappointed by the huge number of people here that see Trump as some kind of hero. For so many reasons well-outlined in your post, and from the way he acts literally every time he's in public, it's clear that he's part of the game. The problem of high-power pedophilia in this country is a systematic one, and our current two-party system is the perfect platform for fooling the masses into thinking that their votes have actual political power. My strong belief is that we need to see this as a human rights problem, not a problem associated with one or another political party.

             Watch this video to find out the real reasons why Trump's hands are tied. Plus there's proof his family members were threatened as soon as he was he walked in to the Oval Office.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now look how many have been arrested for pedo related crimes since he became POTUS. Do you honestly expect the same results would have occurred under Hillary?

             Also was there a script for Kubrick's next film? It would have been a shocker.

               Yes, that one. Many professional athletes, actors and musicians are involved. He is one of the leaders in the NBA and created a Coats for Kids program which is a cover for the real Truth. His handlers have controlled him since his days in the juvenile detention center where the level of abuse is out of control, and he has been rewarded along the way. He is propped up and used as an example to hide the real Truth about Racine and the system of extreme corruption and abuse that also includes the highest incarceration rates of young black men in the nation. He is fully complicit to everything, and has been given a platform and unlimited resources to push their agenda. They use sports as a key access point to youth.
              </p>
              <p>
               Another person from Racine who is involved that no one suspects is Kristin Bauer van Straten, the actress from True Blood deeply involved in Scientology circles, whose brother Jeff Neubauer is closely linked to the Clintons, Podestas and others at the top level. He has since take a leadership role in the global education reform, controlled by the same handlers in Racine, Wisconsin.

            I'm familiar with ClosedSociety404's original work on reddit, but you're missing the real reason Trump can't drain the swamp: the economy is dependent on CIA
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/dec/13/drug-money-banks-saved-un-cfief-claims">

            . If he drains the swamp, they drain the US dollar's status as reserve currency.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why economic alternatives like the
            <a href="https://newfederalistpapers.joomla.com/11-orbitalring">
             space elevator
            </a>
            are utterly crucial to any discussion of swamp-draining. The swamp exists because it functions. Unspeakably evil, but there's bread on the shelves.
           </p>
           <p>
            It doesn't have to be this way, but it will be until we start demanding a viable alternative.

             This is a fallacy. Money does not matter to our future. Money is only relative. We cannot wait for Trump, or we will be waiting forever.
            </p>
            <p>
             Only the Truth can Save us all, and time is running out. If we wait too long, there will never be any recovery at all. The economy does not matter. We have a solution to this, but we cannot get to that without the world knowing the Truth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Do you trust what Bill Gates says about how we need to decrease global population? Do you trust that we cannot feed and shelter the world? Do you trust in the flimsy dollar? Do you trust in Bitcoin? Do you trust in the corrupt Church, or the corrupt government?
            </p>
            <p>
             They have many layers of contingency plans. Trump is one of them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our government agencies are terrorist organizations. Secret societies are terrorist organizations. Why would we as a global people negotiate with terrorists who only want to control, harvest, and enslave us?
            </p>
            <p>
             It is time for the world to learn the real Truth and the real Agenda before it is too late. The Truth is Free.

              This is precisely the problem. The economy is propped up by the petrodollar, enforced by the military. The dollar would collapse if it isn't simultaneously buoyed by the confidence of coming 25% growth.

               You provided two links. I'm already familiar with CIA drug operations. I also instinctively distrust the MSM, including the Guardian.

               <li>
                Shrinking our budget should make the dollar go up, not down.
               </li>
               <li>
                The military does things to prop up the dollar. But it also does a lot of other insane shit to serve other purposes. Like balkanizing Iraq for Israel, and fighting the Taliban to grow opium.
               </li>
               <li>
                I'm familiar with HSBC. I've read that it was used to launder money for deep state crooks. Never read that it was used to finance Social Security and Medicare. If you can provide a source, I will reconsider, but I'm highly confident that you can't, because the proposition is kind of absurd on its face.

                  For the average American, it would be something like an economic end of the world. If you believe the government statistics, we have trade deficits of
                  <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-trade-deficit-causes-effects-trade-partners-3306276">
                   $500
                  </a>
                  billion dollars, or almost 20% of our trade. In reality, we can probably double that due to the arms smuggling and drug-running of the CIA.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In other words, a 40% drop in the standard of living of the average American if the dollar goes down. And that's before China starts to muscle us, imposing tariffs to utterly destroy the industry we have left, and the financial sector shifts elsewhere. And that's before you consider things like civil unrest or outright civil war breaking out.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is not a scenario we are willing to accept and say "life goes on." The bankers have done this too often, and they're going to stop.

                   A 40% reduction in the government's budget does not translate into a 40% drop in our standard of living.

                  <p>
                   The U.S. budget is 4.2 trillion. A 40% reduction would take us to 2.1 trillion - the budget around 2002. The standard of living was ok in 2002.

                   What you don't understand is that the U.S. does not need 40% of its government budget. We don't need the war in Afganistan. We don't need the CIA. We don't need 20-40% of the things that government spends money on.

                    I'm obviously not defending the CIA or the wars. You simply aren't considering what I said because it conflicts with libertarian talking points you've been fed. With a conservative estimate, the US is bringing in something like $1-2 trillion of wealth per year through illegitimate means.

                    You seek to replace this with hand-waiving about budget cuts. Cutting that much money out of the economy would destroy millions of jobs, put disabled and elderly people on the street, and cut basic services like healthcare and schools. Those are the things that lead to economic collapse, starvation, civil unrest, and the like.

However, it's possible to use the discernment process to identify valid leads and truths, even from those people who intend to deceive us.

             You should always have suspicions about any anon, and judge everyone based on what they say, not what they claim to be. People LARP on 4chan every day, but it's rare that one of them posts verifiable, viable intelligence.

              If U.S. Senate Anon was controlled opposition, he would not point to Racine, Wisconsin. Racine is not part of the controlled narrative, and may be the only thing that truly scares those who are involved at the highest levels.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is also why Racine has the highest incarceration rate of black men, who they claim to be "Super-Predators", and is a Sanctuary City to control the mafia and other gangs including MS-13. They need control, and they need protection. They trot out corrupt black leaders like Caron Butler, Rev. Hargrove, and the corrupt police chief to hide the real story about deep racism and the model for Enslavement. They give them military equipment and vehicles, high powered weapons, and illegal surveillance tools to spy on the citizens in order to control them.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is part of the model of Community Policing, education reform and prison reform all created in Racine. Who would win in a fight or war between a group of old corrupt white elite pedos and a group of oppressed young black men that found out the real Truth about Racine and the people who control it? They cannot allow the masses to find out the real Truth and the real Agenda - Complete Global Enslavement. It is a race between the Truth and AI.
             </p>
             <p>
              U.S. Senate Anon may not be who he claims to be, may not be powerful enough to do anything, and may not know everything (and also trusts Trump more than he should), but he does know that Racine is a vital key to showing the real Truth to the world.

             Senate Anon does the exact same thing as Wikileaks, FBI Twitter, and FBI anon: portray Trump as our savior who is fighting for the good guys. He's part of the same limited hangout disinformation campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
             That doesn't mean that Senate Anon doesn't provide good information. I bet 95% of it is great. He says a lot of important things about freemasons. But he's still trying to sell us on Trump, and mentions nothing about Roy Cohn or Trump's connections to Larry Silverstein, Soros, Jeff Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell.

              Senate Anon appears out of nowhere. Had some discussions with them on the chans. When pressed, Senate Anon used the same excuse and same words as FBIanon as to why the Trump Admin doesn't take down big name pols...it would collapse the narcodollar the CIA is using to "pay our bills" lmfao

               That argument from Senate Anon doesn't make sense, for several different reasons that I have explained in other threads. CIA drug money goes to Wall St., not Main St.

              I'm learning that when they try to sell us on a savior, that's the key to recognizing they're intentionally or unintentionally trying to dissuade us from taking personal responsibility and making a difference on our own.

               The "Root" of the Truth is Racine, Wisconsin. Once people understand how everything is connected, they may finally act on it.

                That you added "campaign" is very important so that no one misinterprets what you said as claiming pizzagate isn't real. I think Stone is a pawn for his masters.

                 Stone is a pawn, but people like him are far more important than the elected officials. He has been involved in blackmail for decades, including involvement in the Watergate break-in (to recover records relating to blackmail).

                 Yes Stone is not the top of the pyramid. I'm guessing that the top is the Rothschilds and people we've never heard of. Like Red Cloak in Eyes Wide Shut.

                 And to be precise: #pizzagate is real in the sense that there is occult child trafficking and rituals by the elite. #pizzagate is a limited hangout in the sense that its original sources (FBIanon, the Podesta emails) were selectively chosen, and trailored, to indirectly expose Trump's enemies, without directly or fully exposing anyone, and without exposing Trump.

            You're going to get downloaded as F so I'll put myself out there in support of you. First off, good for you for seeing the light re: Trump. I had to do the same thing with HRC. It's painful to part with heroes, but when you realize they're not a hero, the pain is necessary.
           </p>
           <p>
            We the people have to take responsibility for waking up the masses because Trump et al aren't going to do it for us, and I think that's probably your point in posting this.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, good for you and let the downvotes commence.

             Perhaps you are correct, but I am not sure why I will necessarily be downvoted. The researchers at VOAT are interested in truth and justice, not supporting Donald Trump at all costs. We'll see.

              There are a few VOATers who will download you, but there are many shills who will also download you. And me. But I'm hopeful that more voats will tip the other way. Regardless, you're putting the information out there and that's what's important.

                Thanks for posting this again.  I have said many times I did not vote for Trump but am willing to give him a chance.  I am still hoping but now wearing Rose Colored Glasses.  I think the Train Has Left The Station.  Am Still hoping.  I am not one to throw in the towel until the very end.  I also do not want to burst other's bubbles, but soon we must just read the hand writing on the wall.  I am not trusting anyone really in this game for so many have thrown US under the bus. Upvoat 4U for Your Courage.

                 Thank you. I voted for Trump. My first political vote ever. I still love Trump's platform. But I predict that he will not follow through on most of his campaign promises. Instead, I predict that he will mostly support the agenda of the bankers, intelligence services, and Israel. But I hope I am wrong.

                  I hope you are wrong too.  I voted for Bernie and the thought of voting for Her made me sick so I voted for the other Woman Candidate JS.  I don't know if DT is involved in the pedo stuff, there is just not enough proof so I think too like you that he is just going to do everything the bankers want him to do and what will boost HIS bank acct.  I will NOT label anyone a pedophile unless there is solid proof, and I do not mean speculation or looking through a political lens.  That is dirty pool, no matter how I feel about their policies. Amen.

                   Of course. I believe in due process and the presumption of innocence. But it doesn't look good when Trump has friends like Roy Cohn, Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein, and Larry Silverstein.

                     I doubt this corruption will be exposed in our lifetimes. I hope I am wrong. But I think we probably just to settle for living in a world controlled by elite psychopaths.

                      I will be fighting them every step of the way.  Once people get wind of this, it will spread like wildfire.  We only need one big break.  I say exposing the Masons for what they are will do it.
