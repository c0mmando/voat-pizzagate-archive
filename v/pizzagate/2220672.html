            I've known this family for many, many years, and honestly Billy Ray to a certain point had his head on straight when he first started out because he had some great people in Nashville and his own family,  but his now ex wife was the one who pushed all of those kids to be stars. It's sort of like the whole Mom shoves her daughter into every pageant into the country while still living in a double wide trailer because she doesn't view her child as her child, but as her meal ticket. None of those kids ever had a chance. It has been said that Miley and her brother both were molested by Tish and I do know because I saw it with my own eyes that she used to beat Miley as a toddler. My dad was a roadie for various music artists in Nashville, and when Miley, well her real name is Destiny, and people would go back and forth calling her Miley or Desi, was about 2 ish, she was sick and crying on this tour bus and instead of her mom actually comforting her, Tish stood up, had been drinking and screamed at the top of her lungs for her to shut the f* up then absolutely slapped her as hard as she could in the head. I had just turned 13 and even I thought it was insane how mean she was to her. Over time all of those kids, which btw Miley's older brother isn't even Billy Ray's bio son, but over time those kids just started basically raising themselves.

              She's a horrible, cocky woman who would sell her own dog to be worn by Cruella De Ville herself. She is definitely an opportunist and last I heard she was still Miley and Noah's manager. She is right up there in sketchiness with that Kardashian daughters mom, Kris Jenner. She was definitely one of those type of women from what I can remember of her that when she started aging significantly that she would pimp out her daughters.
             </p>
             <p>
              I did not see it for myself with my own two eyes but one of the things I had heard from friends and other industry kids was that  Tish and Billy Ray taught Miley and her younger sister Noah how to give oral sex on a banana, and about a year later she started being on the Hannah Montana show. She also allowed Miley to wear thongs at a pretty early age, like 5 or 6 in age. I do know that Tish's father was a Freemason, he had that ring that they wear but I have no clue how far up he is in the Freemasons. I doubt very high because they are all from Podunkville Kentucky out in the middle of no where.
             </p>
             <p>
              To be honest Billy Ray really gave off the vibes that he was a very nice and decent person when he was starting out and then when he got in cahoots and really started getting into television as opposed to the music, that is when, at least to me casually observing it all as a pre-teen and teenager, that he was then surrounded by the sick fucks. Nashville is not a huge area and a lot of the people know each other, it's very much like a family, but even in Nashville people do have their secrets they don't want out, but it is no where near as bad as Los Angeles.
             </p>
             <p>
              At least to me Tish was and still is definitely an oppurtunist and just going by what I've seen myself she's definitely physically abusive towards her children but I can't say with certainty that she has sexually abused her kids or allowed Billy Ray to sexually abuse those kids. I'll have to pull out my old tour journals next time I go to my dad's house and see what I might have seen and wrote down. Hope this helps!

            What happened to this campaign?! I guess they worked it out in COUPLES COUNSELING which it was rumored that they actually went to as a father and daughter. The levels of skeev in these Disney and Nickelodean families just never fail.

            I remember Fiona Barnett (a supposed SRA survivor from Australia) calling out Billy Ray as having performed sex acts with Miley at Bohemian Grove. Not supporting the idea but connecting the accusation is out there. She is definitely fits the profile of someone with oversized platform and fame who uses it to promote sexual deviance (Like Gaga, Madonna, Spears et al). Are any of her songs good? If he thinks Satan is after her it's probably because he knows it's true. Maybe he regrets letting the darkness in. While I do derive pleasure from seeing all these monsters go down, I hold out hope that some can be redeemed even now. I'll say a prayer for Miley, may God have mercy on her soul.

             Dammit I wished my dad was still alive. I do know that during the summer time I'd always go out on the road with him on various tours from the time I was 4 until I was 17 when he retired due to some health problems. Billy Ray Cyrus did go several times to Bohemian Grove because every time the road crew would have to set up the stages my dad would always take me and my brothers to my grandmothers house in California cause he did absolutely want to keep us safe. Never stated why but the moment I saw the name Bohemian Grove pop up much later I was like whoa so people know about that stuff.
