            It is preposterous to claim that devil worship is a branch of Christianity, even from a materialistic viewpoint. The Devil or devils have been worshiped independently of Christianity for millenia. Part of your point is however valid, but I think it could still be misleading. Anton LaVey, who founded the Church of Satan, was not a Satanist in the previously accepted form of Satanism. His ideas were more in line with materialism, hedonism, and individualistic amorality. He rejected the spiritual forms of Satanism which preceded him; he was an atheist who did not believe in the spiritual world. His "Satanic Bible" was largely plagiarized from other works. The argument could easily be made that he was not truly a Satanist at all. In that sense, the activities alleged in pizzagate have little relation to the actions of the Church of Satan founded in 1966 by LaVey.
           </p>
           <p>
            True Satanism has never ceased to exist, and the establishment of the Church of Satan has done nothing to diminish its existence, in fact the opposite is probably true. This is most exemplified in the work of Michael Aquino, who left the Church of Satan and founded the Temple of Set, which is a religion based on immaterial spirituality, inspired by Set, who Aquino said revealed himself to him as the true identity of Satan. Aquino disagreed with LaVey regarding the existence of spiritual beings and the power of magic. Aquino's ideas and activities were more in line with those of Aleister Crowley and his associates, who sought to summon deities through occult rituals, which often involved sacrifice of living beings, drugs, and sexual acts. These are the things which are said to be part of pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just because the Church of Satan has been the most widely publicized form of Satanism for the last 50 years, does not mean that it is authentic, or that all people practising "Satanism" are part of it. Many, if not most, true Satanists have never had anything to do with LaVey's Church of Satan. True Satanism involves doing evil for evil's sake, and summoning the powers of the forces of evil. It is not rational and does not benefit its adherents in the long run.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand that you do not want your "religion" to be unfairly tarnished by its association with pizzagate, but if you really want people to think well of you, I don't think being any kind of a Satanist is a good idea.

            Devil worshippers are a branch of christianity in the sense that they worship the christian devil. They are the opposition to normal christianity, but they still keep themselves within the boundary of Christian faith.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am indeed with the "New" (1966-2016) branch of satanism, and I do not pray to any god, other than myself.
