            (safe link) in reference to sexual pictures of teen models.

            Also, Chad Belville was a county attorney in Iowa (?) In the late 90s or early 2000s. He was reprimanded twice for DUI's and ended up resigning. Look into 304 E Beth Dr (I believe that is the address). It's owned by an Erik Anderson according to tax records. Many of Chad Belville's businesses are listed there, so I'm wondering if he somehow is using Erik's last name now? Idk, he's listed as an agent on a bunch of different porn companies.

             He is also involved in companies like DARK LIFE IMAGES LLC (websites like catieminx.com or privateschooljewel.com, both NSFW of course), STAG HOMME LLC (websites like staghomme.com - NSFW) and TIFFANY PRESTON PRODUCTIONS LLC (websites like mybestfetish.com - NSFW). As you said before, a lot of porn stuff. Nearly all of those use ccbill.com for billing, but I guess it's hard to find a provider, which allows pornographic stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
             So the main question is, if it's worth digging deeper on him and posting the deleted post again with some additional information so it doesn't get deleted again or believe he doesn't know what the company he is working with is doing. Or if he knows it and hes still just a regular agent, who doesn't care about what the companies are doing in general. Opinions?

              Porn itself is legal, it's the underage stuff that we need to focus on. The thing about this guy is it seems like almost all of the companies he's involved in are porn-related in some way. If you can find links to underage stuff with his other companies like we did for Opulent Media, then I think a good next step would be to see if the companies he represents are connected in any way. It could be some sort of trafficking ring. Considering Brent Harracksingh's ownership of Opulent Media and his past allegations of trafficking, and considering Belville is Opulent Media's rep, Chad Belville could be the ring's legal representation. You would have to find evidence that these other companies are involved in underage porn (and other supporting evidence), but it could turn into something. It's definitely worth looking into further.
