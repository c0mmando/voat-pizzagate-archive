            This is arguably the most important thing you could do - because the globalist evil goes back decades, and is in everything. Only when you apply this mindset specific of Jah-Bal-On do you understand why globalism is so evil.

            When you're rested enough to read more, here is a great explanation on the Freemasonry plots of the American/French Revolutionary wars.

            Warning, it's 10,000 words, so about 1.5 - 2 hours of your time. But it explains everything from the Freemasonry perspective as it relates to Donald Trump. Full of sources, tons of photos, every word relevant.

            I explained that meme magic is "cultural communicative memory". It is real, no argument there.

           <p>
            The global elite believe Moloch to be real. If you believe in that, that's fine. You can't prove it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I only make claims I can prove, and I do show how the masonic mindset highlights the nature of man as swinging between the poles of good and evil.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, even though Moloch can't be proven to be real, the globalists are meme-ing it into reality simply by the actions of their Illuminati rituals.

           <p>
            Freemasonry is the opposite of the global elite. The French and American Revolutions happened because the Freemasons plotted the destruction of France. They had to, because there was no reaching the aristocrats.
           </p>
           <p>
            They're not opposed to being ruled over, so long as it's not tyrannical.
           </p>
           <p>
            Freemasonry has everything to do with pizzagate because it is how we end pizzagate. It doesn't stop at saving the kids, it ends at understanding the globalist mindset.
           </p>

            The post above links the nature of just one ritual.

            This post below highlights why exactly the Revolutions happened, how the Freemason patriots made America great (the first time around), and who your biggest fan (at ending this madness) is:
