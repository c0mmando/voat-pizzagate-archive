            I'm so sick of your rudeness and negativity. As soon as I see your profile, I usually pass on to the next comment because I know your going to post the same old negative bullshit. You act like anybody that likes Trump is an idiot.

            Any explanation why Kushner owns the 666 fith avenue building, and houses Lucent technology, which rsearches the RFID chip that is to be used to chip peoples right hand? Or why Kushner was sponsored by Soros for 259 million? Anybody care about these connections? Nothing to see as usual regarding Trumps connections?

            Sky Roberts, father of Virginia Roberts, who has demanded Prince Andrew face court is his daughter's claims were true
           </p>
           <p>
            Last night, the father of alleged victim, Sky Roberts, 58, demanded the royal face court if his daughter's claims were true.
           </p>
           <p>
            He told the Sun on Sunday: 'I don't care if he is prince or pauper. If what Virginia said is true he has to pay the consequences.
           </p>
           <p>
            'If the Prince had sex with my daughter when she was underage, he has to be prosecuted.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking at his ranch in Summerfield, Florida, he added: 'I thought all of this was in the past. I feel sick now to think of these men and her.'
           </p>
           <p>
            His daughter said: 'There will be a time when we explain stuff, just not this time.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Elsewhere, Epstein's former butler Juan Alessi - who worked at his Florida mansion for 11 years - said in 2011 the Prince spent weeks there.
           </p>
           <p>
            He claims Prince Andrew was a guest at pool parties full of naked women and also enjoyed daily $100-an-hour massages.

            Why The Donald Will NEVER Discuss the Jeffery Epstein/Clinton Connection
           </p>
           <p>
            And like every good “Sunday Night Smackdown” worth televising, there has to be a bit of pre-production in making sure the performance goes off without a hitch; like a right hook from Hulk Hogan, the effect of the punch must be believable. Occasionally, that means pulling your blows a bit less than usual to sell the performance, but to genuinely damage your opponent is frowned upon by the performers as well as their bosses.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Vince McMahon of this analogy is none other than the Deep State, carefully managing what controversy is fit for public consumption and what remains unaired. In this author’s recent article, The Donald and the Deep State, Trump’s friendly (and in some cases, business) relationships with documented players in the Intelligence-run drug and arms trade is demonstrative of this dark hand of Deep Politics at work.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s why The Donald can never broach the topic of Mena, AK in polite company or the Clinton’s integral role in shipping wholesale amounts of cocaine into this country during Bill’s time as Governor of the State. Such a conversation would be equally uncomfortable for both parties involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those hoping the revitalization of the “Bill Clinton Rape” meme and the 42nd President’s documented debauchery will culminate in revelations of high-level political pedophilia, a-la Jimmy Saville, can The Donald deliver a knock-out blow? Or is the Clinton/Epstein Connection, like The Mena Connection before it, a blacklisted news item?
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, Bill’s credible relations with elite pedophile and general cretin Jeffery Epstein are a matter of record, a relationship that the American people deserve to know more about. As the New York Post recently reported on James Patterson’s new book entitled, Filthy Rich: A Powerful Billionaire, the Sex Scandal that Undid Him, and All the Justice Money Can Buy, Clinton was far more than a casual acquaintance of Epstein
           </p>
           <p>
            Surely the Trump campaign is planning to take advantage of this bombshell information! The President of the United States jet-setting around the world with a convicted sex offender on a plane nicknamed after a book and film about pedophilia are undoubtedly too damning to leave untouched.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet the very next paragraph of the Post story in question reveals why Epstein is destined to remain an untouchable figure in this (s)election cycle:
           </p>
           <p>
            “Epstein was also a regular visitor to Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, and the two were friends. According to the Daily Mail, Trump was a frequent dinner guest at Epstein’s home, which was often full of barely dressed models. In 2003, New York magazine reported that Trump also attended a dinner party at Epstein’s honoring Bill Clinton.”
           </p>
           <p>
            –NYPost.com
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach is quite the happening place; not only is it alleged that the Saudi arms dealer implicated in Iran-Contra, Adnan Khashoggi, used the Trump property as a hideout while on the run from INTERPOL for looting a bank in Thailand, it’s now revealed to have been a popular hang-out for Epstein as well. Keeping the company of rapists and war criminals, in some cases the same criminals your political opponent rubs elbows with, is hardly a topic Trump wants introduced into the public consciousness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just as the Deep State would like it.

            ROBERT MAXWELL, ANDREW, SPOOKS, MAFIAS, NAKED GIRLS
            <a href="https://aanirfan.blogspot.com/2015/01/rob...afias.html">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Robert Maxwell "had free access" to the Bush-Reagan White House.
           </p>
           <p>
            British Publisher Robert Maxwell Was A Mossad Spy.
           </p>
           <p>
            And so, It was Ghislaine, Roberts daughter who, in 1998, recruited the 15-year-old Virginia Roberts to work as Epstein’s ‘masseuse’, from Donald Trumps Mar-A-Lago hotel and resort
           </p>
           <p>
            Meeting Epstein for the first time at his Palm Beach mansion, Virginia was led into the massage room by Ghislaine. After a bizarre interview conducted by a naked Epstein, Ghislaine told Virginia to follow her instructions.
           </p>
           <p>
            ‘She had me put oil on my hand, then she grabbed one of his feet and started to massage it. She told me to take his other foot,’ says Virginia. ‘Then she told me to take off my clothes. He had sex with me. ‘Ghislaine said, “She’s got a knack for it.” And I thought, “These are important people. I must be doing something right.” ’classic grooming technique of a pedophile).
           </p>
           <p>
            Ghislaine had fled to New York after the death of her father, who fell off his yacht – named the Lady Ghislaine after his favourite child – in mysterious circumstances in 1991.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Virginia, Ghislaine helped smooth the way for Epstein to sexually molest the young girls recruited to ‘massage’ him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Virginia says: ‘I once asked Ghislaine why she got as many girls as she did for Jeffrey, as she supposedly had been his girlfriend and they seemed to have a grounded but non-monogamous relationship.She replied, “It takes the pressure off me to have sex with him.” (hmmmm, whoa, says alot about Epstein's prowess).
           </p>
           <p>
            Ghislaine also held ‘auditions’ for masseurs to work for Epstein on his private Caribbean island, Little Saint James.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Virginia, Ghislaine was the undisputed leader of the girls in Epstein’s entourage. ‘She was funny. She was boisterous.
           </p>
           <p>
            'I was scared of ever saying no to her. I was always compliant. I knew if I said no to anything, I would be on the street,’ she says. She adds: ‘Ghislaine was a photographer and she took many of the nude pictures that were all over the houses, including the ones of me in a hammock that Bill Clinton and Andrew and all their visitors had to have seen.
           </p>
           <p>
            ‘One year, I couldn’t think what to give Jeffrey for his birthday and Ghislaine said: “Just give him a photograph of you.” I had a nice picture of myself, lying against a tree, fully clothed, but when 'I showed it to her, she said, “No, you can’t give him that.” She took me and laid me naked across a hammock and put a sheer piece of net across me and posed me with my legs open, a bit provocatively, and that was the picture she had me give Jeffrey.’
           </p>
           <p>
            Another girl Ghislaine targeted for Epstein was Nadia Bjorlin, an actress who stars in the American soap opera Days Of Our Lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now 30, she was just 13 when she attracted the tycoon’s attention. Her mother, Iranian-born Fary, spoke last week of the family’s disturbing experience. Nadia’s father, celebrated classical conductor Ulf Bjorlin had died just a year earlier. (Another classic abuser profile taking advantage of the vulnerable).
           </p>
           <p>
            ‘My daughter was a singer. She was a baby. She was a skinny little girl, not mature for her age. She was 13, but everyone thought she was nine or ten.(Whoa Ghisllaine, Jeffrey....)
           </p>
           <p>
            Another haranguing abuse story:
           </p>
           <p>
            Johanna Sjoberg, a church-going brunette, who was hired ostensibly as an occasional home help but then induced to perform demeaning sexual services, told of a bizarre incident with a doll.
           </p>
           <p>
            Johanna met Prince Andrew in the library of Epstein’s New York townhouse in Easter 2001, when Virginia was also present.
           </p>
           <p>
            ‘Andrew was sitting there in a big leather armchair behind which there was a desk covered with photos of girls and young women including the one of me in a hammock,’ says Virginia.
           </p>
           <p>
            ‘I don’t think Andrew could have missed seeing it when he walked in.’
           </p>
           <p>
            The Prince had been given a Spitting Image puppet of himself by Ghislaine, who was also present. Johanna was sitting on Andrew’s knee, and said Ghislaine made Virginia sit on his other knee.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then, Johanna recalls, Ghislaine ‘put the puppet’s hand on Virginia’s breast, then Andrew put his hand on my breast’.
           </p>
           <p>
            Virginia says she was mortified when she realised she had been summoned that day to entertain the Prince.
           </p>

            <strong>
             Zampolli, UN, Freemasons, Nazi &amp; Mafia Ambassadors
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Paolo Zampolli has a Dominican diplomatic passport and is officially the Ambassador of the Commonwealth of Dominica for Oceans and Seas- an absolute joke. According to the UN’s Blue Book, Zampolli is Dominica’s (lone) Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN.[30] There is great concern that Zampolli is using his stable of MK ULTRA Sex Kittens at the UN to compromise and bribe foreign  heads of state, officials, diplomats and ambassadors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Paolo Zampolli is using the island nation of the Dominican Republic as a front in the old Masonic Agnelli Family business of running a secret international network of Luciferians, Mafia, SS, Nazis, Fascists, Mercenaries, Criminals, Prostitution and Pedophile rings for the Knights of Malta, CIA, and a Demonic New World Order.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2004, ID Models boss Zampolli was exposed as a former business associate/partner of the infamous convicted Pedophile Island financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In 2004, Zampolli and Epstein unsuccessfully tried to buy Elite Model Management at auction.
           </p>
           <p>
            People like Zampolli aren’t in the business of making poor Central European bloc young ladies legitimate models or superstars. He is an old world criminal Luciferian/Masonic pimp– a white slave trafficker. Zampolli manufacture “Executive Whores” for the elite, wealthy, famous, powerful politicians fascists, bureaucrats, master criminals, and world leaders.
           </p>
           <p>
            Zampolli runs an illegitimate international escort racket with stables of mind controlled East European Sex Slaves. He passed down a “sex kitten”  charter from the Old World Ruling Houses of Europe, Knights Templar, and Freemasonry  to Donald Drumpf, Jeffrey Epstein and the Mossad [Ehud Barak].

            As has been proven by history human ignorance is exponential en masse, and this mass of people, unfortunately, are so highly conditioned it is no less comparable to walking in a literal fog. Partisan politics and party affiliation is such a strong divisive tool that it takes a ton weight dropped on people's heads to get them to see that both parties are corrupt as hell.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our entire lives have been embedded with triggers that are designed specifically so that government can run this way.  Number one on that list for this specific mode of conditioning tools is (ritual) sport, why do you think they get you whipped up into such a frenzy for opposing teams, usually a face off of opposing, familiar colors.
           </p>
           <p>
            People are often lead astray with the false promises of hope and change, and when you're faced with two turds but the other one just happens to be a shinier turd, people know it stinks but it just happens to be a better looking (on paper) turd.

            Please America, start realizing these fuckers really do got it all wrapped up, we've just gotta learn to get smarter than that now.

            Good grief are we really still that divided on this?!?  For all the reasons DTM has mentioned and many more, Trump is 100% a bona fide insider and member of the (((club))).  It's flabbergasting that people are still so dim witted to all this.  Wake the fuck up, the whole of politics is a ruse and they have you chasing your tails.  There is not a hope in three ways from Sunday that Trump would have been selected (not elected) although he likely was the popular choice, if they hadn't planned for it.  The demonization of him by the MSM is a psy op strategy to divide &amp; conquer and any token actions taken on the part of child abuse rings etc are just that, token, insignificant and mollifying.  There will be no big takedowns from within!
           </p>
           <p>
            And finally GTFO with this Deep State crap, it's another psy op to imply that there is some kind of internecine and adversarial battle between good &amp; evil taking place in the shadows.  We can all appreciate that there are levels above the presented face of World power but even the term Deep State is an establishment creation and wreaks of more obfuscation and panto drama.  If something so threatening to the status quo occurs at those levels, we will never hear about it.  They have it sewn up and there will be no hero coming to our aid, we can only rely on ourselves.

            I have been asking for a while if Trump is connected to the groups you mention.  If you are right, then Trump will make his own noose.

            Either way, it ends for the Cabal.   Enough of this shit.

            The Pedo-Elites want Voaters to believe Trump is compromised.

            Always consider who gains from a new narrative.  In this case, the real Satanic Pedos win by muddying the waters and dragging Trump into this.

             Hope is wishing and dreaming. Dreams don't come true and wishes are fairy tale material. I will predict this...You are all mostly good people that will come to the same conclusion, because you won't tolerate nothing ever happening indefinately. So i will wait for you guys to play out  your hopes and dreams. I think you guys will last at least another year. They will throw in a Trey Gowdy insulting them high five moment here and there. But they wil never arrest themselves. And they don't allow outsiders positions of power to take them down. Start using your common sense about this. Your world is fake. The world i describe adds up.

            I wouldn't doubt Trump has been bribed and/or threatened into doing nothing. But if Trump wasn't a threat why is the Deep State and the MSM still trying to tear him down?
           </p>
           <p>
            If CNN is any example they're terrified of Donald Trump. Getting rid of him is all they talk about 24/7.

             to lead you to the exact conclusion that you have come to. trump is a psy op. hes supposed to get the pro gun, pro life, conspiracy theorist, anti-vaxxers, "science deniers", the christians, and all the rest of the enemies of the jesuits behind him, so they can take them down with him. i suspect trump might be the last president of these divided states.

             Isn't that also how they would act if they wanted you to be convinced they are enemies? Have you seen the endless predictive programing on Trump and being Potus, or Trump and his wall. Ton of stuff out there.

               I was referring to taking a bribe from the Deep State. He is part of it. He is a crook for sure, not saying he couldn't be bribed in a business deal. He is the same as the Clintons, he just has arrogant charm. I actually find him amusing. The Clintons make me want to spit at the screen.

              If he couldn't be bought then he was threatened no doubt. All that would entail is someone in the Deep State and/or Mossad sending Trump pictures of his grand children.

               Why would you need to do that when he was likely made Potus by the cabal? Unless he is doing a Kennedy and not doing what he was expected to do once he got there. That would be hard to know. No way in hell the elections were allowed to be chance. Realizing this, you quickly see how it makes you forget the basics. They usually control both sides.

             "I wouldn't doubt Trump has been bribed and/or threatened into doing nothing. " We both know good and well I am suggesting it is beyond obvious he is one of them and this is as phony as left vs right, so why would they need to bribe or threaten him?

             I am shocked this is coming from you. You don't think it is a show? They have to legitimize that he is the enemy. But nothing ever happens. Ever. Nobody is going to jail.  Trump against the Deep State is fake. Nobody nis investigating PG. You still have not addressed that he is in league with the Jesuits, business ties with the NYC Mob, CIA and Mossad, and takes advice and endorses heads of the CFR and Trilateral comission. You still haven't addressed why he pushes the false 9/11 narrative and is friends with 9/11 criminals. Since when did it mean nothing in this sub to visit pedo island? You guys have a loty of explaing to do how all the sudden you ignore all this when usually you would consider it evidence. Not impressed how this sub gives Trump a pass and pushes obvious phony Deep State civil war BS. Again, please adress it. Explain why it doesn't count for Trump.

              But.. i still Hope that it´s is more like DrakMath say´s..  But my Hope will not be there forever. "Drain the F**king SWAMP"

              I think of all the children suffering everyday, and that it´s already been far to many day´s gone. But i will be patient..

              (so the charges will stick) But if Trump don´t deliver soon.. this will end bad.

             <p>
              PS: Just a thought.. on more leaning to what DarkMath say´s: 1. Investigation´s should not be announced. 2. Nothing of this magnitude of an investigation would be announced. 3. If this investigation is going on. and i say if.. It would be keep´t very quiet until they finally strike.

              Why is everyone worried about Trump anyways?  Someone just posted an Illuminati flowchart with The Council of 300 at the top.   Why not do something about that instead?   Make changes at the top.  The President is a puppet no matter who it is.

                I think there is more of a chance of something changing with Trump in office rather than Hillary.  Hillary sucks Illuminati cock, but I think that Trump does not like to be pushed around.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think that Trump will comply eventually because they can take him out along with his family.  My hope is that Trump will expose the system so we can deal with it.  Trump did fire Comey, which is a step in the right direction.
               </p>
               <p>
                Obama complied and did not expose anything.
               </p>
               <p>
                Chaffetz was moving in the right direction, but then suddenly decided to retire.
               </p>
               <p>
                I understand what you are saying, and I understand your concerns, but these people are putting their lives at stake, and their families lives at stake.

                I think that positive change will take a lot of time because most people are in denial about reality.

              I'm not disagreeing with you. I strongly suspect Trump has been bought off and even threatened into doing nothing.

              Your explanation of the MSM faux rage makes sense for the most part. The only problem is their fear looks so real to me.

               It would be far smoother sailing for Trump if he had been bought off.  Second, why would they stir up assassination fervor and why involve all of Hollywood in this 9 month tear down of Trump, risking rouge attempts on his life?  Trump's ego is enormous and his desire to be adored is obvious. I highly doubt that he would sign up for this abuse for simply being 'bought off'.  No way.

                Again, you don't need to buy off people on your own team. Notice when he lies, he throws up the eye of Horus 666 hand sign and smiles? Watch what he is saying when he does it. Seems obvious he is there to get you to except what comes next, because he is pushing that it is neccesary, and he is against them.  If he says we need to attack North Korea, we must need to because he is not one of them. I don't even think this is confusing really. They don't leave elections to chance. Like they manipulate everything then cross their fingers about elections. Us vs them. Nothing else is true.

               I am or you are? You did not adress all that was brought up. Why is it ok he was at pedo Island but it is evidence agains others? Why is it ok he goes to Jesuit functions all his life? Why is it ok he owned and controlled voting shares of a Rockefeller/Rothschild Mob front with connections to the CIA and Mossad? Why is it ok he lies about 9/11? Why is it ok that he hangs with the Clintons at pedo Island, at functions and just years ago boasted loudly about how much he loved the Clintons? Why doesn't it matter that he refused to back his promisse and have the Clintons investigated? Why is it ok that Trump blatantly flashes Masonic hand signs ? You seem to completely lack all reason when it comes to Trump. Not one repsonse explained why he gets passes for all this.

                I think you are asking the right questions about Trump.   These questions need to be asked about other politicians, too.   Hillary is obviously "in" with the groups you mention.  At least there was a sliver of hope with Trump.  If Trump backtracks and turns into a pussy like Obama, then...

                you are a broken record DTM and are ignoring current events.  Trump is being highly scrutinized by many investigators of PG, so don't paint everybody with your wide brush when something positive happens, OK ?
