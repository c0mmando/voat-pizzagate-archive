According to the United Nations, the human rights violations against Rohingyas could be termed as &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;.</p>
<p>In 1982, General Ne Win\'s government enacted the Burmese nationality law, which denied Rohingya citizenship, rendering a majority of Rohingya population stateless. </p>

<p>On May 1, 2015, a joint military-police taskforce discovered at least 30 bodies at an abandoned human trafficking camp in the Sadao district of Songkhla province close to the Thai-Malaysian border. Many were buried in shallow graves, while others were covered with blankets and clothes and left in the open. Police reports indicate the dead are ethnic Rohingya Muslims from Burma and Bangladesh who starved to death or died of disease while held by traffickers who were awaiting payment of ransoms before smuggling them into Malaysia. </p>
<p>Rohingya fleeing abuses, persecution, and hardship in Burma’s Arakan State or Bangladesh are often trafficked and abused by networks working with official protection, while in other cases victims simply receive little protection from Thai authorities.</p>
<p>Rohingya men are sometimes detained in overcrowded immigration detention facilities across the country, while women and children have been sent to shelters operated by the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security. Many more are believed to be transferred through corrupt arrangements into the hands of human trafficking gangs where they face cruel treatment and no prospect of assistance from Thai authorities.</p>
<p>As with previous Thai governments, the military junta of Prime Minister Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha does not permit the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to properly conduct refugee status determination screenings of Rohingya.</p>

<p>In fact, according to a U.S. Department of State 2012 human rights report, Burmese officials have reportedly kidnapped Rohingya women and forced them into slavery on military bases.</p>
<p>Burmese security forces also systematically rape and assault women and girls</p>
<p>Notably, many do not make it to their ultimate destination because they are arrested en route and detained by authorities in Thailand. Women and children detained at government run detention centers remain vulnerable to traffickers who have gained access to the buildings, where detainees should theoretically enjoy official protection.</p>
<p>Thai and Burmese efforts to combat trafficking have been less than vigilant. For example, the Thai government has not investigated or prosecuted trafficking gangs and they continue to operate with impunity. Nor have Thai officials determined why traffickers can access women and children in the detention centers described above.</p>

<p>Burma’s state security forces are profiting directly from the trafficking of stateless Rohingya Muslims, earning up to $7,000 per boatload in exchange for passage to sea, a human rights group has found.</p>
<p>Police, navy and army officials have been working directly with transnational crime syndicates by escorting boats to international waters, providing rations or extorting bribes from passengers, many of whom are forced to hand over cash or jewellery as payment, according to Fortify Rights, a Bangkok-based group which conducts independent monitoring of rights violations. </p>
<p>Not only are the authorities making life so intolerable for Rohingya that they’re forced to flee, but they’re also profiting from the exodus,” said its executive director, Matthew Smith. “This is a regional crisis that’s worsening while Myanmar [Burmese] authorities are treating it like a perverse payday.”</p>

<p>Police, navy and army officials generally earn $500 to $600 per boatload of asylum seekers en route to Thailand or Malaysia, where they are often held in trafficking camps and rendered vulnerable to being sold into forced labour or sex work. One interviewee described his Malaysia-bound ship handing over $7,000 to the Burmese navy in exchange for safe passage.</p>
<p>The revelations come just a few days before Barack Obama’s second visit to Burma, and raises serious questions about the south-east Asia nation’s repeated claims of reform – an issue Obama brought up with the Burmese president, Thein Sein, in a recent telephone call.</p>

<p>Just north of Phuket, Thailand\'s holiday paradise, is the town of Baan Bang Khi. There, in a simple wooden house, lives a little old lady called Noi who runs most of the human trafficking industry on the west coast of Thailand. I was surprised when Noi agreed to meet me for an interview about her business, but when she explained how she has the Thai police in her pocket it began to make a little more sense—what does she have to fear from the press? Noi claims she pays the cops handsomely not only to look the other way but to actively participate in the smuggling of refugees from neighboring countries like Burma and Laos.</p>
<p>&quot;The authorities in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Malaysia, and Thailand work together with us,&quot; she said. &quot;First, I receive a call from the brokers or the Thai marine police, who tell me where the refugees are.&quot; Most of these refugees arrive by boat and are collected by the police before Noi picks them up and &quot;[houses] them in shacks in the jungle&quot;.</p>

<p>Thailand’s stunning Andaman Coast is the domain of five-star resorts, pearl-white beaches and sun-bronzed tourists, but it also hides a grim secret. Amid this tropical hedonism, thousands of refugees fleeing savage pogroms and sectarian violence in Burma have reportedly been sold into slavery with the collusion of local officials</p>

              As I said, don't believe everything you read. What you are seeing is the beginning of the West move to take over the many resources in the country. Stories of persecution are being manufactured. Now I'm not saying the Burmese Military are innocent but the AID/NGO agencies want to get in there to establish the ratlines.

                The Military Junta is a brutal regime and most Burmese suffer under them, not just the Rohingya. The focus on this Muslim minority, which are not even Burmese is the problem. Have you seen this "play" in other developing countries with oil?
