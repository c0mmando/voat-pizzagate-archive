<p>So, quite frustrating but I am pretty sure I grabbed a screenshot of the rest of her friends (if I scrolled right on this picture <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ekSEi1A.png">https://i.imgur.com/ekSEi1A.png</a>) but I either didn\'t do it or I somehow lost the picture. However it was after I did most of the research so I already grabbed screenshots from most of her friends. Since then it\'s gone private and I can not get it back.So you will have to take my word for it. Isabella Burley was on the list for sure.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/ek2TaGh.png">https://i.imgur.com/ek2TaGh.png</a> - I don\'t know where this picture is from of course but this looks very much like a dead body, look at the unnatural positions of the hands, the spilled wine glass and the chair on the ground. It\'s almost as if she has been thrown of a higher balcony and landed there. Not saying this is from her personal collection but it\'s still a twisted picture to post, maybe someone else knows where this is originated? Only comment from Isabella is &quot;Paris&quot;</p>

<p>And just for laughs, instagram policy on nudity:</p>
<p>“We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.”</p>',

           - I don't know where this picture is from of course but this looks very much like a dead body, look at the unnatural positions of the hands, the spilled wine glass and the chair on the ground. It's almost as if she has been thrown of a higher balcony and landed there. Not saying this is from her personal collection but it's still a twisted picture to post, maybe someone else knows where this is originated? Only comment from Isabella is "Paris"

          <p>
           And just for laughs, instagram policy on nudity:
          </p>
          <p>
           “We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don’t allow nudity on Instagram. This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks. It also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed. Nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.”
