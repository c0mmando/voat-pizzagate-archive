<p>A few years ago, a Dutch politician named Roelie Post who holds a seat in the European Comission had uncovered unlawful, criminal action surrounding the adoption of Romanian babies and children. These children were abducted from their families in Romania, to be sold to elite European families under guise of adoption. After uncovering clandestine operations through these adoption agencies Roelie then wrote a letter to our prime minister who was at that time the EU chairman for the time being, presenting her self as a whistleblower. </p>
<p>However, early this month, the now vice chairman of the EU, another Dutch EU politician, Jan Timmermans, has actually FIRED her over the whistleblowing. Leaving her without a job at the end of this month (July) AND without income. Jan Timmermans recently conducted a presentation before the EU about how whistleblowers needed to be protected and being treated properly. But, apparently this did not apply to whistleblowers within the European Parliament itself! Instead of protecting her and taking up the case, he FIRED her after 35 years of service. </p>
<p>Here you can read about it; the lady has done an interview, which is available in several languages. Dutch, English and French:</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, Hillary Clinton had a hand in this particular adoption scandal that\'s being exposed. Hillary Clinton pushed Romania for the opening once more of inter-country adoptions.</p>
<p>Clearly, with this expose Roelie became a threat to the supply of &quot;delicatesse&quot; for the cabalist elite and was dealt with from within the EU itself.</p>
<p>Through this post, I\'d like anyone reading (especially in the EU nations) to help and support Roelie and make a lot of noise in the European Parliament. Let Europe show mr. Timmermans that extreme hypocrisy and covering for the cabalists\' delicatesse procurement by demonizing and firing a righteous member of the EU is NOT TOLERATED. Like, let hell break loose over it! Here in Holland government is already becoming aware and has started asking questions.</p>

            Hello my friend.  Hope you are well. More horrid adoption stories.  Romanian, Russian and our own European Adoption Agency of Ohio raided by the FBI last year.  When will it end?  I remember reading about those poor Russian children brought here.  A few ended up dying.  No wonder Putin put an end to it.
