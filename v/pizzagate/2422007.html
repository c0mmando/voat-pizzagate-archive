<p><a href="http://arkglobeacademy.org/governance">Jacqueline Russell is the chairman of the ARK family</a></p>
<p>What is ARK? ARK is a network of schools and associated programs linked to London\'s moneyed elite and \'psychological operations\' cohort known loosely as Tavistock. As per a summary in this helpful <a href="http://archive.is/3q1LN#selection-571.0-571.599">Pastebin</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ark, &quot;an education charity that exists to make sure that all children, regardless of their background, have access to a great education and real choices in life&quot; is the primary funder of both Teens and Toddlers and the Lucis Trust. Ark was co-founded by a group of hedge fund financiers including Paul Marshall and Ian Wace of Marshall Wace and <em>Arpad Busson</em> of EIM Group, who is founding chairman of its board of trustees (Ark.6). According to the WSJ, Arpad Busson, a major Clinton donor, and the EIM group have been investigated for laundering Terrorist Money, including Osama Bin Laden (Ark.7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the book <em>For Export Only: The untold story of the Romanian ‘orphans’</em> by Roelie Post, the author alleges that Romanian orphans were in fact not orphans but babies for sale to buyers shopping through NGO channels.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(p. 50) I remembered our field visit in July 1999….the leagans we had visited looked like baby shops. Had Mariela not told me, a while ago, that in the maternity wards mothers were often ‘advised’ to leave their babies behind, because they were considered too poor?</p>
<p>(p. 77) We asked about the mothers of these abandoned babies. Their identities were all known. Some mothers could not take their children home immediately after birth, for reasons of health or housing, and claimed the children later. But the nurse said she would make sure they would not have their children back. And almost always she was able to convince the mother to sign the abandonment papers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Human trafficking was and is a sad reality in poverty-stricken areas of the world, but the involvement of this specific charity among the political and cultural elite should raise questions. Now consider this other passage from Post\'s book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is most likely not without reason that Europol’s definition of child abuse refers not only to sexual abuse, prostitution, forced labour, kidnapping, parental abduction, ritual killing and illegal adoption, but also to the trade in abandoned children and the trade in organs. That probably means such abuses exist. So why would Romania’s abandoned children not have been victims of such crimes?.... I discussed all this over lunch with my secretary. Not long afterwards she sent me an article from a Belgian newspaper, just a few months old. It reported police had halted a Romanian truck coming from Brasov at the Hungarian border. In it, hidden behind a false interception, were two Romanian women with two babies, not their children. The children were destined for organ transplants in the UK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://file.wikileaks.org/file/schillings-eim-eutruth.pdf">There has been legal conflict before after an article in the British Free Press</a> alleged that ARK schools and its former head, Arpad Busson, were linked to the Dutroux affair in Belgium.</p>
<p>Concerns about ARK also extend to the \'Tavistock\' infiltration of the United States through pseudo-psychotherapeutic institutions. Reddit users in a group called &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HarbinHotSprings/comments/5gqrq9/the_beginning/?st=iwe2zmy2&amp;sh=6bacf8c6">Harbin Hot Springs</a>&quot; identified that institutions and several others as being part of a coercive network of &quot;holistic centers&quot;. To quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e have uncovered a network of ritual abuse, child trafficking and evidence of Project MKULTRA taking place at institutions ranging from Harbin Hot Springs and Esalen Institute in CA through Ecstatic living, HAI Global and the Human Potential Movement through to The Haven in Canada, Findhorn in Scotland and more. These organizations are tied via the International Holistic Centers Gathering to the United Nations via the Findhorn Foundation, GEN, and Kitezh orphanage and Ecologia Youth Trust. They also share mutual ties and ancestry through the Psychosynthesis Institute, Teens &amp; Toddlers and ARK (a part of the Clinton Foundation) with Tavistock, the Huxleys and Military Intelligence in Britain and the US. Psychosynthesis’ founder then ties back through Alice Bailey to Lucis Trust and finally returns to the occult foundations of the UN.</p>

<p>The Podesta emails reveal some interesting elements about the Venice Biennale, notably that one of their artist friends was featured there in 2013. To remove all suspicion that they are involved in ritualistic Babylonian worship (/s),<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/15468"> artist Susan Kleinberg produced an art installation inspired by the Mesopotamian Ishtar.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Mesopotamian figure, Ishtar, is a major goddess, rubies from Burma in her eyes and navel, with her palm outstretched in the classic gesture of offering, an invitation into the work. The unraveling images are an excavation through borders, an essential comment on location of perspective...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example seems to insinuate something else entirely. This <a href="https://vimeo.com/68388617">video installation by Kleinberg</a> seems to make no sense unless there is some hidden meaning to two adults carrying a child. I\'ll let you decide its meaning. </p>
<p>But how about we dig a little more into the governance of the board, which represents the legacy of Peggy Guggenheim and the Guggenheim museum located in New York City. Far from being directly linked to Italian nobility, the source of its leadership seems to be British Monarchy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Castle_Stewart">The Earl Castle Stewart</a>, for example, is the symbolic (and some say genealogical) representative of the House of Stuart, the relatively unimportant family who ruled one of the world\'s largest empires for four centuries. </p>
<p>And the president, S.A.R. La Princesse Sibilla de Luxembourg, is head of the Luxembourg bloodline, but the history of this family as it pertains to witchcraft is surprisingly rich. From the Wikipedia of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquetta_of_Luxembourg">Jacquetta Luxembourg</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Through her daughter Elizabeth, Jacquetta was the maternal grandmother of Elizabeth of York, wife and queen of Henry VII, and therefore an ancestor of all subsequent English monarchs.</p>
<p>Shortly after her husband\'s execution by Warwick, Thomas Wake, a follower of Warwick’s, accused Jacquetta of witchcraft. Wake brought to Warwick Castle a lead image “made like a man-of-arms . . . broken in the middle and made fast with a wire,“ and alleged that Jacquetta had fashioned it to use for witchcraft and sorcery. He claimed that John Daunger, a parish clerk in Northampton, could attest that Jacquetta had made two other images, one for the king and one for the queen. The case fell apart when Warwick released Edward IV from custody, and Jacquetta was cleared by the king’s great council of the charges on 21 February 1470.[8] In 1484 Richard III in the act known as Titulus Regius[9] revived the allegations of witchcraft against the dead Jacquetta when he claimed that she and Elizabeth had procured Elizabeth\'s marriage to Edward IV through witchcraft; however, Richard never offered any proof to support his assertions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fake News, I guess. </p>
<p>The Venice Biennale is of great interest because the popular cast of characters that link the contemporary art world, the DNC and City of London bankers seem to converge there. <a href="https://steemit-production-imageproxy-thumbnail.s3.amazonaws.com/U5dt5MftW9f8LuQwDBKiWoQnq3ZjiFQ_1680x8400">Here is Tamera Luzzatto at the Biennale</a>. Remember that Alefantis is a godfather to the Luzzattos, and Tony is good friends with them, too.<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1786134"> The Luzzatto family has been linked to the committee of 300 and were key figures in the Venetian Black Nobility.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/H82L0wI.png">Remember that Alefantis commonly travels with Tony Podesta to meet a-list contemporary artists around the world.</a>. Not only that, but Podesta and Alefantis share a common interest in the work of Louise Bourgeois, former best-in-show winner at the Biennale. The sculpture/cake in the picture is based off a mutilation/killing fantasy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ms. Bourgeois has suggested as the tableau’s inspiration a fantasy from childhood in which a pompous father, whose presence deadens the dinner hour night after night, is pulled onto the table by other family members, dismembered and gobbled up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spiritual successor of Peggy Guggenheim at the Biennale is steel magnate Victor Pinchuk, the man who made the single largest donation to the Clinton foundation, runs Ukraine\'s largest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANTIAIDS_Foundation">AIDS</a> and <a href="http://ukraineadopt.com/">Adoption charities</a> (through his wife Elena), a network of <a href="https://pinchukfund.org/en/projects/10/">neonatal clinics</a>, and is also on the board of <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2180525">MOCA Geffen (with Heather Podesta)</a>.</p>',

           The Venice Biennale is of great interest because the popular cast of characters that link the contemporary art world, the DNC and City of London bankers seem to converge there.
           <a href="https://steemit-production-imageproxy-thumbnail.s3.amazonaws.com/U5dt5MftW9f8LuQwDBKiWoQnq3ZjiFQ_1680x8400">
            Here is Tamera Luzzatto at the Biennale
           </a>
           . Remember that Alefantis is a godfather to the Luzzattos, and Tony is good friends with them, too.
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1786134">
            The Luzzatto family has been linked to the committee of 300 and were key figures in the Venetian Black Nobility.

          <p>
           <a href="http://i.imgur.com/H82L0wI.png">
            Remember that Alefantis commonly travels with Tony Podesta to meet a-list contemporary artists around the world.
           </a>
           . Not only that, but Podesta and Alefantis share a common interest in the work of Louise Bourgeois, former best-in-show winner at the Biennale. The sculpture/cake in the picture is based off a mutilation/killing fantasy:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Ms. Bourgeois has suggested as the tableau’s inspiration a fantasy from childhood in which a pompous father, whose presence deadens the dinner hour night after night, is pulled onto the table by other family members, dismembered and gobbled up.
           </p>
          </blockquote>

            What more could you ask for, this piece has verything, all of it in a nutshell, intrigue, mystery, official school and orphanage access to children, nobility, mk-ultra by the indoctrination of fanciful, imaginative religious systems (buddhism, tantric yoganism, reiki. holistic mumbojumbo) and especially intrigued by that piece that ARK schools are associated with the Dutroux affair. I'll tell you there isn't going to be an angle NOT covered before their war even gets off the ground.
