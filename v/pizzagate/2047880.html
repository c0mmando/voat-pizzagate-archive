<a href="http://www.m2voice.co.uk/justin-bieber-pedophiles-run-the-evil-music-industry/">Justin Bieber takes break from music industry because...</a></p>
<p>Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that he has “woken up” to the “evils of the music industry” and he needs to take a break from the industry because it is “controlled by the absolute worst kind of people – pedophiles.”</p>
<p>Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Saturday 22nd July he shared what he described as a “horrific story” with the congregation and explained why he felt he had to quit his world tour.</p>
<p>Describing a party on tour – attended by the upper echelon of the music business, including executive VPs of development, producers, power agents and international financiers – Bieber said he was encouraged to sexually abuse a young child who had been bought to the party for the sexual gratification of the industry elite.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to do this. I really didn’t. They said this kid was drugged, it was horrible,” Bieber said, explaining that it was made clear to him that he would gain entry to the “business side of the industry” if he “joined the club” by passing the initiation rites.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t just be a performer, I’d be a mogul. That path would open up for me, like it did for Jay-Z.”</p>
<p>“It’s the difference between being a millionaire and being a billionaire.”</p>
<p>But Bieber told the congregation that he couldn’t do it.</p>
<p>“To join the club I’d have to do bad things to this poor kid. But then I realized that even that wasn’t enough for them. I’d also have to kill this little child.”</p>
<p>Bieber said he had heard rumors about this type of initiation in the music industry, but he had not been confronted with it before.</p>
<p>“I got told they secretly film these parties. Once they’ve got you on video doing something like that, they own you.”</p>
<p>Bieber said his conscience is clear because he didn’t participate, but the fate of the drugged child is haunting him.</p>
<p>“They said this kid was raped by a few different guys. They said he was bleeding. I got out of there but I heard he died and that haunts me.”</p>
<p>This allegation from Justin Bieber adds to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about the real nature of the music and entertainment industry elite. Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood have both gone on record exposing the pedophilia at the heart of Hollywood.</p>
<p>According to Elijah Wood, innocent young lives are destroyed to satisfy “people with parasitic interests” who “see you as their prey.” In an interview with the Sunday Times, Wood dropped a series of bombshells about the pedophiles that run the industry, noting that “Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.”</p>
<p>If you read the Washington Post or watch CNN, pedophilia is not a problem, and those who talk about it are tinfoil hat wearing kooks perpetuating ‘fake news.’ But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood and music industry system.</p>
<p>In recent months Nicole Kidman and Lindsay Lohan also spoke out about pedophilia in Hollywood. Close friends of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington claim the recently deceased pair were working on exposing the pedophile ring working at the heart of the music industry – and it cost them their lives.</p>
<p>Justin Bieber shocked his fans by cancelling his world tour and announcing that he needed some time away from the music industry. But as more information comes to light, it appears he made the best possible decision.</p>',

            Snopes says pizzagate is fake and the suspicious nature surrounding Cornell and Chester are also fake. Snopes is MSM. Everyone just be aware of this alleged story coming from Bieber as more of it might pop up later from different sources. This one is sketchy, clearly.

            I can tell the difference and I've been here from the beginning. The story doesn't seem far fetched as Pizzagate is concerned, it's who is delivering the information. I don't think any of us are in disagreement on that.

            Well written and words that moved me. I don't know much, if any about Justin bieber. I'm a couple generations older then him and his fans, I do know he's got millions off them. I want to believe, because the scenario you/he puts forward is probably happening.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have friends in the music industry, they are nothing major or mainstream, but you do hear rumors that I've laughed off before (Scorpions, German band got stories). That is until PizzaGate and PedoGate. If Justin Bieber speaks out, I will listen. UpVoat from me.

              The song Send me an angel, listen to the lyrics. It's about human sacrifice according to some people. All of them has participated in what is described above, according to people in the know.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 1994 the World Cup in football (soccer) was played in the states. The band (Scorpions) and the German national team and politicians/business men from all over partied for days. The media blamed Germans terrible effort in the World Cup on hangovers from the partying. End of story, no not according to some people, it's said they did terrible, crazy stuff that was so fucked up some team members left the tournament straight after.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've always laughed away rumors like that, not anymore. But it's still just rumors, so take it any way you want.

               The problem is that no names are mentioned. Bieber is a tool used by the elite, nothing more, and his church is known for corruption and involvement in trafficking and abuse.
              </p>
              <p>
               If Bieber really wanted to Save the world, he would shine the light on the "Root" of the entire network in Racine, Wisconsin.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are many names to name. Here are a few involved - Paul Ryan, Reince Priebus, Mitt Romney, John McCain, Podestas, Clintons, Schumer, Emanuels, Ashton (Chris) Kutcher, Tom DeLonge, Travis Barker, Kristin Bauer van Straten, and Caron Butler. There are many, many more, but you can start there.
