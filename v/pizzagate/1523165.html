            Where would victims go, how would they come forward? I believe there have been a few people who have made posts saying they were victims. But it's not like if they call the New York Times or CNN they'll be listened to, and they are probably not very trusting of the police given how LE has been implicated from the bottom up. Plus it seems Wikileaks has been compromised, or even if it hasn't, the rumours that it has been are everywhere, so if I was a victim I wouldn't want to go there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think we should somehow set up a way for victims to speak out and submit evidence if they have any, kind of like a wikileaks thing. No idea how to do it safely and effectively, but it could be like a proper citizens organisation - no links to any government agencies or departments, no links with or sponsorship from big business, no involvement with any corporate/mainstream media - just 100% nice normal people wanting to help each other out. The main problem is ensuring only nice normal people get involved with it. I actually think this is one of the most important things that should have been set up ages ago.

            I disagree- I've seen many posts that really undermine the investigation because they have no substance, they have no evidence to back them up at all. Posting a link to a web site that makes a claim is no good unless that website states its sources or links to evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we don't do it properly and ensure that we are only making claims we can prove or suggestions that have a solid rationale behind them, the whole thing will become a total joke and a mess. I say that as someone who is a professional researcher - I know lots of people working here aren't professionals and haven't been trained so might not know why this way of doing it is so important, but it really really is. I think it's the opposite of what you are suggesting - the fact that mods here are strict about making sure people have evidence to back up their claims and assertions just goes to show that they want the investigation to be seen as legitimate by outside people.
           </p>
           <p>
            It would be so easy for people to discredit everything and file it away as a lunatic conspiracy theory if they come here and read a ton of posts that are all wild speculation or have no sources or evidence linked. The thing that makes people get that realisation that 'oh my god this is actually true, pizza gate is real, this stuff is really happening' is the EVIDENCE - it's seeing posts that are clearly written by people who are not crazy, people who have done a lot of work and have actually found out real facts, facts they can even see for themselves by following the links to the evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I think your worries are unfounded. There are other subs where people can post any and every theory- this is the one where the facts go, where we consolidate what it is that we actually know for sure and present it as coherently as possible. I think that makes complete sense.

            The people claiming that no discussion of possible leads is allowed because everything has to be proven first before it can even be discussed, I will bring this up to you.

            You want people to abide the rules of pizzagate while they are guests here, but consider that pizzagate itself is a guest here.  If you can form expectations of their posts then we can form expectations of your rules.  This is not reddit.  We don't have power mods.  If you have a problem with other people's free speech you can go somewhere else.

            No, nobody has censored Saudi research.  That's just completely false.  We didn't even censor the Besta=Kline=Saudi narrative.  I just alerted everyone that it seemed to be disinformation, as there was no real evidence for it.  Now shills are trying to use that to discredit the mods (OMG you can't talk about Saudis here, Mods R CTR!!!1!!).

             Ah, interesting, thanks for clarifying. I've noticed that I have not seen a single post on Saudi Arabia for about 3 weeks maybe, except here-and-there mentions of the block comet is located on being owned by Sauds, which is why I had figured that posts were being deleted. Of course, I never looked too far into any Saudi connection so I was just speculating. Thanks for clarifying.

            Deleting per rule 2 and 4.  No sources, and meta concern posts don't go here.  By the way, the real shill problem we are having is people posting shitposts, not the mods.  The mods are protecting the quality of the sub.   Shills attack the mods to create distrust and disruption.  Their methods are disrupt, deny, and discourage.

              Allowing these concern posts would be a slippery slope.  For one thing, it would give shills an opening to spam concern posts to try to disrupt the sub.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not to mention: OP didn't even make a argument to support his complaint about the rules.  The truth is that the rules haven't change significantly.  The only significant change is that sources are required for claims of fact.  Also, the impetus for rule change, and asking the community to weigh in on rules, came from kevdude (of protectvoat) himself.  The point is to have a small number of clear rules that can be consistently/fairly enforced.

            Saudi was initiated by Kissinger in 1972 when USA went bankrupt, the only way Saudi's would accept non-gold for their oil was the promise of infinite white kids as sex-slave pets forever, now we're 40+ years into this,
           </p>
           <p>
            Fuck it can't be investigated here, this is the source of the kids.

           <p>
            Prior to petro-dollar agreement in 1972 saudi's got GOLD for their OIL, they didn't want paper, Kissinger knew that in SAUDI slaves are more valuable than gold, and white slaves are the most coveted.

             nobody offers any legitimate sources backing up their claims on Saudi posts, and they never acknowledge that Andrew Klein DOJ and Andrew Kline Besta Pizza have been proven to be completely different people who happen to have the same name.
            </p>
            <p>
             If your 'canary' to alert you when this sub is compromised is 'not being able to post claims without evidence' then I'm afraid that canary is going to die in most places that are serious about an investigation.

             Yeah it should be investigated but it also needs to have evidence - how did you come to that conclusion that this started in 1972 etc, where did you get that info from? It should only be posted here if there is an explanation for why those conclusions have been reached, and links that show how the investigator found out about it. When a post simply states things as you have here, well, anyone can state anything about anything, it doesn't mean it is true! That's why those ones get deleted. If they presented a coherent argument and included sources to back up their claims it would be totally different.

            I am not sure this sub is the legit place to stay any longer. Today my post was flagged as "Possible Disinformation" without any notice or  discussion. I have yet to hear back from one single Mod on the grounds for the mislabel. It is titled as follows: "Pizzagate Represents Only a Single American Franchise Within a Worldwide Child Trafficking Operation Known As Pedogate" and is found at
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1522318">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1522318
            </a>
            . My post of last week titled as follows: [Testimonial] I Was a Sex Slave to Europe's Elite at Age 6, was deleted under questionable violation of the rules. Found here:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1502398">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1502398
            </a>
            . Turns out the user named Gopluckyourself who aggressively petitioned to get my post on the testimonial deleted is now a Moderator!

            Every time I come here there are consistently ~1k users browsing. I don't think participation has gone down at all. Lack of upvotes could be due to lack of new information. Lower number of content submission could be due to rules resulting in better-groomed posts. Voat recently locked-down signups, so maybe that also contributes to lack of growth.
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven't been paying attention to all the drama if it exists, but can you or someone point me in a direction that shows mods are compromised here? Like what critical posts were deleted, or who they banned/silenced?
           </p>
           <p>
            I've mentioned this in a few other places, but I'm currently working on an iOS Voat app over at
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/voatify">
             /v/voatify
            </a>
            , so if it gets successfully published, maybe that can drive up participation and exposure.

            Apparently you can't post anything unless you have everything researched and proven....don't post hunches expecting others jump in or it gets deleted. I posted about Obama being called deporter in chief and asked who and what is in charge of these decisions for deportations and are they even really happening and provable. Also what happens to refugees ....I didn't have all the answers already so....deleted. it's like the vast right wing conspiracy excuse against Hillary Clinton is alive and well here.

            Yeah there's been suspicion the mods suck. Its tough to tell because there are shitty submissions being deleted too, but Ive been too busy to go through themodlog and say "this shouldnt have been deleted."
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems the content did shift though towards more general pedo stuff, but the mods remove it for 'being unrelated to pizzagate specifically'
           </p>
           <p>
            To be fair I am tired of shitty reposts and dont need to hear for the 10th time some historical pedo case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Eventually I'll just go through the 8ch threads archive and see if theres anything new.
           </p>
           <p>
            The idea that 'there are pedo friendly subs' is bull though. OP doesnt understand difference between mods, admins, and the fact anyone can create a new sub and post whatever at any time.

             All the sub's on the far right are compromised by the asshole mods, they work as a team with their shills.

            <p>
             You R 100% correct, no reason people can't have a new sub that isn't tainted by asshole mod's.

            <p>
             They do the same thing here with the

              /v/scientology

             sub, ran by scientologists, but nobody ever creates a new sub where you can have a real discussion. It's like have an

              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             is owned by PEDO's, why say this, because they don't want a real investigation of missing-children, and anybody who stand's in the way is either a pedo or pedo enabler.

             What do you mean by your last statement? Can you point out some sources to support this? I don't doubt that pizzagate leads to RNC or anyone in the government or anywhere, but what makes you say Trump's children, and mods, are destroying the investigation?

            Maybe we could move over to Jim Robinson's  FreeRepublic.com and post on Smoky Backroom or General/Chat forums. Ask permission?   Format is good, I think.  Gab.ai is uncensored...format not so conducive though.

If you don't include evidence or sources or explain how you arrived at the 'facts' you are claiming, it will be deleted and with good reason. Anyone can write anything in a post and say 'this is factual and true' but of course it means nothing unless there is evidence.
             </p>
             <p>
              Journalists, researchers, scientists, lawyers, police detectives etc - all these people whose business it is supposed to be to find out the way things are or what happened and the way things happened - all of them rely on gathering evidence. No evidence might as well mean it didn't happen, because NOBODY is going to believe it just because somebody said so.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you know of a post that provided evidence but got deleted anyway then let me know, but I'm pretty sure there haven't been any. I also find it hard to believe that if the mods here are all CIA they would leave up all the stuff that has been left up, given that a lot of it is pretty incriminating.

             I've been getting that same feeling.  I haven't seen much quality research here recently, and i doubt it's because the most talented researchers stopped researching.  I suspect/ hope they found a more private, shill-less platform for serious collaboration.

              I'm sure there is a lot of research going on in more private forums, but the only shills on here are users claiming "pizzagate is fake news" and also posting intentional shitposts and trying to associate pizzagate with being anti-gay, anti-semitic, etc.  The shills also attack mods as a way to create distrust in the sub.

                 Lol. Shill!?  Cmon on. If we go around calling everyone a shill how the fuck are people suppose to take us seriously??
                </p>
                <p>
                 Why has it become name calling whenever someone disagrees with somebody else's point or opinion (shill, racist, sexist)
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have a different idea then you so no I'm a shill? Maybe you're the fucking shill sent here to divide us even more then we already are.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Keep up the name calling instead talking and sharing ideas .......the new shill tactic ?

                 They are so annoying, trying to convince people that it's a bad thing to require evidence and proof. The sub still has around 10k subscribers and around 1-2k on here at any given time, it hasn't become less popular at all.

                  It's seems like your trying to convince people that's it's bad to believe there is more info elsewhere and that they must stay here. I ddnt say this sub is less popular just drastically slowed down and hope the fire is still burning somewhere else at least.

                   I agree we all need to come together, and I wasn't saying that people should only stay here and not look for info elsewhere - I think speculative posts are useful, or people having hunches or general thoughts etc can lead to discoveries - I just think it's also really good to have one place where an effort is made to ensure all the posts are evidenced, and a place to keep the facts and the findings, what we know and can prove, separate from everything else.

            Whilst you may claim that posts are being neutered, I would suggest it's more to do with being cautious with how we research and present findings. The MSM have already hooked on what I'm calling the "Blue Pill Narrative" where they deride the whole investigation as a nutcase conspiracy, cry out "fake fake fake", and base it all on a mistruth that Clinton and Podesta are masterminds running their operation from a secret lair under CPP.
           </p>
           <p>
            We all know that's clearly BS, but with the clear disinformation drive by the MSM who are very likely getting their instructions from Brock's propaganda machine - see my findings with how the news publications are now repeating Media Matters story from a few days ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, whilst I can see your concern about the neutering going on, I'm thinking it's more streamlining the investigation to maintain a clear, methodical approach to the research, whereas the crowd-sourcing that occurred on Reddit was riddled with shills and emotional outbursts that got the attention of their top brass who closed the sub down.

             is owned by PEDO's, why say this, because they don't want a real investigation of missing-children, and anybody who stand's in the way is either a pedo or pedo enabler.

             is NSFW so that nobody outside of voat can see it unless their registered, you can't register because its turned off, thus it can be assumed that HIGH LEVEL voat is working with these MODS to kill pizzagate investigation

            Then why do you allow the MODS to do this?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why are the pedophiles in control of voat?
           </p>
           <p>
            Voat is owned by NSA ( Palantir-Thiel ) what do you expect?
           </p>
           <p>
            CIA ( finders, Franklin ) has been running children for sex-slavery since 1950's to compromise politicians.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why on earth do you think the NSA would allow an investigation on a site owned by NSA?

            Let's say your not working for them like 'wisdomtooth' limited-opposition.

           <p>
            Then just tell people to post investigation material at

            where the mod's have no ability to delete anything.

           <p>
            Why people continue to use this site, when all know it is owned by the
