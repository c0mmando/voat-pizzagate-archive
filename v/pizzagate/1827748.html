            Abortion is and should be legal. If there is full disclosure telling the patient in laymen terms about how much money will change hands. Then there is nothing wrong with selling tissue.
           </p>
           <p>
            It needs to be regulated. We don't want doctors striking deals with patients for share of the profit. Abortion would turn into a factory setting.  Doctors with stables of women just pumping out fetuses for big pharma.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that i think about it, considering the money and people involved in biotech, it probably already exists. This piece is just targeting planned parenthod for a specific agenda.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the end game is regulation on the doctors, I'm all for it. Otherwise, forced welfare and taxpayer support for kids you can't afford to have is stupid. The kids being fed into the foster system is out of the question.  We now know what happens to those kids (PG).
           </p>
           <p>
            If pro life crowd want all children to be born, then maybe they should start working on lowering how much it costs to raise a child to 18. Last I looked it was getting close to a quarter million dollars on average. That's average, as in, not smart, and not in trouble.

            This was talked about for the first time in stage at the 2nd presidential debate. Trump confronted HRC over repealing the Hyde ammendment. That was her plan which would allow abortions into the 9th month.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump stated on stage that her plan was to enforce this. She did not deny it in fact she openly admitted it and accused him of not knowing anything about women's rights. Pphood Cecile R. was her number 1 fan. In fact Obama was using taxpayer money to support abortions in other countries like Mexico City where of course safety is not regulated and they do not fall under the constitution so late term abortions and baby body parts could be bought and sold with more ease. They knew exactly what they were doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump signed an executive order ceasing that on day one.

            That sounds about right. The use of young blood for life exstendancy (sp). It's crazy to think how many abortions happen everyday, I agree it creates a huge market. You can go deeper with the abortion argument, that it is a "right" but it has just become so normalized. I'm not against abortion, but I still think it's wrong to me under certain circumstances. Do the people getting the abortion sign as a organ donor like with your license? I see that just keep it secret. So fucked

             Don't have the link here offhand, but even for those people who are not against abortion, everyone needs to realize the thing about Planned Parenthood...the whistleblower manager of a Planned Parent hood clinic...(she said probably 35,000 abortions while she was there), her account of the high pressure sales tactics to young vulnerable women or teens, regardless of whether they were really pregnant or not!  So as long as the girl believed she was pregnant, they could do "fake" same day abortions, to help meet their quotas (and get extra cash for the ultra-sound).  According to her, everything was solely about abortion sales, not 'alternative choices', not the health of the women, not the mental health of the women (at least the ones put through a 'fake' abortion!)

            I was generally pro abortion for first trimester pregnancies but when I learned what was really going  I became enraged and felt duped by all of the pro abortion advocates. Is it possible that abortion supporters, including Congressmen and judges have been as ignorant as I was?  This is not relevant to Pizzagate is it? Yet isn't there a similar mindset when it comes to trafficking body parts and blood? How does an intact fetus unexpectantly issuing forth from the mothers birth canal and arriving into the world before staff can perform the ultimate in late term abortion differ from trafficking of infants? Certainly we cannot allow the attachment to the umbilical cord to serve as the difference between a fetus and a human being. Some dramatic legislative changes are needed ASAP.

             The National Institute of Health funds fetal tissue research to the tune 76 million per year which seems to me as an encouragement to harvest body parts from abortions. Once upon a time stem cell research using umbilical cords satisfied researchers but no more. The more highly evolved the cells the better the research. When opposition surfaces, proponents claim that the real agenda of the opposition is to end abortions. Why can't they see that  some folks can accept a compromise. Are women even being advised that their fetuses are going to be used for profit making research? I predict that harvesting blood from children at a blood mobile parked outside our schools  will be commonplace, mark my words.

             Depends on the gestational age/size as well as the buyer's needs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Earlier/smaller ones are used for stem cell harvesting, blood and cord blood extraction, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later/larger ones are used for the above plus organ harvesting.  Obviously, they WANT the larger ones (more $$), hence the PUSH for late-term abortions.  That gets tricky, though, because it's more difficult to get an intact specimen with the later ones (larger head).

             Big pharma buyers have broader applications so use them for all kinds of things.

             It is a huge INDUSTRY and evil to the core.

              And if you're harvesting organs from a fetus how do they re-use it when it's under developed? Do they keep growing it?
