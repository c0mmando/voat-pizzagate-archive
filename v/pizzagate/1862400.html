<p>The whole thing leaves me queasy.  Aren\'t they showing exactly what predators like to see?  Isn\'t masking a little girl and filming her playing with sex toys without her understanding a form of soft exploitation?  So Europeans doing this is okay to raise money, so <em>the real</em> exploitation in Asia can be fought, seems to be the message here.

            I'm flairing this thread "Potential Lead" in hopes some folks will look into the individuals behind this organization and whether they have connections to anyone involved in the Norway pedo ring bust that was subsequently scrubbed from the MSM this past winter.

             I just have to add here, because you are probably going to be the last comment on this, that this normalizing of these visuals really disturbs me.  I can very well imagine now a giant billboard in Times Square or on Sunset Blvd or at Picadilly Circus with similar images of kids in masks holding sex toys and just a phone number - CALL xxx-xxxx.   We wouldn't even know if they were advertising the kids or a prevention charity, and most people would just walk on by the thing, except predators who would make the call.
            </p>
            <p>
             The parents who allowed their children in this video need to be prosecuted for neglecting their child's needs, in my opinion.

             Hi there Vindicator - thanks for that - and good questions.  yeah I included the names hoping eventually they may be looked at more deeply, they need to be.  I believe it was Norway right that had the bust of 50 elites in government soon after pizzagate broke
             <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-paedophile-ring-police-arrest-51-men-a7432441.html">
              http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-paedophile-ring-police-arrest-51-men-a7432441.html
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             So we know pedos are seeded throughout Norwegian society at the top anyway.  I honestly would be surprised if it were found that this group had zero connections to any of the busted perps - Norwegian society can't be that big.   Care to have a look?  maybe you know someone who is especially good at that sort of thing.  Finding that this charity is connected to arrested perps could be newsworthy, no?
            </p>
            <p>
             That is about the same number that THORN claims to have helped, coincidentally.  I wonder if charities in Norway have to disclose how they spend their earnings.   And it's funny isn't it, that there is obviously a lot of pedo activity in Norway, so why do they have to concentrate on Asia, where they admit themselves that their effectiveness is a drop in the bucket.  Seems like if they were legit, they could do a lot better working in their own backyard.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just some thoughts, thanks for stimulating the discussion.

            One of the most shocking things I've learned via pizzagate is the fact that parents peddle their own children. The notion never ever once occurred to me although I recognized incest and had a dear friend who had been sexually abused by her father - messed her up for life.  I'm sorry viebleu that you suffered something similar. If parents, priests, teachers, the local boy scout or girl scout leader and cops are all abusing children, who does a child turn to? Where is there a safe harbor?

             Just to be clear, my comment was putting myself in the position of those young girl children who were videotaped for this fundraising campaign, not talking about myself.    But thanks for your sensitive comment and yes, abuse lurks right under our noses and includes figures of authority all the time.  I feel I could make the case that this video is indeed a form of abuse, it is also a form of abuse on the watching public.  I don't know where this video was shown and if it is only on the internet, but having this come on television would be for me, crossing a boundary of decency in advertising.
