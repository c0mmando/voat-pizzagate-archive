<p>&quot;Verifiable Proof that Andrew Breitbart was MURDERED instead of having heart attack. </p>
<p>HIllary\'s blatant mockery of pizzagate and Michael Flynn this morning following his resignation sparked this message to occur

<p>Considering that Andrew Breitbart “died” <em>was murdered</em> following his investigation into John Podesta and the child sex ring he was a part of, and considering he publicly tweeted about it and was presumably about to release the evidence beforehand raises eyebrows and suspicions of foul play.

<p>Here is his autopsy for your records... Now it does suggest that he had 70% blockage of his anterior descending artery in his heart, along with left ventricular hypertrophy which would suggest he did have heart problems. that doesn\'t conclude that he had a heart attack rather it sets the grounds for a legitimate claim that he could have died from a heart attack
a closer look at his toxicology report would suggest otherwise</p>
<p>Electrolytes and other markers:
Sodium: 137 mmol 
potassium: 13 mmol 
chloride: 121 mmol 
Urea nitrogen: 22 mg/dl 
creatinine: 0.8 mg/dl</p>
<p>First off, right off the bat. when you have a heart attack it is literally because oxygen can\'t get to the muscle cells of the heart,  in order to pump blood to the body, due to blockage of the arteries of the heart that are supplying itself with oxygen and blood. the heart muscle fails then dies and then you have a heart attack. when muscle tissue dies a substance called creatinine is released. it is a big indicator for muscle death in rhabdomyolysis and as well in muscular dystrophy or any muscle death to include HEART ATTACKS... in heart attacks the creatinine levels go through the roof depending on the degree of heart muscle death. </p>
<p>The normal range for creatinine in the blood for an adult male may be 0.84 to 1.21 milligrams per deciliter as cited by the mayo clinic
<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/creatinine-test/details/results/rsc-20179431">http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/creatinine-test/details/results/rsc-20179431</a> … …</p>
<p>He had 0.8 mg/dl , so this man did NOT have a heart attack ... simply IMPOSSIBLE</p>
<p>That begs the next question. How did one die of heart failure if he didn\'t have a heart attack? We next need to look at his electrolyte levels, all of which are normal except for 2</p>
<p>Potassium and Chloride</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/wLOyWO7">http://imgur.com/wLOyWO7</a> - screenshot of autopsy report </p>
<p>Potassium chloride is what’s used in lethal injection. When given in high doses it can stop the heart without causing heart muscle death and won\'t raise creatinine levels. </p>
<p>Normally, your blood potassium level is 3.6 to 5.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) as cited again by the mayoclinic <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/low-potassium/basics/definition/sym-20050632">http://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/low-potassium/basics/definition/sym-20050632</a> …</p>

<p>potassium for andrew was 13 mmol (extremely high)

            So you just assumed that of me. And you're telling
            <em>
             me
            </em>
            to do more research. The Bible tells me all that I need to know. It's foolish to think people who reject God and live their entire lives in unrepentant sin won't pay for it. So none of the evil committed by man on earth matters? If there's no hell, why don't people just do whatever they want? What's the point of trying to do good if in the end no one faces consequences for their immoral actions? Dying and then nothing is not a punishment. It's not like you missed out on heaven, you no longer exist. You can't regret if you don't exist. Our souls persist beyond death and to think God will simply delete the souls of those who rejected Him is not supported by scripture. The soul is eternal and because of this there must be somewhere for it to go when the physical body dies. Hell was created for Satan and his legion but after sin entered Man, they are no longer the only beings who will go to hell.

            What gave you the impression I wish for people to be tormented and to suffer forever? I wouldn't wish that on anyone but people choose it by rejecting Christ. I am just not convinced. What you see in those verses, I do not. It has nothing to do with being open minded or research more. I simply don't see what you are seeing.

            I'm not sure why you think I'm angry but I assure you I'm not. I'm just trying to make a case for something. I just think you should question this more. You believe something in contrast with scripture.

            Revelation 21:8
           </p>
           <p>
            If when the wicked die they become non-existent nothingness, how would they be able to die again, after having already died? This verse not only tells us of a potential death
            <em>
             after
            </em>
            our passing on earth, but what awaits those who's names are not found in the Book of Life.
           </p>
           <p>
            If indeed hell is a lie, what is this second death and what or where is this lake of fire and brimstone?

            2 Thessalonians 1:9
           </p>
           <p>
            There is certainly something awaiting the damned after death that is perceivable. Jesus also talks of the paths that lead to life and to destruction. Was he not speaking of the afterlife?
           </p>
           <p>
            Consider the possibility that
            <em>
             you
            </em>
            have been deceived by Satan.

            Neither angiotensin I or II are diagnostic of heart attack or heart failure and they don't test for it.  ACE inhibitor use is theoretical not evidentiary.   They try it...uf it worjs great.  If not , then dc.

            Other cardiac enzymes tested after cardiac event are troponins not ACE.

            Point about KCl liquid is that it is not disguisable and orally intolerable .  You would know there was something awful in drink and then vomit.

            No test performed for insulin levels.  Insulin levels are insinuated by blood glucose levels.

            There is not evidence of hyperkalemia.  Potassium levels in vitreous are wnl and rise after death.

            From the post above:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             70% blockage of his anterior descending artery in his heart, along with left ventricular hypertrophy which would suggest he did have heart problems. that doesn't conclude that he had a heart attack rather it sets the grounds for a legitimate claim that he could have died from a heart attack
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            100% blockage is not necessary for a heart attack. Again, if you can cite a medical authority saying that CHF only happens when blockage is at 100%, please do so. I'm guessing you can't, because people die from partial blockages all the time. That's why doctors fretted over cholesterol for so many years. In addition, Bill Whittle, another conservative firebrand and close friend of Breitbart's revealed that Andrew had already suffered an earlier heart attack:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://radiopatriot.net/2012/03/03/bill-whittle-at-pjtv-says-breitbart-had-previous-heart-attack/">
             https://radiopatriot.net/2012/03/03/bill-whittle-at-pjtv-says-breitbart-had-previous-heart-attack/
            </a>
           </p>

            Please...give me the evidence. I have real difficulty believing that Breitbart's death was pure coincidence, but I am not convinced it was murder. Conjecture from non-medical professionals is useless to us. We need hard, medical evidence to prove he didn't suffer from CHF, because there's hard, published evidence that he'd already had issues with it.

            If there's no hell, these antitheist, God-mocking satanists who rape and murder children will only ever experience earthly consequences and here on earth there exists not an adequate punishment for the crimes they've committed. And this is if they're even caught let alone tried and convicted which, with the entire MSM and large parts of the US government on their side, actively working to prevent their exposure, is unlikely.
           </p>
           <p>
            For God to be perfect, He must judge evil and the people who perpetrate it. Allowing evil to continue without judgement is in itself evil. We have a perfect, loving and holy God who takes sin seriously. Who, knowing this and understanding this, gave His Son to die for man's sin because we cannot earn salvation ourselves, through our own good actions. Not only do these satanists reject God's gift, they worship His most preeminent adversary, Satan. God will righteously judge these people and the demons they worship. They won't just die and face nothingness or nonexistence. There's no such thing. The only perfect sentence for people who reject Christ, mock God, and love evil is an eternity of suffering in hell, forever seperated from the God they hate, with no hope of anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hell is not merely a concept used to scare people into compliance or for profit. That's purgatory. Catholics believe that through 'indulgences' they can reduce the punishment of loved ones in purgatory. These two lies were clearly invented by corrupt catholic church leaders with the intention of control. There is no scriptural basis for these ideas. Hell, on the other hand, is real and scripture tells us so.

            FFS why is it so damned hard to get an answer out of you?
           </p>
           <p>
            I am simply asking for your opinion on this matter since you obviously know more about it than I do. I don't have an opinion, I see what you've written above and I see this other guys comment that contradicts it. Then I ask you to clarify and all you do is give me obtuse circle-speak.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess the answer is you don't have any idea. Ok, I'll accept that. Good day.

            I am a practicing physician(doctor of medicine), I can tell you from the lab results you have posted, cause of death was likely ** not ** a heart attack(ST- Elevation Myocardial Infarction). Based on what i see, K(Potassium) of 13 and Cl(Chloride) of 121 with glucose of ZERO seems likely he was injected with KCL(Potassium Chloride) Injection, likely big dose, subcutaneously with likely a big dose of insulin subcutaneously. The low glucose (blood sugar in bloodstream) would cause almost instantaneous LOC (loss of consciousness). The KCL injection(which coincidentally is what is used in death row for death penalty cases) would overload the hearts conduction circuits. Think of the heart as an electrical circuit that needs certain level of electrolytes in order to conduct electricity and produce a heartbeat. A sudden increase in levels of K and CL in the bloodstream would overload the conduction circuits and cause the heart to stop. Just my humble medical opinion based on the evidence presented. I think any board certified physician would agree with this assessment, again if the evidence presented is in fact correct.

            The lesson to be taken from this (and many other incidents) is never threaten to expose anything.  EXPOSE IT.

             Maybe breitbart was in on it?
I mean why threaten to expose instead of just exposing it all right? 
Really makes no sense. Its like a mob bosses wife screaming about his nefarious criminal behavior in a crowded restaurant because shes mad hes cheating on her.

            I looked at the report again, and it said that the left ventricle was 60%. Well, any percentage in this case that's less would be a good thing.  We need the doctor to look at this again.  Sorry,  having a sneezing attack.

            WERE CARDIAC ENZYMES DONE? If it was a true MI, then CK-MB would ABSOLUTELY be elevated, as it usually peaks in 4-6 hrs; troponin would take much longer. However, I sincerely doubt it was a real MI for this reason alone: for a true MI, either NSTEMI or STEMI, you must have 100% COMPLETE OCCLUSION of the coronary vessel.  You don't even start to get chest pain until at least 70% occluded. That is straight out of the book Do u have access to the micro slides? Are there mentioned anywhere in the report? That would be solid evidence. ALSO, the potassium level is too high for his autopsy time. I am on a forensics pathology rotation right now, so if any of you want me to ask questions to the pathologist just holla

              Thank you for the links and SERIOUSLY strong work researching your data points. So 60-80%, no problem, the pathologist is eye-balling. BUT it's not 100%. So no transmural heart attack at least in the LAD which was mentioned and circled in diagram. He mentioned red coloring of wall, I'll dissect that tomorrow. Also no freaking way do I buy left ventricular dilation as a cause of death. Sure, he could have had heart failure , left sided, from hypertension. TONS of people do. But the ejection fraction is what matters. Normal is 60%. I've seen pts at the VA with less than 15 and still trucking. Heart failure is a chronic condition. You have exacerbations and go to the ED many times before croaking. And he had alcohol in board. Raises a lot of practical questions. Anyhow I'm exhausted and sick, will comment more tomorrow

             I thought the autopsy report said 60% in one artery or wherever it was.  I didn't see 70%, but I'd have to look again.

            My two cents-The evidence presented, clearly suggests, this dead M.E.'s report (God rest his soul.)regarding Andrews death is wrong. This occurs often in especially in "questionable" deaths. The ME profession is not what it use to be!
           </p>
           <p>
            Possibility: a thoracsic surgeon, had a "look-see" at the ME's report and questioned it. Pointing out the very same information presented here today. The ME than decided to amend the original report and was killed prior to doing so. Probably the entire matter transpired via cell phones, easily compromised.
           </p>
           <p>
            Regardess, enough evidence has been "confidently &amp; astutely" presented to challenge Andrew's cause of death and that's not a difficult process. Every state has a medical-board, which handles complaints of this nature. If a Californian/taxpayer (s), the more the merrier, would take this information/chemistry as listed, place it in a  "online" complaint form and submit it, that would be a good thing! No concern over legal recourse either "Public Trust" thing, no worries there. This produces a public record and they must eventually act on this filed complaint/more evidence.

            Personally any person that I'm around doesn't believe that Breitbart died from a heart attack.  Everyone thinks that he was murdered.  I do and will continue to do so. Andrew really did shake them up.  At this time, I say pray and pray hard for Pres. Trump because they hate him with a passion as well.

            Just to add to this, it wasn't JUST a tweet. Breitbart talked about Podesta often and made vague allusions to some terrible things he was involved in. I just watched "Hating Breitbart" the other day and they spent about 15-20min out of the 1.5hr documentary on Podesta. Quotes include "Fuck you John Podesta" "What's in your closet, John Podesta." to reporters at CPAC I believe. Andrew knew and it flipped switches as Alex Jones puts it. Him tweeting it was probably proof that he was about to publish something but I'm speculating of course.

             One can be diagnosed with anything, but it never means that they died that way.  Sorry, it's the truth. But it would be so convenient to say he had a heart attack by some gov official hitting him with something.

            "mysteriously" doesn't do it justice.  She and her husband were executed with a gun in their own bedroom.  The spy tried to create this fantasy that the husband had cancer and that their finances were in disarray.  But nobody that knew them bought it.

             Senator Nancy Schaefer was exposing corruption in Child Protective Services  (CPS). She said it was the MOST corrupt branch of the government. Taking kids from families they shouldn't be taking them from and giving a large portion to abusers and pedophiles.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Shafer was receiving death treats before her death.

              People can live several years with CHF.  My mother did after diagnosis. Doesn't mean you're fixing to kill over if diagnosed. I know other folks living many more years past that after being diagnosed. Depends upon their lifestyle, but my mother was into her 50s when diagnosed and lived into her 60s. Yet she never got exercise, couldn't walk far then. Still, she lived several years after her diagnosis.

             Expected vitreous electrolytes at post-mortem:
            </p>
            <p>
             Chloride 115 – 125 mmol/L (Coe 1993);

           <p>
            So actually, the chloride count was well within normal range. You should edit your post because you're lying in claiming that 121 mmol is high.

            According to your post, you were the author of the article. I'm asking because the way I understood the article, the amount of Creatinine cancelled the possibility of there having been a heart-attack. Typically when someone has an understanding from having read something, then reaches out to the author for clarification, "re-read the article" doesn't really help much.
           </p>
           <p>
            So I'm left to assume that either I am misunderstanding the amount of creatinine that was discovered during the autopsy, the statement that the amount was indicative of a normal heart condition at time of death or the NY Times link the other poster provided is false.

            The tweet was from 2011. He died in 2012. It really doesn't make sense that they'd wait a year to kill him.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, I do believe he was murdered, because one of the people who worked on his autopsy died of arsenic poisoning six months afterward. I don't think he was killed relative to pizzagate. I think he was killed because of damaging material he claimed he was going to release about Obama within a day or two.

             Yes!  I believe it was the video that the LA Times has re: obama at a (muslim) banquet sponsored by Hamas where there were chidden dancing around with mock heads on a stick. LATimes had it well before 0's selection and still has not released it. IDK if Breitbart had a copy of the video, but this was the rumor. Hannity covered it a lot back in the day.

             My understanding was that he talked to Sheriff Joe a little while before he died. Also it was my understanding that he had some damaging things on BO. I do remember reading this in various places before he died. So he may have told Sheriff Joe, maybe not. Then the family didn't say much after his death, but they might have been warned not to. Too bad that damaging stuff on Obama didn't get released. I also seem to remember Andrew saying in a speech that he had something good on that.

            Ah just read it. Brilliant. I'm gonna try and come up with a photo and/or hashtag to help. There was a people of the world Twitter account that just recently posted a photo of a young girl with an ak47. Might be a way to tie in global aspect of control with it. I'll try

            See my comment about vitreous electrolyte levels in a dead person vs blood in a live person above...which makes most speculation about potassium unimportant but I am a pharmacist so
           </p>
           <p>
            for reference,
           </p>
           <p>
            it would be tough to take too much potassium by mouth because it would cause near instantaneous stomach cramping and vomiting.  Available pills are sustained release becaus of stomach reaction and come in 8, 10 and 20 mEq all are big pills...think ex str tylenol for 8 mEq, twice that for the 20.  For people who need it (usually because they are on diuretics), average dose ranges from 8 to 40 mEq daily.
           </p>
           <p>
            Liquid tastes like crap and there is no way you could consume it without noticing.  It is only used for people who Cannot swallow pills.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also...most electrolytes are given by mEq but measured by mmol in US.  Potassium mEq and mmol are the same but some electrolytes are not, in case you ever need to look.

            I read your comment and clearly knew what you were saying. Sounds like it was misinterpreted but I didn't read it as anything but a little snark that references how Sean Spicer talks about reporters.

             There are Anons on Twitter that are in the know and are literally leaving us breadcrumbs to find so that it all ties together in time for key events. It's a coordinated effort. No, this isn't proof, but it's my direct experience. Before I was banned from Twitter for a full day yesterday, I was getting follows from fake accounts and when I would go to their page, there would be information there, some current, some from weeks to a year ago. Information that's been out there for people to find. Now that the event is underway and people are joining together from all forums, it's all coming out.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why we're seeing video evidence popping up seemingly out of nowhere - like the Worldcorp video and the Demi Moore video that just came out from when she was 19. That's my take. Could be wrong but I've seen too many "coincidences" to not be paying attention to some of the clues that seem to come out of nowhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             **Edit to say that there are also Anons on Twitter and elsewhere that are deliberately trying to offer disinfo as well. That's why it's difficult to know what info you're getting is true or if it's diversion. And we all know there's a massive effort at diversion going on.

              that demi moore video has been around for years. I first saw it on "Entertainment Tonight" at least 10 years ago.

              All this stuffs been around for years; significant only now, because of our new mass awakening.

            Clinical Research pharmacist here. Just for reference I have looked at tonso medical reports over the years. At first it looked scary but...
           </p>
           <p>
            Vitreous fluid is used in autopsy and expected levels are different than live serum values.  According to this
            <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1966150-overview">
             http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1966150-overview
            </a>
            (and other sources but this was easiest to read all in one place)
           </p>
           <p>
            Sodium expected at 135 to 150
           </p>
           <p>
            Potassium anything under 15 is ok.  Potassium rises by time post mortem because most K is in cellular fluid but after death...cells lose integrity and fluid leaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chloride 105 to 135
           </p>
           <p>
            Cr 0.6 to 1.3
           </p>
           <p>
            With respect to Cr, that is indication of kidney function not heart attack.  The heart attack signal is CK, specifically CK-mb (one if the cardiac enzymes which is different from General CK which can increase from trauma or even weightlifting)  an enzyme which doesn't increase immediately.  It starts to rise about 3 hours after MI and peaks at 24 hours.  It isn't something they look at in autopsy...they will visually examine heart for damage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Creatinine will be elevated in chronic heart failure if kidneys are severely damaged but it literally takes years.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, the cause of death is listed as "heart failure due to congestive heart disease".  It does not say due to myocardial infarction...
           </p>
           <p>
            Heart failure is a catch all for no other obvious cause when there is some indication of heart disease.
           </p>
           <p>
            The autopsy really said he was mostly healthy for a 43 year old fat guy whose alcohol level indicated he had a couple of drinks in last hour and was outside on side walk at midnight on a Wednesday.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree it is suspicious for a 43 year old with mild heart disease to drop dead but autopsy doesn't say anything one way or the other.
           </p>
           <p>
            It had been my understanding that perhaps dead examiner saw stuff that wasn't put in report.

             "heart failure due to congestive heart disease".    That in and of itself is out of place...43yo guys like Breitbart do drop dead of heart attacks, but it's not the congestive type.  Usually will be acute myocardial infarction and will be readily apparent on autopsy...also, can confirm that they do not turn red...
            </p>
            <p>
             Point is...it's fishy...especially when you add in the coroner.  You are right about the CK vs. CR thing though, and I applaud OP for taking a close look and doing some intense research....I took two semesters on interpreting lab results and have gotten pretty rusty because I don't use it much....
            </p>
            <p>
             Another fishy point...wasn't there something weird where they cremated Breitbart's body right away against his family's wishes?  Or is that another high profile death I am thinking of?

             I just googled "potassium" and "poison" and found
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_cyanide">
              the wikipedia page for potassium cyanide
             </a>
             which says that it causes a red complexion in the victim, which fits with KittyTigerlily's post. What should we expect to see in an autopsy report if this was the cause of death, and what is in the report that would point away from this as a possible cause?

              Horrible thing is...basically nothing.  Unless you do toxicology test specific to cyanide, it is quick and looks just like any other hypoxia (lack of oxygen)...as in stopped breathing.

            Don't forget Breitbart was also instrumental in the Anthony Weiner scandal (the first one, as oppose to Weiner's 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc.)
           </p>

            Breitbart would happily show Weiner's crooked weiner to anyone that asked:

            Always thought that was another reason (along with Podesta tweets) that got Breitbart "Killary-ed"
           </p>
           <p>
            ...but mainly he was 'heart attack-ed' due to his imminently releasing evidence of Obozo being a Kenyan/CIA asset/fake birth cert etc etc.

            I agree, but this was like a cherry red streak/band around his forehead. A person that I used to talk to years ago, who herself was a scientist, she knew someone in forensic medicine, said something about a certain type of poison. Wish that I could remember what she said.  It's been maybe 4 years ago now. Well, the forensic friend was telling her about it.

            Well that explains why I didn't see your post. Which not only should be in the main sub but it should be stickied. I think we will get to that point, as long as we keep those things in mind. Surprisingly before all this stuff broke into mainstream(which I consider the few days before the 'shooter' came, shortly after the first NYT and WaPo articles) when I brought it up to my normie friends they were all genuinely curious and not being dismissive. I'm not a normie at all but I am a parent and that combined with nonpartisanship will hopefully win over the masses. It would help if these heartless hollywood shills and media folk would shut the fuck up, they are rich enough, why don't they all just move to a big island and fuck each others kids all they want ffs

            This is a post from below, curious to hear your input

           <p>
            Creatinine is associated with increased chance of heart attack in people with hypertension, but it is totally false to say that it is impossible for creatinine levels to be normal in someone with congestive heart failure. This is another dumb, irresponsible post.

            With all due respect to original OP, why would
            <em>
             anyone
            </em>
            believe an autopsy in a case like this?  The powers that be lie about
            <em>
             everything
            </em>
            - and they have the power to manipulate anyone and anything they want to.
           </p>
           <p>
            George Webb, deep insider - go to his YT channel for the ultimate dose of truth, seriously - says that these heart attack murders are done incrementally. They give you somehow (restaurant meal?) a small dose of this stuff which sends you to the doctor with heart palpitations.  They do it a few more times so it's on your med. record - for real.  Then they hit you with the kill does while -- for instance, you're out running -- using a "heart attack gun (google it, CIA reveal --- the technology now has to be beyond belief) and that's that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then you fake an autopsy and most people are convinced. Others believe he was murdered but there is doubt  he wasn't really because it is on his med record that he went to doctor numerous times for heart palpitations. It's brilliant - evil, diabolical, the work of psychopaths but brilliant tactically.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's another related example for people who are skeptical.  (I'm really sorry to rock your world on this but it can't be helped.)  If you've never heard of Frank Marshall Davis or know that Obama's mother was a CIA honeypot, you're not yet seeing the entire picture.

             Just a funny, when I watched your link to dreams from my real father, my closed captioning said Obama's father grew up hurting goats.  Made me laugh. Not that it's true, I have no evidence to say Obama's father was a goat hurter.

            The corruption you speak of is true but what I doubt is that we are going to see any real significant leaks coming up, mostly because I feel that Assange is dead or compromised since oct 15 with big leaks promised but nothing huge since then and even if there are big leaks I doubt it will effect people much. If the citizens aren't angry now election fraud certainly isn't going to get them going. I just don't think the public will outrage in any significant way unless they see irrefutable proof of the child trafficking and ritual abuse.

            These constant deaths just made me think..... Maybe we're going about this the wrong way. Not in overall research, but in drive. What should our end goal be? The destruction of the systems that propagate this evil along with those trapped within it? MLK quote about darkness not being able to drive out darkness, only light can do that. Considering how old the structures of evil are, every single human operating within them is a victim of them. If we attack them within the realm of subterfuge it's like 300 and we're xerxes army. I still think we will win through sheer volume of awareness and awakening... But perhaps appealing to their humanity in some fashion could win over the 70% of folks in this system that aren't legitimate psychopaths and would probably hit the reset button if given one.

             The majority of you guys doing this 'investigation' are amazing, the job you are doing unveiling these insidious people and their connections can never be repaid by anyone...The saving of humanity would be an understatement. Keep up the super sleuthing as you are beginning to uncover the biggest, widest, evilest satanic criminal cartel the world has ever seen and it's been going on for millennia. Never forget it will be their own arrogance along with all of you people that will ultimately bring the syndicate down...It's already begun! This is the epic battle spoken about for centuries in my opinion and none of us, myself included, have any real concept of just how many tentacles this fucking octopus has...The further down the rabbit hole you go, the sicker it makes me feel. More of us are going to wake up and many more victims will come forth. Prepare yourselves. More power to you all...Justice for the innocent! Just keep doing what you're all doing, step by step...It will reach a critical mass eventually and take off like a runaway train, in my opinion...keep investigating and sharing

             we need to go over to reddit and start spamming
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics">
              r/politics
             </a>
             with this kind of circumstantial evidence.. every thread on there has at least one shill posting deluded liberal fakstream propaganda and about 20 other brainwashed people lapping it up... Also I see people mentioning pizza gate all the time as evidence of how trump supporters are delusional and lie. Specifically they are parroting the "muh russians" meme and then they point out how Trump loved wikileaks and how julian assange is a propagandist and how that it is pizzagate's fault that Trump won the election. if we force all this evidence in their face it will pique the interest of one of two people a day and then they will find voat and do research themselves and get to where we are!
            </p>
            <p>
             The top post on this thread talks about pizza gate being #fakenews.. I am banned from this subbreddit at the moment.. otherwise I was about to flame them to all hell and back!

             I was almost like the brainwashed masses up until late november and then i just kept seeing a little snipet of info here and there and then finally went down the rabbit hole. I always had a disdain for the elites but I had no idea JUST how evil Clinton was or some of the good traits of Trump. Now Im watching infowars and alex jones daily and cant get enough. I also feel really scared for my family back in the states and feel like an idiot for buying into some of the lies!

              and WOW just checked out reddit.... doesn't look too hopeful. I literally saw Twitter remove #pizzagate hashtag from the main page on #nationalpizzaday with my own eyes!!

              This is why it will be VERY important to expose the dynamic that currently exists once we get some big busts. To prevent it from happening again

              Ah man I was in same boat til only a week ago. Had honestly never even heard of pizza gate. Accidentally clicked on hashtag on national pizza day and stumbled into everything. Crazy looking at Twitter now post red pill. The manipulation is so transparent it's crazy. Thought Alex jones was some RW nazi or whatever vague picture had in my head. Watch rogan podcast and its SUPER OBVIOUS the guy just loves getting information and passing it on. His political support for trump is secondary, based on all information he's received, realizing it's our only shot at eliminating control of these folks

              Lol! Well I do believe in divine :) seen it for myself and had visions as well. I don't base this worldview off of any religious text and I'm aware that any human interpretation or religious text creates a separation from this force and an inevitable injection of ego. Create structures based on the text and you get even more separation from truth and higher percentages of ego. ANYWAYS.... The force exists and we must stop these darth fools 😝

             I think suggestions like this are always welcome, a battle of attrition against these centuries old entities is not a smart move. Win yes but at what cost.

            <p>
             I'm not sure 'reset' exists and as you rightly point out what actually is the end goal. These systems of power chew up the good and bad in equal measure perhaps if a realistic alternative to their system was offered. Confess all, brownie points if you can prove you were being manipulated and double points for each additional person name.

             I think we need to accept we will never catch them all but if we can catch enough the infrastructure crumbles.

              Ahh yes. Like the idea of alternative system. One of the things that gets me is how they've perverted the process of globalization (soros) and how the positive ideals of humanity (love, equality, protection of innocent) have been perverted for personal gain. So in the campaign to protect themselves they are stirring up real emotions in people. And in the abuse of children.... Taking advantage of the purest form of love and creating entire structures to accomplish it. Bah. Anyways. If their end game is globalization and they have perverted this process and the mechanisms of this process, then we need to figure out what the ideal end game looks like and we need to figure out how to get there in each domain. Once we have the ideal then we can work on reducing control of collective ego/evil. Example would be steps to be taken in Middle East when underlying goal is genuinely peace rather than a climate for weapons sales, oil control and refugee surges. Wouldn't be a need to deal with refugee crisis if they didn't have to leave their countries in the first place....
             </p>
             <p>
              Their own system of control is ironically our gateway to removing it :) but at the moment we are just plowing away and hoping for the best. They have psychopaths just sitting there plotting very far in advance. Will think about it more, but first thought is that we really need to expose the manipulation of information. Once high level arrests are made people need to know how aggressively this was censored. Will help remove control of this arm moving forward

               Another point is that they have power from top down, power of control. They can execute a higher tier of tactical maneuvers and with greater ease. Whereas we are working from ground up and have to hope for positive tactical outcomes once we get to even levels of power.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also another thing. They realize their power is under threat and are surely monitoring developments here intensely. Just the sheer fact that someone like myself, who has 0 ties to politics and 0 ties to any hint of human trafficking... Hell I don't even have kids yet... The sheer fact that I know about all of these structures now and how obvious it is, means they've already lost :) suppose they could destroy the world and whatnot... But what's the point? Can't take your power to the grave. Life is a beautiful thing. More power in one human than a million stars, because a star cannot paint a monalisa ;D and although your demise is inevitable. I do forgive you. No human has control over the conditioning of their childhood. Which is why it's so important to protect of course... But the removal of these structures of evil is just a natural part of our evolution. My message to those involved in the evil... Shame you weren't born 200 years later ;)

            Creatinine is associated with increased chance of heart attack in people with hypertension, but it is totally false to say that it is impossible for creatinine levels to be normal in someone with congestive heart failure.
This is another dumb, irresponsible post.

            Is it possible he was taking ACE inhibitors for his heart issues?  They'll cause an increase in potassium and I think maybe chloride as well.  I've got no clue what the expected increase would be though, so even if he was on them it could be irrelevant.

              Hey, if we had had the stuff on Obozo's BC, true stuff, in the beginning, we might not be having this conversation. They never vetted that sick sucker. He was "chosen" anyway. That clued all of us in on the fact that we don't elect anyone, they are chosen.

            Not seeing the correlation between US interfering with foreign elections(which obvs has been going on for decades) and pizzagate. Those leaks were released last week and no one is even talking about it as far as I can tell. Either way I think evidence of Bam meddling with the 2012 Fr elections will only help the people to believe our govt is capable of devious shit.

            My understanding is that the one witness who saw him saw that he had a red-type streak or red band around his forehead.  Not a material band, but his skin was that color, cherry reddish color.

              Yes, and I finally remembered after reading. I had just forgotten, but you must understand, a lot happens and I'm 63 now, almost 64. I knew there was a band, though.  I just thought it was red, but no, it was a white band. I don't know if he would have appeared that way when he got to the hospital or not.

            Is this the guy who probably saw anomalies in the autopsy report or he actually performed the autopsy and saw Something strange , reported it and then was killed by someone close to him?
Maybe a police man?

             Good thought, I bet you are right. I wonder if there is evidence that he tried to find the correct channel for the information and chose the wrong channel?
            </p>
            <p>
             Because who else, theoretically, would they expect to find all of this information and correctly act on it? Another journalist I suppose. But I think that they figured the buck stops here after taking out the M.E.

            I'm 100% convinced Breitbart was murdered, but this not proof. We don't even know for sure that Breitbart had a heart attack,  considering that the coroner who did his autopsy report died shortly thereafter of arsenic poisoning.

              Hmm interesting that's what I always heard. Regardless his death was incredibly suspicious. I don't think it had to do with Podesta, I think he had the dirt on Obama and was going to release it.

             he was doing something because he tweeted about it in 2011 before he was murdered and actually called out Podesta as a rapist/pedo. So there's that.

              His tweet was ACORN, about James O'Keefe's stunt where after he did his interview, he then went outside and changed his clothes into a pimp outfit and shot some more footage.

            Nope. Just telling it like it is. Unlike so many of you cowards I don't have to lie to push my agenda. And ultimately that's why you will lose this war. There is an obvious shift in power and no longer will you demons be able to lie and do whatever you want. This is just the beginning. As soon as the public really knows the truth they will turn in a heartbeat. Enjoy your freedom while it lasts, pedo!

            Cr and CPK are not the the same thing.  Cr does not elevate with heart attack, CPK or troponins do.  Sudden cardiac death can be heart arrhythmia without heart attack.

             "Michael Cormier, an autopsy technician at the Los Angeles coroner’s office, drove himself to Kaiser Permanente Hospital complaining of heart and stomach pain and diarrhea. The doctors suspected a heart issue or an ulcer and recommended he follow up with his regular physician. Two days later, Cormier asked his wife to call 911. An ambulance took him Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where he died several hours later from massive organ failure."

            <p>
             .."Cormier died on the day the coroner’s office announced Breitbart’s cause of death as a heart attack"

            <p>
             "The coroner’s office released its findings on Cormier’s official cause of death: he was indeed killed by “
             <strong>
              extremely high amounts of arsenic in his system
             </strong>
             ,” said Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter. “He had a history of heart problems, but it was the arsenic that killed him.”"

            All the potassium level postmortem tells us is that the sample (vitreous humor usually) was in fact taken after death, probably 12-18 hours. Though this varies with health cause of death and environmental factors. Potassium levels rise after death since potassium is actively pumped out of body fluids, into cells, by metabolic processes in life. After death the sampled fluids contain more potassium, that has leaked out and not been pumped back into the cell.

            13 is high but maybe it needs to be 130 or something to stop the heart.

              They did a Vitreous potassium and it was 13 mmol. How's that different than blood potassium?

               If they had done a blood potassium test - it would probably have shown higher levels. That is speculation on my part.

               Vitreous = testing fluid from the eye. The results for Breitbart were much already much higher than they should have been based on time after death when testing was done.

                " much higher than they should have been"........That pretty much clinches it for me. It wouldn't if we hadn't learned what they've done in Haiti. Child traffickers and organ harvesters aren't going to think twice about offing a vocal critic like Breitbart.
