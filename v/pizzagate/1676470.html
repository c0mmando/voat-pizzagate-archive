            This video is terrible, their protest plan is terrible, and if they are really going to do something, they need to release the 650,000 emails and everything else that is being held back. Then they need to expose the hidden secrets that all link to Racine, Wisconsin. It is the key to pizzagate. Here is why.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those who stand against Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption, here are the options generally presented:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             John McCain and Ashton Kutcher = Completely Compromised and Controlled / Cover Up
            </li>
            <li>
             Mainstream Media - Completely Compromised and Controlled / Cover Up
            </li>
            <li>
             Mainstream Social Media - Twitter / Facebook / Google / YouTube / Reddit = Completely Compromised and Controlled / Cover Up
            </li>
            <li>
             Jason Chaffetz = Too weak and powerless / may be genuine
            </li>
            <li>
             Cynthia McKinney = Too weak and powerless / may be genuine
            </li>
            <li>
             David Seaman = Too weak and powerless / may be genuine
            </li>
            <li>
             Trey Gowdy = Partially Compromised and Controlled
            </li>
            <li>
             Rand Paul = Partially Compromised and Controlled
            </li>
            <li>
             Breitbart = Compromised and Controlled
            </li>
            <li>
             Infowars and Alex Jones = Presumed Compromised and Controlled
            </li>
            <li>
             Roger Stone = Presumed Compromised and Controlled
            </li>
            <li>
             James Comey = Presumed Compromised and Controlled / Too Connected
            </li>
            <li>
             Robert Steele = Presumed Compromised and Controlled / Too Connected
            </li>
            <li>
             Anonymous = Presumed Compromised and Controlled / Too Disconnected
            </li>
            <li>
             Wikileaks = Presumed Compromised and Controlled / Too Disconnected
            </li>
            <li>
             Julian Assange - May not be what he seems / may be compromised and controlled
            </li>
            <li>
             George Webb = May not be what he seems and too forgiving / too weak and powerless
            </li>
            <li>
             Donald Trump = May not be what he seems and too forgiving / possibly the last hope only if forced to do the right thing
            </li>
            <li>
             Random YouTubers = May not be what they seem and most are terrible researchers and reporters
            </li>
            <li>
             VOAT, Gab and a few others = The last few endangered outlets for uncensored truth
            </li>
            <li>
             Many Others with Good Intentions = Dead / Suicided
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Are there any other significant options left out? There are real people out there that know parts of the truth, including many on this list and others like Sibel Edmonds. The problem is that it is completely disorganized and compartmentalized, while the side of evil has developed a network of organized chaos. It creates a constantly moving target. Pizzagate is the closest the world has come to cracking the egg, but none of these people have quite been able to crack it.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the future of our world is left up to the slim possibility that Wikileaks is not compromised, a corrupt FBI head with direct conflicts of interest with many involved and a history of negligence and complicity to known criminal corruption, some alt media sites selling snake oil products, an insider on YouTube with crazy powerpoint presentations and hardly any audience, and a President of questionable ethics, character, morals and integrity to actually drain the swamp instead of just making more deals with people who he has been associated with for decades, and some random faceless hackers whose plan is to stage unorganized Occupy-style protests in random cities.
           </p>
           <p>
            The answer to the puzzle is Racine, Wisconsin - all of the dots are connected in one form or another to Racine and it is a weak link in the network of global criminal corruption that would serve as a barometer for draining the swamp and create a chain reaction of dominoes to fall around the globe. Opening the gates of Racine, Wisconsin would begin linking up the paths that the Panama Papers, Anonymous, Snowden, Wikileaks and all others to date have paved - their contributions were incredibly important and did create change, but have yet to link it all together and create Common Global Knowledge that will be the tipping point to real change. If the people knew how everything is controlled around every corner of the globe and that we could show how everything is linked from city to state to nation to world - they will begin to open their eyes to the REAL story of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption. Everything is connected. History must be rewritten.
