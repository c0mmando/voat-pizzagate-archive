   Recently an international firm with links in justice, schools, healthcare, military and transport has been liquidated - I suspect it was an outlet for pedophilia and abuse, but I need help digging

Carillion was funded by the government and several banks - <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/revealed-carillions-billion-pound-government-clients">38% of their revenue came from the government in 2016, including</a> - £1.9 billion. It is also known to have received investment from HSBC, Barclays and Santander.</p>
<p>Carillion also boast <a href="https://www.carillionplc.com/solutions/sectors/healthcare/">on their website</a> about branching out to Canada, the Middle East and North Africa on top of their English base.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now that the background and scale of Carillion is out of the way (as well as its funding), there are a few things about Carillion that worry me.</p>
<hr />
<p>Firstly, Carillion has a large involvement in the NHS and is <a href="https://www.carillionplc.com/solutions/sectors/healthcare/">the largest provider of NHS resources management.</a> The NHS is a field of concern due to the Jimmy Savile scandal of free access to Stoke Mandeville Hospital and his 60 odd sexual abuse victims, aging from 8 to 47. Savile had close connections to Members of Parliament, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/revealed-jimmy-saviles-close-friendship-with-margaret-thatcher-8432351.html">including Margaret Thatcher who Savile asked for donations to Stoke Mandeville multiple times</a> (which is why the government funding concerns me.) He also knew Tony Blair, and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2487217/Jimmy-Savile-harassed-music-boss-wife-Chequers-dinner-party-hosted-Tony-Blair.html">attended parties thrown by Tony himself.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/11818357.Savile_lessons__still_not_learned_/">This article from 2 years ago</a> quotes a barrister from the Savile case suggests that there are still some volunteer groups that may be able to take advantage of patients and pose a risk to them. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Barrister Kate Lampard, whose review of Savile\'s offending across NHS institutions made a series of recommendations, said many volunteer programmes at hospitals still &quot;pose a potential risk to patients&quot; due to inadequate checks, while stricter controls are needed so they are not under threat from celebrity guests. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>She went on to say this about Savile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His status was &quot;enhanced by the endorsement and encouragement he received from politicians, senior civil servants and NHS managers&quot;, she told a London press conference. </p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Secondly, <a href="https://www.carillionplc.com/solutions/sectors/education/">Carillion managed supplies &amp; services for almost 900 schools and built 150 buildings</a>, <strong><em>generously</em></strong> providing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Health &amp; safety services</p>
<p>Grounds maintenance</p>
<p>Capital works</p>
<p>Property maintenance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The construction of 150 schools is a slight red flag because of cases like <a href="https://youtu.be/BplUD6kQYuU?t=9m45s">this one described by Ted Gunderson,</a> in which a pre-school had tunnels built under it to transport children into a building next door and from there were prostituted in the community (<strong>although obviously, on its own, constructing 150 schools doesn\'t give any evidence</strong>.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/nov/02/sexual-attacks-in-schools-action-is-taking-too-long-says-mp">In this article, an MP conveys frustrations about government attempts to delay and ignore discussions about sexual abuse and violence in schools,</a> which suggests to me that it is a prevalent issue. The connection that Carillion has to prisons also raises alarm bells in my head about the potential to avoid the law, but that is just speculatory.</p>
<hr />
<p>The worrying part of this information is <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/revealed-carillions-billion-pound-government-clients">this detail about legally hidden spending costs between the government and Carillion</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Government departments and agencies are legally obligated to disclose details of their contracts with private companies. However, there is no widely-used central database and the information is not published in a standard format. As a result, the OpenOpps dataset – which comes primarily from Tenders Electronic Daily, the European-wide record of public tenders and contract awards – is only a partial indication of the government’s relationship with Carillion.</p>
<p>“There’s no data for schools or universities and most NHS bodies don\'t publish,” says Ian Makgill, founder of OpenOpps. “I think we\'re missing 50 per cent of their spend.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don\'t like how that sounds. I\'m suspicious, but can only find a limited range of information on them - anyone want to look into it to find anything more?</p>
<hr />
<p>To conclude, it is my suspicion that a major outlet for paedophilia and corruption may have just gone down, and we could be a lot closer to justice considering how large a company it was.</p>',
