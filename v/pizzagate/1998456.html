            Ha! "Epstein is a saint..." I'll be laughing at that one for the rest of the year. All the stuff Epstein ever gave girls was bribery, much like the cash he gave the Palm Beach PD.

            Did anyone else notice that this was a subtle hit piece against Donald trump? They even assigned it a Donald Trump keyword so searches would be more likely to find it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump deserves to be excoriated for his involvement with Epstein, its true.
           </p>
           <p>
            But its interesting that they mention Trump twice, including the lawsuit mentioning him that got thrown out of court.
           </p>
           <p>
            But they don't mention that Bill Clinton has been partying far more often with Epstein, and not just in Florida, Clinton has been documented on flights regularly to Epstein's 'Pedophile Isle' and was named in a lawsuit that Epstein settled out of court to prevent it going to trial, so that testimony about their behavior would not go public.
           </p>
           <p>
            They also neglect to mention liberal lawyer and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz, who has also been named as a sexual abuser in Epstein legal proceedings.
           </p>
           <p>
            And it's no accident that the NY Daily News is a liberal mainstream rag.

             Yeah it reeks of propaganda, I googled "jeffrey epstein rape teenager" and all that came up were trump hit pieces. This was the only thing mentioning Epstein. Google is nothing more than protection for these monsters. The article seems to paints epstein in a decent light, "soliciting prostituation from a teenage girl" rather than statuatory rape. Just couldn't believe it when I read that paragraph about the exact replica, felt like sharing. Dershowitz is the sleaziest looking guy I've ever seen, he's probably huge in this cabal, but also willing to throw everyone under the bus, who knows. Crazy times.

              the differences between podesta and epstien are staggering. epstien gets teen girls good jobs, cars, puts them through college etc. he is a good guy, the girls he likes are a little younger than the law allows. that can't be compared to kidnap, forced rape of a child, murder and the like. they aren't in the same ball park. epstein is a saint compared to some of the people out there.

              Actually, this is quite a common in elite pedophile circles.
             </p>
             <p>
              The guy who procured the underage kids and set up the parties gets prosecuted, and walks away with a slap on the wrist sentence that allow the higher-ups in the government to claim that 'justice has been served.'
             </p>
             <p>
              But they also let it be seen that they will protect their own by rigging the trials to hand out meaningless sentences, so that other guys will be willing to step in and procure.
             </p>
             <p>
              Did you know that Lawrence E. King, who procured the Boy's Town kids in the Franklin scandal, was never even prosecuted for his pedophilia crimes? They only prosecuted him for the embezzlement he committed at the savings &amp; loan company, and he got out after serving a bit less than 5 years of a 10 year sentence.

                The OP there is wrong about the time King served in prison, but the links are very useful. Especially concerning is the fact that
                <strong>
                 as late as 2014, King was speaking to groups of children in after-school programs run by Granville Academy
                </strong>
                .

                These pedophiles never quit. They've got some kind of mental compulsion to keep doing this shit.
               </p>
               <p>
                And that's why old stories like the Franklin Scandal are still relevant to today.

                Also, if you want to get completely caught up on the whole Franklin story from the beginnings up to 2009 in one sitting, you could read Nick Bryant's book:
                <em>
                 The Franklin Scandal: A Story of Powerbrokers, Child Abuse &amp; Betrayal
                </em>
                2009, ISBN 1936296071 / 978-1936296071. Here's a link to cheap deals on the book:

                This is how the elites get away with this shit, because of the media covering up for politicians who claim to be aligned with their liberal prejudices.

                 </strong>
                 or some thing on other social media could go viral so fast Twitter couldn't censor it fast enough to keep it down?

            Jeffrey Epstein should be sweating in a real cell.  He and Dyncorp are so very involved, and the CIA is connected to it all.  Everything is so intertwined and confusing and that is the way the like it.  The harder to unwind.
