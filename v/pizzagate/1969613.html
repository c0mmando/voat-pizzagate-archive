<p>Deep was writing a play about the illuminati/Thelema worshippers. Last week he died at the age of 42. Supposedly the hot weather triggered his sickle cell anaemia.  It is also reported that he choked on an egg while in hospital. </p>

            That cause of death thing is plain evil. It's like, that's what they may have told him they would write as "cause of death", before allegedly killing him... Like post-mortem abuse. :/

            Reports (mainly from TMZ, which makes me question who is feeding them this info) now suggest that the autopsy--which I've read will not be released--will say that Prodigy died from 'accidental' suffocation.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was in hospital for days before he died.  His anaemia was well under control (and one would expect that after a few days in hospital it would be).   Why do people who advocate for the protection of children and who lift the lid on ritual abuse end up dying in hospital?
           </p>
           <p>
            I doubt that the suffocation was 'accidental'.

            This is very important, copied from above - 
THEY ARE BEING SEXUALLY MOLESTED BECAUSE IN THESE IN THESE SATANIC RITUALS WHEN THEY MOLEST A CHILD THEY’RE CONJURING UP A NEGATIVE ENERGY.
           </p>
           <p>
            THEY CALL THIS ENERGY ‘SATAN” OR “THE DEVIL.” SATAN OR THE DEVIL IS NOT A PERSON, IT’S SIMPLY A NEGATIVE ENERGY THAT CAN COMPLETELY TAKE OVER A PERSONS BODY, MIND &amp; SOUL. THE PICTURE AND IMAGE THAT WE ALL HAVE KNOWN OF THE DEVIL WITH AN ALL RED BODY AND HORNS, TAIL PLUS PITCHFORK IS JUST AN ARTIST RENDITION OF THIS VERY SAME ENERGY
           </p>
           <p>
            Evil / Devil / Hate =   Negative Energy
           </p>
           <p>
            Good / God / Love = Positive Energy
           </p>
           <p>
            If we stay positive the world becomes a positive place. 
If we become negative the world becomes a negative place. 
Evil thrives on negative energy
Good thrives on positive energy
The more positive energy we all send out,  the less powerful evil will become. 
We are all sending out way too much negative energy these days. It's what they want, why they need war and hate, why all the murder and lies, it's all negative. 
Try not to hate, understand that the more positive energy we give out,  the weaker they become. Love is the key not Hate... Peace not War... Good not Evil. Open your minds. Remember just as THE DEVIL IS NOT A PERSON, IT’S SIMPLY A NEGATIVE ENERGY THAT CAN COMPLETELY TAKE OVER A PERSONS BODY, MIND &amp; SOUL.. 
God is also not a person or being, it's simply a positive energy, however this energy is so strong it can completely take over a persons body, mind &amp; Soul. The more people who become positive, give off more positive energy. The world will heal.

            Wow, the handwritten pages show a very brave, passionate and red pilled man that actually cared and wanted to make a difference. He'd be a great voice for the rap culture.

           <p>
            It's ridiculous that they say that they are not sure what killed him. The sickle cell anemia or choking on the egg. I guess that's their lame back up if the anemia story doesn't hold up.

            If you not heard it already then you really should listen to the following album by Canibus - Melatonin Magic. This is a very interesting album all about the Illuminati and the draco new world order. Very good album, a real eye opener.

            Always read the fine print people. And for the love of God can we start teaching European History again? I don't ever want to be this freaked out again.

             was he really suicided? I thought it seemed like a legit drug overdose (though I might be mis-remembering), and he was kinda known for drinking a ton of 'lean' (codeine) and doing other opiates.

              They say it was sickle cell. However I feel they may have messed with his meds,  which ironically is something that George Webb speaks about, reguarding VA hospitals administering diluted meds to our vets.  It could be the same deal here.

              Not sure, but his contemporaries seem to think that his death was suspicious. Especially the timing and all, after he started talking about rappers sucking dick and getting fcked in the ass for record deals (or something like that).

            We need this archived and put as a lead. Huge celebrity industry insider telling it as it is. Great for red pill. I think we know for certain now J.Z. is a huge handler. Two of the biggest names in hip hop have called him out now Mobb Depp and Kanye West. 8:50 in the video and third note in the second link.
