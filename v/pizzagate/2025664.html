            I contacted the "oath keepers" and this is what I got ...
We are not a law enforcement agency, but share your concern.
           </p>
           <p>
            The best thing you can do is report it to the local police department. Also, child protective services (CPS) in your area. If they find anything near that bad, they will extract the children from that environment. Then after investigating further, they will forward what they find to the District Attorney.

            Requesting situation update. Has the situation changed in anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            In terms of tactical, what's the terrain around that house like? Any places to get obscurement (for the sake of stealth surveilance and if need be, set up ambushes).
           </p>
           <p>
            How many men in total have come to that house? How big or buff are they? Size of the mother?
           </p>
           <p>
            If things don't improve, arrangements might have to be made to bring me along as additional muscle for the posse. I'm a 6'3" 200 lb male BTW.

             Nothing against the OP who I feel is absolutely genuine, but if this were a hoax it wouldnt be the first time Pizzagaters have been goaded into a foolhardy action.  How far would you go?  Would you scoop up the children and take them to an agency or the police?  Then be charged with kidnapping?  Would you notify every child protection agency knowing some are pedo traffickers?  Do you send your info to local news?  Talk to all the neighbors? What do you do.

              That is a predicament. On one hand, you wanna help the kids in any way you can, on the other hand, you don't want to get YOUR name on the radar of the pedos, as they may start to organize in an attempt to ruin your life.

             I am saying no violence if there is danger he will be attacked by a group of them.  If it gets too hairy, the best is to stay inside and call LE.  If you have a gun and there are 3 of them with a gun you don't look too tough.  There are times for defense and time to use your brain.  Yeah if there is one weak looking guy outside with that kid tell him to let him go or you'll bash his head in, and then do it.

            Videotape, videotape, videotape. When you have enough material, GO TO LOCAL MEDIA! If the police won't help you, they sure as hell will when a local station picks up the story and details how they're not doing their job.

              Your fearlessness is power.
             </p>
             <p>
              The bad guys don't know what to do with that.  Making you afraid, this gives them the advantage, they know how to use that against you.  If it comes to violence they likely have an experience advantage.  Defend yourself with your greatest strengths, use what you know.  It could be in your eyes what drives them away, your posture, your voice, your intention.

              Self defense is a right, not bashing the second amendment, just offering strategy.

                lol what difference does that make.  Inner strength is asexual.  (Says Account Deleted By User, where the title should be, so I'm guessing about my input re: your response.  Are you the person Carmenita was getting on board from OK to assist the woman with a neighbor issue?   If so thanks much!

                  In the first post, she switched from describing neglect and signs of abuse she witnessed in the parking lot, to claiming that sexual abuse was occurring inside with these men without having actual witness of such.  I think it was a shift in logic that perhaps the authorities she called have picked up on.

                  They have people crying wolf all the time. This could be that.   I heard of an older couple who have driven their grandchild across the Can/US boarder for many years.  The latest time, the boarder guard was up front about looking for child trafficking.  He insisted on questioning the young child without interference from the front seat. all was no problem and they were impressed.   A change has been made, that was a first I've heard of.   Many in authority are happy about it.  I've got to believe that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The abused strongly need the support of honest brave authority figures.  We haven't had it.   Thank you for being here, answering the call.  That we have community resources within is awesome!  False alarms are always the best.  (my experience)

                Yes, a hoax is the best possible outcome in this situation even though a huge inconvenience for you.  Thank you for caring as you so obviously do.

                Edit:  I wonder whether CPS showed up as the OP said they were scheduled to.  I asked her but haven't received an answer yet.  Did you notice that she has now said where she works--at the Orange County Food Bank?  That should be a place where it would be easy to make contact with help organizations.  Also, it turns out she lives with her fiance but there was no mention of his help in all this.
               </p>
               <p>
                Edit:  She's also now saying she knows the identity of one of the men she saw go in the house but not how she learned this or whether she told the police about it.

              I am wondering if he read everything on here and called them himself.  You are being rewarded for always helping others!  I wish I was out there and we could go together.  BUT To Where?  I have frazzled myself all day re reading this thread about 10 times today.  I am so very glad to hear about all your good fortune.  With everything you have done for those kids, you deserve it and so do they.  Going out now.  Be back on here late tonight.  I wonder where OP is.

                I am home now.  I am afraid this might be a hoax.  Unless he got into some trouble with one of those guys.  That is the scary part, not knowing.  But as you say, the good part of it being a hoax is that kids are not being abused, at least not in this case.  I just hope if it is real that everyone is safe.

            Forgot about Oath Keepers. If it is nessecary to bring them in, describe in detail the situation, perps, victims, and any injuries you have seen on the victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stay calm, stay tranquil. You don't want a rash decision to get you hurt or killed. Who will be able to save them if you're out of commission.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think tactical. Analyze these perverts patterns so you can predict their movements. This will make the OK arrival that much more of a nasty surprise.
           </p>
           <p>
            These kids need to know that heroes still exist, including the ones they can't see.

             Oath Keepers Info.  and she is contacting.  I know they will want to help.  This is making me crazy.  Have not heard from OP.  I  sent him a DM for address for Cc1914 so she can head there.  This is excruciating at best.  Thank you for all your concern.  We have some really great people on here. Everyone give yourselves a pat on the back. Upvoat for you all.

            I would be highly suspicious of anonymous individuals here who are encouraging you to violence.  Baseball bats?  Tackling him?

            In fire and EMT situations,  people often remind themselves and each other, **Your emergency, doesn't make it mine.  **  Stay calm and centered, adrenaline is to be avoided.  It leads to poor decisions and exhaustion.  That's how emergency responders avoid getting themselves and others hurt.
           </p>

            You are a witness, they and the cops know it, that's enough for now.   Talk to a lawyer, get a referral from someone you trust, even if you can't afford it.  The first few minutes are free and it's confidential.   Learn your rights and stay legal.

             This is valuable info.  No Violence Recommended.  He may be the one to end up in jail.  Seriously.  It is of course good to have something like a baseball bat in your house. But only use if there is threat of attack.  I know this first hand.

            I'm curious because you're calling them out a lot;
How do you know these creeps are homeless?
Especially the one you said had car?
Most homeless I know can't even afford a bite to eat much less sex with anybody.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not trying to diminish the impact of your story in any way but the homeless are being put in a certain light here.
If it's true by all means let it shine.
But this just ain't my personal experience with their character.

             I said in another comment that LE may be protecting them.  That is my biggest fear.  Why have they not moved to stop this.  If the old man has started Eviction Notice then it is good idea to contact the County Sheriff, he is the one that comes to evict.

             , be careful.  There is a possibility that this whole thing is a hoax meant to flush out Voaters or just to get us worked up.  Edit:  Also, the OP calls for help on what to do but then gives no indication of intending to take any of the advice we have given on who to contact.  That seems like another possible hoax flag.

            You could contact the nearest elementary school. There are some rotten apples, but most teachers do care about kids and might have resources.

            I hate to say this, but it sounds as though you've done everything you can.   If Child Protective Services are coming tomorrow, hopefully they will do SOMETHING.  If they do nothing, call them again next week.

            I had a completely different circumstance, but what I did worked and this may work for you. I lived in Los Angeles and had a pretty neighbor. She turned to drugs and then started prostituting herself for drugs... men would start coming over around 10pm and it would last through the night. Couldn't sleep she was so loud. When I heard a car park and a man start walking up, I pulled out a flashlight and camera and yelled "you are live on the internet, your face, your car, your license plate." They couldn't even see me because of the light, but every time they ran and left. Stand out there and blatantly record the "johns" people like that do NOT want to be on camera. Arm yourself in case. Be careful.

            If you're willing to risk assault, forcible entry, and kidnapping charges which come with a possible prison sentence, and endangering your own life, you could go over when it's just the old man and the kids, break in, overpower the old guy and take the kids to the nearest safe location (ideally some sort of organization that's not corrupt and willing to help).

            You said they look like they're in bad shape so once you get them in front of somebody who cares they'll be able to see with their own eyes.

            OP, maybe you should make a call to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. You might get more traction. They might at least investigate.

               by DM so he doesn't put it on here.   but I would contact the Oath Keepers for Backup they will protect you.  This could be dangerous.  I have a sinking feeling those police are not helping because those pedos are being protected.  If you go take a few with you, but contact O K.  They will not disappoint.  I have listed their info in the thread.  Keep me posted I will be watching this.

                 Just do it safely.  We can't be on here 24 hrs a day, even though we would like.  As I said highly recommend Oath Keepers.  See my info in thread.  Have not heard from the OP as of yet.  We have to get info from him.  DO NOT GO ALONE.  I think bringing a good size of people about 6 friends and relatives with you will be a show of force.  And the Oath Keepers.  They will also give you advice.

                     It's not even about bravery I think it's just an instinct . Knowing this could be true and it's 30 min from my house , I feel it's my duty . I can't un learn this .

                     I messaged both and no reply yet.  I know Cc is on her way. Can't keep her away.  Wish I could jump in the car with her.  Hope they called Oath Keepers.  A friend on here mentioned them, he used them.  I  will be unable to check later, going out.  Hope they do get back to us.  I have a feeling there is a lot going on or she would be in touch.  She's a great gal and Mom.  That's why I called on her to help.  Knew we could count on her. If I hear anything will let you know.

              Orange County would be a better bet. Lots of Marines that will take care of things. Was a member when I was stationed there.

            will help because she's awesome.  Meanwhile can you start writing down the license plates of the cars you see coming and going?  Get the plates and post them here.  I don't post on 4chan/pol because I'm not computer literate enough to navigate that confusing site, but maybe people here can get the 4chan crowd on this.  Once you get the plates then someone (authorities or 4channers) can IDENTITY THE ADULTS, and that will Be a start, right?    Be careful.  Good for you for getting involved.  I hope you have a dog or more for protection, but definitely get the plates of the people coming and going.  God bless you.

            You say "I just want to know what else I can do."  There are a lot of suggestions given here that you can pursue if you do not receive help from Child Protective Services.  Until you have tried these suggestions, you have not run out of options.

            Inform your neighbors. Jump them, tackle them and do not come off them until restrained. Take him to the police precinct with your gathered proof and licence plates, or demand for an investigation. They may book you, but try to have a posse.

            If you believe your neighbor is senile, as you say, you also have an excuse to report to adult protective services that you believe he is being taken advantage of by a homeless woman who is also apparently pimping her children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beyond that, when you didn't get immediate help from local police, why didn't you call the mayor, city council members, newspapers, television stations, neighboring city authorities, county authorities, state authorities, federal authorities?  Whatever it takes.  You get close enough to see bug bites, but you don't have pictures to show authorities what you're worried about.  Get creative--find a way.
           </p>
           <p>
            It sucks I know, but you do not have the option of doing nothing if Child Protective Services doesn't come through, and even waiting until tomorrow for them to show up is really not okay.  It is terrible to think what might happen to those children tonight.
           </p>
           <p>
            Call a local Crisis Hotline.  Say you are beside yourself with worry because of what's going on next door and because no one will help you save the children.  Call a state or national hotline and say the same.  (This paragraph edited to remove unwise advice on what to tell Crisis Hotline.)
           </p>
           <p>
            If you don't know how to make the contacts I've mentioned, post here immediately and we will help you find who to contact and the numbers to call.  How can you watch that going on next door?  How can you sleep?

             If this  report  is  true  this  person is  in  a  dilemma, you  need close  competent  friends helping  you, don't trust  any user on  Voat,  take everything  with  a  grain  of  salt- this  forum is  used  by true  citizen  investigators and the  wolves they report  on at the  same  time, without  competent associates that have  some  training to assist you it would be  wise to keep some  distance,  observe  and  report, videotape but don't  ever  get intimately  involved  in  any aggressive  action  with people  you  meet  on  Voat-or  you  could  find  your  self a  victim of a trap and in prison,
calm  yourself, be  patient, have  witnesses, document, protect yourself  at  all  times

            Believe me, as you know, we know what you are up against.  You are doing the best you can do right now.  I commend you for getting involved.  A lot of people would just pull their shades and have a beer.  If you pray, that is all you can do tonight.  Just know that you are doing your best. I am hoping others will see this too.  If you can do it safely, stay with this case.  It is heartbreaking stuff as you know just being a member on here for 7 mo.  Bless You. Goodnight:)

             Having proof of the mans doing and other witnesses to corroborate your story prior to having the bones in his legs and arms beaten into dust with a baseball bay should sway 1 juror. Take no deals, push it to trial by peers if you must.

            Got a baseball bat? Otherwise maybe you should buy "mom" a pile of her favorite drug of choice...

            Honestly though if the cops do nothing, it may call for some form of vigilantism. Some fire departments are "safe spaces," likewise a non-Catholic church or kind hearted attorney could help.

             .  Usually I'm not a big fan of lawyers but, yeah, there are some good ones.  I bet there are some good ones who would step up and help.  There's nothing more powerful than an ethical lawyer who's passionate about helping others....

            As you will see I have tried contacting someone that might know how to help.  I have to go to sleep but maybe she will contact you. Maybe tonight or tomorrow.  Good Luck I will check in with you in the morn.  I feel for those kids.  She may be selling that little boy of hers to those men.  I will pray for all of you, even the Mother.  God Bless You.

            Maybe you are still up, there is a problem here with abuse that maybe you can give this person help with.  They have called authorities but there are no results.  Where can they call or what is the best out there?  Child protective services are coming tomorrow.  They are bad out there.

            Child protective services will most likely question the kids away from mom. If all fails and if this person has made any threat towards you, you can file a restraining order and put it all in your complaint, with your police reports, that will be seen by a judge. If you feel the kids are in immediate danger keep calling 911.
