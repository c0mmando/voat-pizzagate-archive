<p>Relevance: This post is very relevant to the subject of pizzagate. It ties together pedophilia, sex-magick, Marlon Brando, Michael Jackson, Corey Feldman, Aleister Crowley, an abused daughter’s suicide by hanging, and even offers a possible explanation as to how and why Chester Bennington resembles John Podesta. As for the aforementioned Feldman, it’ll give a new perspective as to why he does what he does. It also gets into the black heart of PedoWood and advances an original theory as to the social and genetic engineering insidiously muddying the waters and making it difficult to tell who is who. </p>

<p>Yup, that’s where The Kenyan went to write his $60 million’s worth memoirs. In fact, there was some snarky little tweet about The Kenyan hiding out at a bunker writing them. But the question remains why Tetiaroa? Why The Brando? Is it just super luxury resort and choice of celebs? Or is there a deeper significance to the choice? To find out, I went dumpster diving for what I could find. It wasn’t long before I discovered a lot of very creepy stuff some of which you may have already heard and some you might not.

<h1>Marlon Brando accused of sexually harassment - 2004</h1>
<p>&quot;Marlon Brando has been accused of sexually harassing his former business manager and confessing to having intercourse with underage children. Jo An Corrales, who worked for Brando from December 2000 through to March 8, 2004, is suing the estate of the legendary actor, who died last July, aged 80, for Â£260,000 for wrongful dismissal and sexual harassment. In a suit filed at a Los Angeles court this week, 
Miss Corrales claims the Oscar-winning star subjected her to a hostile work environment exposing his genitals, touching her inappropriately, insisting she watch pornographic movies with him and revealing his sexual exploits with underage partners. The suit says: &quot;Corrales spent many occasions being subjected to Marlon Brando\'s sexually graphic stories, including several documenting his sexual escapades with minors, which Corrales found very disturbing.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marlon Brando Molested his daughter Cheyenne (FULL interview)</p>
<p>From Paris Match interview (1993)</p>
<p>Part 1:</p>
<p>reporter: You have made [the] allegation . . . that your father behaved in an unnatural way toward you. Will you now explain?</p>
<p>cheyenne: I have always been the &quot;sacrifice&quot; of Marlon Brando, his lamb for sacrifice, for his own personal happiness. I have said that I have been sexually abused by my father. My first memories go back to age seven.</p>
<p>reporter: Did you tell your mother about it?</p>
<p>cheyenne: No, I never told anybody about it, not even my mother.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>reporter: You didn\'t know he had bought a house for you?</p>
<p>cheyenne: No, he didn\'t talk about that. Maybe he thought he could isolate me.</p>
<p>reporter: Why did he want to do that?</p>
<p>cheyenne: I think he was worried I would say something wrong, or something I didn\'t mean.</p>
<p>reporter: What was it like living with him during those months?</p>
<p>cheyenne: He often went in his room and put on a Do Not Disturb sign. That was when he did his &quot;exercise.&quot; He said he sat in the dark room and played tapes. He said they were &quot;autosuggestion&quot; tapes. I don\'t know what that is, but he was listening to voices—I think his own voice—for hours, at three in the morning. I didn\'t see him do this, but he always talked about it. . . his meditating.</p>
<p>reporter: Is he searching for his soul?</p>
<p>cheyenne: I don\'t think he has a soul, so he is not searching for it.</p>

<p>He also raped that actress in Last Tango In Paris. She was only 18 he was years and years older than her. What a piece of shit.

<p>As for Cheyenne, she ended up committing suicide by hanging herself. Marlon Brando did not attend the funeral. Here’s a little bit of an interview done with her by ABC. She was recovering from a car accident at a psychiatric hospital. More details are given in The Data Lounge link if you care to search for it. She says she was locked up in the institution after a car accident for no good reason. Her pedo father said she was crazy. One guess who I believe.</p>

<p>As for the rape allegation of the actress in Last Tango in Paris, the director has finally admitted it’s true: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/05/last-tango-in-paris-director-admitted-marlon-brando-committed-rape-on-camera/">http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/05/last-tango-in-paris-director-admitted-marlon-brando-committed-rape-on-camera/</a></p>
<p>‘Last Tango in Paris’ director admitted Marlon Brando committed rape on camera </p>
<p>In a recently surfaced video, “Last Tango In Paris” director Bernardo Bertolucci admits he and Marlon Brando thought up the infamous “butter” scene in the movie without actress Maria Schneider’s consent.</p>
<p>In the video of a 2013 interview, the late director admitted Brando essentially committed rape, with his consent.</p>
<p>“The sequence of the butter is an idea that I had with Marlon in the morning before shooting it,” Bertolucci said. “I’d been, in a way, horrible to Maria, because I didn’t tell her what was going on” (because) “I wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress.”</p>
<p>“I wanted her to react humiliated,” he said. “I think she hated me and also Marlon because we didn’t tell her.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, well, it was for a movie! Why not rape her? And you think she hated him? Wonder why? Just because of the rape? So petty … NOT! This really does remind me so much of the concept of viewing a snuff film. Same idea. You think you’re watching a pretend film where people are acting, but you’re not. Maria Schneider IS being raped and movie goers paid for a ticket and watched, cheering the movie on. But is there a backstory to this evil? Sure is. Seems the pedo Marlon Brando met Donald Cammel, the godson of Aleister Crowley. The two worked and palled around together starting circa 1970. Is that when the meditation tapes started? You know the idea of listening to your own voice and staring into the mirror is uber mystical. Hmmmmm …. First a link to Crowley’s The Sacred Texts where he talks about mantras and breath and how they’re used for meditation to still the mind: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/aba/aba1.htm">http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/aba/aba1.htm</a> </p>
<p>The ultimate idea of meditation being to still the mind, it may be considered a useful preliminary to still consciousness of all the functions of the body. … The best way to time the breathing, once some little skill has been acquired, with a watch to bear witness, is by the use of a mantra. The mantra acts on the thoughts very much as Pranayama does upon the breath. The thought is bound down to a recurring cycle; any intruding thoughts are thrown off by the mantra, just as pieces of putty would be from a fly-wheel; and the swifter the wheel the more difficult would it be for anything to stick. 
This is the proper way to practise a mantra. Utter it as loudly and slowly as possible ten times, then not quite so loudly and a very little faster ten times more. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Crowley, his influence on Hollywood through his organization is immeasurable. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://leozagami.com/2017/11/04/hollywood-satanism-ritual-murder-and-aleister-crowley/">http://leozagami.com/2017/11/04/hollywood-satanism-ritual-murder-and-aleister-crowley/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the connection between Brando and the Donald Cammel the godson of Aleister Crowley established, the following link suggests the island where The Kenyan visited and Brando lived is cursed:  
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2012/01/marlon-brandos-fatal-island-of-crossed-destinies.html">http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2012/01/marlon-brandos-fatal-island-of-crossed-destinies.html</a></p>
<p>Aleister Crowley\'s godson, Donald Cammell\'s &quot;swingin\' sixties&quot; gangster turn rockstar psychedelic mind-control epic Performance (1970) impresses Brando and influences his descison to cross the line with his 70s triumvirate of The Godfather, Last Tango in Paris and Apocalpse Now. Brando had met Cammell in 1959 through the french actor/director Christian Marquand (and Brando\'s son\'s namesake) and the two struck up a lifelong friendship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>===========</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cammell and Brando\'s friendship would (temporarily) fall out over Cammell\'s romance with China Kong, the teenage daughter of Brando\'s longtime mistress, Anita Loo.  
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>========</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Brando signs on to writer-director Richard Stanley\'s Island of Dr. Moreau project, his personal life takes a turn for the worse. Son Christian Brando, shoots and kills Dag Drollet, Tahitian lover of half-sister Cheyenne in the Brando home on Mullholland Drive. A distraught Cheyenne would hang herself in her mother\'s home in Tahiti five years later, just as Marlon begins shooting Dr. Moreau on an island off of Australia.</p>

Seems the pedo Marlon Brando met Donald Cammel, the godson of Aleister Crowley. The two worked and palled around together starting circa 1970. Is that when the meditation tapes started? You know the idea of listening to your own voice and staring into the mirror is uber mystical. Hmmmmm …. First a link to Crowley’s The Sacred Texts where he talks about mantras and breath and how they’re used for meditation to still the mind:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/aba/aba1.htm">
             http://www.sacred-texts.com/oto/aba/aba1.htm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The ultimate idea of meditation being to still the mind, it may be considered a useful preliminary to still consciousness of all the functions of the body. … The best way to time the breathing, once some little skill has been acquired, with a watch to bear witness, is by the use of a mantra. The mantra acts on the thoughts very much as Pranayama does upon the breath. The thought is bound down to a recurring cycle; any intruding thoughts are thrown off by the mantra, just as pieces of putty would be from a fly-wheel; and the swifter the wheel the more difficult would it be for anything to stick. 
This is the proper way to practise a mantra. Utter it as loudly and slowly as possible ten times, then not quite so loudly and a very little faster ten times more.

            Thanks for putting this together. I had no idea Brando was a monster. I’m also not quite sure how this ties into BO staying at the Brandi? Is there more to it than a name? Finally, I don’t see a problem with meditation using a mantra. People were doing that for thousands of years before Crowley. It’s effective and it does calm the mind. I do it everyday.

             It's not that I think anything is wrong with meditation and I hope I didn't imply that.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's the tapes Brando was using that I'm saying have got to something twisted. I mean, it's always the goal, isn't it? Do you actually think a devout Satanist like Crowley would be practicing yoga and using meditation tapes to the end that you're using it for? I'm very curious as to what was on those tapes. I'm wondering what ideas he was reinforcing and putting in his own head.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, I started out with Obama going to The Brando because it was a natural starting point. I'm raising the question as to whether something of Brando actually remains on that island. In other words, is there a "culture" there. A "cabal". On Epstein's island there was a temple. Is there such a thing at The Brando. What about underground tunnels? Donald Cammel was there so I doubt they were playing Bingo each night. So I'm more calling out why Obama chose that spot, why he went there, and then backing up my asking by filling in details/background of what went on there.
            </p>
            <p>
             And I didn't put this part in, but you know the obsession everyone has with Q and #followthewhiterabbit. Well, I mentioned dancing with the white rabbit being related to MJ, but what about a real white rabbit? Seem VP Pence has a white rabbit (a BOTUS: First Bunny of the US), and you know what the name is? That's right: Marlon.

            Good research. To tie this back together again, I would add that Marlon Brando was a very good friend of Michael Jackson's. But apparently even Jackson's level of pedophilia irked Brando.
           </p>
           <p>
            It came as no surprise to me when I heard Obama went to Brando's Island. They all run in the same circles and are financed by child pornography and human trafficking. Did Brando establish the Island as a gateway to bring over children from the poverty stricken Asia Pacific area? Were VIPs invited to the island previously to have sex with children at the island? It seems that the island is very symbolic for 'them,' I think they have held rituals there on more than one occasion.

             Michael Jackson Molested Macaulay Culkin Suggest FBI Files – MJ Was a Monster Pedophile
            </strong>
            In a transcript of one tape from 1993, Jackson’s ex-butler Philip LeMarque and his wife Stella detailed how screen legend Marlon Brando complained that the King of Pop would “disappear with the children” at his Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara, California.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stella said: “He’d come to the ranch and always see Michael playing, then disappear with the children.” Michael would never spend time with the adults at the ranch. The couple said Jackson would watch porn films with young boys in his private bedroom behind a secret wall.

             Thanks for the info. As for the first questions re: the island, I believe a lot of things were done. Maybe rituals, etc.

             I'm very interested in those tapes Brando listened to. What happened to them? Does The Kenyan use them? So many questions surrounding this. Obviously hugely dark, demonic forces are behind this And had Brando had his awards stripped away? PedoWood really is the most dangerous propaganda tool ever invented.

              Tapes are used by alot of them. I don't know if it's something that is THAT unusual. Many normal people listen to positive reinforcement tapes. The highest level ones have access to virtual reality setups that have been in existence for decades, and can be used for all sorts of things.

            It's getting to point that every single "big-time" actor, and more importantly, the kike producers and executives of Hollywood, should simply be lined up against a wall and mowed down with a machine gun.

            What a very interesting post, thank you.  I never thought I would say this but I am happy my mom is not around to see all her old 'heart throb' film stars being exposed.  I remember the venom which she spat along with the name of Rock Hudson when she found out he was gay.  My mom was a very loving woman, but there was one obvious thing she hated and that was gays/paedophiles.  In the early 1970s my mom was in court on behalf of my 2 little brothers who had been caught by police in a 'gang' of boys (they were around 9 &amp;10 years old at the time) and accused of 'gay bashing'.  The leader of the 10 strong gang of was about 15 - he would get the younger boys to hang around town and when a 'gay' approached them to go to the car park with him, the rest of the gang would be there to threaten him and take money from him.  I don't know all the ins and outs other than my mom saying that the lawyer was 'as queer as a 9 bob note' and the poor kids are going to spend time in detention centre, which my 2 brothers did for 6 weeks! - these sickos have been in power FAR TO LONG a time of reckoning is upon them!

             The fact he was allowed to destroy his daughter's life that way ... with no one even interfering. And it's going still going on today. The adoration and people thinking this scum are gods is definitely part of the problem. The other is that some do have that X factor where you actually like them. Sympathy for The Devil syndrome. There's someone else on my radar. Everyone is giving him a pass, but he doesn't deserve one. Think he's stinky, smelly dirty.

            No I had no idea about Brando...I thought he might be okay because he did an interview with Larry King where he said the Jews were horrible to other races.  They made every time of degrading movie about people but never made one with the kike.....
           </p>
           <p>
            Brando sounds like a real piece of work.

             Brando was clearly insane as are all these child raping monsters. Maybe he had a mood swing and spilled the beans on Larry King, or more likely, he was just reading a script that was given him. Sometimes kikes like to openly tell the public that they control everything, only for the zombie masses to stare blank-eyed without reacting in any way at all, save for the well-learnt exclamation of "anti-semitism", much to the amusement of the kikes. Brando was a wreck, a puppet and tool, sustained by drugs, money and perversion his handlers the kikes threw his way.
