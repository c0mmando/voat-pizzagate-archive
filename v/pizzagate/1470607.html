<p>There have been articles posted in the guardian trying to normalize pedophilia.

<p>Once we have their attention, we bring up the Podesta brothers having stuffed animals all over their houses when they have no children, the art all over their walls, James Alfantis\'s Instagram, the Wikileaks emails that seem to be in pedo code, that Cheese Pizza has been confirmed to be pedo code for child porn, the pizzeria in MO that was busted for trafficking, Trump having been on Epstein\'s plane, him being sued for having sex with a 13 year old girl at one of Epstein\'s parties, Clinton having been on the Lolita Express 22 times, the Clinton\'s apparent &quot;looking the other way&quot; in terms of trafficking as evidenced in the Wikileaks emails, the child porn found on thousands of defense employees computers.

            The GAY rights movement advanced quickly due to funding, positive media and legislation all assisted by the Elite. They never would have changed society so quickly without. Gays are one of the hardest groups to wake up to the NWO. The less secure someone is the more they will default to the power structure. There is also quite a prevalence of mild Narcissism amongst gays, so they tend to be quite self-orientated. It would be hard to get them to see any value in taking on a cause like this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its would be wrong to say that gays are in to kids if I remember statistically its less % wise than for straight people. Most gays like MEN, hence the derogatory use of the word "Chicken" to mean a guy who just looks young but doesn't necessarily have to be underage at all.  Alifantis was subverting the usual gay use of the word "chicken" and using it in a joking way. No gay (except a pedo) would use the word to describe a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            Better to spend time waking up some other group like Christians - who might take on the mantle.

            Many people don't want to admit this (due to decades of social conditioning) but homosexuality is the first step on the road of degeneracy that leads to pedophilia. That's why alot of these pizzagate pedo ring are gay. (I'll probably get censored for this but its the truth!)

             Dude. First rule of these evil fuckers: divide and conquer. 
You've been divided. We need the good natured gay/lesbian/bi/trans on our side - on the fucking CHILDRENS side. Do you really think its not possible to have a healthy adult consensual gay sexual relationship? There are millions of examples - and those gays dont point out examples of heterosexual pedophiles as indicative of the entire heterosexual 'pathway to degeneracy'.
So no its not the truth, even if it was you shouldnt be censored, but fuck me, way to play into Hillary's hands. She'll use homophobia as her defence of pizzagate - just you watch: 'pizzagate is a delusion of trump suppoters so homophobic they cant tell between decent gay people and pedophiles'   Dont give her that ammunition.
Divide and conquer. Remember it. Dont let it inside you.

             I understand where you are coming from but I really don't think that the majority of the glbt community supports the abuse of children. Polygamist have proven to have higher instances of pedophilia/ arranged child marriage than the glbt community. I still support polygamy between consenting adults.

            Not only do we need the media savvy of the gay community, they need us too. As this becomes bigger there are going to be thousands of homophobes arguing that homosexuality is a gateway to pedophilia, as if there's no such thing as a healthy adult consensual gay relationship. So the gay community are going to need to demonstrate they vigorously distance themselves from the gay sub-culture Alefantis seems to be part of

              Understand, if pizzagate gets the momentum it deserves, it will destroy the Left for 50-100 years. As the left is providing unwitting cover for the Clintons, they deserve it. But the ugly truth is, the Humanist baby will be thrown out with the Politically Correct bathwater. There will be a return to Victorian era conservatism and prudishness. If thats what is required to destroy this depraved, demonic network then it is warranted - its just, we know history's pendulum, it'll swing too far back, and you and i will lose many liberties that will come to be regarded as a 'pathway to depravity'

             Thank you for your reply. Can you help me assemble credible links and sources of the above points I posted. I'm active on a Britney Spears forum. I would like to start a thread in their general section. We can also ask Zachary Cambell (popular gay youtuber in college, not in the Hollywood fold) to do a reaction video on Pizzagate in the comments of his other videos.He does reaction videos to pop performances, videos etc, but he did do a reaction video to the election. Kinsley is also another popular Youtuber, but he may already be too in the Hollywood fold. We both really need this collaboration!

              I think maybe you introduce the link with an honest teaser, something like 'Hillary may become massive threat and liability to the LGBT community. Please spread the word about Pizzagate, please distance the decent LGBT community from these creatures. Please follow the evidence closely and understand its implications. Child protection advocates need to know we stand behind them, not in front of them. Do not dismiss, devote your attention. And please be aware, this material is a trigger warning for anyone and everyone who is a decent human being''
