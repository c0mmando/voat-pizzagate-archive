<p>First, we\'ll go over Kevin Jennings who is the founder of GLSEN, which is still used in classrooms today. Have you heard of &quot;The Day of Silence&quot;? From what I can tell it originated from GLSEN.</p>
<p>This is his profile on <a href="http://archive.is/Kd9tl">wikipedia</a> </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, he was appointed by Obama in 2009 as Assistant Deputy Secretary of Education. He apparently <a href="http://archive.is/AFY0H">promoted CP in the class room.</a></p>
<p>His reason for leaving his position was apparently because he was going to work for a non-profit called \'Be The Change\'... Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>He\'s a writer for the infamous <a href="http://archive.is/OFM1H">Huffington Post</a></p>

<p>From Smear: Kevin Jennings Praised A Member Of NAMBLA:
The conservative smear machine, still attempting to damage progressives by drawing shady guilt-by-association connections, is trying to link Kevin Jennings, the head of the Department of Education\'s Office of Safe &amp; Drug Free Schools, to the North American Man-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA). It\'s no surprise that upon examining the facts, no such connection exists.</p>
<p>Smear: Kevin Jennings Praised A Member Of NAMBLA TRUTH Harry Hay Was NEVER A Member Of NAMBLA</p>
<p>One wonders how Media Matters obtained this information, as NAMBLA, understandably, doesn\'t make its membership publicly available.

<blockquote>
<p>Hay’s influence is relevant not only because Jennings is a top Education Department official, but because Hay is considered by homosexuals to be the founder of their movement. A Stalinist and Marxist until the day he died, Hay defended NAMBLA’s participation in “gay rights” marches and its membership in the International Lesbian and Gay Association.</p>
<p>But the controversy over Jennings, which had been growing since his appointment in May, has been skillfully deflected by some journalists and commentators who have been attacking the government of Uganda for considering a law that would toughen laws against homosexual behavior that threatens public health and children. “Uganda wants to execute people for being gay,” lesbian commentator Rachel Maddow asserted on her MSNBC program on December 2. She called it the “kill-the-gays bill” and demanded that Christians in the U.S. denounce it.</p>
<p>Jumping on the story, the New York Times has claimed the bill would “impose a death sentence for homosexual behavior.”
These claims are flat-out disinformation.</p>
<p>Dr. Scott Lively, who visited Uganda in March of 2009 to encourage efforts to protect traditional family values, says the proposed death penalty in the bill, just one of many provisions, is for “aggravated homosexuality,” which is actually pederasty, pedophilia, homosexual parent/child incest, homosexual abuse of a disabled ward, and knowingly spreading AIDS. Dr. Lively is the author of The Pink Swastika and the president of Abiding Truth Ministries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a document entitled, “Developing LGBT-Inclusive Classroom Resources,” teachers are encouraged to use the new Common Core curriculum as a means of teaching about LGBT issues in every subject, at every grade level, from K-12. So if you are teaching second grade math or fourth grade geography, you as a teacher are supposed to figure out how to teach, at taxpayer’s expense, how important LGBT issues are to that subject and every other sphere of existence. Allow me to quote from that document:
Implementation of the Common Core State Standards is one way that many states and school districts are making efforts to ensure quality education for all students. The examples below demonstrate how an examination of the standards and themes can lead to locating opportunities for the natural inclusion of LGBT-related content in English Language Arts and Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects, and Mathematics.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Ready, Set, Respect! GLSEN’s Elementary School Toolkit” introduction:</p>
<p>[E]lementary school children are bombarded every day with messages about different groups of people in our society, many of which portray these groups in a negative, socially undesirable way. Those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) are often among these groups. In addition to influencing attitudes, the messages children receive about these people also influences (sic) how they will make sense of gender and inform how they think about their own identity… without intentional guidance, the messages children receive about groups of people, as well as various identities and gender roles can complicate this process and contribute to bullying, prejudice and bias.</p>
<p>While most elementary educators have embraced this work and construct and conduct lessons focused on diversity, recent research suggests that intentional efforts to include explicit lessons that foster respect for differences in gender identity or gender expression or that include families with LGBT parents/caregiver, siblings, or other individuals significant in our student’s lives, are less frequent. As a result, many students go through their elementary school years without positive mentions of families that include LGBT persons or friends or people who may be gender non-conforming.</p>
<p>The elementary school years offer a wonderful and important opportunity to instill and/or nurture positive attitudes and respect for individual, family and cultural differences, including diversity related to sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
More specific instructions include the following:</p>
<p>Make sure the analogies you use when teaching don’t rely on hetero-normative or gender-normative images or viewpoints. A hetero-normative viewpoint is one that expresses heterosexuality as a given instead of being one of many possibilities. Such a viewpoint can translate into the development of all kinds of images that reinforce the view. The assumption (reinforced by imagery and practice) that a boy will grow up and marry a woman is based on such a viewpoint. A gender-normative image, on the other hand is one that delimits the possibilities for children of either gender by reinforcing stereotyped expectations.</p>
<p><strong>~</strong> Find ways of grouping and lining up students other than “boys here, girls there” or “boys do this, girls do that.” While some students may enjoy these ways of separating the class, they can isolate other students who may feel uncomfortable conforming to gender-based stereotypes.</p>
<p><strong>~</strong> Monitor choice activity time to ensure that students are not segregating themselves by gender.</p>
<p><strong>~</strong> Become more aware of the ways that you support gender stereotypes in your expectations of students and their work and intervene when you hear students making genderbased assumptions.
<strong>~</strong> Write math problems with contexts that include a variety of family structures and gender-expressions. For example, “Rosa and her dads were at the store and wanted to buy three boxes of pasta. If each costs $.75, how much will all three boxes cost?”

            [E]lementary school children are bombarded every day with messages about different groups of people in our society, many of which portray these groups in a negative, socially undesirable way. Those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) are often among these groups. In addition to influencing attitudes, the messages children receive about these people also influences (sic) how they will make sense of gender and inform how they think about their own identity… without intentional guidance, the messages children receive about groups of people, as well as various identities and gender roles can complicate this process and contribute to bullying, prejudice and bias.
           </p>
           <p>
            While most elementary educators have embraced this work and construct and conduct lessons focused on diversity, recent research suggests that intentional efforts to include explicit lessons that foster respect for differences in gender identity or gender expression or that include families with LGBT parents/caregiver, siblings, or other individuals significant in our student’s lives, are less frequent. As a result, many students go through their elementary school years without positive mentions of families that include LGBT persons or friends or people who may be gender non-conforming.
           </p>
           <p>
            The elementary school years offer a wonderful and important opportunity to instill and/or nurture positive attitudes and respect for individual, family and cultural differences, including diversity related to sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
More specific instructions include the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            Make sure the analogies you use when teaching don’t rely on hetero-normative or gender-normative images or viewpoints. A hetero-normative viewpoint is one that expresses heterosexuality as a given instead of being one of many possibilities. Such a viewpoint can translate into the development of all kinds of images that reinforce the view. The assumption (reinforced by imagery and practice) that a boy will grow up and marry a woman is based on such a viewpoint. A gender-normative image, on the other hand is one that delimits the possibilities for children of either gender by reinforcing stereotyped expectations.

            </strong>
            Find ways of grouping and lining up students other than “boys here, girls there” or “boys do this, girls do that.” While some students may enjoy these ways of separating the class, they can isolate other students who may feel uncomfortable conforming to gender-based stereotypes.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             ~
            </strong>
            Monitor choice activity time to ensure that students are not segregating themselves by gender.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             ~
            </strong>
            Become more aware of the ways that you support gender stereotypes in your expectations of students and their work and intervene when you hear students making genderbased assumptions.
            <strong>
             ~
            </strong>
            Write math problems with contexts that include a variety of family structures and gender-expressions. For example, “Rosa and her dads were at the store and wanted to buy three boxes of pasta. If each costs $.75, how much will all three boxes cost?”

             BREAKING: Obama ‘Safe Schools’ Chief Kevin Jennings Used Pro-Pedophile, pro-NAMBLA Publisher for First Three Books
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Jennings is already under fire for praising his hero, early homosexual activist Harry Hay, despite Hay’s longtime,  dedicated support of NAMBLA — the North American Man/Boy Love Association, which advocates for sex between men and boys. (Jennings’ praise of Hay was first reported by AFTAH’s Lambda Report in 1998 based on a GLSEN conference where Jennings spoke the previous year.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Moreover, many have questioned Jennings’ judgment — as a private high school teacher — for failing to report to authorities an apparent seduction by an adult man of one of his sophomore students. In his book, Jennings describes using the situation to confirm the student, Brewster, as “gay.”
            </p>
            <p>
             These three books by Jennings were published by the now-defunct Alyson Publications:
            </p>
            <p>
             Becoming Visible: A Reader in Gay and Lesbian History for High School and College Students (1994); and
            </p>
            <p>
             One Teacher in Ten: Gay and Lesbian Educators Tell Their Stories (1994)
            </p>
            <p>
             Telling Tales Out of School (2000)
            </p>
            <p>
             Below is a reproduction of Americans For Truth’s debut press release, issued in 1993, highlighting Alyson’s pro-pederasty connections. This release was the debut edition of “Lambda Report,” a newsletter monitoring the “gay” activist movement that actually preceded AFTAH.
Kevin Jennings, founder of the Gay, Lesbian, Straight Education Network (GLSEN) — and a one-time activist with the homosexual extremist group ACT UP — is a man of words, who has devoted his life to promoting his version of “human rights” to students. So why did he choose to publish his first two books with a company that was pedophile- and NAMBLA-friendly?

             It is curious why White House officials and Education Secretary Arne Duncan believe it’s worth it politically to continue taking arrows for defending Kevin Jennings, who is Mr. Obama’s controversial “safe schools czar.” The evidence suggesting he is unfit to serve as a senior presidential appointee is startling and plentiful. It was revealed this week that Mr. Jennings was involved in promoting a reading list for children 13 years old or older that made the most explicit sex between children and adults seem normal and acceptable. This brought up anew Mr. Jennings’ past controversies, such as his seeming encouragement of sex between one of his high school students and a much older man as well as his praise for Harry Hay, a notorious supporter of the North American Man Boy Love Association.

             But there is more. There are shocking new revelations this week of tape recordings from a youth conference involving 14-year-old students. The conference, billed as a forum to encourage tolerance of homosexuality, was sponsored by Mr. Jennings’ organization and was held at Tufts University in March 2000. Mr. Jennings was executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) from its founding in 1995 until August 2008. The conference sessions appear to have had less to do with promoting tolerance and more to do with teaching children how to engage in sex.

             This is the CREEPY dude who wrote the foreword to the book “QUEERING ELEMENTARY EDUCATION”.

            <p>
             I wrote about this slimy pedophile Oct 5, in WordPress. He’s a who’s who of the assault against our children and parental authority. He’s all about advancing a pernicious ideology against the most powerless in our society. Listening to those who support this person gives serious doubt as to the Obama administration’s ability to govern. So far it rhymes with ineptitude.
            </p>
            <p>
             That some of the key people around Obama  and his lapdogs in the fringe-stream press would circle the wagons around Jennings says worlds about who they are.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sean Hannity interviewed George ‘Boy’ Stephanopoulos…(the”Your Christian Faith” Stephanopoulos?) on Fox News last night and Georgie covered himself with glory (or something), again saying among other things that Jennings had a “distinguished career” and then parsing answers and  pleading ignorance to every fact that Hannity threw at him. He’s a prime example of why the main stream media is rapidly becoming the has-been it so richly deserves to be.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then there’s Valerie Jarret, who has done Obama no favors since becoming a Senior Adviser to His Majesty. She is largely responsible for gathering the gaggle of Marxist incompetents that surround Obama. The glorious leader certainly is covering himself with magnificence…at least in his own eyes.

             Memo to Kevin Jennings: Your reputation is on the line
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I’m talking about the revelation that in a speech you gave in 1997, you praised gay rights icon Harry Hay and claimed you were “inspired” by him.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to various blogs and smaller news outlets, when you addressed the GLSEN Mid-Atlantic Conference on October 25, 1997 in New York, as reported in the January-February 1998 edition of the Lambda Journal, you said:
            </p>
            <p>
             “One of the people that’s always inspired me is Harry Hay, who started the first ongoing gay rights groups in America. In 1948, he tried to get people to join the Mattachine Society. It took him two years to find one other person who would join. Well, [in] 1993, Harry Hay marched with a million people in Washington, who thought he had a good idea 40 years before. Everybody thought Harry Hay was crazy in 1948, and they knew something about him which he apparently did not—they were right, he was crazy. You are all crazy. We are all crazy. All of us who are thinking this way are crazy, because you know what? Sane people keep the world the same [shitty] old way it is now. It’s the people who think, ‘No, I can envision a day when straight people say, “So what if you’re promoting homosexuality?”‘ Or straight kids say, ‘Hey, why don’t you and your boyfriend come over before you go to the prom and try on your tuxes on at my house?’ That if we believe that can happen, we can make it happen. The only thing that will stop us is our lack of faith that we can make it happen. That is our mission from this day forward. To not lose our faith, to not lose our belief that the world can, indeed, be a different place. And think how much can change in one lifetime if in Harry Hay’s one very short life, he saw change from not even one person willing to join him to a million people willing to travel to Washington to join him.“
            </p>
            <p>
             So — what’s the problem? The problem is that Harry Hay, despite whatever else he did in his life, was deeply involved with NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Love Association — a group which advocates for legalization of sexual relations between adult men and underage boys. In other words, it’s a pro-pedophilia group.
            </p>
            <p>
             How deeply was Harry Hay involved with NAMBLA? As I discovered: very deeply. Much deeper than almost anyone seems willing to admit. He gave keynote speeches and led panel discussions at several NAMBLA conferences. He openly told stories about how wonderful his own experiences were as a young teenager having sex with adult men. He encouraged the gay rights movement to not exclude NAMBLA from the united front of rights for all sexual minorities. And that 1993 march you recalled in your 1997 speech in which Harry Hay was joined by one million other protesters? Well, just one year later, in 1994 — just three years before you gave your speech — Harry Hay marched in the Stonewall 25 parade in front of the NAMBLA banner, for the stated purpose of bringing NAMBLA into the mainstream of the gay rights movement. Now, obviously NAMBLA doesn’t publish lists of its members, so we have no way of ever knowing for sure, but from all the evidence I’ve learned (presented below on this page), I wouldn’t be surprised if Harry Hay was at some point somehow affiliated with NAMBLA.
            </p>
            <p>
             How could you not know any of this? What were you thinking when you praised Hay in public? Aren’t you by your own self-description an expert in the history of the gay rights movement? How else would you know the obscure details of Harry Hay’s activist career, which you mentioned in your speech? I’m no expert myself, but Harry Hay’s proclivities were quite well-known, and the photos, links and quotes presented below were uncovered after a mere 30 minutes of searching.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, I know that many mainstream media outlets showered praise on Harry Hay in their obituaries about him when he died in 2002. And nary a mention of his NAMBLA activities was made at the time. But as a prominent gay rights activist yourself, and as a fan of Harry Hay’s early activism, weren’t you of all people the kind of person who should have known of Harry Hay’s unsavory later affiliations? Just because his NAMBLA connection was swept under the rug for a mainstream audience, doesn’t mean it would stay hidden forever.

GLSEN's leadership does not have a clue what they are doing; the organization undergoes constant restructurings and the newer staff that get hired are completely incompetent and unprofessional, make unprofessional comments with racist undertones and are degrading to lower level staff. The organization constantly argues that they are interested in lower level staff opinions, but during these planning sessions, the same things are repeated over and over again and nothing comes of it. Majority of the staff are rude and disrespectful. Several of the "Chiefs" make belittling and demeaning comments. GLSEN is a very stressful place to work and has been emotionally damaging on numerous occasions. Many staff have said this in their exit interviews and the executive team has made no efforts to alleviate these problems. Sadly, with an organization that preaches respect for all, GLSEN does not even have respect for its own staff.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cons
This organization does not help LGBTQ communities of color. Research that the agency executes is not reviewed by a third party. The Development team is "led" by an individual that cares more about traveling around the nation than making a difference. When approached by this agency make sure to ask what have they done to directly improve the lives of students. Also, check out their digs, it is pretty posh for a non-profit, "struggling to keep the lights on".

I would urge the board to get rid of the Executive Director and the Chief Development Officer.
