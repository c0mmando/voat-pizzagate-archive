<p>Synopsis: Over the course of the past couple weeks, I have systematically been researching suspicious accounts on Voat.

I honestly can\'t remember how this rabbit hole began, but where it ended up taking me was not only incredibly disturbing but extremely fucked up. I believe I was looking at an Instagram account with the same username as a notorious SJW Reddit mod. The account had no posts but 300+ followers. It was very unusual, so I clicked it\'s followers and that\'s where shit just instantly became very uncomfortable. Once again, I want to reiterate that I am not posting anything illegal nor am I posting direct links, only screenshots.</p>
<p>This was the first account that I saw on Instagram asking for nude pictures of young boys and girls. I blurred out the faces of the kids on the post as well as the profile picture because the profile picture is literally a totally naked, underage girl. You cant see anything but the username -  <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/XPG8l0Z.jpg">https://i.imgtc.com/XPG8l0Z.jpg</a></p>
<p>From there, I decided to see what kind of people were following this account.</p>
<p>I find this account - <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/HyHzjUq.jpg">https://i.imgtc.com/HyHzjUq.jpg</a></p>
<p>You can see that the same person who has the spermbird.5 account also has one called spermbird.8</p>
<p>Then Instagram \'suggested\' a very disturbing profile that IS LITERALLY ASKING TO TRADE &quot;KID CLIPS&quot; - <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/HMexT4t.jpg">https://i.imgtc.com/HMexT4t.jpg</a></p>
<p>That account leads to this account. An account of a girl who looks no older then 7 showing provacative pictures. She has maybe 7 posts and over 1,500 followers... what the fuck? -  <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/AWr7DX1.jpg">https://i.imgtc.com/AWr7DX1.jpg</a></p>
<p>That account then leads me to one of a girl no older then 7 dressed up in fish net stockings. This one made me almost puke. I blurred everything out so you cant see anything but the account name -  <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/jw71vfu.jpg">https://i.imgtc.com/jw71vfu.jpg</a></p>
<p>And guess what? That one lead me to this profile of a &quot;wittle girl&quot; asking for DMs -  <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/2tTESbZ.jpg">https://i.imgtc.com/2tTESbZ.jpg</a></p>
<p>............. I mean there literally hundreds upon THOUSANDS of these accounts. Asking for nude pictures of underage children. Asking to swap pictures. Accounts of children clearly ran by an adult, selling pictures of kids. Please please please report these profiles to the FBI. PLEASE.</p>

           Then Instagram 'suggested' a very disturbing profile that IS LITERALLY ASKING TO TRADE "KID CLIPS" -

           That account then leads me to one of a girl no older then 7 dressed up in fish net stockings. This one made me almost puke. I blurred everything out so you cant see anything but the account name -

           And guess what? That one lead me to this profile of a "wittle girl" asking for DMs -

            Hi there LGH. Thanks for posting your findings. I have a couple of questions. Your headline says you were investigating Voat accounts. Your submission says you were investigating suspicious Voat accounts you think are Reddit mods, which you connected to a pedophile ring on Instagram. These grave assertions are made in a very vague way, and you provide no links whatsoever to support them. My concern is this is a common smear technique that relies on innuendo and confirmation bias which we have seen deployed here thousands of times, which is why our #2 submission rule is:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             2: Empiricism: EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link. If you ask a question: Explain what led to your question and provide sources. If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them. Avoid baseless speculation. ALL posts must include at least one link.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You need to edit this thread to provide the support for these claims, or repost it with a headline and text that does not make unsupported assertions (since headlines cannot be edited after the first 10 minutes).  I will give you the 24 Hour Grace flair so you can add the missing information. Otherwise, please self-delete and repost sans the unsupported claims. Thanks!
           </p>

              Thank you. No one wants to censor this. It just needs to fit within our submission rules. I can't arbitrarily leave up a post that ignores the submission rules.

             Because it's not time to publish my findings yet. I'm not finished and if I were to publish everything now it would only hinder the rest of what I'm doing. It's like a detective trying to solve a murder case. They have to build up as much possible proof so the criminal can be punished without a reasonable doubt.  Same concept applies for what I am doing.
            </p>
            <p>
             This just happened to be some tangent discovery I made while conducting my main one. I simply mentioned that while I was researching into some Reddit mods who have accounts here, I stumbled upon this rabbit hole.

             Feel free to remove the post at your will. This has nothing to do with my main research so removing this doesn't affect me whatsoever but does a disservice to the community here who should know about these obvious pedos I found. Whether you remove this or not, my main investigation will continue.

              I understand completely. So, why even bring up the stuff that isn't ready for the public? Why not just make a post on the fact that Instagram is allowing a pedo ring to flourish? That is certainly relevant to pizzagate and worthy of a submission. We've had many like that about Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Instagram.

            All of us noticed early on there was a group of imbeciles and degenerates on the different subforums of VOAT for a very long time it's bout time someone said as much. I wonder how these mods can be conscionable knowing these other parts of VOAT exist and understand that this material hosted on this site puts ALL of our work at jeopardy. Well, even if this fucking site is based on GOATS so that's a horrible look as it is anyway. Good to see someone pointing out these lechers.

             is not talking about stuff he found on Voat. He's talking about stuff he found on Instagram when he was researching a moderator on Reddit. Voat doesn't allow photos of naked kids anywhere, and goats who see it report it and Putt removes it.

              oh ok, now that I think of it I did read it that way but was conflating it with earlier investigations that did uncover attempts to create subdomains with CP and posing children on them. Excuse my mistake.

               Yeah, due to hosting our sub, Voat was targeted by pedos on a number of occasions. We were also targeted, but the spam attacks were all cartoon CP so Putt couldn't ban the IPs for violating Voat's terms of service (it's legal content). I banned the accounts from
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
                v/pizzagate
               </a>
               , and after a while they got tired and stopped spamming that shit. It involved several all-nighters deleting it, though. I think they had bots running it automatically. Putt made changes to the codebase that make it a lot harder for bots to spam and we haven't had a problem with it in a while.

            This big business on the dark web. Lots of sick people there. The DS depends on you being ignorant, by assuming this is so horrible it can't be true. Yet similar reports for decades say the same thing: It's still going on.

             </a>
             … Please help. Someone close to me may be connected to the disappearance and murder of countless children; most of them refugees or otherwise disadvantaged – all untraceable.
            </p>
            <p>
             All forgettable. And now, all dead. He told me about a drug called adrenochrome that could produce a high beyond any other. And unlike those other drugs, there are no ill effects. Quite the contrary; there are substantial benefits from consuming it: greater health, increased vivacity, and a host of other, smaller effects. Combine those with an intense sense of euphoria and you have a substantial demand. The issue is this: it is a derivative of the chemicals produced by the human body when it is under intense, immeasurable fear. My former friend, who confessed his involvement during a fleeting crisis of conscience, insisted this was true and cited a number of dubious-looking studies and fake news sites. But then there were the photos. He didn’t allow me to make copies for fear of implicating himself personally, but
he’d been to a “farm,” he called it, in one of the Baltic states.
            </p>
            <p>
             There were photos of countless people, all seemingly under the age of 15. They were naked and chained to tables and walls and floors in a windowless room the size of a football stadium. I couldn’t estimate how many there were. As he scrolled through the photographs and I debated killing him, I saw masked men hovering over the victims and torturing them. As they were being tortured, their blood was being drained into containers. Other photos showed the production facilities – enormous rooms that looked like chemistry labs where the blood was filtered and the compounds were extracted.
            </p>
            <p>
             The worst, though, were the mass graves. Men stood around them and laughed as they unloaded truckloads of carcasses into pits. They used pitchforks to gather up anyone
who had been left behind. I asked him why he was allowed to take these pictures. He said no one would believe it was happening. And he’s been right. Rumors about facilities like this have been around for decades. Journalists have tried to report on it, only to be laughed out of their editors’ offices. One journalist, a Swede, came the closest to bringing it into the mainstream. He died, along with his family, in a hideous house fire.
            </p>
            <p>
             Listen to me: the pictures I saw were not faked. They were not staged. They were, without any doubt, real. And
there’s one more thing. One more picture. Believe it if you want, I don’t care. I need to get this off my chest. There was an image of adrenochrome users. I don’t know what I expected. Well, I guess I do: strung out, gaunt, miserable-looking addicts with despair and desperation in their eyes. It’s what we’ve all associated with drug users thanks to h****n and crack and whatnot. This was different. The image was of a lavish conference room in a skyscraper. Where, I could not determine. Syringes of the drug were sitting on gilded plates
on a thick table of polished wood. I recognized the faces sitting around that table. World leaders. Entertainers. Religious icons. All grinning. All happy. All ready for their injection. Seeing those familiar faces was the initial shock. It wasn’t the final one.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the 
far side of the table, almost too small to be seen but still unmistakable, was an iconic head of state. A recent one. He was laughing as he reached for his syringe, but there was something unusual about his hand. It wasn’t its normal, small, pink self. It was green. It was webbed. It was clawed. It was reptilian.

             This is not going to comfort you in any way, but most of these poor children are from 'breeders', women who have multiple children just to be used for whatever purpose the cult requires. They have no identities or SS#s in this world. I only make this point because it can be easy to assume that the reported missing children account for all the abused and tortured kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             Remember the kids found in the playground? They were being transported by the Finders to Mexico. They didn't even know how to use a bathroom, or what phones were for, and were supposedly gifted children? I think that is the closest these scum ever were to being exposed.

            First, great find! Second, this stuff needs to be reported to MULTIPLE agencies BEFORE posting the evidence to Voat - especially this sub.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was doing some research yesterday and found this
            <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/indiana-serial-killers-victims-still-unknown-long-after-his-death/">
             article
            </a>
            interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            As it's not a good idea to report just to the FBI since we know their past track record,
            <a href="https://www.namus.gov/">
             NamUs
            </a>
            could possibly be another good option to report to because while they are a government agency, they utilize volunteers from all over in multiple sectors to solve cold cases and find missing people.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             More than 10,000 bodies remain unidentified in the United States, and the FBI estimates some 80,000 people populate the ranks of the reported missing. Details about them are contained in a growing but voluntary database called the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs, housed at the Center for Human Identification in Fort Worth, Texas.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Back to the article, I find it suspicious that so few coroners were interested in getting involved with NamUs. I understand that they have a busy job, but their reluctance to participate in the system when it could lead to solving cold cases and reunite families reminded me of what the creepy coroner of Sandy Hook.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             “Every time I go to our state coroners’ conference, I’m pushing the other coroners to get their cases into (NamUs),” McCord said. “The major complaint that I get is, ‘We just don’t have time.’ I have even offered some of the smaller counties that … ‘I’ll come do it for you.’ ”
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the article, NamUs is making strides.
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             Of the 43 cases entered into NamUs from Indiana, 18 were labeled homicides as of June. Officials have not determined the manner of death or it is not listed for another 21 cases, according to an analysis of NamUs data obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            If things such as what you found are reported to as many agencies as you can think of, it's going to be difficult for the bad guys to bury the situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to remember that not everyone at these agencies is corrupt. There are still Ted Gundersons in the world and we need to have faith. But for the love of God, please stop posting obvious concrete evidence on

                I think its the mods, they are overly cautious "for the integrity of the investigation". if it links to CP I wouldnt want it and no one should have to see it, so I have some sympathy . What bugs me is that there isnt any really good way on the web in general to report it to get it removed and investigated. Mods of sites like this arnt really equipped to deal with it as a delete/remove button just hides the problem from view just like so many of the victims are.

                the global rule, basically = no pedo shit, theres even darknet boards that call it that. I mean fuck even in prison there arnt many pedos, but for some reason some places have felt they needed to point out that pedo shit is not ok.

                4chan -
Anyway all ive got is 2nd and 3rd hand information of what happened with 4chan theres probably a few voaters that know more about what actually went down, I only had access to public computers at the time it happened but was kept in the loop through friends and so I cant speak directly to what happened but basically pedos showed up on 4chan and b/ the board of random (Long live boxxy lol), found out and thought "fuck that for a game of soldiers nothing is beyond our reach", but the ovens take time to heat up so lets get out ze flammenwerfers, which should have worked but the pedos seemed to resist the bombardment of brigading from 4chan and surprisingly fought back by flooding b/ at the least, with CP. I heard there was hacking involved, I heard that people even destroyed/burned their own computers, got scarred or life oh and that 4chan DDOSed itself for a while so no one would have to see it, but like I said its all 2nd and 3rd hand info. But some of the stuff that went down scared the shit out of some coders leagues ahead of me. The theories ive heard range from a war between boards (which i doubt) to Israel flexing their payots cos "muh antisemitism". Im inclined to believe the latter. JD!F, trying to discredit and destroy the zionist truthers with their photo albums. But who knows.

            25 years ago i ran into pedo porn and they actually sent it to my email. I got really pissed told my wife and then i called the wonderful FBI who guess what were not interested! The first thing he said was so? I said so? Don't you think underage kids forced to have sex is against the law? He then said what do you want me to do? I said oh i don't know i thought this sortof was against the law and you are the FBI YOU KNOW? Then he said file a complaint at this website he gave me and i ended the call with i just did file a complaint and hung up. Guess what happened next? I started receiving magazines of child porn with no return address on them every month for several months and it only stopped when i went to a postal carrier and asked the lady how can i stop this from coming to my house when it has no return address knowing all the time the FUCKING FBI sent it. Trump needs to shut these assholes down!

             I stumbled across some pictures of a little girl about 6 or 7 wearing lingerie in disturbingly provocative poses on imgoat about 6 months ago while looking for conspiracy theory shit. I submitted the url to the FBI, called plus emailed url to the center for missing &amp; exploited children who suggested I should call my local police which of course I did. Nothing was done, minimal interest &amp; no follow-up from anyone. No one gave a shit

              It is for real alright and i think your assumption is correct for i wrote a letter of support for a young kid accused of molesting a small boy he babysat for and i believed he was being set up and i told them he was a good kid who has been around my boys a lot and never was like that and he even went to Karate with my kids and over my house a lot. They railroaded this kid and did not appreciate my letter of support. It was shortly after that i started getting the emails.

            Report it. If it remains active, then it's probably sting accounts to entrap pedos.

            Seems fucking strange that it'd be out in the open on IG like that, though, which makes me think it's a honeypot to attract degenerates.

             It might be a honeypot, but considering how openly pedos post on YT, have Facebook groups etc., it's more likely that Instagram just doesn't give a shit.

            You don't need multiple people to report things to the FBI.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've busted various rings with single anonymous reports, including a pedophile group.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no reason for you to be asking other people to report things for you.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they don't take action within 2 weeks, you're likely seeing a honeypot. If it doesn't disappear on its own within 6 months, that's when you need to get other people to take action.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedophiles are extremely brazen in the USA due to corruption by local law enforcement, in those cases, or cases where it is online, the FBI needs to handle it. You should always report things anonymously, VPNs, in either case. You don't want to have corrupt local cops framing you before you have a chance to get the Feds in. If all else fails, tell your community. Even criminal gangs have a certain sense of justice when it comes to certain things. Find the most dangerous bar in your state and start complaining about pedophiles, when you find someone that shares your hatred, tell them all the details. Don't tell them what to do, and don't let them tell you what they will do.

             Err....you realize that it is criminal gangs that do the dirty work for people higher up? Also, many gangs make money from forced prostitution, and even child pornography.

             MS 13 even is satanic. Not a very good idea to get involved with them.

             Re the FBI: It totally makes sense when as many people as possible report this stuff. Then they realize that it will look bad when they don't take sites down. (Not that it always works, but people should at least try.)

              Most of the people working for the FBI are diligent and loyal to the USA, but the structure of the FBI allows for corruption and foreign infltration.
             </p>
             <p>
              The FBI informant system for instance, designed to limit infiltrator access to informant information to avoid killing informants and sabotaging investigations also allows Israel to get the USA to pay for their operations in the USA by getting Israeli operatives in the FBI to select Jewish informants working for Israel to manipulate US politics.

             The FBI bust regular folks if they are traficking or distrubiting pedophile material, but they have their own opperations with the CIA, their job is to take investigations out of the police hands if the other spook agencies get exposed, and quash the investigation. That is the game. So it may or may not be a honeypot, they may just be protecting the systems crimes. Hard to tell. Their inaction can mean more than one thing.

              All one has to do to protect oneself from statutues and charges except when charge is placed under common law universal jurosdiction ..is to reduce debt at the treasury..
Statutues only apply to US debtors...ie the social security name...that we r surety to (do u stand under the charges ..the military court banker asks u )
             </p>
             <p>
              When one reduces debt that is one advantwge ...the police cannot place charges on u based on those billions of statutes...since the US is made ur debtor ..
Constitutor means someone who shifts debt onto the surety party to the natinoal debt..
             </p>
             <p>
              Another advantage is u can directly operate the US miliatry corporatio. To conduct military tribunals under universal jurisdiction..all charges payable towards the debt reductionn of the US treasury
             </p>
             <p>
              We r leaving neverland ..the law of the sea and its licenced pirate corporation and licenced pirates..

               Have you actually free’d yourself from the debt system? Did you actually get all your debt wiped away ? I am really curious because I’ve seen you post about this stuff for months now .

Its not about wiping anyones debt ...
There is no debt ...
The whole payment system is based on insurance and we r the sureties of it
All u do is to place urself as surety to the peace game by reducing risk at the US treasury...one can do that from anywhere in the planet ...with any currency..i ahve confirmation by email from the US treasury itself..
It is no different than using ur estates ie the names credit to increase debt ie risk and inflation at the war game and its record keeper...
U can use debt owed to u to create hell or heaven...
..
It is available to even a beggar in the streets of phillipines or some african village..they all have access to the US treasury...
..the bankers know this is a merchant banking system that runs the roman war game...and have givennus the solution in their movies like the wizard of oz..
Dorothy always had the solution to her.to escape ..but her destiny before she escaped was to kill the wicked witch ie the debt system..
How did she kill the wicked witch?
As the wizard if oz expalined to her ...she liquidate te witch..
               </p>
               <p>
                I and a few others know this is the solution ..
We r waiting for the gremlins to show their faces..
...art of sun tzu..
Let the enemy be at its strongest...the world has to see what evil it has funded..
Lucifer must reach his summit...
I personally am out of the system...i am.in the process of charging a local hoodlum , all charges payable to the US treasury debt reduction department..all under universal jurisdiction..
His connections in the police cant touch me...i am out of statute law..which delas only with sureties of the debt system...i am surrty to the US and out of the debt system...all it took was a few local currency..what i earn is now not mine ...vanishes into thin air at the US treasury.
 Its not about reducing debt or increasing it...its about which hame u want to fund..
Peace or war
If u wwnt to fund ceasars war..the statutues imclding tax  code will ensure that u volunteer to pay Ceasar..
Incomr Tax is voluntary ..u can confirm that with ur local tax commissioner..
               </p>
               <p>
                Pay Ceasars what is Ceasars and his war ..
               </p>
               <p>
                Pay God ehat is Gods..
And they will stand by their contract...ie the birth certifcate...Rome is gods accountant ..as well as war accountant..
We choose and its our instructions that fund the war game

She doesnt see the simple solution though...becuase she doesnt see the world as an accounting system funded by our birth trusts ..ie our consent to fund the fuctional war game ..

               <p>
                Its not in any onee video..
I have yet to see one explaining thr legal defintion if the word name...
The videos about birth certificates actually are the exact opposoite of what is the truth...
Google : what is namium
Ur certificate prooves that the system is bonded to u and not the otherway round...
U volunteer to use the value of the birth trrust and lend it to the banking system..
               </p>
               <p>
                The closest i got to understanding the birth trust is 
Utube : martial law reversionary interest
But his solution is wrong..and convoluted..and lot of papaer work...
Once u understand u r the surety to the payment system..all one has to do is decide which game u want to insure...the peace game ..ie reduce debt...or use ur energy to increase debt ie..u fund the war..and u war againsf ur own estate..
..
The solution is given to us in the movie wizard of oz..
Like dorothy we had to go through the journey ..we had this solution all along..
We have to liquidate the witch...ie the merchant banking system that provides the fuel for the fictional war game and jurisdictiin...via us lending that fuel as deposits...
We depositoon and re,side ourselves into the war game and its insuraance policy known as constitutions and statutues..

            This is not the first I've heard of these sorts of things. I don't doubt it, but dear god this is so blatant it almost makes me wonder if its the Feds themselves with a honeypot or whatever they call it.

             Not after the PlayPen fiasco. The FBI kept a cporn site running for a week to catch people and most of those cases have been throw out (especially since the FBI refused to disclose what TOR browser vulnerability they exploited, so no one knows if it's even been patched or not).
            </p>
            <p>
             Keeping an existing site running got them into trouble and creating sites could be argued as entrapment. It's unlikely any of these sites are run by the FBI.

              Hard to believe the FBI didn't know they were destroying the cases of thousands of pedophiles they 'entrapped'?!
/wont someone think of the poor pedo's? Their poor rights! They forgot to punctuate the MiRANDA?
             </p>
             <p>
              RIDICULOUS.
             </p>
             <p>
              WTF.   They arrested them and violated their rights: Sorry, have to let them all go. 
now they have how many pedos under their thumb?  Or they covered up for their clients?
             </p>
             <p>
              It's a big control mechanism besides being a criminal mental illness/ perversion.

              Of course. I'll start believing the FBI cares about laws the moment Hillary is behind bars. They care that they got caught and nothing more.

             the spirmbird.5 and spirmbird.8 accounts both share the same image of a totally naked and underage girl being held in the air. I really hope its not the feds because if it is, that's really disturbing. its disturbing all around but the feds using real naked pictures is even more disturbing
            </p>

             this whole fucking thing is disturbing. it took me no less then 5 minutes to find these accounts and I felt sick to my stomach.

              "I really hope its not the feds because if it is, that's really disturbing. its disturbing all around but the feds using real naked pictures is even more disturbing"...Proving once again, that this sub has done next to nothing to inform people about what is and is not reality. The FEDS have covered up every instance of  the systems crimes for ages, especially satanic ritualistic abuse. The finders, Franklin cover up, white house "call boys" scandal, JFK assasination, Pizzagate, being involved in Oklahoma city bombing etc etc etc. The CIA makes the mess, the FBI cleans it up. Yet this sub, is confused when they run into suspicion that the FBI is behind nefarious activity. Why are any of you here then? Ever research pizzagate? Don't recall the FBI agent whose house in DC burned to the ground, and and his wife a supposed murder suicide? Who is Arun Rao and why was he interested in Alefantis child pics on instagram? Research pizzagate and cases of Satanic ritualistic abuse, and tell me what the FBI's role wasin them. For you guys, every day is a first day of the investigation, you learn and retain nothing.

               I see the merit in your opinion, but these things, little by little, are changing for the better. I'm not sure you have been paying attention.  Pedo busts are in the thousands since Trump took office. Laws are making the pursuit of these people easier, and like it or not, there are good folks mixed in with the bad who are enforcing these laws. What we have learned here is that there is an effort on the part of the Trump administration to put a stop to these heinous crimes. This sub has done a great deal to assist and expose. Are you under the impression that the pedos are arresting themselves? Every day is, not the first day, but a new day.

              Could potentially be a morph picture. No law against feds making fake cp to distribute and lure in pedos. Hopefully this is all a fed trap for sick fucks. Either way, you can report at www.ic3.gov and it will get looked at hopefully.

               It is against the law to make fake cp. However the picture in question is probably in a gray area as while she is nude it's from an angle that doesn't actually show anything. Disgusting? Yes,  leading one to believe there are worse? Yes, actually illegal? Probably not..... Just playing devil's advocate here.... These guys flex their freedom of speech right up to the line of what's legal...

                  What is being communicated? It may be a form of media that some cunting bollock rot that jewed its way into life might cry "muh censorship" at but if even the 4chan anime fuckos can work out why its not classed as "free speech" then maybe its time to reassess your position.

                   Hey I agree, just saying what they would argue not me. Perhaps they would say it's art, idk. Or maybe they would say it's my kid and you're the one seeing it as sexual...

                  <p>
                   Just imagining their defense not saying it's valid or anything. I think it's bullshit that they are posting pictures like that on Instagram where my daughters have accounts. It's as bad or maybe even worse than alefantis' account. At least his pictures they had clothes on.....

               You are both half correct. If the FEDS were putting it online to catch people, then they are distrubuting the material and entrapping people. Either way, they are often the source of criminal activity. Give them the excuse of slinging pedophilia material in the name of a greater good if you want. FBI was discredited long ago to anybody that is red pilled.

            These accounts lead to hundreds more showing sexually explicit photos of underage children. Asking for picture swaps and video swaps. Some accounts advertised young girls and boys but had no posts and over 1,000 followers, so obviously there is some sort of private chats going on that are not made public. Please report those profiles to the authorities as I have
