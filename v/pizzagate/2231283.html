<p>My dear Pizzagate Voaters, I\'m asking you to look into this church where we are told a shooting took place (<a href="https://youtu.be/5Hkv68N04Bw?t=47s">an event in which somehow 20 rounds killed 26 people</a>).</p>
<p>The following video comes from a Christian grounded in the Bible. She shows that not only is that Baptist church NOT Christian, but she notes that in the 100 videos available of sermons from the church, many children are seen running about, with no parents running after them. Not only that, but the children are only seen for one or two sermons, then they are seen no longer. </p>
<p>Why are these NON-Christian sermons being videoed? Why are there so many children without parents? Why in such a tiny community would you not see the exact same people every week for years on end? Is this actually a child trafficking operation, where people choose their pizza by watching the &quot;sermons&quot;? Why was the preacher not there when this event occurred? </p>
<p>Thank you in advance for weighing in. It\'s a long video, but worth it for the information:</p>

            I'm a Christian 'grounded in the faith' and this is a wonderful little Baptist Church.  Stop finding a conspiracy where none exists.  The sermons aren't, "non-Christian", The placing his foot on Jesus was only demonstrating the short term victory that Satan believed He had, unfortunately for him (Satan) the victory was only a misunderstanding it was actually his doom.  Many Christian Churches mistakenly teach that Jesus went to Hell to defeat Satan, in truth Jesus went to Hell to proclaim His victory over death.  1 Peter 3:18-20  Please leave them alone, they've been through enough.

             No, you're wrong and your attempt to hush reasonable questioning is tired and won't work. That pastor literally said "I'm going to turn off the lights now, and turn this pulpit over to demons..."

            I just got messages from Greg Chism and a bunch of Elsagate people I have never heard of and if you are an Elsagate researcher your help is needed urgently. I have reason to believe that they are trying to imply they will hurt  my children. The messages included "See you at the Mill BB" and "we had to kill a little superman"
           </p>
           <p>
            I have several kids and one has the initials bb.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are a legit researcher I need you to do two things:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) submit all leads immediately, like tonight, to the FBI and Interpol
2) tag the FBI, Interpol, realDonaldTrump, TreyGowdy, Steve Scalise etc. on this tweet:
           </p>
           <p>

             https://twitter.com/amyphilo/status/928516462964301824
            </a>
            and this collection of tweets
            <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/928483081215934465">
             https://twitter.com/i/moments/928483081215934465
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            This relates to the Lisa Irwin disappearance and Pakistani child trafficking, kidnapping rings as well as terrorism. Somehow Greg Chism is tied in with the Muslims &amp; latino traffickers.

             What is going on, please?  It is very confusing to receive a message from you and the name is Greg Chism and you say you are being stalked by Greg Chism.  This is very confusing.
I had wanted to get into the research of Lisa and Esagate, but never quite got there.  I really don't know much about it .  I hope you get the help you need.

             I'm confused. Greg Chism is pinging us on this, saying that Greg Chism is threatening Greg Chism? I know amy has been having computer problems and changing names, or so she said, unless it was a faker. I thought amy was voat user Greg Chism? Is amy mocking Greg with a voat Greg Chism name? Is Greg a toy freaks person? I is be confused.

            The preacher wasn't there when it occurred because his daughter was about to get killed. Don't know any more than that.

             Did the preacher offer up his daughter?  Is that why he was missing and she was not?  Maybe he was handsomely paid to also offer up the Church.  I trust no one, especially in a false flag type situation.

            There is a person claiming to live in San Antonio whom I believe is connected to my stalker or stalkers. Check out this information on his twitter account. He has me on several lists. If anyone can help me identify this individual I'm going to send a letter to the President and Gowdy, and Scalise, as they seem to be the only people who actually want to take these individuals down. The most recent post by this person is a photo of a man covered in pasta.

            That is an interesting blurb. I am not sure how to take that but it sounds to me like their crack active shooter response team uses triage methods so secret that they cannot be filmed. I'm assuming that is for "national security", of course.
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess in the future this might also explain away the questions people keep having such as "where was the fleet of ambulances and trauma teams?" Maybe the future answer is "oh, our crack active shooter response team did triage, they are experts, and its a secret, so we can't show you." ??

            Regardless in the midst of the new cabal taking over in this country, and apparently the world from looking at Saudi Arabia the false flags and hoaxes not only go on unabated but are getting larger and more grand. "largest shooting in Texas ever." "largest shooting in Vegas biggest in U.S. history." etc....Does not overwhelm me with confidence that "the good guys" are restoring individual sovereignty.

            When they arrest the shareholders of the Federal Reserve, shut down the Federal Reserve, without rewriting the Constitution to allow the Federal Reserve to legally become the government, I will at least start to be less suspicious but I will never trust the bastards, any of em.

            Check out the number of GoFundMe campaigns for this latest hoaxed shooting:

            My mother in law died unexpectantly. She was on a bike and ran into a truck. And it left my father in law by himself. Everyone knew her... most loved her, yet no one started a GoFundMe page to help him out. No one even thought to start a fund... it is tacky.

            People did die. This isn’t a hoax. My coworker’s daughter goes/went to school with the victims. Her classmates are dead. My coworker is a patriot and not a crisis actor. Could still be a false flag to distract from other things but it did occur. Not a hoax. I’m concerned that hoax posts will damage the credibility of what we are doing here. I’ve seen people
Laughing at the church for various reasons and I don’t know how any of that helps us. I look at this as an attack on sovereignty by a guy who was likely triggered to attack when he did.

             It's not fake. We get that. HOWEVER, in theory, the shooting is just a way to cover for the DNA evidence that was already present in the church. If the church had a secret human trafficking connection, there might be blood present. What is a good way to make sure people don't ask why? Well, shoot up a bunch of people and claim that's why DNA is everywhere.

              Even if there was old DNA evidence they wanted to destroy, it would most likely be concentrated in a backroom, basement, or somewhere out of sight/sound, not where the main congregation sits.

             She is correct and the church was just a few miles from my son's home. I think the shooter was ANTIFA, he had a connection to the church via his ex mother in law, he was a crazy person who somehow got his hands on an AK and lets talk about that. How does one who cannot buy a gun get an AK which is hard to acquire even legally? How come ALL the mass shooters have full military gear and AK's, Why are there always Mass shooter exercises right before a Mass shooting? What connections does Mass Shooter have with CIA, Police or other Entities (ANTIFA) What does ANTIFA have in common with ISIS, and Christians and Killing?

            The little girl named Annabelle in this story. I have seen that name connected to some other weird shit like Elsa Gate or something. These people's names, if they are in a cult, mean very specific things. I don't remember where else I saw that name though. And if I type in "annabelle" in image search get a load of this wickedness...

              So is Sarah but the cult uses it and many other common names. Sarah represents the mother of the jews. Matter of fact the more common the name the better chance it might have of having occult connotations. I don't know if this chruch is a cult or not but after listening to the preacher promote Druidism it makes me wonder.

             IMPORTANT: Annabelle is the name of a horror movie that is supposedly based on a true story. It's about a doll named Annabelle. I think this is the movie:

             This is really CONCERNING! It most definitly looks like 'Annabelle' is a code for a certain kind of little girl you choose :'(  Those search pics are too graphic for my imagination of what it means.

              The cult has an obsession with dolls for various reasons. I think the doll, Annabelle, was based on the original Raggedy Anne doll. Considering that everything they do is directly related to "inverting" something to its opposite or negative connotation maybe the word Anne/Ann/Anna means something they are inverting?
             </p>
             <p>
              Bell/Belle could be a play on Baal? I haven't tried to look it up but my gut feels like maybe there is something there.

               I'm inclined to agree with you here. The girls like me are called "dolls" and "toys". Belle is the character name in Beauty and the Beast, which is used in mind control programming and is also a metaphor for these people and what they do. I would not be surprised at all if the name Belle is meant to harken back to Ba'al, though I can't say for certain. I know that the name Anne/Anna/Annie is typically the name of a bad actor female in the cult naming convention. And the Raggedy Anne &amp; Andy dolls are used in mind control programming. All very good observations.
              </p>
              <p>
               I looked up what the root meaning of Anne/Anna/Annie. It derives from Hebrew "Hannah" meaning favored, grace, or beautiful. So Annabelle would mean something like "favored beauty" or "double beauty" since both Anna and Belle have similar meanings. If they use this name as an inversion, it could easy mean Favored by Baal.
              </p>
              <p>
               As I was left an unaware member of the cult, they never gave me any instruction in these things, so I can't say for sure. But I think your logic here is pretty sound, and I'm inclined to agree with you.

               GREAT observation. Yes, Anna is the name of a bad actor (at least as far as I can tell), and Belle would be a version of El, later known as Baal. Belle also means beauty, so reversed would be ugliness, something they admire because anyone can look at and enjoy something pretty, but it takes a stronger person to look at and love something ugly. This is the way they think. Anne in Hebrew means "favored by god" so in a Hivite family it would be better said as "favored by Satan/Lucifer". The name Natasha is Ah Satan backwards, definitely a bad actor name. Great observation! Thanks for looping me in. I've been truthbombing twitter all day and haven't been able to check voat much.

                kaspersky has a free version of their anti virus. for a free version its pretty good i think. i think it uses the same virus database as the paid version but just has less extras that are not necessary to get the job done. if i were in your shoes i would download the free version of kaspersky and let it clean out your puter. you might have to do it two or three times because it might not get it all on the first sweep
               </p>
               <p>
                kaspersky won't bog down your computer and be a resource hog like mcafee etc....

                I have no idea if Annabelle was being in a cult sense as it relates to this church shooting or not. I just remembered that one of those videos, which turns out to be toy freaks, had an annabelle. The rest is just speculating off the cuff.

                 I'm in a lot of fear right now and I cannot handle this guilt if they killed her off after I investigated and tried so hard to get her rescued. Do you have a link to the list of victims / pictures? That video is like 40 minutes long.

                  OK I looked and it must be a different "Annabelle" - a while back I noticed that Annabelle is kind of like a code word pedos use - yes, because of Belle from Beauty and the Beast, also because of a poem about Annabelle Leigh. There was a pedo website called Annabelleigh.net or whatever a few years ago and it got taken down. The reason being both because of Belle falling in love with the beast (Beauty and the Beast aspect) as well as the symbolism of the Beast (666) and also, Annabelle Leigh the poem describes a "dream girl."

                  I remember sorta what Lisa Irwin looked like and this is definitely not the same annabelle. That doesn't mean it is impossible that it could still be connected of course. You know how crazily these things are constructed to be.

                  No I have not looked at that situation up close. I will poke around and see what I see though. Won't surprise me if the info is vague per usual with these deals.

            Excellent post V_Z.  Sane Progressive (Debbie) is right on the mark.  She mentioned the TruthStreamMedia tube I watched earlier today.  I get so burned out with this Q said, Rex said, grid going down gonna happen any day (they do these drills 4 times a year).
           </p>
           <p>
            Then all this Q bs.  Everything is fine patriots, all under control, love the military...you're getting sleepy, very very sleepy. If ppl can't see thru that I give up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the tube she referenced that I had seen earlier today...

              I'm already perturbed.  At least Iran is preparing and has strong allies.  Getting sick and fucking tired of watching entire countries reduced to rubble.  One of the first things is to destroy ancient sites so the culture of the ppl is lost.  Then they make sure to have everyone so contaminated with depleted uranium future generations are toast.
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh but wait, Q says trump loves us, loves the usa.  Your getting sleepy, very very sleepy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then again MF keeps speaking up for Q so I guess Q is legit right?  I couldn't even follow all the Q shit, after a few paragraphs of god and country I blew it off.  When I saw MF speak in their behalf that cinched it.

               I understand your distrust, but I am also leaning toward Q being legit. In fact, I think it's Trump. In any case, we we soon see. 😎🍿

               <p>
                Yeah, there is a debate going on is it or isn't it?
               </p>
               <p>
                I should have been more specific...don't think Q is some larper in a basement.  Whomever it is has inside info.  I think whomever it is/is manipulating ppl into some false sense of security, loyalty etc if coming from the trump team.  On the other hand the dems are trying to dump HC and salvage the crumbling party/she won't stfu.  Either camp could have all the info that is being dumped.
               </p>
               <p>
                On the other hand both sides could be working for a common goal...collapse the clinton/bush cabal so everyone goes yea...we are 'saved', the corrupt system is 'fixed' and in the process will agree to more surveillance, more govt control of fill in the blank and will regrettably go along with war with Iran bc 'trust' has been restored.
               </p>
               <p>
                The bigger picture still remains that the US as servants of Israel will do what is required by giving $ and cannon fodder for a piece of the pie.  Israel has dreams of greater Israel/remapping the ME.
               </p>
               <p>
                But alas, if ppl are living in the illusion of some kind of patriot bs then no matter all the policies that trump and company have been promoting which are NOT FOR OUR BENEFIT will be accepted.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is easy to forget in the hype of 'drain the swamp' how many promises trump has broken in such a short time.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is about conditioning ppl to trust the govt and taking down the cannibal cabal would go a long way to doing that.  Then just like with the patriot act ppl will agree to things if they were rational and awake they never would.  There is no excuse what so ever for continual war.  Trump is promoting war.  He is carrying on the agenda that has been status quo.
               </p>
               <p>
                People were getting antsy...something had to be done about that.  Q is either the trump team, the dems or both working together.

                 I completely agree with your stance on never trusting the government. Power corrupts, period.
                </p>
                <p>
                 However, people cannot be "un-redpilled". You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. Q is making very specific predictions, in a way designed to viralize the info among those who memed Trump into the Whitehouse, which if not realized in fact will destroy the credibility of Team Trump. It would be a retarded move.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It could be an elaborate disinfo campaign designed to do just that by the Clinton Cabal, but I've spent the last 11 months deleting disinfo spread by those people here and although it is sometimes elaborate, it is never specific or provable. The Q stuff has a completely different feel.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Just out of curiosity, what promises has Trump broken?

                  I don't really want to engage in a point by point he said thing.  He promised to stop engaging in endless wars, was perceived at least as a potus of peace.  Compare that with his track record when he took office and continues.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He promised to put american workers first and increased H 2B visas/including Mar La Go hiring even more seasonal foreign workers.  The tax plan will hit the middle class/something he campaigned against.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  While this country needs infrastructure rebuilding, homeless numbers are increasing the US is spending billions on overseas wars.  He has become just like all the others, a war potus.  No reason to be in Yemen, obliterating a poor village where some rebels had taken up camp.  SA and Yemen/it's their conflict/not ours.  The military industrial complex loves him...more troops, more deployments/hi Somalia, Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq.  Iran you are next.  Let's not forget Russia/thought we were going to get along?  The endgame has always been control the ME and then take out Russia.  If the US tries to invade Iran it will trigger WW3 with Russia...is anyone listening?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Promising to let states decide marijuana laws he appoints Sessions who is for prohibition which will help keep the private prisons stocked/private prisons being a big trump campaign supporter.  We have the most prisoners of any other country (most non violent) which drains our economy.  On top of that when prisoners are released the are angry from abuse and a danger to society/when they might not have been going in.  Look at how the private prisons are run/the minimal food and jacked up prices for phone and commissary just to name a few.  We make more criminals...has no one heard of rehabilitation?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The US home front is rife with the poor getting poorer and yet we have billions to fight wars across the globe.  Geez, what does it take to see that?  Look at the children here that are starving but hey let's cut funding to that.  We here are about the children.  Cutting the free lunch program hurts the children/and I find no excuse for that.  I don't care if some of the parents are at fault/the children are the ones who suffer, period, end of story.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He campaigned on america first...nothing could be farther from the truth.  The cycle of needless death and suffering continues.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For the record...trump was not elected, he was selected.  No one memed him into the WH.  That was all for show.  Now we are just seeing another show.  I wanted to believe trump was different.  I was relieved when he was elected.  That faded immediately when he bombed Yemen, then Syria, then Afghanistan.  The chocolate cake comment was beyond any kind of sensitivity for lives lost, terror unleashed for those in the area, including children/I read the stories.  Well sure, would I even need to read the stories/what effect would it have on children to have the mother of all bombs explode in your area?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This country has enough resources to take care of everyone, and take care of them well.  Homelessness could be a thing of the past, poverty could be a thing of the past.  Children could grow up to reach their potential.  If you look at his policies none of this is happening.  We are spending money on wars and foreign aid to countries that have the ability to stand on their own/ie Israel.  This is not america first.  Anyone that cannot see that there is nothing more I can say.

                  I'm not a Trump hater. I want to believe. But equally as good a question is what promises has he fulfilled? I don't see a 24/7 massive construction effort building miles of wall a week. Other than token lip service exec orders and stuff I don't see an out-flux of illegal immigrants from places like North Africa from which war age males who delight in raping white women came from.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Iran is being setup to get the Arab Spring treatment. Lebanon is being accused of attacking Saudia Arabia during the Saud game of thrones.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This is NOT an anti NWO cabal coming into power. If I am viewing the tea leaves correctly we may be seeing the winding down of the Clinton bush cabal and the transfer to the new cabal that are tied to Trump, Kushners, and their network whoever all it is.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Other than people's faith that Trump is dismantling the shadow banking system and government there is no solid evidence that it is happening. This Game Of Thrones in Saudia Arabia is only evidence of a game of throne in the house of Saud and all this speculation about other things is only speculation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If "the good guys" are taking over they will arrest the shareholders of the Federal Reserve, dismantle the Federal Reserve, and let the U.S. Treasury print its own money without borrowing it from parasites.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The new cabal would arrest everybody in the top tiers of big pharma and put the poisoners in prison and fix this whole horrid nightmare we call a medical system.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  and on and on and on.....I realize Rome was not built in a day but right now they are busy building the new Tower Of Babal by going after Lebanon and Iran.

                  who is also gangstaulked as I am for telling the truth but you ban me. I have real evidence on this case and others...I am hoping Trump is the good guy as well and have communicated directly to members of his team...sent evidence to DC....might be why I was attacked at home and threatened. Then you banned me. Please release that so I can provide info for people to research.

                  Trump = kikeshill?  Perpetuating Jew schemes like the Dow?  Susan Rice signed a $40 bn military aid guarantee to Israel, largest in history.  I talked to a young Jew yesterday who can't wait for war to take more of Syria etc.  So that's gonna happen anyway because they are an ethnocentric and parasidic supremacist group.

                  I have a ten point plan to effect a nonviolent resolution to the Jewish problem.  I wonder whether your larps allow you any time to consider INEVITABLITIES based on history (race war)and what welcome you'd receive on our side.

                   They will just cut off the ATM machines, the food, and the water. Then the race war Kangz will beg for mercy. They have the power because they control the distribution lines.

                       You still didn't tell me what the master plan is when they cut off your atm, food, water, and are sweeping out your brains with their microwave toys.

                      <p>
                       When they feed the chimps and bus them to your neighborhood for parties that will be swell too.

                      <p>
                       You won't have any food to feed the chimps.

                      <p>
                       Ya know. When the ADL, Jidf, etc...false flag attack jews they never mention that the jews are not really oy veys kicked out of the holy land to further damage their credibility.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I notice that you don't either. You and the ADL have the same approach to dealing with the Jews.

                        Thats theiri plan anyway obviously.  As I've pointed out all their schemes are temporary. Your "strategy" is capitulation

                       <p>
                        IDK whether you're gaslighting or genuinely ignorant, but Jews playing victim isn't new to any European (who have folk sayings about it) and isn't reason to lie about the nature of the problem (community wide, Jews historically cover for Jews as Talmud prescribes).  The entire internet is realizing liberalism = Judaism.  We on this sub have proven they assault our children physically, mentally and intentionally and unrelentingly. So fuck em.

                     So when you race war Kangz get starved out and can't get to any money, and the chimps are in the streets tearing up all the white man's businesses because that is what they do as a reaction to just about anything they don't like, that will "show those fucking jews and it will get rid of them"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Great plan. The jews will laugh at your misery and egg the chimps on to tear up some more stuff.

                    AIPAC? 100% of his kids married rich Jews.  More logical to assume Trump's a crypto, as equine does.  But unnecessary so I don't.

            Don't know if this is connected, but Reuters just reported the FBI conducted a day long search of MedCure, a national body broker company in Oregon:

            It caught my eye especially because George Webb said after the Texas church shooting to "follow the fresh hearts", or something to that effect.

             Hmm.  Good thinking.  I read the article too.  Nothing surprises me anymore after the shootings we've had, false flags or not.  Those bodies at the church were taken to a hospital, what was taken out of them before sending them to their funeral home, etc. They have it all worked out.  Loved ones will not question stitches, for they are in mourning and shock.  This co. is also connected to tissue as well, Could something be wrong there?  Possibly or more than likely for they never miss a beat.

            Im starting to think these "events" take place where child abuse took place in order to cover up the REAL dna evidence , if that makes sense.In other words , child dna would be found even though the shooting was a hoax as children were abused there in the past.

             Arson is one thing, but creating a mass casualty scene that would involve various investigators and media attention seems really stupid.

              There was a recent Antifa posting somewhere, I can't remember where I saw it but I think I still have it on my phone and they were planning to hit that area on or around that same date. I smell Soros.

               The photo said that they wanted to hit the area near San Antonio and Austin, but I don't remember the exact name of the city. When I looked it up I realized it is near where an ex friend used to do his Texas Militia trainings. I assumed it was for targeting the Texas Militia because they wanted to target conservatives, but now I am thinking they did that flyer in advance as kind of a cover to like, Double, Triple False Flag this one. So instead of just a crazed gunman gone mad, they can take it to two additional levels of false flags to cover up the true motive. Level one motive = gun control. Level two motive = on a bunch of meds (hello, Scientology). Level three motive = Antifa thug. Real motive: CIA / Elsagate / Pizzagate / Alefartface.

              A mass casualty scene would explain away the fact actual DNA exists at the scene , if children were being molested  evidence would remain so what better than a fake shooting to cover that up.

            1) The vid's host is correct in that the church does not use the KJV or the original English version of the Bible. Rather they use their own sect's version, saying it's easier for children to understand the simple English. You'd have to read it to see if anything important was left out. Either way they honestly should not be calling themselves "Baptist" as it's a deception.

             From Texas and a Baptist: Can tell you that a lot of the churches have changed some of their formats to get people in the doors, such as informal dress codes, newer more modern music, different types of teachings, etc. as an older more traditional person, i don't like it and try to avoid the changes, they make me uncomfortable. But It is weird that while the preacher is preaching that kids and adults are moving about the place, that is just strange to me in any church. Small Texas towns have also been infiltrated by Human Traffickers. The cops know it and do nothing.

             The video states that in all the sermons she watched, no parents are seen running after the children, only one girl, the same girl each time - the one purported to be the daughter of the pastor.

              Not the children, but i'm not sure about adults. The video was asking us to search through the videos to get more insight into this, she was mainly looking into the anti-Christian messages coming from the pastor.

                  Well it takes a real Christian to know when a pastor is lying. I wouldn't have been able to discern it, I don't know the Bible, so I have to defer to one who does.

                   I grew up in a church as well. It is extremely unlikely to have a big turnover in a little church. That all by itself is odd. Add kids to the mix and we have a PG possibility.

                    I agree. I'm not sure if you saw that we have the video re-uploaded, but i'd love to hear your take on the teachings and stuff coming from this church. I'm floored....

            When I saw it first happening, that was my knee jerk.  MKU trigger.  Took down a distribution point maybe?  the guy was living on a 28 acre estate (parents).  Possibly another "Dylan Roof" or "Adam Lanza"?  I'm sure there are more.

             No more than than Sandy Hook or Vegas. I"m still waiting on those hundreds of sympathy selfie videos from the vegas shot up and traumatized. If 500 people got shot there should be hundreds of sympathy selfie vids spread all over the net from shot up people wanting their five minutes of fame and a "i was there" T shirt.

              I've seen plenty of videos like the one you described. Do you want links?  Also interviews of various survivors with different alt.news hosts. They are not the ones hired for the drills done right before the real event.
             </p>
             <p>
              Would you like to hear a copy of the original 3 hour recording of the Fire Dept Chief of what occurred that night? Transportation of victims from various locations where there were shooters is discussed.

               So far several who came forward discussing evidence of multiple shooters have died. All of those who left their phones at the event, running away in haste, had their cells scrubbed. Suspicious for that fact alone.

               I have seen multiple videos from those at the concert. Major British media co linked together several for one long one too. Would you like the link?
