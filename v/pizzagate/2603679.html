            The hard drive was not destroyed. The pictures and video show it did not even hit the hard drive. That dipshit shot the powersupply and maybe the back of the dvd player, not the hard drive. Look at the video yourself.

            The rest of the sketchy ACT they put together was fake as hell, even the cops were in on it. (or he would have been shot and had his ass kicked, instead of being led away like a ceo)

            Don’t forget that law enforcement moved the camera angles before the shooting took place then moved them back in place after so no footage could be seen on camera. Also, people at the restaurant and nearby claimed they never saw a gunman and didn’t know what happened. Yes, there 100% was an encrypted password only section on the Comet website when pizzagate and Alefantis broke I went on the site to look around and saw it and wondered why a pizza restaurant would have a password protected section on their page. So many questions....

            REPOSTING:
           </p>
           <p>
            "North Carolina arrest records for an Edgar Maddison Welch date back to 2007, and include charges of possession of up to a half ounce of marijuana, possession of controlled substances, driving after consuming alcohol and driving with an open container of alcohol. He plead guilty on the alcohol and drug charges.
           </p>
           <p>
            In October, Welch is alleged to have struck a 13-year-old with a car on Harrison Road in Salisbury, according to a WBTV story. He stayed at the scene, it was reported. Officials said the victim suffered head, torso and leg injuries.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reports emerged late Sunday that Welch might be a struggling actor, with a resume that includes a half dozen minor jobs on film productions, including being an extra and production assistant."

           </p>
           <p>
            According to the "public narrative" at the bottom of the page, NO ONE WITNESSED MADISON FIRING THE GUN.

            COMET PING PONG TRAFFIC CAMERAS MOVED 24 HOURS BEFORE GUNMAN INCIDENT – PIZZA PLACE LINKED TO PEDOPHILE RING CONSPIRACY A.K.A. #PIZZAGATE
            <a href="https://70news.wordpress.com/tag/camera/">
             https://70news.wordpress.com/tag/camera/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            When I followed this story in real time, as I recall, there were NO customers that witnessed Maddison inside Comet Ping Pong and NO reports of gunfire.
James Alefantis was not at Comet Ping Pong that day.
The "assault" charge was based on a single Comet kitchen employee who came in the back door as Maddison was allegedly in the area. The rifle was swung in his GENERAL direction, but I don't recall a specific claim that it was DIRECTLY pointed at him. The employee allegedly turned around and ran out and called the police. The employee did not report hearing a gun shot.
           </p>
           <p>
            My original conclusion at the time was that no gun was fired. Researchers discovered that about a month prior to the incident, Maddison had been involved in a documented car incident in North Carolina where he had hit and injured a 13 year old who was walking on the side of the road with other friends. An early article said the youth's friends claimed that Maddison was the only car on the road at the time and  the accident could have been avoided. One theory at the time was that Maddison was given a plea deal and he was used to carry out Comet Ping Pong. This would have been cover to obtain the tower computer, WHICH IS LISTED IN THE FINAL POLICE REPORT. After "capture", his sentencing could have been time previously required in the theorized plea deal. Remember, Maddison did have ACTING EXPERIENCE.

             WHAT IS LEGAL DEFINITION OF ASSAULT?
"a) an unsuccessful attempt to commit a battery (i.e. a swing and a miss); or
            </p>
            <p>
             b) any act that would cause a reasonable person to fear or apprehend an immediate battery (i.e. a fake slap to make someone flinch, but without actually touching them)."
            </p>
            <p>
             WHAT IS LEGAL DEFINITION OF "DANGEROUS WEAPON"?
"Some things like guns, knives, brass knuckles and other typical weapons obviously would meet the definition of “dangerous weapon.” But even something designed for a completely peaceful purpose can be a “dangerous weapon” if it is used or intended to be used in a way likely to cause serious physical injury or death. A common example is a car or glass bottle. When there is a question as to whether or not something like this is a “dangerous weapon,” it is up to a Jury to decide."
WELCH DID NOT HAVE TO FIRE A WEAPON TO BE CHARGED WITH THIS, but only point the gun in the direction of the employee.

             A. That is what BigFish has been saying for about a year now. It's eyewitness testimony; he found it on their server, then he reported it to the FBI and DC police. Lots of people, including me, got as far as the Comet Ping Pong private page where a series of encrypted graphics files were available. His claim is simply that he was able to decrypt them, and having done so, told the proper authorities. He's still around, and the Honeybee YouTube video above strongly suggests that the investigation is still ongoing.
            </p>
            <p>
             B. BigFish said that the private section linked to nine other servers around the world. So most of what he claims to have found was not hosted at Comet Ping Pong. While it scarcely matters for purposes of his eyewitness report exactly where the server was physically located, I would expect a halfway competent criminal enterprise not to leave evidence of felony rape and kidnapping on a third-party server. But then, we have reason to think that the Clinton crime syndicate is no more than halfway competent, as
             <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/4xaqz9/hillary-clinton-tech-guy-asked-reddit-for-email-advice">
              their IT guy went on Reddit to ask for help destroying evidence
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             C. The story about the gunman firing through a locked door and hitting the computer makes no sense (he's rescuing children so he fires blindly?), but that does seem to be the official account. Nothing specifically proves that the bullet went through the hard drive, but then nothing really proves that shots were actually fired, either. (The employee who says they were has an obvious conflict of interest.) If at any point that detail becomes important, I would imagine a computer with a shot-up hard drive will turn up and its chain of custody will be vouched for.
            </p>
            <p>
             Funny that they have you in this particular thread trying to bail the ocean with your cupped hands, alone. It's almost as if all those sockpuppet accounts that I keep talking about have some aversion to talking specifically about this evidence.

              This is more than ridiculous. The guy who used Bleach Bit didn't work for Clinton.  He worked for Platte River Networks, a commercial IT provider.   So your theory is that Clinton's server contains such damning evidence as felony rape and kidnapping and yet they let an outside group have access to it for 3 years.
             </p>
             <p>
              Logically this points to, there was not evidence of felonies, you are imagining that, not look at what incompetent felons they are.  You are imagining the felonies and you are imagining what they did with the evidence.

             <p>
              This is a logical fallacy called arguing by incredulity.  Because you can't believe someone who do something that means it didn't happen.   Once something happens, the chance of it happening is 100%.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was in the midst of about 36 hours of terrible decisions.  This attempt at anomaly hunting falls very flat.  You claim it's a story.  I say it's what happened.  This guy was making one bad decision after another.  The decision to bring an AR-15 into the restaurant was a terrible decision.  This congruent with everything thing else he did.  He mentioned he resorted to the gun because he was frustrated.

              <p>
               A. Why wouldn't I believe Big Fish? This is the era of "see something, say something," and he saw something and said something. As I said before, I find his statement especially compelling because I saw the same file folder with the same encrypted files. I just don't have his hacking skills. As for who hosted the Comet page, as I already said, I don't think it ultimately matters. It was part of an international network of such servers, available to hundreds or thousands of users, something that is intrinsically quite vulnerable. The only truly reliable way to protect such a network is through corrupt cops and courts. Then reports like that of Big Fish can be intercepted and quietly round-filed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Last year, the investigation seemed to have stalled. The DC police officer who had at first been communicating with Big Fish had gone silent. But now, after a year under Trump, I get the impression that the institutional protection that the Clinton syndicate has counted on for decades may be crumbling. The cops have confirmed there is an investigation ongoing, and we have a new name attached to the case, Jeremiah Johnson. Too soon to say much more than that, but the case is certainly not dead.
              </p>
              <p>
               B. "This is more than ridiculous." I agree, but nonetheless this is where we are. There's nothing saying that Platte River Networks can't be part of the Clinton crime syndicate, in much the same way that, say, Media Matters is. And Platte River's CEO didn't exactly help dispel that suspicion
               <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/managed-services/300084709/platte-river-networks-ceo-faces-possible-criminal-prosecution-after-clinton-email-server-controversy.htm">

              </p>
              <p>
               C. Well, sure, Counsellor, that's one theory of how things happened. You're paid to come up with such theories, and you do a decent job of it. But I can't help thinking that given the truly epic headache that erasing ONE server had already caused the syndicate, they were extra anxious to avoid having to answer questions about the whereabouts of a SECOND one. I think we should be grateful they didn't just burn down the whole place, and blame that on hyped-up Pizzagaters instead.

                 The only truly reliable way to protect such a network is through corrupt cops and courts. Then reports like that of Big Fish can be intercepted and quietly round-filed.

                The reason I don't believe big Fish is that if he had hacking skills enough to do this he could have put up a website that showed how he nailed Comet.  He could even convince the Pizza-gate community.

             "North Carolina arrest records for an Edgar Maddison Welch date back to 2007, and include charges of possession of up to a half ounce of marijuana, possession of controlled substances, driving after consuming alcohol and driving with an open container of alcohol. He plead guilty on the alcohol and drug charges.
            </p>
            <p>
             In October, Welch is alleged to have struck a 13-year-old with a car on Harrison Road in Salisbury, according to a WBTV story. He stayed at the scene, it was reported. Officials said the victim suffered head, torso and leg injuries.
            </p>
            <p>
             Reports emerged late Sunday that Welch might be a struggling actor, with a resume that includes a half dozen minor jobs on film productions, including being an extra and production assistant."

                  But there were plenty of eyewitnesses to him enter CPP with a gun and people who heard him fire and the gunshot damage, all of which is evidence.

                    Do you think I have access to original law enforcement documents?  This never went to court. He plead guilty, so there's no trial testimony.

                    When he entered the restaurant with his gun people fled.  He was probably the only person inside when he fired his guyn.  An employee went to a refrigerator in the alley and heard three loud bangs.  And returned to restaurant saw Welch who raised his rifle at him and the employee fled out the back door.

This is made up. Quote from the document. Only one "victim" is referred to in any official document.

                     Not many customers at 3:00 pm. One waitress reportedly told her few customers to leave because a man had walked in with a gun. I saw a video interview of two of them who were laughing and said they grabbed their pitcher of beer on the way out. Neither actually saw the gunman nor did they hear gunshots. I saw this first hand, the day of the event. It was local coverage.

                     Alex jones interviews another "witness." He only saw Welsh "in his peripheral vision" and "could see he had a CONCEALED weapon. HE DID NOT SEE WELSH FIRE A GUN NOR DID HE HEAR GUNSHOTS.HE DID NOT STATE WHAT HE AND HIS FAMILY DID AFTER WELCH WALKED BY. HE DID NOT SAY THAT THEY WERE FRIGHTENED AND RAN OUT. NOTHING. The witness was playing ping pong towards the back middle of the restaurant. He was not still seated up front by the front door.

                      WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TOWER COMPUTER AND THE 4 SHELLS?
Not one witness has been named that heard the gunshot(S).  We need to see a crime timeline. One news report said a shot (s) were fired BEFORE the restaurant worker entered the back door. Another says it happened RIGHT AFTER the person fled out the back door. WHICH IS IT?

                      Thought Welsh was a concealed carry security guard. NO MENTION OF A CRAZED SHOOTER BRANDISHING A LONG FIREARM. Says Welsh entered the back mystery room. Is that where they keep the "tower computer"?

                       What makes you say this?  This seems like an assumption.  3PM on a weekend is a pretty prime time for a popular restaurants in big cities.

                       This is backed up by news reports that people took shelter in several place, an Indian restaurant, the bookstore, around the corner behind police barricades.  The criminal complaint says the police also took people to a firehouse.

                        I saw a video interview of two of them who were laughing and said they grabbed their pitcher of beer on the way out. Neither actually saw the gunman nor did they hear gunshots. I saw this first hand, the day of the event. It was local coverage.

                       The computer tower was in a small utility type closet.  Alefantis said they used it as a coatroom and the computer was on the floor.  You can see it at 3:45 in this video.

                       The staff at Comet Ping Pong was almost certainly interviewed by the police and by the FBI and the criminal complaint is based on what law enforcement learned.

                        The guy that AP and Alex Jones interviewed said he arrived around 2:00 pm and had finished his pizza and he and his family were playing ping pong when Welsh allegedly walked to the back room. According to news and incident report, Comet employee called 911 at 3:00pm after encountering Welch near the back door and turned and ran out that same back door.

                        Please construct a TIMELINE for me of when and how many shots were fired and what was hit by those shots. Include who heard the shots and who witnessed Welsh shooting the gun(s). It has been claimed that the ground was shot, a locked closet, wall, and tower computer. Welsh, in the court report, said he fired a gun(s) two times. Police claimed that LATER they found 4 casings. Welsh was NOT charged with discharging a firearm in the restaurant, OR ATTEMPTED MURDER.

                         FOX LIED. They said assault with a DEADLY weapon.
The charge was "assault with a dangerous weapon." A legal distinction.
The closet door showed no gunshot. I posted pictures released "later" of the same door Alefantis opened, but it was damaged, allegedly from a bullet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Alefantis was NOT at the restaurant when the incident occurred.
Megan: "WHEN THIS MAN WALKED IN.....You were there that day, RIGHT?"
James: "I was there EARLIER that day."
MEGAN WANTS VIEWERS TO BELIEVE A LIE. She would have known if James was there during the incident. 
I would like to hear a recording of the 911 call to hear if the caller mentioned hearing gunshot(s).

SHE IS THE DEFINITION OF FAKE NEWS. JAMES DID NOT CORRECT. HE WASN'T EVEN THERE AND THEREFORE HE WASN'T A WITNESS.

ANOTHER LIE. D.C. POLICE HAVE NEVER INVESTIGATED IT.
MEGAN: "Again, the D.C. police are saying this is FAKE, FAKE"
Sorry Megan, YOU are fake news. D.C. police have NEVER investigated the allegations.

                         Regarding Instagram photos: James claims the taped up little girl is his "god daughter."  NO PROOF. The walk-in cement cooler photo was labeled by James as "KILL ROOM". OOPS! MEGAN didn't tell us that. THE WHOLE INTERVIEW WAS A FAKE NEWS COVER-UP.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         MEGAN :  " ...a national debate over FAKE NEWS"   This shows the media's initial attempt to discredit citizen journalist/researches by labeling them repeatedly as FAKE NEWS. Enter Trump. He turned around and put the label on THEM. LOL!

                         "Dunno where that coatroom is, it could be in the backroom"
It's right next to the only back door in the restaurant. That means that that is the door the employee entered and then left when they saw Welch. Should have heard gunfire.

                         JAMES OPENS THE CLOSET DOOR WHICH DOES NOT SHOW DAMAGE SEEN IN LATER RELEASED POLICE PHOTOS. video:  3:50
JAMES: "The bullet went into our computer system"  SHOWS AN ANGLED HOLE ON TOP OF COMPUTER CASE. Was this a SECOND shot? It wouldn't align with one shot in the door lock. Did Welsh make a statement on motive for shooting the computer? It wasn't on his list for alleged reasons to come to Comet.

                          Regarding "computer tower", just realized the "shooting" occurred 2 WEEKS prior to the interview. Why didn't the police seize the computer as evidence? Why hadn't Comet fixed the computer by then? Did they want us to think this is an old computer they no longer use?  Was this sending a message to the guy that reported them for cp on their computer? Yea. WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

            I had heard about this "story" but assumed it was fake news. It just seemed too outlandish even for the MSM to try to push a bogus story like this. I can't believe they tried to pass this off as an authentic narrative.

            If y’all haven’t realized that the devil has taken over the United States then please wake up. Evil is rampant in our government from everything and everything. Everything the government does is to destroy us.

            What was the gun and bullet used? That is actually something that would be recorded in a transcript and have relevance to the case. None of that matters because the M. DC police are corrupt.

             no true.   A single camera was affected.  The claim was that this camera faced onto Comet which was not true, I believe.

              Showed the intersection where much of the photos were taken, I believe, in the stories of the arrest but it was aimed at the post that day, I believe. Deleted previous inaccurate comments since I couldn't edit.

               I could certainly be misremembering this.  But people were acting like it a focus directly on Comet Ping Pong.  Could you see the door?

                Not a required element but it was weird, strange, added to the hubbub that half the screen was focused on a pole. And, yes, you were right that it didn't face the storefront but rather the intersection. Was wrong, thank you for helping to clarify.

                 right, because it's a traffic camera, it would be focused on the intersection and not any particular business.  I believe that it sometimes focuses on the street in the opposite direction.  I was thinking of that , not that it was oddly facing a post.

                 The thing that's always struck me about this is people on this board call for vigilante action every other week.  It's all about someone should go down and do something or worse, they should be killed.
                 <br/>
                 The actions Edgar Maddison Welch took is the logical destination of a lot of thinking on this board. His logic would not be out of place at all on this board. Remember what the guy said when he got arrested?   He still believed in pizzagate, still thought it was going on, just that he got bad intel about Comet Ping Pong.   Dude is doing 4 years in prison.

                <p>
                 Some guy just got arrested for blocked the bridge by the Hoover Dam.  He was holding up notes saying Release the IG Report.  A report that was released, mind you.

               I think Connecticut Ave @ Nebraska Ave would be the camera in question.  It's dark now, but it doesn't seem like it would show much of Comet if at all.

His post is an opposition tactic. This is not about free speech!

             This is a research site. The proper way to phrase your sentiments would be "I would support the DEATH PENALTY for a convicted pedophile."  Your current post could be misconstrued as a threat and compromises the integrity of VOAT.

             <p>
              Two weeks after alleged shooting Fox News showed us this video of Alefantis at the closet:
see 3:53 in video. Notice DOOR IS NOT DAMAGED. Notice door at end of hallway.  Is this the door the employee entered when he encountered Welch?  Did employee report hearing gun shot(s)? There is only ONE back door at Comet.
             </p>
             <p>
              COMPARE WITH THIS PHOTO, allegedly first published June 21, 2017:
"New photos show Comet Ping Pong crime scene ahead of gunman’s sentencing"
              <a href="https://wtop.com/dc/2017/06/comet-ping-pong-gunman-sentenced-thursday/slide/1/">
               https://wtop.com/dc/2017/06/comet-ping-pong-gunman-sentenced-thursday/slide/1/
              </a>
              Scroll down to photos. It's the 5th from left. It shows a similar hallway as in video above, BUT IT IS NOT THE SAME. THE BACK DOOR IS DIFFERENT.  Does Alefantis' nearby Buck's Fishing restaurant have a similar hallway and back door?
ALWAYS MORE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.

               OPPS!
Here's the video. See 3:53
               <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/5250221515001/?#sp=show-clips">

              </p>
              <p>
               Here is my OPINION on the entire video:
FOX LIED. They said assault with a DEADLY weapon. The charge was "assault with a dangerous weapon." A legal distinction. The closet door showed no gunshot.
              </p>
              <p>
               Alefantis was NOT at the restaurant when the incident occurred. Megan: "WHEN THIS MAN WALKED IN.....You were there that day, RIGHT?" James: "I was there EARLIER that day." MEGAN WANTS VIEWERS TO BELIEVE A LIE. She would have known if James was there during the incident. I would like to hear a recording of the 911 call to hear if the caller mentioned hearing gunshot(s).
              </p>
              <p>
               MEGAN LIED: "When this man walked into your restaurant, with this gun, firing multiple shots..." SHE WANTED VIEWERS TO BELIEVE WELCH WALKED IN WITH GUNS BLAZING. SHE IS THE DEFINITION OF FAKE NEWS. JAMES DID NOT CORRECT. HE WASN'T EVEN THERE AND THEREFORE HE WASN'T A WITNESS.
              </p>
              <p>
               MEGAN: "even D.C. police say (pizzagate) has no basis in fact..." ANOTHER LIE. D.C. POLICE HAVE NEVER INVESTIGATED IT. MEGAN: "Again, the D.C. police are saying this is FAKE, FAKE" Sorry Megan, YOU are fake news. D.C. police have NEVER investigated the allegations.
              </p>
              <p>
               Regarding Instagram photos: James claims the taped up little girl is his "god daughter." NO PROOF. The walk-in cement cooler photo was labeled by James as "KILL ROOM". OOPS! MEGAN didn't tell us that. THE WHOLE INTERVIEW WAS A FAKE NEWS COVER-UP.
              </p>
              <p>
               MEGAN : " ...a national debate over FAKE NEWS" This shows the media's initial attempt to discredit citizen journalist/researches by labeling them repeatedly as FAKE NEWS. Enter Trump. He turned around and put the label on THEM. LOL!
              </p>
              <p>
               JAMES OPENS THE CLOSET DOOR WHICH DOES NOT SHOW DAMAGE SEEN IN LATER RELEASED POLICE PHOTOS. video: 3:50 JAMES: "The bullet went into our computer system" SHOWS AN ANGLED HOLE ON TOP OF COMPUTER CASE. Was this a SECOND shot? It wouldn't align with one shot in the door lock. Did Welsh make a statement on motive for shooting the computer? It wasn't on his list for alleged reasons to come to Comet.
              </p>
              <p>
               NOTHING ADDS UP.

              I played an audio recording of a phone call that was sent to me by BigFish the hacker who broke into comet Ping Pong, where he once again gets the runaround by DC Police Detective Godin who won't confirm or deny anything, when trying to find out why nothing has been done about this. Audio played during.

            I thought there were three shots fired?  Regardless, shooting into a deadbolt isn't going to result in a deflection with enough destructive energy to penetrate a PC case and destroy a hard drive.

             COMET PING PONG TRAFFIC CAMERAS MOVED 24 HOURS BEFORE GUNMAN INCIDENT – PIZZA PLACE LINKED TO PEDOPHILE RING CONSPIRACY A.K.A. #PIZZAGATE

             When I followed this story in real time, as I recall, there were NO customers that witnessed Maddison inside Comet Ping Pong and NO reports of gunfire. James Alefantis was not at Comet Ping Pong that day. The "assault" charge was based on a single Comet kitchen employee who came in the back door as Maddison was allegedly in the area. The rifle was swung in his GENERAL direction, but I don't recall a specific claim that it was DIRECTLY pointed at him. The employee allegedly turned around and ran out and called the police. The employee did not report hearing a gun shot.
            </p>
            <p>
             My original conclusion at the time was that no gun was fired. Researchers discovered that about a month prior to the incident, Maddison had been involved in a documented car incident in North Carolina where he had hit and injured a 13 year old who was walking on the side of the road with other friends. An early article said the youth's friends claimed that Maddison was the only car on the road at the time and the accident could have been avoided. One theory at the time was that Maddison was given a plea deal and he was used to carry out Comet Ping Pong. This would have been cover to obtain the tower computer, WHICH IS LISTED IN THE FINAL POLICE REPORT. After "capture", his sentencing could have been time previously required in the theorized plea deal. Remember, Maddison did have ACTING EXPERIENCE.

             WHAT IS LEGAL DEFINITION OF ASSAULT? "a) an unsuccessful attempt to commit a battery (i.e. a swing and a miss); or
            </p>
            <p>
             b) any act that would cause a reasonable person to fear or apprehend an immediate battery (i.e. a fake slap to make someone flinch, but without actually touching them)."
            </p>
            <p>
             WHAT IS LEGAL DEFINITION OF "DANGEROUS WEAPON"? "Some things like guns, knives, brass knuckles and other typical weapons obviously would meet the definition of “dangerous weapon.” But even something designed for a completely peaceful purpose can be a “dangerous weapon” if it is used or intended to be used in a way likely to cause serious physical injury or death. A common example is a car or glass bottle. When there is a question as to whether or not something like this is a “dangerous weapon,” it is up to a Jury to decide."

            <p>
             WELCH DID NOT HAVE TO FIRE A WEAPON TO BE CHARGED WITH THIS, but only point the gun in the direction of the employee.
I think the final incident report has some "holes" in it.

               Notice the Dec. 4th story above says the alleged shot was fired AFTER the employee fled through the back door.
The "factual proffer" indicated the shots were fired just PRIOR to the entrance of the employee. Which begs the question of how did he not hear the alleged 4 shots.

              So you are saying the gun man was a crisis actor playing a role, which wouldn't be surprising at all.  But what about the four year prison term? Surely that is fictional. As for Brock, he may have been suicided or may have faked his death. It's too convenient he just suddenly naturally dies of a heart attack so he's no longer in the picture. There are two realities, one on the surface that is all for public perception and another that is real but secret. Only the Jews know about it because it's their world and we don't live in.  Who can say what goes on in the real world who doesn't live in that world? Am I speaking in riddles?

              WHO IS SHARIF SILMI?
Maryland lawyer Sharif Silmi appears to be the only NAMED and interviewed "witness" of Welch in Comet Ping Pong.
Each of his accounts in several different interviews differs.
             </p>
             <p>
              ARTICLE:
"“A lot of us saw he had a gun and we all started getting our families out,” says Sharif Silmi, a Maryland lawyer who was at the restaurant with his wife and three children. “The staff came and got us.”
             </p>
             <p>
              "Silmi says his family stopped by Comet Ping Pong as part of a day trip to Chevy Chase that also included plans to stop by Politics &amp; Prose and the Little Red Fox bakery, Comet Ping Pong’s neighboring businesses on its homey block of Connecticut Ave., Northwest, which have caught some spillover flak from Pizzagate conspiracy theorists."
             </p>
             <p>
              "Police, who Silmi says arrived about two to three minutes after the gunman entered the restaurant, have not released the suspect’s name."
             </p>
             <p>
              Silmi says that since the November 8 election, he and his family, who are Muslim, have felt a bit more cautious."

              ANOTHER ARTICLE:
"Eyewitness Sharif Silmi was at the restaurant with his wife and three children — ages 7,9 and 12, when the suspect walked in.
             </p>
             <p>
              “He walked right past us holding a shotgun, when we realized what was going on we gathered our young ones and started moving toward the exit,” Silmi told CNN. “It was very swift, quick exit, everybody moved out very smoothly.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Silmi, who lives in Maryland, told CNN he and his family are Muslim and that he blamed those who were spreading “false rumors [about Comet Ping Pong] online. They put our children’s lives in danger today.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Silmi said he did not hear the man speak."

              VIDEO INTERVIEW WITH ALEX JONES:
Alex jones interviews another "witness,"  Sharif Silmi. According to his statement in the video, he only saw Welsh "in his peripheral vision" and "could see he had a CONCEALED weapon. HE DID NOT SEE WELSH FIRE A GUN NOR DID HE HEAR GUNSHOTS. HE DID NOT STATE WHAT HE AND HIS FAMILY DID AFTER WELCH WALKED BY. HE DID NOT SAY THAT THEY WERE FRIGHTENED AND RAN OUT. NOTHING. The witness was playing ping pong towards the back middle of the restaurant. He was not still seated up front by the front door. See you tube video at 4:10

              VIDEO INTERVIEW WITH AP
Silmi thought Welsh was a concealed carry security guard. NO MENTION OF A CRAZED SHOOTER BRANDISHING A LONG FIREARM. Did not say he heard gunshots. Did not say he saw Welsh aim or shoot a gun. Says Welsh entered the back section room behind the ping pong tables. It was dark and closed off. It wasn't until a waitress told them to get out of the building that they left. Silmi's name is not mentioned in the D.C. incident report. The worker(s) who warned patrons (no mention of how many were in there at that time) HAVE NEVER BEEN NAMED NOR INTERVIEWED IN THE PRESS. Only ONE worker was named in the D.C. incident report. That is the one Welsh allegedly pointed a gun in their direction and they fled out the back door and called police. THIS IS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS THE VICTIM OF "Assault with a dangerous weapon".

               Making a Comet Pizza incident time line would be interesting.

               </a>
               According to the Final Incident Report:
Incident started at 14:57 (2:57 pm) and ended at 16:30 (4:30pm)
              </p>
              <p>
               From the "Public Narrative" at bottom of report it indicates that victim R-1 (only victim mentioned) saw Welch in restaurant, fled out door in back of restaurant and called 911 at 2:57.
              </p>
              <p>
               According to Silmi's several statements to the press, he and his family arrived at Comet Pizza at 2:00pm. How long did it take them to eat?
They had finished eating and had moved to the middle of the restaurant to play ping pong. Some time before 2:57pm, Welsh allegedly walked by, headed to the room at the back of the restaurant, behind the ping pong tables. Silmi allegedly saw Welch from the PERIPHERY of his eye and noticed he was carrying a concealed weapon. Concluded he was a security guard. Shortly after, he was told by an employee someone had a gun and they should immediately leave. They did. No gun shot was heard.
              </p>
              <p>
               "When Welch entered the restaurant he allegedly pointed the rifle in the direction of an employee who police said was able to flee and notify police. Patrons inside the restaurant HAD rushed out of the building."
               <a href="https://pix11.com/2016/12/05/man-armed-with-assault-rifle-storms-comet-ping-pong-in-response-to-fake-news-reports-police/">

               </a>
               SOUNDS LIKE THE PATRONS LEFT BEFORE THE EMPLOYEE FLED AND CALLED 911. Was the employee already at the back of the restaurant? Some accounts said he came in the back door and Welch was in that area. He turned around and left through the same door. This would fit Silmi's account. Therefore most likely no shots were fired PRIOR TO 2:57pm
              </p>
              <p>
               "On Sunday patrons inside the restaurant ran out when the suspect entered."
               <a href="https://pix11.com/2016/12/05/man-armed-with-assault-rifle-storms-comet-ping-pong-in-response-to-fake-news-reports-police/">

               </a>
               Based on Silmi, Welsh must have entered close to 2:57pm- I'm guessing about 2:50 because between 2:00pm and 2:57pm, Silmi and family had to order, eat, finish, get up and move to the middle of the restaurant and start playing ping pong BEFORE Welsh allegedly walked by. No gun shots were heard during this time according to Silmi.
              </p>
              <p>
               "Acting DC Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters Sunday evening that Welch walked into Comet Ping Pong and did fire at least one shot into the ground. "
               <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/04/man-with-rifle-arrested-at-comet-ping-pong/">
                https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/12/04/man-with-rifle-arrested-at-comet-ping-pong/
               </a>
               SO AT WHAT TIME DID THIS TAKE PLACE? It most likely would have happened AFTER 2:57. This is not noted in the Incident Report. No information on WHERE this happened inside the restaurant. No witnesses to Welch firing a gun.
              </p>
              <p>
               "Police, who Silmi says arrived about two to three minutes after the gunman entered the restaurant, have not released the suspect’s name."
HMM. HOW DO I FIT THIS INTO MY TIMELINE? On second look, the Final Incidence Report leaves it unclear if the 2:57pm time refers to the time Welch allegedly pointed the rifle in the direction of the employee, or when he called 911 after exiting through the rear door (he and Welch were already back there). It sounds like the 2 incidences were very close together. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE 911 RECORDING. IT WOULD CLEAR UP TIMELINE AND VERIFY IF A SHOT WAS REPORTED.
Let's say that the police were called at 2:57. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE THEM TO GET THERE?
We already estimated that Welch entered Comet at 2:50, based on Silmi's statements. That would mean the police arrived at 2:52-2:53pm.  BUT THAT DOESN'T WORK. Did the police ARRIVE at 2:57pm? If so, according to Silmi, Welch entered Comet at 2:54-2:55pm. SO, Silmi was back playing ping pong with his family at 2:54, when Welch allegedly walked by to the back area of the restaurant. That would mean that back area, behind the ping pong tables, is where he encountered the employee, who then fled out the back door in that area and called 911. It is still an almost IMPOSSIBLY TIGHT TIMELINE. It appears that any alleged gun shot(s) happened AFTER THE POLICE ARRIVED and bulding occupants had all left. NO WITNESSES? NO POLICE HEARD SHOTS?
Can any VOATERS come up with a more accurate timeline?

                ACCORDING TO WaPo's ACCOUNT, GUN WAS FIRED BEFORE WORKER IN BACK RAN OUT:
"The few patrons had fled before Welch shot off the lock to an inside door, sending a bullet into a computer tower. The North Carolina man then turned the gun on an employee who emerged from the back holding pizza dough. The worker ran out, unharmed."

"Edgar Maddison Welch, the actor who went to Comet Ping Pong with three guns on December 4, 2016, and did "something", allegedly "firing a gun", according to the #NewYorkTimesEatsBabies, supposedly because he was influenced by "fake news" on the internet about that "insane PizzaGate conspiracy theory", also starred in a 2005 movie called "Something About Pizza", which is apparently about a young girl  (“pizza”) who goes on a killing spree because her brother ate her pizza, in which Welch played the role of The Gunman.
                  <br/>
                  Then in December, after Welch became known worldwide as the Comet Pizza Gunman, Welch's credit for the role of The Gunman in "Something About Pizza" was removed from IMDB."

                  "UPDATE: AUGUST 2, 2017:
                  <br/>
                  A citizen investigator named Howard Caplan filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the Washington Metropolitan Police report and police photos from the December 4, 2016 “shooting incident” at Comet Ping Pong, because no person on Earth who actually gets paid to do “journalism” would do that. 
Howard Caplan’s FOIA request was denied in April for unexplained reasons, and he is appealing that decision. 
“We can neither admit nor deny the existence of any records responsive to your request pursuant to D.C. Official Code 2-534.” "

A narrative for the MSM - pizzagate is dangerous and believers are crazed gunmen
Any evidence was destroyed by an outside source (would raise obvious suspicion if CP told the MSM they smashed up their own harddrive)
