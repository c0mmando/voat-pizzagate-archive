            I am seeing more and more claiming Q is a Ciccada game in an effort to dismiss the drops as LARP. They will leave these comments on YouTube truther vids.
           </p>
           <p>
            That made me wonder how, even if it was a game, was this bad for enlightening people. It helped us with confirmation and clarity on a lot of issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thought about FBI Anon who told us "it's all in the cards".
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm wondering, could the map that Q left us could be used in conjunction with the illumaniti cards? Has anyone tried using those cards with information on the Ciccada website?? All games have instructions.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm just throwing this out there.

            Q kept talking about Y and owl and that the elite love to use symbols. There is a daycare thru the YMCA (also known as "The Y") called Y's Owls. The song written about the YMCA was sung by The Village people who were gay. The song says that a young man can play with all the boys. What's crazy is the YMCA song was written by Disney which is owned by the now arrested Prince Alwaleed who also owned floors of the Mandalay Bay that Paddock stayed in when the Vegas shootings took place.Here are the song's lyricshttps://www.lyrics.com/lyric/2590270/The+Village+People/Y.M.C.A.+%5B12%22+Version%5D 
The YMCA original logo is a Y made up of a black chevron(meaning a goat) and a red upside down triangle as seen here

            which is the patch the Nazi political prisoners wore. It is also the red upside down triangle logo for planned parenthood as seen here

            The YMCA is also affliliated with The Redwood Group that protects kids from pedophilia and drowning and sells insurance. They are based out of Morrisville NC just 30 or 40 miles from the Virginia border where all the missing kids are. Here is a link to the Redwood Group

            </a>
            Their logo is three chevrons with a pyramid or triangle at the bottom and is suppose to look like a redwood tree.
The YMCA has had their problems with pedophilia and is known to put on pizza pool parties as seen here

            Strange how Podestas home has a pic of dead kids at the bottom of a pool? Lots to research here and dig up. I found all this info in just an hour. This info might lead to the Pizzagate's pandora box being opened. Please investigate Anons!

            Q has mentioned Ys and Owl symbols. There is a daycare thru the YMCA called the Y's Owls! The YMCA has had many problems with pedophilia in it's ranks. The known classic song"YMCA" was sung by a gay band singing about men playing with boys and get this!!! The lyrics were written by Disney! Prince Alwaleed that was involved in the Vegas shooting and owned part of Mandalay Bay also owns Disney who puts sexual content in their children films. The Mandalay Bay is also in the shape of a Y. Qanon kept writing about Y and owls in the same sentence. I think this is a hot l;ead that could crack this Pandora's Pedo Box right open. Get sleuthing. I think this is a major key!

            Is there a clear motive for Q to post these things? What benefit does it provide? I'm skeptical that he'll start leading us in the wrong direction, or start asking for things to further a hidden agenda.

             Trump has to reveal all the stuff without BEING the person to reveal it.  The way a human works and especially a libtard is is if they think you are their enemy they wont listen or even read stuff...I found that out with my three so called almost genius sisters.....all libtards......all easily led......

             I think it was their college education and the fact they loved being the teachers pet as kids.....always wanted to be goody goody two shoes.....I always got in trouble and didnt go to college.....it saved my brain and was way better off in the long run.

           <p>
            The stuff about mass despair and violent mobs is exactly what I've been warning about for months as something we need to start being prepared for.
           </p>
           <p>
            Which is why certain "black pillers" around here (we ALL know who) need to be silenced. We cannot have them going around making things worse.

             Idk what you're larpfag terminology is supposed to mean, but you obviously haven't even taken the red pill so STFU.

            <p>
             Its not provocative or blackpilling to warn people that a violent racial conflict is inevitable, particularly as TPTB will crash the economy.  Like prison the races will trust their own  oth instinctively and because THATS ALREADY HOW WE LIVE!
            </p>
            <p>
             You might have noticed blacks loot in "violent mobs" ALREADY: in fact the idea of them even noticing the removal of half the govt is laughable.  THEY DONT EVEN VOTE YOU FUCKING MORON!  You don't know ANYTHING about race!
            </p>
            <p>
             I challenge you to refute this, you should be eager to get the better of me for once.

            <ol>
             <li>
              Minorities have less money than whites and always will
             </li>
             <li>
              Minorities (puppets of Jews) demand political power and handouts from whites
             </li>
             <li>
              Most children in the near future will be ethnic minorities whereas most retirees will be white
             </li>
             <li>
              In 2043 the country's "majority-minority" and they will have the political power to simply confiscate wealth
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             So tell me you
             <strong>
              WHY MINORITIES WHO ALREADY DEMAND HANDOUTS
              <em>
               NOW
              </em>
              WOULD PAY THE PENSIONS OF OLD WHITES WHO USED TO OPPRESS THEM?
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             More likely they will rape plunder and murder with IMPUNITY as faggot cuck whites like you get taken completely by surprise.  Although personally I hope you die sooner. And I'll tell you why: what I just described is exactly what's happening right now in South Africa and you think it's a big fucking joke.
            </p>
            <p>
             Guess who lobbied for DECADES to bring this situation about by handing power over to the Africans?  CAN YOU FUCKING GUESS, FAGGOT?

               I see you can't refute anything either, but that's how a discussion board works, so you two LOSE.  You are NOT EVEN HALF-MEN; your entire role is to be PREPARED FOR POSSIBLE CATASTROPHES AND PROTECT YOUR FAMILIES but you are totally oblivious to reality.

               I also proved your "framing us as anti-Semitic" hand-wringing is just more LARPFAGGOTRY FROM THE FAGGOT KING HIMSELF.  Even the Jewish WaPo, in an article about Jews which quotes Alefantis and mentions PG, said NOTHING.

               I'm glad people hate me.  Makes me stand out more, and we all know I'm right anyway.  Indeed you just said race isn't a factor -- WHEN THE CULPRITS ARE LITERALLY A SINGLE MINUTE RACIAL GROUP!

                Judaism is a religion parading as a race , if you say " I hate Jews" your deemed a racist because everyone thinks they're a race , you hate Jews (👍) but also hate brown people (👎), you sound like an idiot when you claim Judaism is a race.

                   It's literally a race parading as a religion.  When the Talmud was first discovered by Europeans in the middle ages they were quite shocked by the ethnocentrism.

                     I'm here because I had an alert. Donkey is no guy to me. He's a little faggot. I don't owe him or you any proof. Pay for a damn DNA test if you're so curious. I told you before that I think you may be Donkeyhote. Then you answered with the correct spelling. Maybe that's why you are starting to write me all the time. Because Donkey is obsessed with me! Why else would you need to go protect his bitch ass?

              You really are something to behold.  Possibly the stupidest bitch I have ever encountered.  Half your comments are "Oh I get it now" where you failed to understand a sequence of replies or didn't know a word.

              I hope you choke on something that was clearly too big to fit in your mouth.  Like my FAT UNCIRCUMCISED COCK.

                My first encounter with
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/srayzie">
                 @srayzie
                </a>
                was her describing how horny she gets when I tell her to shut the fuck up and let the men work.
               </p>
               <p>
                That reaction is completely understandable from a bio-evolutionary standpoint -- and that's why the shitty romance novels WRITTEN FOR WOMEN BY WOMEN are about a guy who looks like me rescuing a bitch and ravishing her without even asking.   Men and women deep down both know this is the natural sexual dynamic.  Hell I'm getting a boner just thinking about it.
               </p>
               <p>
                It couldn't be clearer that's what happened here.  All that's left to know is whether you used a vibrator or merely diddled your bean like crayzie.

             Funny how "da Joos" are so complicit in everything, yet THEIR Holy book is the only one that specifically warns against and excoriates those that cause their children to "pass thru the fire" (human sacrifices to Moloch.

              LOL...Jews dont follow the Torah....that is old timey stuff...the Jew is modern...they follow the Talmud.  Which discusses how fucking a goat or a Goyim kid....doesnt make the Jew a fucking criminal or scum....no the three year old kid or the goat has sinned by "making" the Jew transgress.
             </p>
             <p>
              Listen the Jew is all about getting around the rules of god.  They make machines that turn on on friday at their sundown all jews must hide rules.....when the sun goes down no jew can used electricity....but if the oven magically turns on...well now they can throw some food in the oven and take it out.....so they get around the sprit of the law with a jew trick....
             </p>
             <p>
              Jews make CPAP machines that turn on by just putting them on your face and sucking in hard two or three times....because the Jew isnt allowed to turn it on himself....but if it magically turns on...the Jew can use CPAP all night...
             </p>
             <p>
              See how a Jew thinks?  They are fucking morons.....
             </p>
             <p>
              It is why they make good lawyers...it is all they do as rabbis....it is their fucking religion...sitting around thinking of ways to cheat the system...whatever the system is.

               It would be good if your arguments weren't self-contradictory.
Da Joos t follow Torah anymore they follow Talmud....
...but they observe the Sabbath but cheat....

                   Report me all you want, you douchebag.  The mods can take a look at all my posts very easily.
                   <br/>
                   You say you've reported me twice now, but I haven't heard a word from anyone.....Guessing you don't have much credibility around here....or anywhere else.
You're butt-hurt that I don't join in your ridiculous DaJoos daJoos antiSemitic bigot-fest......anyone who reads YOUR posts sees an emotional infant that reacts like a slug to salt when anyone expresses disagreement...."Reported!"  "Paid shill!".....SO tiresome.

There is so many distractions, deflections, miss information, white washing, and smoke screens but even with all this noise &amp; camouflage it is still very easy to identify the Jewish organization having played a consistent roll in it all over multiple generations.
            </p>
            <p>
             You cannot have such a tiny minority group (measured as a Race or as a Religion) and yet somehow they hold all key positions in elicit trades &amp; areas of vice across multiple geographies. They have successfully infiltrated all economic, intelligence, and political choke points of multiple governments. No other group is so organized, financed, well connected, heavily represented and ferociously defended. Jewishness is nothing more than membership to a global criminal syndicate that uses racial, cultural and religion as cover.

              Yeah its the fucking Jews.....but I am not sure the ultimate leadership isnt some European Royal....but honestly it wouldnt surprise me if the Jew didnt blackmail or bribe the dumb Goyim Royals to let them cuckoo egg into their royal families....because the Jew really does think that way.  And they love leaving their inbred scum children all over the place...the watch them and see if they show talent.  If they can sing they make them rock stars.....Linkin Park, Kiss just for starters.  Or if they talk a good bullshit game they become politicans....if all they can do is be underhanded and sneaky....like the talentless Podesta clan....you put them in politics.  The Podesta family is way more connected than I thought.  Same for cuckoo's egg alefantis.....

              Someone close to me made that post in my name.....he did not want to use his own account.  But he also believes that Trump and all the big people around him go over the Q stuff...so it will make an exact match difficult because most likely other people are inputting stuff themselves and changing the vocabulary.
             </p>
             <p>
              And honestly it does not matter who Q is.  They have proven to me they are legit and are very well placed in the Trump camp....and they obviously have the go ahead with it.
             </p>
             <p>
              With what we all learned this last year Q has just made it that much more certain in my mind.

              Miller is definitely smart enough to be Q but if he is why isn't Trump doing more to expose the cabal and stop the bullshit Russia hacked our election nonsense? Miller if he is Q could save the world if he can get Trump to give a major TV speech explaining everything and ordering the military to round up all the traitors.

               Trump wants the Russian malarkey to continue. In the end its not going to damage him because he's innocent, and all the while the Dems keep investing faith in it they are not looking to their defences

               You're missing the big point: Trump is running a giant bait-and-switch. He turned Mueller early on, and they've all been acting out a school play involving Russian collusion while they set up the big take down of the Clinton/Obama/bankster cabal. That's the theory anyway. Time will tell.

                I have no idea about Mueller. But I was absolutely shocked when it was released he's only spent 5 million on the investigation. That is nothing for almost a year with how many top lawyers?

                To put it in perspective, megyn Kelley makes 23 million a year.

             One thing to think about is.... why?
Are sex acts with children and torturing them and trafficking them so important in their overall operation??? Obviously so if they risked it to talk about it. Gives you something to think about.

             The "sustainable sea" is a double entendre. The "sea" is the Sea Of Humanity. We are the "fish" that live in the Sea Of Humanity. Their goal is to hook us with their fish bait. Making the sea "sustainable" means keeping the fish farm (our prison) well maintained so that we can be exploited.
            </p>
            <p>
             When JP says he is worried about the "ocean's sustainability" what he truly means is that he fears his cult is losing control because people are waking up. Actually, he does not fear it, he knows it. His tweets about concern for the "oceans" are signals to his buddies about his fears of losing control of our perspectives and our captivity. He is afraid that too many of us are swimming out of muddy layers and into the clear water of true vision.
