            If you  genuinely think that you are on to something with this Peter Thiel guy, then maintain your integrity as you keep researching into it. So far it just looks like you're trying to BS this into the narrative which kills the interest/credibility, presumably not what you want, right? In the thread title you have changed the words to make it fit your narrative, perhaps in an effort to get people to look into it (best devil's advocate I can come up with for you).
           </p>
           <p>
            Your thread title being:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Pizzagate's Peter Thiel believes death is nothing but a bug in the feature set of mankind, and one can avoid Death by Debugged Children
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            When what the article actually says is:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Peter Thiel believes death is nothing but a bug in the feature set of mankind, and one he can buy his way out of.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            No mention of children at all. Even when I follow the sources linked by the article itself, there is no mention of children. So now imagine someone who doesn't have as much free time as I do right now, sitting there not only knowing that you bullshitted them, but then thinking that you also wasted their time.
           </p>
           <p>
            A better way to approach it, is to first of all take it over to
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Conspiracy">
             r/Conspiracy
            </a>
            , because none of this is pedo-related specifically, but it's still significant enough to be worth floating past people. Perhaps it can be tied in more at a later time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Use this article:
            <a href="http://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/peter-thiel-live-forever.html">
             http://www.inc.com/jeff-bercovici/peter-thiel-live-forever.html
            </a>
            <a href="http://archive.is/Ii4kP">
             http://archive.is/Ii4kP
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Encourage people to read it, but then emphasize these parts:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I talked to the billionaire venture capitalist about why he's been putting so much of his time and money into biotech startups, particularly those focused on health and human biology.
            </p>
            <p>
             But death isn't an on-off switch, Thiel believes. If we "cure" it, it will happen one increment at a time: a cure for Alzheimer's disease here, a remedy for sarcopenia there, each one supplying a small piece of the overall anti-aging puzzle.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Then follow up with this:
            <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112829-blood-from-human-teens-rejuvenates-body-and-brains-of-old-mice/">

            Let people research who this guy is, and draw their own conclusions. The conclusions that people form on their own lead to stronger convictions. Leave the bread crumbs and let people learn of their own volition.

             Thiel has also postured as a libertarian, and even as his ideology shifts toward something more nihilistic — The Economist now calls him a “corporate Nietzschean” — he continues to rail against government programs like Medicare and Social Security. Meanwhile, he is chairman and co-founder of Palantir Technologies, a mass-surveillance-software company that makes a good deal of its money selling to the government; Palantir’s clients reportedly include the Department of Defense (including the NSA and various military branches), the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the CIA. Thiel is, inexplicably, pro-monopoly. And don’t forget that Peter Thiel believes death is nothing but a bug in the feature set of mankind, and one he can buy his way out of.
