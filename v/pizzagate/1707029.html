            Ronnie Leon Hyde
On June 5, 1994, a dismembered torso was discovered behind a gas station dumpster in Columbia County, Florida. The identity of the victim was only recently confirmed to be a 16-year-old male from Yulee, Florida. Hyde was a known associate of the victim’s family at the time of the teen’s disappearance.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI has confirmed that Hyde was also a named suspect in a previous international child exploitation investigation
           </p>
           <p>
            Hyde’s employment history includes providing counseling services at multiple organizations, and the potential for extensive access to children

                  I had commented on this. I also would love to hear how I or someone could get the actual trial transcripts as I think there'd be interesting things to find. I think or spidey senses feel the possibility he was a spook needs to be considered. Or plain old crazy as he was his own attorney in his trial. He also had outlandish claims and was considered bizarre. Which is why I'd love to see transcripts!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Largely from memory but have links too:  in 2008-09 he worked for Blackrock in Camp Bucca.  Yep
                  <em>
                   that
                  </em>
                  Camp Bucca.  I think that might have some significance as is considered starting training/recruitment place for ISIS. What he did was get access to computer levels he should not have had and sell access to the info. He also would print up ID cards that allowed Iraqis to walk around where they didn't necessarily belong. A woman/wife was involved too. I don't recall her name off hand but she wasn't US citizen.Became naturalized and wasn't considered involved in the theft of info. But sentenced to time served for immigration violations. DoD fired him I think 2010- but didn't prosecute as it didn't hit $500K amount which is where they decide to prosecute. What reaches level of WTH is how did he get fired from THAT and go on to get hired with another contractor?  Haven't made connections yet but plan on looking.What was he doing between being fired and then hired to Harris Corp. ?
I need to do more on Harris Corp in another post or I will add here later.

                  "Glenn was hired by the
                  <strong>
                   Harris Corp. in 2012
                  </strong>
                  even though he was expelled from a U.S. Army base in Iraq three years earlier. Army officials discovered that while employed by government contractors in 2008 and 2009, Glenn hacked into a U.S. database as part of a side job for Iraqi companies. Military lawyers decided not to file charges, saying the amount of the fraud, estimated at $17,000, wasn’t worth prosecution, court documents show."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So- 2012 through 2014 -he had moved to work at the U.S. Army Southern Command’s Joint Task Force Bravo, JTF-B in Soto Cano Air Base.  With his neighbors (a couple also convicted of trafficking)  he starts convincing parents of young girls for them to live with him and even married I think one or two. Appears he was or became Muslim! So one article (Spanish) mentioned he was procuring
                  <em>
                   young girls and then selling them on internet for 10-30K
                  </em>
                  . AND he also accessed top secret and 1000 emails and files he wasn't supposed to .17 June, 2012 is said when he took files. I am trying to remember history and also think about how would the following files have been helpful. :
 Focused on US military activities in the Middle East. The eight documents listed in court files are:
A. Seminar 1, Strategic Seminar Series, dated 28 January 2012
B. Seminar 2, Strategic Seminar Series, dated 21 March 2012
C. Seminar 3, Strategic Seminar Series, dated 14 May 2012
D. Information Paper on Qatar Key Issues
E. Information Paper on Saudi Arabia Key Issues
F. Information Paper on United Arab Emirates Key Issues
G. Information Paper on Bahrain Key Issues
H. Electronic mail message dated June 13, 2012, Concerning Security of US Personnel in Iraq
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Name of 2 wives: Khadraa Adeeb, Sinea Orellana
He also had 2-3 aka : Derek John Michael, which he used to obtain fraudulent driver's licenses in Texas and California, Fernando Albergue and "Mr. Michael"
Other family : Mother is "Ruth Andrews"  mentioned in article he was living with her in West Palm Beach. These names I am pretty sure are related: Oliver W Andrews ,Emily A Glenn ,Michael James Glenn Robert J Glenn. Also cp from 2005/06 from mexican 13yr old he lived with was found on computer.

                   I think this could be really big. The connection to camp bucca is very interesting. Bucca was listed in this article about torture and rape in Iraqi prisons.
