<p>Two Key Findings Here:  Gujarat (We will revisit) - and Jay Laxmi Ind Estate
From here, I looked up Jay Laxmi Ind. Estate;  Top hit on Google led to this:  
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.momentstocherish.in/index.html">http://www.momentstocherish.in/index.html</a>
- Now check out the logo and recall the FBIs document regarding pedo symbols - specifically the butterfly with heart wings (Streaming photos: Picture of a child with mouth wide open covered in chocolate, creepy woman smile with bread around face? - again could be nothing).  Went to the contact tab.  On the bottom of the page, bank details are listed  (I have no idea if that is relevant - just thought it was strange?).  The testimonial  on the bottom right of the page is very &quot;cryptic&quot; for lack of a better word.<br />
- Address now says Mumbai</p>
<p>The only other company I could find related to JAY LAXMI IND ESTATE - something called HOUSTON Training &amp; Skill Upgradation Academy - summary mission statement is: <a href="https://plus.google.com/106620158581705252063">https://plus.google.com/106620158581705252063</a></p>
<p>It says: &quot;A Place Exclusively Designed for Recruitment agencies !!!!!! A place to Conduct your Interviews … A place to conduct your Trade test to confirm your selection!! A place to Upgrade the skills of  your Candidates…. A place to conduct your Seminars &amp; Meetings...Now opened at  Mumbai , Delhi and Gorakhpur with huge space considering the requirement of our esteem clients and their satisfaction.&quot;
- Huge spaces for esteem clients to perform interviews, trade tests to confirm selection, and upgrade skills of candidates.  Kinda strange? Maybe not. 
- Mentions Mumbai (~10 hours from Gujurat)</p>
<p>Now Back to Gujurat: 
- In 2001, Gujurat suffered a massive earthquake that killed 20,000 and injured another 160,000.  Who came to the rescue and immediately was caught in a scandal: none other than Bill and the CF - promised to start the American India Foundation - where only 2.7 million of 53 million raised went to help rebuild a few houses in 7 (and not the 100 promised villages).  This link below will give more details.</p>

<p>For those that took the time to read this far, thank you.  Again, I hope this is relevant and I didn\'t just waste a bunch of mine and yours time.  I\'m honestly not sure what to make of these connections other than another possible front for money laundering and child trafficking sites?  Is it normal to list bank numbers like that?</p>
<p>God bless all of you who are doing this research.  Make sure to step aside, take some time to breathe a little and pray for these children.  Prayer is powerful.  Don\'t stop fighting.</p>

            These companies like S J Machine tools are often front companies for illegal activities. They could be trafficking spots that allow transport of drugs, weapons or children. Sometimes weapons go out and drugs and children come in from overseas. Illegal weapons transfers help arm CIA-backed rebels in the middle east and the rebels send back drugs and children. One thing to look for is an army base or arsenal nearby any of the front businesses because sometimes that's where they buy weapons off the books.

            When I went to that site the first thing I seen was a child with hands covered in chocolate and immediately thought of that spirit cooking pic of the dead body in the blood.
The next thing I seen was that logo you pointed out. Notice the heart has what looks like baphomet horns coming out of the sides of it?
