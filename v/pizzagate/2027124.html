            The only innocent explanation I can give is for the stuffed toys. They may belong to Tony's wife. That may be strange to some people that a grown woman keeps stuffed toys but it does happen. Great article though and one everyone who dismisses PG should read.

            Kudos for laying out a handful of comprehendible facts on the table. My only qualm here is that many relevant facts regarding Podesta were left out. As repetitive as it may sound, you don't fully do the PizzaGate argument justice without properly bringing up the FBI's official "known Pedophile symbolism and code". The infamous WikiLeaks Podesta Hot Tub and handkerchief e-mail are definitely substantial.
           </p>
           <p>
            If I'm not mistaken the woman Tamera Luzzatto writing Podesta
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">
             in the Hot Tub E-mail
            </a>
            was proven to have a highly suspect blog herself where she appeared to advertise nude images for sale of her own grandchildren. Harsh and deep, but true.

            <p>
             The codewords are made up.  The codeword list that pasted around is a hoax.  There's no evidence whatsoever for that list existing prior to the Podesta emails.
            </p>
            <p>
             Given that this code does not exist, you cannot read the Podesta emails and substitute the code.  You are basically making up evidence at that point.

              As fatyshorts2 previously stated, on the Dark Web the term Cheese Pizza is code for Child Porn. This is a known fact you could easily verify yourself by logging on to the Deep Web and do a little browsing. The list is not a hoax, it was compiled by someone who has thorough knowledge of the morbid underground scene of the Deep Web... Other terms like "hot dog" and "pasta" are absolutely used as well in Child porn communities on the Deep Web... Then there's

               The Handkerchief code

              also a known code used in the Homosexuality community. Code Podesta could be using

               It's an absolute hoax, there's no evidence for this "list" existing before Podesta's emails came out.  No one who actually wanted to investigate pasta with walnut sauce would think it's code.

               Yes. Tons.   The main being they didn't come from the FBI, they came from an anonymous user on 4chan.  The other being, they don't even exist as any code list before that user posted, let alone "an FBI list."  They are a deliberate hoax, in my opinion.  It's quite easy to dump a dataset and analyze frequent words.  This is how word clouds are made.  The hoaxers then chose which words to map to a code and thus completely change the meanings of innocent emails.

               As the commenter above notes one phrase was known slang.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Not entirely true. Cheese Pizza = CP = Child Porn. For MANY years before Podesta.
               </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               This is actually proves my point.  One phrase is not a list.
Also, search the Podesta files on Wikileaks, the phrase "cheese pizza" never appears once.   So Podesta doesn't even used the one phrase that can be code.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also the whole pizzagate investigation is distorted in a major way. 99.9% of references to pizza are in no way involved in pedophilia, so it's an absolutely terrible indicator if someone is a pedophile.  This is completely ignored, by most folks on here.

               Yes, Handkerchiefs codes have existed, but they would have no use amongst a small group of friends.  They were for use with strangers in public in gay bars in the 1970s and 1980's.
              </p>
              <p>
               The image you point has no code for the type of handkerchief found.  In fact, people took it upon themselves to create a hoax image where they falsely inserted new information for what white would mean

                One from a government employee is enough for me. That email doesn't at all seem weird to you? Why send that email if it wasn't important and if mundane why send the email at all? We've seen enough through Instagram with people associating this pedo shit to pizza and other terms and then we have him associated with handkerchief code and pizza.
               </p>
               <p>
                That together with everything else in the emails everyone found and cover ups and the constant attempt to try to derail pizza gate narrative is enough for people to know there's something deeper to be found.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you looked at the majority of the pizza gate info and you're still not convinced there's something super shitting going on then I won't be wasting my time with you.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm not here to convince you. Go out there and find that all the info yourself if you care, if you don't it's not my problem.

                 You're missing the point.  A single instance means they don't talk about this much and it's an anomaly.   It's a giant, giant leap of logic and reasonableness to assume this has to do with sex in any form.  "Anomaly hunting"  .....explain this one wierd part and ignore all the other contrary evidence..... is a key way to build conspiracies theories.  If you actually looked at all the evidence logically, the theory would collapse.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You're building a mountain out of evidence that never comes close to proving a single thing.  The whole way that mountain supports itself, is if you don't actually care if anything is proven.

                  Well if that shit came up in the email means they are doing that shit so much they aren't careful enough to cover their trail if it makes it's way to government emails. Just think. Them tied to the clinton foundation and that being tied to the trafficking in haiti where bill clinton came and showed his repeated cover up pattern and you start putting shit together and you realize what you are looking at is dipshits who fucked up and thought they were slick but now the house of cards is tumbling.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Just look at how much oppression there is to hide it, that's the first indicator that you are onto something here. We are all here to see all of those fucks come forward and show us what they meant in the emails, no one has come foreward to show anything. So they aren't going to come and show us after this much suspicion that there is a logical explanation for their emails beyond the truth and pieces of truth people put together on their own, so now they have this shit storm to deal with and its all coming apart. Slowly but surely they will lose.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So exactly man I'm not building a mountain of evidence, there's a heaping pile of suspicion they did nothing to even attempt to disspell, they just let it get worse and worse and still don't come out and address any of it.  If someone called you a pedophile, the first thing I bet you would try to do is come out to clear your fucking name dude especially if it was spread online virally faster than a California forest fire. Not hide and pay trolls to fuck shit up for them in forums while they hide and say nothing to explain any of it and cherry pick the shit they want to answer because it's easy to answer. They are nothing but cowards and absolutely nothing to be afraid of. There are far more of us than them. They are powerless cunts.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Everyone needs to keep digging for the real truth until we make a fucking change.
