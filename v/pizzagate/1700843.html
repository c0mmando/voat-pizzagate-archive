<p>Below is the latest/yesterday\'s question and answer by FBI Anon: </p>
<p>Q. Thank you for talking with us. What do you think of Trump’s allegations against Obama? 
A. In the worlds of the Carpenters, “its only just begun” </p>
<p>Q. So was Trump wiretapped as our DHS insider and Robert Steele suggest 
A. Yes. </p>
<p>Q. Why? 
A. Wrong question </p>
<p>Q. Ok, by whom? 
A. Trump tower was bugged by more than just our IC. </p>
<p>Q. WHAT????? Could you elaborate? 
A. Brits, Israeli’s. In the fullness of time, much will be revealed </p>
<p>Q. Why the Brits? 
A. The same reason as the Israeli’s. Trump is a threat to the Deep State. The Deep State is a threat to Trump. Globalists are the populations bee keepers. They harness the energy, they harness the honey. Controlled oppression. </p>
<p>Q. So why do you and other insiders leak to us and others? 
A. Because once in a while, a bat needs to be taken to the bee hive. </p>
<p>Q. So you want the bees swarming? 
A. In a manner of speaking. We leak, so that the people may have a just outrage and demand a just result. The People outnumber the Government 300 to 1. It’s a numbers game. We expected high level arrests to happen weeks ago, but discovered the bee keepers had interfered at the highest levels. There is an internal war within our Government, as many know. The Shadow State is like a vampire facing dawn. They do not go easily into sunlit areas. </p>
<p>Q. So why did the Israeli’s bug Trump 
A The same reason they keep close tabs on Jared Kushner, who I fully expect will be let go by Trump soon. There is too much liability with Kushner. Kushner has pressure from the Israeli lobby and Trump knows he is a delivery boy for AIPAC. The Israeli’s bugged Trump because they were concerned about Bannon, America First, the possibility that with a Trump win, they would see their foreign aid cut, which by the way, is going to happen. </p>
<p>Q. What do you think of David Seaman? Is he a Mossad asset? 
A. Never heard of him. </p>
<p>Q. How will this all play out? 
A. We are entering a time of political purge – the likes of which has not been seen for decades, if not centuries. Trump has the evidence he needs to launch an investigation into a myriad of DC collusions. He must concentrate on the communications between Lynch, Bill Clinton, Obama, and Brennan. He needs to get serious with the pedophilia investigation because he can bring down his enemies in one fell swoop. McCain, Graham, Obama, Bill Clinton, and so on… His greatest tools include the Wiener file titled “Life Insurance“. (Names, dates, photo’s, videos) and the Epstein videos captured by NSA when they were being delivered to Israeli intel, Wiener and Epstein. But, his greatest tool is the collective rage of the People. Trump must prosecute #PedoGate. The relationship between Schumer and Wiener must be explored. It may lead to some stunning climaxes, if you can excuse the pun. </p>
<p>Q. This is huge! 
A. As I said before, there is enough underbelly rot to collapse not only our Government, but collapse the Likud part in Israel and expose a huge political pedophile ring that exists in the US, UK, Asia, etc. All inter-connected. And that’s not even venturing into the extortion aspect. </p>
<p>Q. Will it get bloody? 
A. Lets just say its flag weather. </p>
<p>Q. Any advice for Trump? 
A He who hesitates is lost…..</p>',

            'Q. What do you think of David Seaman? Is he a Mossad asset? A. Never heard of him." LOL. Kind of my take on (until all the seamangaters took over voat) all the spec surrounding Seaman. Dudes a bit nutzbar (just from where I'm sitting at least), doesn't really produce verifiable content, yet somehow he's dangerous enough for the body language "experts" of YT to "expose" him.

            More vague, cryptic hints/ LARPing. If these people knew anything at all they could just come out and say it instead of "In the fullness of time, much will be revealed". And to quote the Carpenter's? lol it's WE'VE only just begun btw. He says a lot of things without really saying anything at all. This was linked from the actual 4chan post yesterday or the day before when it happened anyway.

             FBIAnon has been posting since July and a lot of what he "predicted" panned out.  I think it's worth reading and considering Just in case he's legit

              What exactly panned out? When you speak in such vague terms as he does it's easy to make something fit. At some point you gotta tune out some of the bullshit and focus on hard leads. He says nothing new that wasn't already known and offers zero reason to believe he is legit. I don't know why people are so ready to latch on to this guy. If he actually knew anything he could have just came out and said it but he never does. I wonder why?

               He's a little nutty.  I agree.  But I don't think he's against us.  I think that being exCIA and now on the other side has led to him being a little wacky

Just basing that on this narrative that has been building.

              both, right? they are still trying, I guess. I wonder if the vault 7 release will have evidence or be a dud. It would be really nice to get some arrests. The part about Kushner is weird, how can trump get rid of Ivanka husband? I mean he can stop involving him to some degree, but he seems to really count on Ivanka.

            We need to tweet to Trump to have courage and prosecute #Pedogate.  He needs to find the courage.  I think they are threatening him as well as distracting him - look at what is going on with North Korea - dont think for one second that the globalists didn't plan this North Korea activity.  Kim Un is likely in their sick pedo club.
           </p>
           <p>
            The one world order would rather orchestrate a nuclear war to distract the citizens of the world and President Trump from pedogate.  They have the power to do this, and that's what they are doing.

             north (and south) korea is stuck in a triangle between china, japan and russia. Koreas would have unified long ago but It is strategic for the US (and South Korea - we are their growth $$ market) to keep our base in Seoul, so we prevent that. North Korea has no resources, so when they get hungry and need food they lobby bombs and poke the border, and they get money. they are not as much a threat, as a nation kept in a geographical / political cage.

              Well you see, that's just awful. I've seen pics of them starving etc.  there's plenty enough to go around, but the one world order has taken all the money for themselves and most of it is OUR money that WE earned

               It makes me so angry when I think about how it's being revealed now just how much of the really shit terrible things that have happened over the past century were not only compeltely avoidable, but were deliberately planned and set in motion just so some inbred narcissists could feel like they have the biggest dick in the world. You're right, the wealth of this world belongs to us, our labour and our creativity and imaginations have brought so much that is good to the world, or could have been good, if it wasn't all snaffled straight away by the dirty 'elites' and diverted into being either hoarded and collected dust or used for evil on an unimaginable scale. The good thing is, though, thinking about how wonderful the world will be when we've gotten rid of them and value decent, kind-hearted people once again, over people who are ruthless when it comes to making obscene amounts of money.

               yeah, they are kind of fucked. a lot korea families got divided and there were pushes for unification but that was derailed and now those people are dying off, I used to have contacts in South K but not recently.
