Recently, I was reading this post (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2923497">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2923497</a>) by <a href="https://voat.co/u/5c4RFAC3">@5c4RFAC3</a> and I thought to myself before, &quot;I know I have archived google maps before.&quot; So, I dug through my comment history and found the time I had done it before. (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2321290/11532957">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2321290/11532957</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2321290/11533053">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2321290/11533053</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2321236/11533176">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2321236/11533176</a>) To archive Google Maps, you have to go through the website <a href="urlbox.io">urlbox.io</a></p>
<p>First, get the URL of the Google map image you want. I haven\'t figured out how to do it with mapstreetview.com yet so you will have to go though google.com for now. Take the best security measures that you can, such as using a VPN. For this example, I will use the July 2017 image of Besta Pizza that <a href="https://voat.co/u/5c4RFAC3">@5c4RFAC3</a> requested. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/4707+Chase+Ave,+Bethesda,+MD+20814,+Сполучені+Штати+Америки/@38.989605,-77.0945857,3a,75y,340.93h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sifwMS3NjNyy-VTsv0TppBg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7c96427bef9eb:0x4856bceaf743648b!8m2!3d38.989739!4d-77.0946226">https://www.google.com/maps/place/4707+Chase+Ave,+Bethesda,+MD+20814,+Сполучені+Штати+Америки/@38.989605,-77.0945857,3a,75y,340.93h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sifwMS3NjNyy-VTsv0TppBg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x89b7c96427bef9eb:0x4856bceaf743648b!8m2!3d38.989739!4d-77.0946226</a></p>
<p>Second, make sure the street view image is not zoomed in. If you can try it zoomed in, but URLbox only pulls data for the screenshot for a certain amount of time. Zoomed-in images often take too long to load for URLbox to capture them.</p>
<p>Third, copy the Google URL and paste it in the &quot;try it now&quot; spot on <a href="urlbox.io">urlbox.io</a>. Don\'t worry, you don\'t need to make an account, the free trial will work just fine.</p>
<p>Fourth, after it takes the screenshot, copy the new URL below the image (not the one above the image) and paste it in archive.is. Otherwise, click on the new screenshot. The new screenshot will appear full-screen and you can copy the URL from your address bar and paste it in archive.is, as it is the same new screenshot URL. </p>

<p>Archive of the URLbox Image: <a href="http://archive.li/eIOe7">http://archive.li/eIOe7</a></p>
<p>Unless you have the exact URLbox link, don\'t expect to find the image when you search on archive.is because the original Google Map address will have / instead of %2F and other symbol changes. Because of that, make sure you keep track of the new archive.is link. At least the image is verified by the original URL appearing in the URLbox URL. </p>
<p>It has been a year since I last did it so I don\'t remember how to get the side picture to disappear but that could have something to do with how Google runs its system. If any of you know how to get the screenshot not to include that let me know in the comments below. </p>

             I just looked at your recent submissions and it looked like you just got a collection of sources that don't like archive.is. Some websites block archive.is directly because it is a European domain. Other times, the website won't archive correctly depending on how it is set up. In that case you just have to try a work around through another site. You will see in the comment section of one of the posts that I had to try a bunch of archival sites before getting one to work.

               Ya know, it's tough because on the whole, archive.is is the best for our type of work. Being in Iceland, foreign governments can't easily take down material. Also, if you have to archive a page from another archival site, archive.is includes both URLs for reference. But since you asked I will give pros and cons of all of the archiving sites I know of.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Archive.org
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Pros: It can archive most pages, including those who have geo-blocked archive.is. Once a page has been archved there, it regularly caches the page on its own in case new updates happen.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cons: In the United States so people can sue to get information removed
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Megalodon.jp
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Pros: Not located in the United States.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cons: If archive.is and archve.org can't archive the page, Megalodon probably can't either. I have only encountered a few sites that Megalodon could archive that wouldn't archive elsewhere.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Perma.cc
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Pros: You can archive pretty much every site. It even allows you to archive Instagram posts. However, Instagram posts are private. (See my other thread for instructions on how to publicly archive Instagram posts.
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2865313">
                https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2865313
               </a>
               )
              </p>
              <p>
               Cons: Have to sign up to use. Also, you can't search for other pages like on archive.is and archive.org on the site itself.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                FreezePage.com
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Pros: Can sometimes archive webpages that other sites can't.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cons: Super slow to load pages. Also, you can't search for previously archived pages.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Cache Feature of Search Engines: Google, Bing, Yandex, Gigablast,
                <a href="https://www.exalead.com/search/web/">
                 Exalead
                </a>
                , and NewsLookUp
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Pros: You can pull up slightly older versions of a webpage as the cached page isn't current. If you archive the page through archive.is, it will include the original URL in addition to the cache URL.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cons: You have to archive the page through another site such as archive.is as the cached page may be erased within 60 days or replaced by a newer version of the page sooner than that. Sometimes the web page formatting is wrong and pictures in articles may not be cached.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bing Pros: It caches a lot of YouTube pages that Google does not as Google owns YouTube and doesn't see much of a reason to cache YouTube pages without the video.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bing cons: When you archive on archive.is, it is no longer showing the original URL A message will need to be sent to archive.is as the people there are usually good about fixing that sort of thing.
              </p>
              <p>
               Gigablast Pros: If a URL isn't in its "collection", it gives you an option to add it in real time.
              </p>
              <p>
               Exalead Pro/Con: If a URL isn't in its "collection", you can submit a website to add to the cache but you have to include an email and there is no timeframe on them adding it.

              </p>
              <p>
               Exalead and Gigablast Cons: There aren't many webpages on those sites.
              </p>
              <p>
               NewsLookUp Cons: It is limited to news articles.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                Screenshot-Only Archives: Snapito.com and URLBox.io
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Pros: Can archive websites that don't typically allow archives in the source code. Also, the URL created includes the original webpage URL.
              </p>
              <p>
               Cons: Because it is only a screenshot, you can't copy text from it. Since the screenshots aren't guaranteed to be stored for any length of time, you will want to archive the screenshot through another website such as archive.is. However, archive.is doesn't currently include the original URL of the website.
              </p>
              <p>
               URLBox Pro: It can capture Google Maps screenshots
              </p>
              <p>
               Snapito Cons: It does not capture Google Maps screenshots.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                https://unv.is
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Pros: By only using text, it removes any ads that archive.is doesn't. The original URL does show up on archive.is
              </p>
              <p>
               Cons: It is only text, so you miss any important images. Also, most websites that don't archive under archive.is or archive.org won't archive here. Since it isn't an archival site per se, you have to archive the page through another site like archive.is.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are other archiving sites that I have not used, such as Archive-it. Archive-it seems to be a more user-managed portion of archive.org, so if a webpage won't archive on archive.org, I'm guessing it won't archive on Archive-it.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you ever need to search for a web page across all major archival sites use
               <a href="http://timetravel.mementoweb.org">
                http://timetravel.mementoweb.org
               </a>
               . That site pulls from many more other sites, such as the UK government archives, most of which require an email address just to ask a human that a page be archived. When you want to archive something right away, that isn't really effective.
              </p>
              <p>
               That was probably more information than you wanted, but I hope it helps.

               Well, take a look at the list of archiving sites in my reply above
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2928148/15708590">
                https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2928148/15708590
               </a>
               . If any links aren't archiving for you, feel free to PM me the URL before you post it and I'll see what I can come up with.
