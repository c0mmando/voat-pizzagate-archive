            we are in such a tough spot because on one hand, people can' t whistleblow if they aren't aware of the crimes but so many are complicit in the crimes its hard to tell the difference where they stand.  I don't see Snow as having profited and living an easy life the way that other pedo-social climbers have. To me his writings and the radio clips and his Ted talk show a guy who is affected by suffering, his own and others, but I really don't know that much about him and will be open to actual evidence.

            I haven't read the book but its possible that Snow started researching it based on what he saw.
           </p>
           <p>
            I once went to a lecture by the Canadian guy who was in charge of peacekeeping forces for the UN during the Rwanda genocide and due to his experience there he nearly killed himself. He left the job so distraught by what he saw and was up against (by internal UN policies) that he became suicidal and alcoholic and it  took him years to recover. He eventually started doing a lecture circuit and giving presentations to expose the atrocity of what was really going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't remember his name but he had very disturbing pictures, first hand accounts of how the Belgian government incited contentions between the two local formerly peaceful tribes, provided them with weapons, and worst of all, how he was directed to force his people to stand down and not stop the brutal killings right in front of them.  As you can imagine, he had nothing good to say about the UN (or Bill Clinton) and yet he had worked there for many years up to that.

            Yes! And there have been some great posts here on this subject. As far as I know the title you cite is in reference to Connecticut Family Court but apparently Harmon Snow has also written another book that is nationwide in scope. I can't remember the title but a search should find it.

            I very much agree he is suspect.  As usual some of these authors of books make some very good points and then OH OH there it is the Bingo Moment.  Yes, by all means, they are good at distracting us form what some Drs. and the Psychiatric Community have been trying to steer us away from.  Their involvement and their trying to change the outlook on the Memories of these Children.  Horrifying, imo.

             Here is a short radio clip featuring Snow, there is a lot about him online including TED talks. I don't think Snow is 'in on it" He's working to bring attention to US/Western war crimes in Africa and not a fan of US gov.

               I could be wrong but he doesn't give pedo vibe. His ted talk didn't say much but was anti-globalism, upset at the caesarean birthrate (as a profit generator) and loss of innocence for children today who are not allowed wonder. He talked about being brutalized by life.

                Certainly does not seem like a backer of the pedo elite.  Sounds like he may have suffered himself.

            From Barnes &amp; Noble site:  "Keith Harmon Snow's meticulously documented investigation into sex-trafficking of children by American judges is not to be missed. This scandal is one of the most important censored stories in our country today. I might not believe what Mr. Snow has written if I had not independently investigated two dozen cases not discussed in his article, and found ample evidence of the precise dynamics he lays out for us here. Anyone who says they care about child welfare needs to learn what is happening in family courts and take action until it is stopped. Once you start reading this exposé, you won't be able to put it down."  Hmm.  Sounds OK, but I cannot see Amazon the Bezos site, allowing this unless there is something in there to normalize something in there.  He and his Bus. are highly suspect. Lundy Bancroft

            Yeah, I do not go to that site nor buy, and refuse all gifts from there.  Every one I know already knows not to send gifts from Bezos.  Bezos IS Amazon.  He has a very large contract with the CIA. Very large. Yeah, do not go there. Thanks for the warning. Maybe we can look it up another way.

            <p>
             yes, there is another way to find / buy books.
            </p>
            <p>
             see my link to the  book search engine site where you can find the lowest priced books comparing many sites (not all)
            </p>
            <p>
             is called  addall.com
            </p>
            <p>
             to search used books  go to     used.addall . com
            </p>
            <p>
             i use that site almost every day.   am constantly looking up books recommended by other VOAT users
