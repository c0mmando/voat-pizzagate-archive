However, after <a href="https://voat.co/user/noworldorder">@noworldorder</a> posted a recent <a href="http://archive.is/kLMrp">rt.com</a> article there is now considerable reason to think that ngo rescue boat trafficking is indeed going on.

<p>Jake Chapman is half of the Chapman brothers duo which has obscenely degenerate <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1637350">art</a> depicting little kids with genitals placed on random parts of their bodies. At least one of their works has been labeled &quot;Paedo-Pornographic&quot;. They called the murder of the toddler James Bulger &quot;a good social service&quot; and also said that kids shouldn\'t look at their art because &quot;children aren\'t human yet.&quot; Their book The 4th Sex has also been called <a href="http://archive.is/O9ere">possible grooming tools</a> for pedophiles. I have my doubts that the piece of shit Jake Chapman would suddenly start caring about kids.</p>
<p>All of the major people at Refugee Rescue are hipster <a href="http://archive.is/DSGYG">artists/musicians</a> which seems like an oddly specific group that Jake gave money to. They are the sort of people he probably would have heard of ahead of time. I\'m wondering if the group is a front for abducting children at sea to sell into sex trafficking. Something just seems off about the group. What do you think: innocent group or front?</p>
<p>Edit: Refugee Rescue used to just say a bunch of platitudes on twitter about compassion and used the weird hashtag #stayhuman.  Lately though, they have been taking every opportunity to bash <a href="http://archive.is/IDeJg">Frontex</a> all over their Twitter. This isn\'t surprising since Frontex wants to stop <a href="http://archive.is/kLMrp">human trafficking</a> by ngos that kidnap people at sea.  So it looks like they are trying to paint Frontex as a bunch of heartless bastards that don\'t care if innocent people drown.  If Refugee Rescue is trafficking people this could help explain their antagonism towards Frontex, which threatens their operation.  Similarly, they seem to like pulling on the heartstrings in a way that reminds me of <a href="http://archive.is/0GYsv">Save The Children</a> which the RT article points out as being probably guilty.</p>',

            I saw an article here in the U.S. asking where all the young children were if those people are shady enough to pack 500 human beings on boats they know will sink if it's over loaded or in a hot van or shipping container why would any news media outlet ( who are supposed to be professionals at investigating things ) believe these people would not sell a small child off to make extra money ? Plus as sick as it sounds I'm sure there are even more vultures waiting to sell them off as soon as their feet hit the ground here . According to this there are 10,000 children that went missing in the last few years !! 10,000 and where are the parents of these 10,000 children double that per each child so would that not be 20,000 upset parents  ? The media is compliant in this they have to be .

             There is something very very wrong inside the EU when 10k refugee children are missing. I'm very concerned about this. Also because there is no update and we don't know who the children are and where they are. Nobody is searching for them, because there  are no Amber Alerts for the missing refugee / migrant children. MSM and Brussel are silent.

              It's almost to perfect for them , they just let mass amounts of people in so they can play dumb by not keeping track of who is coming in . They already knew that this was a billion dollar business and it makes me wonder really how long has this been going on ?

               I can say to you that we had already problems with illegal immigration via Greece since the beginning of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan (Iraqi &amp; afghan refugees) The flow from Lybia has started since the fall of the gaddafi regime (2011) (migrants &amp; refugees from the horn of Africa) But this is only the flow by boat over sea. You never heard about the flow by plane. Migrants and refugees come also by plane to the EU.

               It clearly has to be a large operation to take that amount of children in such a short time. Its honestly making me sick. What are they doing with all of them ?! Why do they need so many ? It really makes no sense this so goes beyond the seedy pervert in the van these people are so evil it's beyond belief or we are being lied to about the numbers . I also saw a story about jewish families taking some of the children as well and " raising them as their own " I'l see if I cand find that story and post it here for you.

            I've checked the vessel (Mo Chara) Position Received: 2016-11-04 06:16 UTC  location BALTIC - Skagerrak
At this moment I watch every day on Marinetraffic which vessels and NGO's are in the SAR Area nearby the coast of Lybia. 
I see a lot of things going on there. For example NGO's are operating under the radar and are not visible all the time. Last week a vessel called the IUVENTA send an emergeny call (Mayday) and location via Twitter, because they were operating under the radar ! Maybe it is also a good idea to take a closer look into the NGO's. I have a list with all operating NGO's and names of the vessels.
