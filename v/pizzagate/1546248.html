            Yes we need to curb our enthusiasm sometimes i feel and take a leaf from Gary Webb's book. He was the guy who proved that the CIA was using cocaine to fund arms in Nicaragua. He was a little hastey in publishing his research and was taken down by the CIA stooges in the MSM and eventually was "suicided" by two (count it) bullets to the head.
Potential Proof might be a more cautious title..

            <p>
             If we had met five years ago, you wouldn't have found a more staunch defender of the newspaper industry than me ... And then I wrote some stories that made me realize how sadly misplaced my bliss had been. The reason I'd enjoyed such smooth sailing for so long hadn't been, as I'd assumed, because I was careful and diligent and good at my job ... The truth was that, in all those years, I hadn't written anything important enough to suppress ...

             But see, this isn't your first conspiracy rodeo. The worst thing about PizzaGate is that everyone went off half-cocked and muddied the waters. The path this is on is not heading toward a prosecution... on the other hand, Alefantis is sweating like a stoolie, so there may be some action. That's "good", but convictions really drive the truth and justice movement.

              We dont really have a road map here that we know is going to work so who can say what is the right approach. Caution and real evidence, but even with real evidence we cant do jack unless some people with influence in positions of power basically risk everything (including their lives) to get the prosecutions happening.
In my experience, the deeper you go into all of this, the more attention you get, and the danger levels go up. When I started digging into CIA involvement in New Zealand about 12 years back.. it didnt go unnoticed.. My contacts in media got shut down really fast. And then they denied ever speaking to me. I mean fear and threats go a LONG way..
I saw people get threatened.. we had our phones bugged, my laptop stolen from the house, a visit from a strange man and in the end it didnt feel safe to continue.
I discovered that everyone that i turned to was compromised or could be leaned on by "them".. the media, govt, corporates.. they were all scared of an unseen group in the shadows that seems to permeate all of the government and corporate sector.

               This isn't entirely true. You have a roadmap. Several, actually. You have to decide now: are you going for a conviction (a la Karen Silkwood) or are you going for the smear campaign (a la Jimmy Saville)? If you opt for the latter, you might not get any confirmation until people are dead.

               My background in this is from conspiracy circle you might not respect much. And yes, you're right -- the counter-operatives don't have to hold themselves to the same standards. And some of the researchers are a liability. It's a rough game, but casting it the way you have -- with references to a shadow cabal of "them" -- doesn't do so much good, even if it is true.

               No one wants to hear about any of this. People want to believe the world is boring and tedious meritocracy. And you'll look like a nutter. Wiesenthal looked like a nutter to many. So you downplay the darker aspects. Focus on documentation. To me, the biggest thing that has come out in the past week is that someone actually filed with the police over the threats. It starts a paper trail. It legitimizes a perspective. This won't be put to bed in the next month. Or even under Trump's watch. If this is true, you're in for a long game. It can be won, and it is often won in terms of legacy. Saville never served a day, but the historical perspective changed. That actually changes the future. But your success if this strategy can depend strongly on how people conduct themselves early on.

               The time for bad behavior is when you can change the
               <em>
                present
               </em>
               . I don't have any information that could do that. I don't have the name of a child to liberate, etc. If I did, I might be willing to go criminal. Now? Nothing. Your best bet is to try to establish a strong network of dedicated people. Don't discuss "strategy" in public. Crowd source speculation and research, but establish a trusted network for anything leading to prosecution. In the US, the right of private prosecution has been curtailed, but you could work to make prosecution part of a party platform, even at a state level. It's already a pretty partisan issue. The problem is, even I wouldn't touch this case as it is now.

               But I do have hope.. I do see the worms squirming about and running for cover and in damage control.. and there are good people in high places and I am hopeful of Trump, but also know he has many flaws.. i hope he has the guts to really do some serious digging and shit.. i feel he already is, and is just waiting and biding his time until he can do whatg needs to be done, hopefully.
I fully believe Hillary was deadly serious when she said "..if Trump gets in were all gona hang from nooses!"

            I do not understand some people here. Day in day out, he is trying to give the asked "proof" and still people are telling "no proof" but also do not deliver proof it was a fake and hoax. That there is a possibilities to fake a part of the hole story like facebook page loading (i had no idea that was possible, so that sceptic could have happend to me to if i did what GoT did) does not proof that exactly did happen!
           </p>
           <p>
            So, to be clear. By my definition, if you show it is possible to fake some part is NO proof it also happend. And keep demanding he shows proof he did not manipulated that part while not delivering proof he did fake it (even if possible) makes no sense to me after all his affords to proof the circumstances the last couple of days.
           </p>
           <p>
            Being sceptic is a must, but in this case i find the "attacks" (how it comes over to me) on the person day in day out i do not understand. If still sceptic, pick up the phone and call the number. Nothing illegal about that. Is is James or Comet who answers you have your proof.
           </p>
           <p>
            Telling you only believe it after a live stream or something like that is lame (imo), you are not the one who decides for a other how to do investigation and deliver facts and proof. If he did not put effort in making a case, ok, but after all his efforts i see no reason to only except that as a proof and dismiss all he delivered until now.

            We need to work together and not against each other. We of course have to fight the shills , but unjustified place someone under the number shill will do more harm than by mistake not recognize and not treat a shill as a shill.

            <p>
             It's almost impossible to prove a negative.  The burden of proof is on the one making the positive claim.  isThisGameOfThrones hasn't provided the proof necessary for his claim to be taken as fact.  There is no need for anyone to prove that he is falsifying his evidence.  The only thing debunkers need to do is demonstrate how his evidence could be faked.  In a case as serious as this, nobody gets the benefit of the doubt.
            </p>

             We have to always be skeptical, even when we really want to believe.

            I'm going to cover my ass and say that the guy, pizzagategear, who said he was threatened by Comet Ping Pong owner James Alefantis has not proven his claims until the livestreams his facebook chat messenger, nukes the html settings, and keeps the chat open without anything changing.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is a high standard and he did file a police report, but this new development seems too good to be true for the insane level of incrimination.
           </p>
           <p>
            Note: Pegasus is still a real place, is owned by Alefantis, and is very suspicious.

            I personally think it's time to move on from this topic. It's not adding anything to the research and I highly doubt that he's ever going to provide verifiable proof that this really happened. Even if he did, what difference does it make to the investigation? And what has going on and on debating over this really done to progress our efforts? If anything it was a wasted opportunity to obtain at least some shred of information from the source, but since that didn't happen why are we still talking about it? Time to refocus on leads that actually matter.

            Because it just doesn't make sense that Alefuckulties would blow up like a loose cannon and make threats like that... regardless of not recording the phone call, etc. Spotlights on him. He's now representative of his masters. Do you think he would do that? He's on damage control. His masters could snuff him out like it's tea and crumpets. That and Ryan not agreeing to livestreaming... among others.

            Anyone can file a police report for anything. I can go to the police station and file a report claiming a man in a chicken suit ran up to me and threatened to kill me. Does that make it true? No. That's called filing s false report, which, depending on circumstances of what the report is for - if the claim is investigated and found out that it's a false report, you can get in a lot of trouble for it. Though, in reality - reports like his get filed all the fucking time by thousands of people and a report claiming simply just "this person threatened me" are very rarely even seriously investigated unless there's substantial reasoning to do so.

            It's also a fairly complex and bizarre conversation on text to fake. The overlapping conversations, strange manner of speaking, ect. Not something that could be easily faked from that standpoint either. Seems like an epic shill project trying to discredit him.

            What would be the motive? Not only does it have serious consequences if he did file a false police report, but his gains are what exactly? Some more "likes" or YouTube views? There's been no reason not to believe him except the incredible retarded ego of JA thinking that making that call was a good idea. I think that's the main thing people can't get past. Sociopaths think they're untouchable and smarter than everyone else.

                I agree. I hate reddit, but they do handle these kind of things properly. I hate it when they silence us, but in these kinds of situations, the reddit admins and mods are being more honest about the situations.

                I agree. Witch hunting is bad. I just got caught up in the research. I'm a good judge of character and I felt I would have known within 2 minutes of talking to him.

                 Honestly, I wish that we could get a public statement from him. I suppose that the news interview that he did was that statement, so maybe us interviewing him is unnecessary for his public claims.

            This isn't "proof" of anything. Anyone can spoof any phone number they want to make it "look" like there was a dialed / received call from whatever fucking number they want.

            I suppose what Ryan needs to do now is do the 'proofs' again, showing the number this time. After all, he didn't leak it - it was out there already.

SO, UM...would someone care to explain why "James" from PEBBLE BEACH, CALIFORNIA, is definitively #JamesAlefantis?
I mean, besides WISHING it were so.

             I don't  know enough about how easy it is to fake these kinds of things, so I'm remaining skeptical on this until the consensus is 100% clear, just because it's so crazy.

2 The unbelievable infomercial fox news pushed on its viewers.

              it is the same boy from the first photo, they probably came together to park with the photographer. also the woman with the brown jacket appears to be with the photographer too, looking at her body language. please notice though, on the 2nd photo the pink jackets girls face has been intentionally photoshopped to the ground. and on the 3rd photo this girl is standing all alone (no brown jacket woman)

              Hey, the mod is doing the right thing - flagged it with a warning rather than deleting it outright.
             </p>
             <p>
              And the poster has used conclusive language 'PROOF' he shouts from the rooftop. How about a title that leaves some wriggle room 'May be proof' 'apparently verified' 'potential evidence'

               That's a pretty pedantic thing to get upset about when proof in common usage is often stated synonymously with evidence.

            For one, I don't think this GameofThrones guy is stupid, he should know the consequences of pulling a prank like this (if he did). Not saying that he could be lying though. Maybe he can post a picture of his phone with the calllog of that time he called Alefantis. Would provide some proof assuming you can't fake that either.

             I grew up with the child of a chief of police in Galveston County myself but I don't think there's any action that needs to be taken here.
            </p>
            <p>
             I really don't think this guy Ryan is faking it. Maybe that's naive but he has seemed very forthcoming this entire time. I have dealt with people like Alefantis, arrogant, narcissistic, likely sociopathic and that type of behavior is exactly what you would expect. Alefantis really thinks he is a God in his own world and he can intimidate you or influence you to do whatever he wishes and get away with because he is smarter than us, more influential, he is better than us. It is so obvious to him he cannot see past that and he is surrounded by sycophants that do nothing but feed that right back to him. He must be so out of touch and he is being very reckless. This is not at all surprising. It is a pattern of behavior. He cannot help it. Ultimately it will likely be his undoing. He knows this too he just doesn't want to admit it to himself just yet because in doing so he would be admitting defeat. That is crushing to him. Eventually though self preservation instinct will kick in and if he is not eliminated he will bring down others with him. It is his culture, after all.

              I think I worked with the guy's son (chief of police). I'm not going to try and see Ryan. And also, he seems on the up and up to me also. You're right about petulant people like Alefantis.

            I grew up very nearby to Galveston, TX and I really don't think Ryan is in any way faking this based upon my experiences dealing with the authorities there and living there - this is exactly the response and process and documentation that would be expected.
           </p>
           <p>
            Terroristic Threat is a pretty common one in Texas and I think really you file the police report more to make a record of the harassment so that if anything further continues or a future incident occurs, you can show a pattern of behavior by Alefantis and/or possible intent to cause harm to Ryan. It is known between Ryan and the police officer this incident itself won't lead to charges on Alefantis but it is also understood a record should be made and if anything further happens, Ryan will follow up with the detective and the history is established already.

            That's easy for us to verify, we can call the police station.  But it has no bearing on whether he actually talked with Alefantis, as far as I can tell.

             I already called the police station. They pointed me to the police web site, and I shared the link to the police report. I posted it in a thread here. That doesn't prove that he talked to James, though.

             <p>
              If you dont know how to do that?...take the video and Isolate the audio and upload the audio to vocaroo...I would at least like to hear what he had to say...And if you cant do that...well...

               I hope you recognize that if you're LARPing people are probably going to DOX you and turn you in to your local PD for filing a false report. Not to mention, James could decide to make an example of you and and sue your ass off. If I were you I would do whatever I could to prove this is real and what everyone is suggesting with the live stream seems to be the only answer. Your cell account won't work either, a couple other people have brought up call spoofers. You have to prove this through Facebook messenger.

                 At least give us a reason as to
                 <strong>
                  <em>

                  </em>
                 </strong>
                 you won't give the objective proof that is needed here. If truth is what you're trying to provide, then you shouldn't mind a collective approach to this if it does not incriminate/harm you (other than what you have allegedly already done to yourself). It boils down to reasoning, anyway. Look, man, I hope the best for you if this is true, but you're trying to convince the collective. Leastways, collaborate with everyone to find a good strategy to legitimize your claim that we all agree on
                 <strong>
                  <em>
                   before
                  </em>
                 </strong>
                 you enact said strategy. Otherwise, you must understand how this looks to a bunch of people (young and old) who are trying to use truth through verifiable facts (not Snopes and the like) to help a bunch of little people who need it.

                 Don't be surprised when Galveston PD gets all this information in regards to your report. If you're being truthful you have nothing to worry about. If not, you better hope you're JA's buddy or you're going to need some soap on a rope.

                 I guess it depends on the browser on the tablet and your settings...but you might need a program to view the cache...maybe the app "astro file viewer" might help to view the temp files?

            I downvoted because it is not proof.  Not saying you're a shill, I just would love to see actual proof since that would make this a huge story.

              I thought the same. He looks like a guy that would approach you at a gas station asking for gas to get to his brother's funeral. Then approaching you with the exact same story, convincingly, a week later. (Happened to me)

              I don't know if it's desperation or if it's just people's inability to believe that kind of stupidity exists. This guy, if lying, has committed libel, filed a false police report and revealed his name to the internet. If he's LARPing he's likely to get doxed before he goes to jail and potentially gets sued for everything he owns. It's fucking baffling the lack of though put into this, if it's fake.

                I recommend everyone else do the same, if he's telling the truth it will only help him by drawing more attention to it. If he's lying he can fuck off in jail.

             Funny you say that. I had started looking into her. Apparently she's a bitch. One of the articles I read was quite interesting in that she actually sent a cease and desist letter to a local blogger who had eaten at Buck's and taken pics of the food and of her to add to his write up, which was a positive review. Apparently she didn't want her "food" to be photographed.

             Quote from lawyer letter: The food and contents of the said restaurant are propriatary and confidential.

             She was his former partner, rather well known chef in DC. She had her detractors, but also her fans.

            <p>
             The consensus is that she got a bad deal when she was forced out, but not everyone was sympathetic.

             Comments on articles at the time of her departure however alluded to sick things going on there and "if people knew" they would never eat at either place again.

              Not sure how to respond -- I'm trying to help this guy prove his interaction with Alefantis since this story would be huge if it's real and proven.  I guess almost all of my comments in the last couple days are about that and sound mostly negative since all I'm doing is debunking various attempted proofs.  :/

            And here's Comet's Business License.  Same number so I don't know why he bothered to hide it.  It's quite public:

              It says a license was issued in June 2016, and one ran from Sep. 2014 to Aug. 2016, so it looks like there is an overlap of two consecutive licenses.

             I put this number into caller id and got "Comet P*******", not JAMES ALEFANTIS which is what he got in his video:

             Does caller id sometimes have two names for the same number?  I don't really know how it works.

            In the video he clicked to his calls page from his account page. Can anyone say if its possible/impossible to edit the elements of the calls page, move away from that page, click back to the calls page and it will still be edited?

            Edit: Why would someone down vote my comment? I'm not denying this is real, I'm trying to make it undeniable.

              I'm surprised that he didn't end the video with, "And if you enjoyed watching me get threatened, then click that like button. I post new threats and conversations each week, so if you want to see more, then don't forget to click the subscribe link below, too. While you're waiting for the next video, check out these 2 videos about the kill room being at the pyjama factory.

             Yes, that's easy to fake if it's in a web browser on a non-livestreamed video.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wish he would just do the requested livestream (

             </a>
             ) which would give him no time to fake anything.  But he has not responded to the idea of doing a livestream, at all.

               Lots of ways to do it, you can have some javascript in your browser that will edit the page immediately when it loads.

              <p>
               That's why the only proof would be a
               <strong>
                livestream
               </strong>
               where he does what people ask him to do on the spot, where there's no time to prepare any kind of fake.

                  Also, I was just talking to my brother and he brought up caller id spoofers. So, the cell account won't work anyways. Proof has to come from the Facebook conversation.

                     He got evidence of murder threats from one of the prime suspects and he didn't record the call. Im angry to fuck at his ignorance and disregard for common protocol for investigators. It absolutely boggles my mind

                  It's not. The number has been known so people will say he edited the page element to display that number. I'm not sure how that would be possible because he clicked to his calls page, it wasn't pre-loaded, then he clicked to page 2 of his calls, but someone has already stated it is possible.

               it really isn't difficult to spoof a number.  I could call you from that number (as far as your caller ID is concerned) in 5 minutes.  I don't know if this is real or fake yet, I am waiting for more verification one way or another, but knowing the number isn't too much of a giveaway

                Yeah, I think using a livestream and verifying the facebook chat was actually with Alefantis' account is the most straightforward approach if he really wants to prove this.

               As far as that, correct.  Personally, I don't care or need proof.  If he is making it up but got REAL police reports while everybody knows his full name, he'd have to be pretty stupid, which I don't think he is.

                "I don't care or need proof" is incredibly dangerous thinking. I'm trying to forget the whole distracting thing that has thrown this subverse off course. But, if it is meant as a false flag, the police report wouldn't matter. He could be a shill paid off for any trouble he might encounter for filing a false report. Think of how shitty it'd be for our cause if someone made a false claim against Alefantis. It could totally be a hoax.

                That's a fair point.  I don't know the risks involved with the police report.

                I'm just trying to explain that all the "PROOF" threads don't actually prove it.
