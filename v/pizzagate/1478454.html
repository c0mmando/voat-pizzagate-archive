            Probably nothing from the taxpayers pocket, only from that police response to that staged shooting event. He is really a foot soldier in the grand scheme of things. He is wealthy enough to stay afloat and "weather the storm" as he said in an interview. In looking at all the media blitz, the only help he is getting is a propaganda piece in the MSM saying how wonderful he is and what a great place comet ping pong is. All that media piece is worth more than money could help him at this stage. He is protected by what the media prints and so far that seems to be keeping public at bay. When that stops being effective, there is no money that can protect him in this world.

            Maybe not that much really, comparatively speaking. For instance, the British government have likely spent at least one hundred times as much keeping an eye on me over the past few years. As for Alefantis, most of it was probably routine long before this all kicked off since he's associated with various politicians and businesspeople - there might be little change as a big increase in security would be noticeable. When it comes to coverage, reports by the mainstream media I imagine that is routine business for them.

              Who me? Why do people think I'm Australian? Seriously though, I'd expect if Assange were posting here he'd just say it. Or pop to the balcony. Or Tweet. Or something, anything to say he's doing just fine and having dinner with Pamela Anderson. No, I'm not Assange, I'm a different kettle of fish altogether.
