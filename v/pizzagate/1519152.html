            Some responses to each comment; thank you. 
Making Memes to push public awareness is a strong recommendation. 
Is it our most optimum, most targeted, most leveraged action? 
(ie, we have broad public awareness that the official story of JFK is faulty if not an outright conspiracy, so - what good is public knowledge; how much is enough? what does it CAUSE to HAPPEN to CHANGE these practices from being covered up and a norm.
           </p>
           <p>
            And here is a repeat from below:
           </p>
           <p>
            Goal: public awareness of the best explanation for the available evidence, by best I mean the explanation that makes the minimum number of assumptions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Strategy: build an association map from known victims to suspects to potential conspirators with a focus on paedophile activity or child trafficking. 
Canvas for missing/abducted child data in order to build a usable public database?
            <em>
             [IS GLOBAL INCIDENT MAP complete enough / useful enough / to use as this base map?]
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            Actionable evidence: 
Collect affidavits, ideally with helper affidavits that attest to the honesty of the witness of the primary affidavit. 
Civil jurisdictions have problems with international law, a common law grand jury approach is better but should be convened in a common law country.
           </p>

            <li>
             <p>
              need far more people making memes about connections we've uncovered, and historical examples of child pedophilia being covered up. People need short single concrete points of evidence to be persuaded along with the overarching examples.

              When we see something like Twitter or Google protecting / condoning a pedophile network, then we need look up the advertizers / sponsors of said platform / videos. ...(see 2nd paragraph in comment above to review specifics.)

              ATTITUDE ADVICE:   "I want to raise your awareness" most will bargain this down to something much less than awareness and concern. If you instead go forth, hitting people in the pocket books, making people feel guilty for letting this shit continue, then you'll wind up negotiating down to "being concerned" about the issue. Do you see? You have to aim higher than the goal you want to hit.

            <li>
             <p>
              Part of your awareness campaign needs to be showing that the "authorities" can't be trusted to do shit. FBI and police have been covering it up, and that's why it's been allowed to get this bad.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Think about what your enemies are saying, and find a contrary position that's more sensational. Do things that provoke more interest than demand "investigation" be done. What the hell is the common person supposed to do if your goal is to demand an investigation? You have to outline most people an action they can participate in right then -- preferably one that's as easy as spreading a meme or changing a social media avatar to raise awareness. Once they've committed the first easy step, some of them will want to do more. Create a series of actions people can do to help, clearly outlined, and graduated in difficulty / time investment. This way your supporters can work their way up to the level of investment they can give. ...

             <p>
              They've been brainwashed into thinking they're helpless and overwhelmed. So, give them some hope, give them something they can actually do, even if it's very small.  (Yes, this is the topic of another post I've made, requesting Active Investigators to put out TASK lists of bite-sized chunks others can coordinate their fact checking and digging with, to ensure coverage and avoid duplication of effort.)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              once you have evidence that something bad is happening in a state or even a city you don't have to call for the federal powers to perform an investigation. You can notify the agency in that state or city that is responsible for investigating corruption.

            (click on new 'human trafficking map'). I write/share stories of successful busts and indictments as well as suspicious activities of pizzagate players. Write editorial submissions to local papers. Share stories of recent and past incidents with friends, family, social networks and Kid's school principal and PTA.  I have found when I've started conversations with 'Did you hear they rescued teenage girls when they busted that guy running a child porn operation out of a pizza shop with after-school karate program ?' and followed it up with wow that ping pong place in DC sure does seem suspicious. ~always gets a better response than 'Did you hear the latest smear on pizzagate. I don't even use the word pizzagate in these conversations except to admit that the MSM has turned it into a fringe lunatic conspiracy theory.

            By so doing, we can use archetypical association in our favor, and expose the public's confirmation bias to new information, which will allow that to "sink in" faster than if we HADN'T approached it in this fashion... trust me on this, been working in mass media more than 30 years.

            When Climategate happened, there was a similar blackout/ridicule/censoring the opposition from appearing on MSM and all the left-leaning pundits. The Repugs jumped on it, and the whole matter was reduced to political bipolarity. Just like now. Except now we are talking satanic cannibalism at great galas with all the stars. Those pictures and descriptions sliced through the political and struck the souls of people on both sides. The Podesta Brothers are your poster stars and Alefantes is in the inner ring. It was Podesta who mentored Bill Clinton in college. He and his brother are connected everywhere. Maybe just keep flooding the internet with spirit cooking pics and the Heavy Breathing s/h/it, the words are just gold for the prosecution. And maybe Trump's administration or Congress is gearing up to take it on after Jan. Or will they keep it sequestered because it spills onto them as well? Why doesn't the PTA lead the charge??? Only a large org like that could break down some media doors.

            Goal: public awareness of the best explanation for the available evidence, by best I mean the explanation that makes the minimum number of assumptions.

            Strategy: build an association map from known victims to suspects to potential conspirators with a focus on paedophile activity or child trafficking. Canvas for missing/abducted child data in order to build a usable public database?

           <p>
            Actionable evidence: Collect affidavits, ideally with helper affidavits that attest to the honesty of the witness of the primary affidavit. Civil jurisdictions have problems with international law, a common law grand jury approach is better but should be convened in a common law country.
