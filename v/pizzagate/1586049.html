            I would like a list of every DC cop currently serving on the force. Seems that would be a good place to start. Like JFK, I worry about "insiders" who wish our new President harm more than pussy hats and paid Soros dipshits.

            Here's a 2007 blog entry, supported by a WaPo article, that reports that 13 of the 34 DC police officers arrested in 2007 were charged with domestic violence offenses, accounting for about 38% of the arrests.

           <p>
            From WaPo:
           </p>
           <p>
            "One D.C. police officer helped himself to a woman's credit card while investigating a burglary at her home, another allegedly spit on a nightclub bouncer in a drunken rage and a third was caught soliciting sex within 10 blocks of police headquarters.
           </p>
           <p>
            "They are among 34 members of the D.C. police department arrested this year on assault, fraud, drunken driving and other charges, the largest number in at least five years.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Although the percentage of officers arrested on the 3,800-member force is small, this year's total is 10 more than last year's. At least five cases involve on-duty conduct, but the majority stem from off-duty activities. Thirteen officers were arrested on domestic violence charges, 10 for drunken driving.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Police officials refused to provide many details, initially denying a request under the Freedom of Information Act. After The Washington Post appealed, officials agreed to provide a general breakdown of cases but refused to release names, saying they were concerned about the officers' privacy and noting that some cases could be dismissed."

            about the two Metro officers who were charged with child prostitution and porn, it seems that the residents of the SE seventh district in Washington DC called for a full investigation as they felt that the problem was widespread within the force:

            In 2009, Newsham, as head of Internal Affairs for the DC police, lied and covered up for a Detective Baylor, who pulled his gun on a crowd that threw snowballs at his Hummer during a snowball fight. Newsham insisted during a press conference that Baylor actually pulled out a cell phone, and then stuck the cell phone in his holster. There's a photo at this site that clearly shows Baylor holding a gun.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Newsham is one of the defendants in the Chang case (World Bank protests) in which I am lead co-counsel (with Daniel Schwartz of the law firm of Bryan Cave). Newsham testified that he gave the order to arrest hundreds of people without probable cause or warnings in Washington. They were later hogtied and left for as much as 19 hours. The case has already cost the city in excess of $15 million in costs and damages. However, Newsham was promoted after the incident and is now in charge of allegations of abuse by other officials.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Newsham’s latest controversy raises the question of whether the detective told him this story and whether Newsham failed to investigate (as in actually speaking with witnesses) before publicly clearing the detective."

            They also shut down the Finders case in '87... if you read it, Wash. metro police got involved and then TPTB (CIA) stepped in.

            This would confirm what George Webb has stated multiple times in his Youtube videos, i.e. heads of police departments are often compromised to get them ignore and bury criminal activities. According to Webb, this was common tactic by CIA to compromise and blackmail police in foreign (third world) countries, but appearantly it may very well happen in the US too.

            No evidence was ever put forward as to how, where, what or why it was debunked.  We also know that no investigation was ever conducted.  Agree we need to shine a spotlight onto the police department and its processes.  I am finding reports of their past questionable conduct in terms of abuse cases.

            This has been discussed briefly before. I also found two recent Metro officers implicated in child prostitution and porn, one if whom suicides and was found drowned. Will try and find those links again.

               I have no real alternatives I'm afraid. I still use archive.is.  In this recent voat thread it was mentioned that the voat posts are being backed up anyway:
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1569702/7650190">
                https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1569702/7650190
               </a>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               If you could archive the Washington post article and add the link to your comment I would appreciate it as I can't read that outfit's posts without a subscription.
