 If Soros is the Kingpin of Pedogate as some say... why would Trump spend Christmas with him and borrow money from him? Why was Trump very good friends with the Clintons? Why was Trump hanging out with Jeffery Epstein (the billionaire pedophile) and was named in a lawsuit with him involving an underage girl? Why has Trump put a Head of Goldman Sachs in a key position in the government? Why is his cabinet filled with traitors? People keep saying that Trump just doesn\'t know? If we all know don\'t you think he knows who is a left wing diabolical traitor as well? Why does the Bible say that you will be deceived by the anti-christ?
 The truth seekers are the ones they fear most among the Satanic, evil, deep state pedos. We are their greatest adversary. If we can be manipulated into believing that we have someone in charge that will do the right thing while we sit back and see what happens the bad guys can strategically move in on those of the light. I do believe that this is a spiritual war of good and evil and Satan and his minions well known tactic is to deceive the masses. They have had 1000s of years or more to perfect the art of deception. Something just doesn\'t seem right? I pray we are not being played but it is starting to seem that way.</p>',

            He hasn't gone after Soros, nor the Clintons, or known pedophiles in the Congress and senate. Shoot, even media and celebrities can make death threats and they don't have any reprocussions. Hillary was given questions at the Presidential debate and she still is walking around free. It seems like it is the same ole modus of aparandi. Make a little stink about it. Then the evil deep state and their followers pretend to throw a fit and then the illegal acts get swept under the rug as we wait patiently for our leader to do something. In the mean time the states are being flooded right now with foreigners. Trump could have closed the borders! He had EVERY RIGHT to do it! Yet he let a CA judge stop him? What am I missing here?

            Many have given up their souls for fortune,fame,drugs and the like. Now many are as if demon possesed and are on the side of the wicked. Now that our society has drifted so far away from morals there is only a part of humanity that still retains a sense of moral fortitude and decency. These are the ones that seek truth like us here. These are the ones that will be deceived because the others have already been deceived and tricked into giving their humanity away. Now these evil doers only need to play us that are still on the side of good. This just may be their trump card?

            YES, this needs to be discussed.  I have said many times that you don't get to be a billionaire in Jew York if you're not playing ball. Trump is a Tribe of Dan crypto Jew. We all heard the "open mic" Freemason admission. He has more royal blood than Hitlery -- his cousin -- (hence he "won" the [s]election).
           </p>
           <p>
            Another angle is Roy Cohn, who was Trump's "mentor." They were very close friends for many years. Cohn was a Jewish faggot lawyer for the mob. He also just happens to have been bubbled the "CIA Pedophile Ringleader."
           </p>
           <p>
            This is illustrative but doesn't contain the quote, also biased (Jew York TImes).

            ^^ These two together describe the relationship pretty well. Also the Roger Stone connection to Trump via Cohn. That makes AJ even dirtier via extension IMO.
           </p>
           <p>
            No matter how you slice it, Trump comes up dirty.
