<p>So I was poking around on Twitter over the weekend, and noticed the old Al-Capone-treasure-chaser Geraldo was lecturing Trump again. As if Geraldo (yes, it seems Geraldo is still alive and fresh from the vault! That pizza eating really does pay off) is anyone to lecture anyone on any subject. I did a search only to see if there had been any harassment claims on Geraldo, and came across something really interesting because I believe he inadvertently doxed SNL. </p>
<p>SNL has been suspect for some time as per the above relevancy comments. And why it flew under the radar of being subversive is curious. For a professed “comedy”, it’s had an unwavering amount of sex swinging and influencing elections. Remember the Bob Dole bits? Pundits attribute to Dole falling in the polls and losing his bid on the scathing SNL skits and the fictitious character Norm McDonald immortalized and that the writers created. </p>
<p>They’ve been going at it hard against Trump, and not letting up on trying to ridicule and tear him down. Remember that it was an unhinged SNL writer that went after Barron Trump. She had to apologize, but they didn’t fire her for going after a kid?!!! Isn’t that sort of a rule? Evidently not for hypocrites like this.  
</p>
<p>If you juxtaposition this against their repeated attempts at the normalization of pedophilia, they should be on officially on the pizzagate radar. The video above with Miley Cyrus and that disgusting fat comedian with the permanent smile on his face talking babies and pizza should be enough to make anyone cringe. I mean, wearing diapers? Come on! Enough! I’m nominating SNL for further investigation. Why? Well, because of all of the above and because of what I found. </p>
<p>As stated, I was doing the search for Geraldo when I ran across this: </p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Geraldo Rivera had a riveting conversation about his life with Will Cain of The Blaze. Part of that discussion included a breakdown of how on earth Rivera could have managed to sleep with 1,000 women, as he claimed he had in his 1991 autobiography.</p>
<p>&quot;It\'s not particularly my magnetism or anything,&quot; Rivera told a curious Cain, who still wanted to have &quot;the mechanics&quot; of having sexual intercourse with that many women explained to him. (Get your priorities straight Will and you\'ll figure it out!) Instead, Rivera said that the lack of &quot;workplace protections&quot; in the 1970s and 80s meant that he was able to have a very active social life. &quot;Now if you look at an intern with cross-eyes you go to jail, I mean get fired. Office affairs are monitored...[then] it was the SNL after party everyday,&quot; he told Cain, adding:</p>
<p>&quot;It was almost like sex was free! You have no HR – no human resources – no workplace rules against it, lots of money, relative youthfulness, a young staff, surrounded by sycophants and enablers, people smoking joints openly in their office...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So sorry women\'s rights ruined the sex parties for him. He’s pretty disgusting, but there’s the gold buried in the dung. Here’s the quote again: </p>
<blockquote>
<h1>. Office affairs are monitored...[then] it was the SNL after party everyday …</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>What? WTF does that even mean? Is he insinuating there’s sex at SNL after parties? In fact, he’s more than insinuating, he’s STATING it! I went in pursuit of trying to back this up, and I, unfortunately, found it. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yup, Norm McDonald gives the skinny on a tantric yoga sex expert wanting to share his and his wife’s considerable skills (practice, practice, practice!) in the area of orgies by incorporating an orgy into the after hours party! Yes, indeedy! </p>
<p>The star that is NOT named as “Sting” or his slutty wife (you’ll get the joke after listening), actually goes about setting one up … or rather has his wife Trudy do it. Remember all those stories about Sting’s wonderful marriage and his devoted wife Trudy? Well, the propagandists for the stars must have been laughing up their sleeves when writing that garbage because obviously the life those two share together is anything but devoted or because of true love. In fact, Norm McDonald specifically calls Trudy out for being the one to pimp and recruit for her husband, and for the one that does the most “sharing” at the orgies they participate in. No, it is not the first time at the rodeo for the NOT named Sting or his wife …. whatever the hell her name is. </p>
<p>To give some perspective, most of us work or have worked. Just imagine suggesting the company participate in an orgy at the banquet dinner celebrating some employee’s twenty-fifth anniversary? Or how about at Christmas? Yeah, that would go over well. So why did it not cause any red flags to go up at SNL? Had to be because it’s pretty much business as usual. Otherwise the subject would have never been proposed. </p>
<p>Given the wildly popular after hours parties SNL hosts, I’m wondering if this is why. Or at least a part of it. Maybe they’re wild, but then there’s that room in the back to really get loose and crazy. I’d also like to know the connection between the sex and PedoWood and the Cannibal elites. As stated, why does SNL have its nose in elections? Why are they used to skewer opponents? They were almost the Clinton/dems attack dogs. </p>
<p>In one case, SNL went after the Sandlers. </p>

<p>The Sandlers’ big giving well predates Clinton’s current campaign.
The family’s fortune comes from the savings and loan institution that Herb and Marion Sandler ran for decades, a bank that became World Savings. It would end up making boatloads of cash from a type of adjustable rate mortgage that other lenders would later adopt, securitize and sell in a way that some have blamed for contributing to the housing bubble that burst in 2008. Not long before the burst and subsequent recession, the Sandlers sold the bank for $25.5 billion to Wachovia, earning $2.6 billion off the sale and donating most of their net worth to their foundation. Wachovia was later acquired by Wells Fargo.
The Sandlers met Podesta when they helped seed the Center for American Progress, the think tank he started in 2003 as a sort of Democratic administration in exile during George W. Bush’s presidency. Tax filings show that the Sandler Foundation has donated more than $37 million over the years to CAP, which worked to support President Barack Obama’s administration but has always been seen as more aligned with Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>The WikiLeaks emails reveal that Podesta and his team at the Center for American Progress discussed how to push back on scrutiny of the Sandlers related to the 2008 housing collapse. That included an October 2008 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch in which an actor playing Herb Sandler thanked members of Congress “for helping block congressional oversight of our corrupt activity.”</p>
<p>Podesta wrote to his colleagues that he’d talked to Herb Sandler, and “they are obviosly [sic] upset. Weird that snl should pick them out.”</p>
<p>After doing some research, a subordinate replied that “it appears default rates on their stuff was high (herb says not more so than others) and the losses were key to almsot [sic] wachovia failure -- athough [sic] herb emphasizes that they were only one of the institutions [sic] problems.”</p>
<p>Another staffer indicated plans to enlist then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the pushback. It’s unclear whether that happened or whether Podesta or CAP reached out to &quot;SNL.&quot; But the editor in chief of the Sandler-funded journalism outfit ProPublica did, arguing that the Sandlers were unfairly vilified, according to a New York Times piece soon after the skit.</p>
<p>The show’s producer, Lorne Michaels, apologized for the skit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you go! Lorne Michaels and his attack dogs didn’t get the memo that Podesta was working with Sandler and not ‘agin’ him, but I think we should find out just how in bed Michaels is with the Pedostas and Killary. So close that in some places in Indiana, they won’t sell them pizza anymore? &gt;</p>

            Geraldo was comparing his daily work environment in the 1970s and 80s with SNL after parties.  That means he's outing not only SNL but also ABC, where he spent most of the 70s and 80s:

             He inadvertently said it. If he had been questioned about it, then, no, I wouldn't believe it. But this was mentioned while he was bragging about shagging women.

            nice to see someone pointing out that SNL is very sketchy(haha, little play on words). Lorne Michaels is or was Canadian. His buddy Dan Ackroyd is a creep. He would try to seduce women, telling them he would put them in a film he was working on only for them to show up and find out  principle photography was finished. I knew a woman he had an affair with(yes, he was married at the time)Heard all kinds of dirt on him and apparently his family is connected to Military Intelligence. His skull Vodka is pretty creepy as well.

             We as a community need to really dig into these people's backgrounds and find the connections. One thing for sure, this is NOT just a comedy show! It's very well-connected propaganda brainwashing the masses, reinforcing how cool it is to hate the POTUS and common sense, and assuring the ignoramuses believing this shit that they're the intelligence ones!

            "Geraldo Rivera Quote Calls Them Out For Sex At Their After Parties"...Sex at parties is not Pizzagate. Did they mention the CIA and Satanic child churning system? Yes or no? Adult promiscuity is not pizzagate. Quit trying to pretend the insider resistance is legit because crude Hollywood is being exposed. That is not Pizzagate. This site is a limted hangout.

             Thinking it's just that SNL is part of the media arm that is defending pedos and helping spread disinfo and predictive programming. - They're fucked up that's for sure. I was super glad to see them get hammered for their shitty ghostbusters remake.

            It gets worse. This refers to triggering the child alter that has the mentality of toddler and then raping her. You can pull up a youtube of Anna Nicole Smith when triggered into her child alter and imagine the possibilities.

            Very common for those with a more modern or "European" approach to sexuality to marry each other in Hollywood. Hello Trudy Styles Also for more or less straight men to choose a very wild wife, especially for their 2nd or 3rd marriages.  Hello Charlie Sheen. That way they don't have to repeatedly hire one of whomever replaced Heidi Fleiss's "models" to bring to the frequently held, entertainment elite, swing parties. All of which are filmed by the way.
           </p>
           <p>
            After all awards ceremonies the hotties indulge in cocaine and swing together while the stars make financial deals with the power brokers who've watched the program. Once deals are made the men either watch or join in with whomever they choose. All are presumably available for multiple combinations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes those who are married to more Conservative women, perhaps the mother of their children, send them home early. They are still required to bring a very hot number to the after parties. That's why you see some unusual match ups among celebs.
           </p>
           <p>
            No I haven't been but was told by a reliable source. Orgies are common place among the entertainment elite as marriages are made for mutual career advancement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately this norm gives men the idea that anyone and everyone is sexually available to them at all times especially if they're at the top of the power, fame and money structure. It also motivates some to find a "fresher" young lady who won't require them to perform in front of others, and who will be far, far less critical as they age. Or perhaps some think they need a new thrill of something a little bit different.

             I wonder when the masses are redpilled if their adoration for these pervs will stay the same. Doubtful. Otherwise, there wouldn't be publicists spinning tales of what the public wants to hear. All I'm getting from this is that there's no spirituality involved, no love, and no kindness or compassion/concern for your partner. Just a very lonely way to get through life and one designed to skew your thinking.

             That's really funny because this "Al Franken" that the women staff at SNL wrote the letter of support for, got the call that warned him to stay away from the WTC on 9/11. He had an office there. Now why the hell would Mayor Koch call Al "POS" Franken to warn him not to go to work?

            Thanks for shining a light in this. This makes a lot of sense with all the famous young stars who started out on SNL who have died of drug overdose. Definitely makes you think they had a change of heart and wanted to talk so they were killed...

             Yeah, I've always wondered why so many tragedies. They could indeed have had a change of heart. Then there's the fact that being involved with this stuff screws with your head. If they got involved in things they regretted, there'd be a tremendous sense of guilt. Then there's the blackmail. Who knows what they were ordered to do?

            I remember  an old SNL episode from I think 1988 or 89.  It was shown on MTV, when we got the original UK-MTV in Germany, and not yet that  German version. So it must have been in the late 80ties or early 90ties. It was a SNL-show where Bryan Ferry appeared with two or three songs of his then new album (that's why I watched it).
            <br/>
            Well, I remember there was some joke in this show, which was called  "Pizza Boys"  or something like that... starting rather boring and unfunny and ending in a sexual innuendo ("you need a massage?" or something like that)  - it was meant to be funny, but made me feel a bit uneasy watching.   I did not know anything about a connection of "pizza"  and "sexual abuse" then, of course, but I never forgot about that stupid joke (and I forgot all the other crappy jokes of that show).  I know I recorded the Bryan Ferry part on an old VHS-tape, and there is  a little chance, that the rest of the show also was recorded. But maybe someone else here remembers that?  Maybe it was shown more often in the show? (I am not an SNL expert).

             Re "Pizza Boys:" One of my friends whose abuse started with the Catholic church said they referred to the kids as "sandwich boys," which was shorthand for, they wanted a sandwich and a boy, no, forget the sandwich, just send the boy.

             Good memory. UpVoat for that alone.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't know the show, but I'll try doing a search for it later. If your memory is accurate (and I'm sure it is), it would mean SNL was in on this crap from the beginning. How else would they do an inside joke using a code word? I never heard "pizza" used in any other way except for the accepted definition of it being a food. It was never used to refer to for sex or anything sexual.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for this.

              Here it is...!  I spent some time on the attic with my old VHS-tapes and finally found the right one.  That sketch was called "At the Movies" with "Gene Siskel" and "Roger Ebert". They are talking about "Boynapped", "Pizza Boys" and "Stanley Kubrick". So, what do you think?
             </p>
             <p>
              In my memory it was longer, but maybe there was more in the show, but I recorded just the Bryan Ferry songs in the show - and this part was recorded by accident, as it was shown just before Ferry's last song.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, here it is  (I set it on "private" as it seems that SNL-stuff quickly gets removed from youtube, if it's not on their official channel - maybe they don't find it when "private". But you can spread it of course):
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://youtu.be/hk9ZjEBycIU">
               https://youtu.be/hk9ZjEBycIU
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              I also put it on Russian "rutube" - if it should vanish from yt:
             </p>
             <p>
              rutube. ru/video/033f0ac4fc7d518cc4d0883ffa515919/
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh, voat tells me that "comment contains banned domains" - no Rutube allowed? wtf?
              <br/>
              (If you want to watch it, just take the link above and remove the empty space before "ru")

              </p>
              <p>
               They don't even have that skit listed!!!! I mean, I wonder why? From what you said, obviously it's pizzagate related. And I went to a couple of other places and they don't have this listed either ... wonder why? Youtube definitely scrubbed saying it violated community standards, and rutube? Yeah, I don't trust that site. Don't know a neutral site where you can put it.

                Yes, it's that SNL-Show... as listed in the nbc-link and that other "snl-transcripts" link above.
               </p>
               <p>
                But it is listed - in the "snl-transcripts":
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 At The Movies
Summary: Gene Siskel (Kevin Nealon) and Roger Ebert (Phil Hartman) review Christmas porno films.
Recurring Characters: Roger Ebert. *
                </li>
               </ul>
               <p>
                Youtube already sent me a warning - and that they deleted it - although it does not have any "views". Wow, that was quick!  But it's still online. Just visible for me?
               </p>
               <p>
                Rutube has it still listed. I have an account there - for cases like this one. It's my "exile".
                <br/>
                But I can upload it somewhere as a "file" or even a zipped file, it's just 1 minute / 6 MB.

              oh, found it here!  Season 13 Episode 06.  With Bryan Ferry and Danny DeVito. First aired  12/5/1987. There no Pizza-joke is mentioned,  well, hope my memory was indeed accurate here.. and not spoiled by all this pizza stuff of the last 12 months.. 
It's not on youtube, and here are only a few clips offered, which are just available in the US.

               Here it is...!  I spent some time on the attic with my old VHS-tapes and finally found the right one.  That sketch was called "At the Movies" with "Gene Siskel" and "Roger Ebert". They are talking about "Boynapped", "Pizza Boys" and "Stanley Kubrick". So, what do you think?
              </p>
              <p>
               In my memory it was longer, but maybe there was more in the show, but I recorded just the Bryan Ferry songs in the show - and this part was recorded by accident, as it was shown just before Ferry's last song.
              </p>
              <p>
               So, here it is  (I set it on "private" as it seems that SNL-stuff quickly gets removed from youtube, if it's not on their official channel - maybe they don't find it when "private". But you can spread it of course):

              </p>
              <p>
               I also put it on Russian "rutube" - if it should vanish from yt:
              </p>
              <p>
               rutube. ru/video/033f0ac4fc7d518cc4d0883ffa515919/
              </p>
              <p>
               Oh, voat tells me that "comment contains banned domains" - no Rutube allowed? wtf?

            Someone on 4chan just posted a little bit about Lindsay Lohan a 2004 episode. They were saying that while she was 17 she played sexy hemione granger and the subsequent drug/sex/all night party that she was prepped for by tina fey started her decline.

             Yeah, they're involved in all these weird things. And look at the string of drugged up comedians that ended up committing suicide or coming to a bad end.

             SNL really needs to be investigated by our community. Too many coincidences. And another one! Did a quick search for Lohan and up pops a "slumber" party with Lady Gaga at Chateau Marmont. That place rings a bell.  #creepy

              I may be wrong but Chateau Marmont, was that the place where a Magician was found hung in a closet and another murder connected too.  I believe it was his daughter or stepdaughter.  Think we researched it, a Society of sorts.  You know, mysterious code to get in, masks, etc.  Very Sinister Indeed.

                Some claim that the ghosts of famous celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Howard Hughes, Boris Karloff and Jim Morrison have made an appearance at the chateau. There are those who will insist that the Chateau is cursed since some people who have stayed there have went on to encounter terrible deaths afterwards.

                I remember now.  I had the wrong place.  CM is where Hunter S Thompson and Terry Richardson stayed as well  Sharon Tate &amp; Roman Polanski too.  Sordid and Spooky Guests Indeed.  Lohan is a real mess and I hope somehow she gets her life straightened out.  So very sad.

                 Did you see the Terry Richardson stuff on Twitter? Holy shit it was beyond bad. His wife is so abused. I wonder if she even knows she is? Her friends/family should perform an intervention.

                  Wow.  Yes, they should, but they are probably too scared.  They may have an inkling as to what is going on and who he is involved with.  Why would he bother with her if he is gay.  Why don't they just have a marriage of convenience?  Unless he is just some Masochist. Probably angry he has to put up the Charade and blaming her.

                   They might have children. I'm too afraid to look and see if they do. If they do, "Skinny" (yes, that's what he calls he because he keeps her half-starved -- he also cut off all her hair. Must be all of one inch now), someone has to put in a complaint and get those kids taken away. There's no way he could be a good father and be abusive to his wife.
