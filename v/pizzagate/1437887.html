            The Daily Mail is still elite connected. So it could be that they are just working to normalise it. Check through my recent post history, and you will find English aristocrats like Violet Hesketh and Lucy Guinness are connected to US child traffickers (in this case Ray Chandler, also another young woman). They have communicated openly on Instagram with this cryptic language they all use, including on chicken farming imagery. It's chilling. Chandler herself was hanging around with famous rappers as a child and was an associate of the Clintons as a 15 year old.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another circumstantial link. No proof, but I think we can be certain the English aristocracy is heavily involved in this stuff.
