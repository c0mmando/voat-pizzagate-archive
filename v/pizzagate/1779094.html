<p><em>Five international judges are examining evidence of child rape, torture, murder and kidnapping allegedly done by global elite members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network</em> </p>
<p><em>Human hunting parties were said to take place on the grounds of Belgium, Queen Beatrix’s Palace in the Netherlands. Two witnesses have named former Pope Joseph Ratzinger and Queen Beatrix’s father the deceased Prince Alfrink Bernhard, as being present at child sacrifices. Both were said to be Nazi sympathizers.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The witness, a retired public official, has named nine top judges, politicians, Bilderberger member George Soros and Prince Friso, the brother of the present King of Holland, as participants in killings of children she observed in Oudergem, Belgium and Zwolle, Holland during 1996 and 2000.</p>
<p>The witness gave her videotaped testimony last Monday to Court investigators.</p>
<p>“In some woods near Oudergem, they hunted those naked children through the forest and shot them down … then they cut off the penises of the dead boys and held them up as trophies.</p>
<p>I saw Belgian soldiers patrolling the woods and protecting the men who did the hunting, men like Prince Friso, King Albert of Belgium and Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>I recognized George Soros in the hunting party too, you know, the billionaire. He is good friends with Friso’s wife, Mabel Wisse Smit.”

            This "George Soros is a Nazi" meme needs to end, he does not claim guilt today because he himself is a cog in the machine that Germany was fighting against, did you ever take a moment to consider his opinion &amp; viewpoint is based on knowing more than that which was allowed to be written?
           </p>
           <p>
            Although I voted up on the aspect of hunting parties I must make this criticism more clear &amp; known.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some will give you a much harder time than just criticism alone but I hope you can understand.

            Friso, the brother of the present King of Holland died an un natural death a few years ago. His widow is definitely a "spook" big time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dunno why but they didn't attend his funeral; and he was supposedly brain dead for a while before they pulled the plug.
           </p>
           <p>
            The widow is using the Royal titles, though technically she is barred from that, since because of her past [consorting with some criminal] she was lacking approval by the Parliament; which by law she must have to use the title.

            It is most definitely a RACE. Practice of the religion of Judaism is optional for a BLOODline Jew.  (Many are completely agnostic.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Consider these points:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             One cannot convert to a big nose, funny-looking eyes, and a surname ending in -stein or -berg
            </li>
            <li>
             Jews typically marry other Jews.  That makes the Jewish "community" a closed gene pool, which is why so many geneticists love to study them.
            </li>
            <li>
             There are scores of Jewish GENETIC diseases.
             <a href="http://www.momentmag.com/genetics/">
              http://www.momentmag.com/genetics/
             </a>
             Obviously, this has nothing to do with the religion of Judaism or going to a synagogue.
            </li>
            <li>
             Rabbis state that there is a Jewish "race."
             <a href="http://rense.com/general45/race.htm">
              http://rense.com/general45/race.htm
             </a>
            </li>
            <li>
             Jews refer to their "tribe."  Obviously, "tribe" has nothing to do with religion.
            </li>
            <li>
             Every crypto Jewish male that I have researched has married a Jewish (bloodline, not religion) woman.
            </li>
            <li>
             Jews attempt to hide themselves behind changed surnames and outward religions, but once you learn what to look for you can spot them.  Craniofacial morphology and body habitus are excellent ways to spot them.  (Again, this is about genes/DNA and not religion.)  Genealogy, if available, is also quite helpful.

            Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network
           </p>
           <p>
            Regular Ninth Circle child sacrifices were said to take place in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals, the Vatican, on private estates and groves and government military bases in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, Ireland, France, England and the US. At least 34 child mass grave sites were identified in Ireland, Spain and Canada – and refused excavation by the respective governments, Crown of England and Catholic Church. Named as present in Ninth Circle activities were Pope Francis, former Pope Ratzinger;Anglican, United Church of Canada and Catholic Church officials including Cardinals; members of European royalty including Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip; officials of the Canadian, Australian, UK and US military and governments including the USA’s CIA, plus prominent government ministers, judges, politicians and businessmen from the US, Belgium, Holland, Canada, Australia, France, Ireland and the UK.
           </p>
           <p>
            Teens were drugged, stripped naked, raped, hunted down in the woods and killed by European royals according to this week’s latest eyewitness to testify before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. The woman was the fourth eyewitness to give accounts about these human hunting parties of the global elite Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. A former member of the Netherlands criminal drug syndicate known as Octopus testified that victims were obtained for these human hunting parties from juvenile detention centers in Belgium and Holland.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Ireland, Spain and Canada 34 child mass grave sites were discovered and appeared linked to Ninth Circle activities. The largest was the Mohawk Indian Residential School in Brantford Ontario where child remains were identified in 2008 before the Catholic Church, Canadian government and English Crown shut down the dig by professional archeologists. The 2013 ICLCJ Court had found Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip guilty for the Oct. 10 1964 disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic residential school in Kamloops British Columbia. In the first two weeks of the 2014 court witnesses identified Dutch and Belgian royal participants in the rape and killing of Mohawk children and newborns. Named were Bernhard and King Hendrick, consort to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another court document called the Magisterial Privilege indicated child sacrifice was a regular occurrence at the Vatican. At the tender age of 12 “Svali” of San Diego County California claimed she was brought to catacombs beneath the Vatican to witness the sacrifice of a three year-old drugged boy. In this video her interviewer said that 24 years prior a “Maria” told him she witnessed another satanic child sacrifice rite in the same Vatican Catacombs.

           <p>
            found guilty in same court was Pope Francis and Pope Benedict, also Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip
           </p>
           <p>
            Pope Francis’s fast ascension to head the Argentina Catholic Church was suspected to be a result of an agreement between Pope Francis and the Junta military to traffic children from Catholic orphanages
           </p>
           <p>
            A year ago Catholic Pope Francis came to power over the global Catholic Church after Pope Benedict resigned from office. The unprecedented resignation of a Catholic pope happened within days of Pope Benedict being served an arrest warrant by the same international court that would try Pope Francis in March.

            The five or six year-old child was gagged, repeatedly raped, killed, disemboweled and dismembered. Her blood was consumed by nine red-robed figures that included a member of the British Royal Family.

             There is no court by that name that you mention. it's made up. it's all part of Kevin Annett's fiction. He is an Occupy Wall Street communist wacko that plagiarizes real stories, like that of Marc Dutroux and the x-dossiers, and incorporates them into his completely made up courts of crap. His sites (yes, sites, he runs multiple) are NOT a legitimate source of information. If you want to learn more about the Netherlands and Belgium and the real atrocities there, there are other actual real sources that are trustworthy. The defrocked priest's sadly, are not.

              Went with what the titled story showed.  What I wanted to do was introduce The Ninth Circle and how wide spread it is. I believe these are the Illuminati. The crimes are very real, The satanic sickness is very real.  Many of these stories have been in the news but lacking details and seem to be quietly going away. How do you fight something so big, so dug in, so protected?  So many swamps, But a good start is cleaning up our own swamp, that we are not complacent or enablers of this. Our Judicial System needs big changes to meet this demand. Getting the foxes out of the henhouse and death sentences with no appeals.  I will try to be more careful on the things I post, Common sense says there's something up with that court. I tend to look everything up and failed to do so. Thank You for correcting, but the links I posted, I believe, tells about a very frightening cult, one of which wants to continue doing what it does, and will do everything and anything to do just that

            I think the main point of pizzagate, something none of us want to really digest, is that this is all actually satanic. It is no coincidence that Hillary has been practicing witchcraft since the 70's, and that Guccifer2 said
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “Hillary Rodham Diane Clinton is one of the high priests, a goddess of this ocult, (sic) satanic, shadow group. One must see their evil and profoundly corrupt motive to understand what I am talking about.”

             i know, i'm sorry. but it's so important for us to know since Soros has so much influence, and is actually considered to be a philanthropist!

              They say they're "doing so much good" for everyone....and that's how I arrived at my user name. It's pretty disgusting how they basically "rape" good people of their hard earned money for their "philanthropic deeds".  Soros, CGI, CF, McCain,NCMEC and so many more. I've long thought it better to simply help those in and around one's community rather than giving to some "charity" that sucks all the money into administrative salaries and fundraisers, aka elite networking parties.

              All we can do is to keep digging and spread the information after its been checked and verified. These people are incomprehensible monsters.Beatrice has appeared somewhere before in this investigation but I can't recall. As the women stated these people are operating outside of investigation and accountability. Its left up for open source investigators like ourselves to expose these bastards.

            There are other first hand accounts of human hunting parties in Europe and Australia. They are heinous, and the people in the videos can barely keep it together to tell their story. You can see that they relive it as they tell it. I heard about the Hampstead case, and studied everything I could in it, absolutely horrified. During that search, I ended up finding out about these parties, and the fact that Soros was there. I literally had to take a break from the Internet after that, I was so shaken, I went numb. I quit investigating this stuff until pizzagate popped up. Not I am glad to be able to share because it's less horrifying when you've got a community to discuss it with you. Years ago I had to just sit with this knowledge all alone.

            I just woke up from a weird dream about sneaking through a cult complex and then being arrested, then intimidated, then released but followed by a man and a woman in two different cars. They trapped me on the freeway and got out with silver six shooters and started firing at my vehicle. I managed to get away unscathed and ran through a field toward the tree line. While watching out, I checked instagram on my phone (lol) and saw a meme that said "if you wake someone up, you'll wake up dead." It's the first time I've seen a meme in a dream and so I made it.

             That's funny. I used to spend so much time on Facebook, that I would dream I was scrolling through my newsfeed, complete with (made up by my brain) memes, statuses, pictures, news articles...lol I just wish I could remember some of the memes, they were pretty good.

            Another example of the elite existentialism pedo mindset.
           </p>
           <p>
            To the pedos who believe the end justifies the means, innocent children are just fuel for their fire – the means to an end.  This is the typical Satanic / Luciferian outlook, pedo or not.  It’s the same reason soros can say he has no guilt over committing atrocities that we call evil – because
            <em>
             If someone’s going to do it… why not let it be me?
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            MSM and controlled opps want to convince us that pedo is an “acquired taste” and that there’s such a thing as power-elites who are “pedo-lite,” but that isn’t true.
           </p>
           <p>
            Destroying innocence is their religion… it’s how they worship… and the means by which they ascend to that “higher order” of illuminated masters.  This enlightenment by any means necessary is what their lives revolve around.  This is what the giants of pizzagate are involved in.

            Guys I don't doubt some of this is true but the "International Tribunal Court in Brussels" aka "George Dufort" is a scam/hoax run by a nut bag and defrocked Anglican priest in Vancouver. It is bullshit and doesn't exist. He takes true stories and add a his own spin and people then believe and circulate it. Please stop spreading the inaccurate/fabricated sources like this one as it delegitimizes the real pizzagate investigation.

              Kevin Annett runs dozens of websites under a variety of names - ITCOJ, ITLCJ, ITCCS, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is no Common Law Court in Brussels. Only the US and U.K. Use common law, the rest of Europe uses civil law. It's all a cleverly worded hoax. Including the so called Ninth Circle Sacrifice Network or whatever.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also look at his email addresses - gmail.com and yahoo.ca? Why would an international court of this caliber be using free email addresses? It makes no sense.
             </p>
             <p>
              Shame on people like Annett that take real stories and mold them into a non-existent mega-conspiracy. There's enough evidence of conspiracy in the first place but the truth is that not all the dots can always be connected. People that try to go out of their way to tie every conspiracy known to man into one easily explainable story should always be viewed with skepticism. It's probably fair to say that most "conspiracies" are associated with NWO type agendas, but not all - and there is no consensus on who exactly is behind the NWO. Some say Jews, some say British, some say Freemasons, some say Vatican/Jesuits, some say Illuminati, some say CIA, some say Knights Templar, some say Nazi's. who freaking knows. All I know is anyone that tries to tell me that they are the one true source of knowledge of these things and that their explanation of it all regarding the sources and background and purpose/agenda - I am going to immediately question why I should believe anyone else over their perspective.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's bad enough that The Powers That Be lie and hide things from us, but even worse that people try to steal the podium to spoon feed us their own narrative and expect us to trust them - when really we don't know if they are Cointel, Disinformation Agents, Gatekeepers, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've noticed the further you go down the rabbit hole the closer you get to outright schizophrenical bullshit pushed by nutbags. It takes a great deal of common sense to approach things rationally. Just because there is evidence of an obvious coverup doesn't automatically mean it is proof of a very specific theory behind it. Clinging to one single explanation behind every conspiracy is as closed minded as the people who don't believe in conspiracy theory at all and believe everything the MSM tells them to. Let's not be as stubborn as those people.

              The burden of proof is on the person actively making the claim. I am not lying about the "international tribunal court of justice... in brussels" being bullshit. it's made up. It's concocted by a defrocked priest named Kevin Annett. This is all well known. There are real testimonies of real SRA victims, and I have no doubt that he has incorporated their actual testimony into his bullshit. It still doesn't validate the rest of the crap on ITCSS.org and ITCOJ.org and whatever the hell else he runs.

He said he has had these thoughts since childhood.
Aren't some kids singled out and told they are very special while being tortured and raped?
No excuse but may be an explanation?

             How am I a raging fucktard? It says he's Jewish in the post. Doesn't mean he didn't help the Nazi's. He probably hates himself and that's why he has no trouble watching children be tortured, and murdered.

             They own the news outright, or own people who own media outlets.   Him and Rothschilds,  Rockefellers,  the German and UK members  and others are part of the small circle, that ripples out in larger rings. 
People like Clintons are only wannabe's who bow to them in the outer rings of the circle, as pathetically described in  Hillary's   Podesta wikileak to Lynn Rothschild, Rothschild's  tweet berating and dressing down of  John Podesta and Podesta's  immediate media scramble to regain face  (as ugly as that mug is).   Look at    Podestas idiotic claim    that people believed it was a false flag to   remove guns, when Rothschilds earlier tweet stated that guns should be removed.    They're very deviant, evil, corrupt,  stupid rich people who run our world.

             That sounds just like America. When royals are involved (here, our royals are people like the Clintons and Soros) rules don't apply. And they control the media, so we don't hear what they don't want us to hear.

              I think with this Syria fiasco, even the most die-hard Trump supporters are starting to see he's not honest. Years ago he "identified in many ways as a Democrat", but then when he wanted to be president he said the right words and a significant segment of the conservative voting base just took him at his word without ever doing any serious research on the man, or selectively researching out of a desperate need to believe that they actually had a representative in the race. What they failed to realize is that the Left also was in the same exact boat with Hillary Clinton. So odd that they are old friends right? We're supposed to believe all that is in the past and the election was not staged to offer one of two neoliberal fascists; one speaking populism, the other speaking liberalism, and yet both secretly spoke corporatism. We are not a functioning democracy anymore and this election was naked proof of that.

            79487934:
Is Soros an ideologue or a profiteer? He seems a bit old to be the latter.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ideologue. Believes he and his cohorts are the answer to ending all world wars. Todd Huizinga’s book The New Totalitarian Temptation reveals the mindset quite adequately.
           </p>
           <p>
            79488021:
Where does Soros stand in all of this?
           </p>
           <p>
            Soros funds, instructs, and influences every layer of government. right down to the tax code.

           <p>

            The reason he's a "nazi sympathizer" is because he knows the Holohoax® was 100% staged and financed by his fellow jews.

             It would really help if you would learn the difference between being a Zionist and being a Jew. Zionists are behind a lot of global political manipulation whereas Jews is the term for an ethnic or religious group covering a broad swath of humanity. There are definitely Jews that are anti-zionism.

             George Soros and Hitler helped the Jews to the "summer camps" where they were protected from the bombings and then after the war Israel was created and they were given Israel as a country of their own.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now why do they need Israel?...because they knew the day would come when the goyim would wake up and kick them out of their countries so they needed a country to fall back on...thats why the Jews in USA government have dual citizenship...Israel and the US.
            </p>
            <p>
             Did Hitler ever talk about Jewish Ritual Sacrifice of children?...NO...he helped them get their country Israel.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why the Jews control nearly 100% of all media...to cover up their crimes;

             The reason he is a "nazi sympathizer" in this article has nothing to do with whether the holocaust happened, but he admits to collecting property from his fellow Jewish people, saying he feels no guilt about it because they would have lost that property anyway. It builds the overall message I'm trying to elucidate here, which is that George Soros is a psychopath, a dangerous person who happens to exert a fuckton of control over the US and beyond.

             That's why Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble had their book burning. They don;t want people to know the truth. That's who they continue continue their money scam over 70 years later, while ignoring the Armenia/Greek/Assyrian, the Bolshevik initiated genocide in Russian including the Ukrainian Holodomor genocide, the Iranian genocide, the Chinese commie genocide--in total over 300 million people. All of it perpetrated by the same group under different names.

              It is said here all the time, you guys just don't know how and when to judiciously bring the topic up. You think you can just ram it down people's throats. But how long did it take you yourself to get redpilled about it? Thus you are heavily downvoted because people think you're shills (and JewBurger IS a shill).
             </p>
             <p>
              In the posted you tube here of Bill Still (it's short) just look what FBIAnon says about George Soros. Choose your red-pilling moments wisely.

                It is said here all the time, you guys just don't know how and when to judiciously bring the topic up. You think you can just ram it down people's throats. Choose your red-pilling moments wisely. And there are others though that need to hear it.

             Indeed it was 100% a hoax. The thought crimes in Germany says it all. Can't question the holohoax without going to jail. Free speech at its finest.
