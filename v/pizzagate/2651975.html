            I don't know. Being British and of a certain age, BH was always in the tabloids from '93 on. He might know something, he might not. I remain skeptical of him, drugs and all that stuff, he could just see online what is relevant from QAnon to PG and decide to reclaim his fame.

            Andrew Ash, as you can see has learning difficulties and so would be very easy to confuse. Harvey also has video evidence of Ash being Bullied into repeating what others want him to say. This is his own words
