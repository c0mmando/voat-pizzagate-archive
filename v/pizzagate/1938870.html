<p>I literally just learned this today. Obviously this was quite a shocker. This is Pizzagate related because it explains how the U.S. Government can get away with lying.

            You think someone personally involved has this much time to put into writing responses under different account names? He's also RWeSure. But hey, anythings possible at this point. There are definitely people out there with high IQs doing shitty jobs, it's a sign of the times. A couple months ago he and I had a go around and I wouldn't budge, he kept getting me to change my view, I held my ground and he his, it was relentless he wouldn't stop. It was like he HAD to have me change my view but I wouldn't and didn't. Fuckin sociopaths I can't stand them but I can sense them from afar. The question I have is why does he switch handles from AreWeSure to RWeSure? I mean come on, like we are the preschoolers he's after. Why not just stay on the one handle? He must be on Reddit too.

             Yep. They're making it very easy to figure out what they're afraid of. If there's one conclusion Historians will make about this cluster fuck it's almost without fail the Deep State did the exact worst thing whenever it really mattered. First it was Hillary and her Basket of Deplorables. Now it's their clumsy online offensive against George Webb.The Deep State has all the elegance and sophistication of a cow falling out of a tree right now.

             It reminds me of Adolf Hitler's last 2 years. Without fail he would snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The worst was the Battle of Kursk. Hitler might as well given control of the Wehrmacht over to Stalin and it would still have been more effective than under Hitler. Fascinating.

             Of that I am sure as well. And thank you DTM for not attempting to drill me a new ass hole in your comment. Maybe you're starting to get it.

             I'm just like you just older. I thought Sandy Hook was real until this past Winter when the 2 months I had spent here convinced me there was more to the story at Sandy Hook.
            </p>
            <p>
             And when I discovered the truth I was in shock for at least a couple of days. I could not believe it. Then I kept going trying to find out the Truth behind all the infamous conspiracies we all know and love. They all fell like dominoes.

              I felt the worst after finding out about 9/11.
             </a>
             I almost vomited a couple of times thinking of the pure psychosis it took to kill 3500 Americans in cold blood.

            <p>
             You have said to me you thought I was a shill because I was pushing the argument this countries on the verge of a Civil War. You don't think so obviously but I do. You thought I was a shill sent here to stoke the flames of revolution so the government could justify declaring Marshal Law. Remember?
            </p>
            <p>
             And I told you to go look at my submissions to learn my real objective here is to spread Salvation and Forgiveness. It won't take you long to discover that about me:

            <p>
             We are on the verge of a Civil War. You're giving a slowly improving economy and dropping rate of unemployment too much credit. The Civil War I'm talking about is when the American Public is told the truth about 9/11 and the equally disturbing "non-crimes" like Sandy Hook. Just those two alone will get several MILLION alpha males into a gun store to buy assault weapons. Mark my words.
            </p>
            <p>
             The truth about 9/11 is coming out, at this point there's nothing the Deep State can do about it. They can try Dirty Bombs. They can try Martial Law. Nothing will work. The truth about 9/11 nullifies anything they can do. The horse done left the barn. When the average Joe wakes up they're going to see red and demand blood from the closest member of the Illuminati they can find.
            </p>
            <p>
             The ONLY WAY TO STOP THAT is to remind that average Joe of his Christian roots. The irony of ironies is the Deep State did everything they could to kill God the past 20 years and that's a decision that's going to haunt them terribly.
            </p>

            They sure are good at making the description seem innocent. Public diplomacy broadcasting? Lol. That doesn't sound so bad. It's ridiculous that they say we spread fake news. But, they get paid to do it. I'm so sick of the hypocrisy!

            Assuming this act does open doorways to deceive the US citizenry, ask yourself this. Has anything prevented agencies of the US government from lying to the public previously? That includes complete disinformation campaigns and coordination between agencies? I can't think of anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are regulations in place that instruct intelligence agencies not to undertake certain activities in the US, limiting their actions to other counties. The CIA is not supposed to conduct any domestic operations. But they are also not accountable to any authorities. So they do as they wish and risk only a meaningless congressional investigation and hearings. All judicial actions can be shut down with simply citing national security.
           </p>
           <p>
            The FBI is supposedly a domestic law enticement agency with no international authority. That didn't stop them from forming an international terrorism division.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's also a massive loophole in the system that prohibits spying and harassment of US citizens by any US agency. Because of our 5-eyes relationship with Britain, Canada, Australia, and our admitted intelligence sharing, the countries contract with each other to troll their own citizens. It helps that they are all English speaking nations. This is one major reason why so many trolls online and here on Voat are British and Canadian.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for events mentioned in this discussion like Sandy Hook, that's another matter that can't be smoothed over by extending authority to propagandize. Because those events involve things like financial fraud, misappropriation, criminal fraud, child abuse and even murder, they are subject to prosecution. It's even possible (some have theorized) that a deceptive event like Sandy Hook could be prosecuted under the False Claims Act because there was so much cross departmental fraud going on. But that act is geared for private corporations defrauding the government, not the government defrauding itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            But hey , if anyone could identify that fraud and it was prosecuted they could earn 15-30% of the recovered funds.

             Yes, the Constitution.

            <p>
             Don't worry, the NDAA and Smith-Mundt were built with great risk to the Deep State. They opened up the possibility the U.S. Government can be sued for things like Sandy Hook.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everything was fine until Hillary Clinton lost. Now the house of cards is coming down. In the case of Sandy Hook the State of Connecticut will be paying millions of dollars in court settlements after they're sued down to a bloody stump.

            Back about 15 years ago, when the internet was a new thing, I remember reading an actual report, I think from the U.S. government but possibly from an NGO, which said the U.S. government would do things like this in the future. I thought it was part of the government's "Global Trends" series - in which experts say where things are heading 10 to 15 years in advance -but I haven't been able to find it. I thought, though, that even some alternative news site talked about it at the time.
           </p>
           <p>
            The example given in this report was literally this: in the future there would be an incident with Cuba and a fake Fidel Castro video would be shown on t.v. He would be digitally created, and it would be the U.S. government behind it for the purposes of propaganda. And I remember this report so clearly stating: "and the target (for this fake Castro propaganda) wouldn't be the Cuban people, but the American people."
           </p>
           <p>
            So 15 years ago they were already saying they would turn and use propaganda against America.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the Global Trends page. It's from the Director of National Intelligence.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/global-trends-home">
             https://www.dni.gov/index.php/global-trends-home
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The Castro scenario sounds like it's from Global Trends (which uses fictional scenarios) but I haven't been able to find it (yet) in old reports.

              Of course, I get it! I finally understand. You'd like to see the United States be replaced by some Communist government or at the very least go pretty far down that road.
             </p>
             <p>
              What a relief. It's like I was finally able to scratch that itch that's been bugging me since I met you AreWeSure.

             <p>
              I've got some really bad news for you though. Ever hear of Yuri Bezmenov? I'll paste in a Youtube search below. He describes the whole process in great detail. Trigger Warning! Ready? Here goes:
             </p>
             <p>
              Yuri Bezmenov explains after the Revolution succeeds the first thing they do is gather up all you bleeding heart idealist, line you up in front of a wall and shoot you.
             </p>
             <p>
              You been duped AreWeSure. Ever read any George Orwell? You might want to look into a book he wrote called "1984". He once said:
             </p>
             <p>
              "There are some ideas so bad only an Intellectual could believe them."

                We've been over this before. I don't trust anyone in the American intelligence community because they couldn't figure out David Rockefeller and George H.W. Bush decided to play God on 9/11 and kill 3500 innocent human beings to justify 2 very unsuccessful wars in the Middle East. Of course anyone like you who believes 9/11 was carried out solely by 19 Muslim terrorists will consider us all wing nuts. And of course since you believe the government's story I think you're some sort of Idiot Savant that has figured out how to type things on the Interwebs but is unable to process the information and form rational conclusions.
               </p>
               <p>
                But I believe you about not being a Communist. I'm now pretty sure you're a Democrat so we're making progress. And if you're a Democrat in possibly work in DC then you could be working for the SEIU which is obviously a union and would explain your "Now you're getting closer." comment.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'd like to remind you that at this point I'm a fellow

                like you. I believe in Unions provided they pull another Detroit. If I had my way I'd tax Wall Street out of existence and make everyone there go out and get real jobs. I detest Rich People with the heat of a thousand suns. And I'm not joking. Sometimes I fantasize about digging up David Rockefeller's cold corpse and burning it at the stake. In fact I'd like to separate the entire Rockefeller Family from its money by force of arms if necessary. I believe in Reparations for black people because of George H.W. Bush's lucrative

                . I'd also like to see all money removed from the campaign for all Congressional elections House and Senate. I can fill you in on details if you're curious. I could go on for hours. You get the point.

               <p>
                Forgive the long response but I'm just trying to understand what makes you tick. As soon as you write something articulate and well researched you come out with some gem like calling Domestic Propaganda by the euphemism  "Public Diplomacy Broadcasting".

               <p>
                Basically you're a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma for me. It's fun. I'm trying to solve the mystery behind AreWeSure.

                 Imagine this though: AreWeSure is paid to sit at a desk and respond to posts ALL DAY. That is his job. Think about that for a moment. You gotta be some kind of broke or dedicated to want to do that, spreading lies and misrepresentation all fucking day long. Wow. Just wow. Oh and you know he's on other platforms too not just Voat. Almost feel sorry for him.... not!!

               I'm poor. 25 years ago I was kicked out of the American Aristocracy. During my brief 8 years living high off the hog I learned one thing: The American Aristocracy would love for you to blame "The Jews(tm)" and Israel for everything, especially this recently deceased

                 No I don't. I've said here many times Mossad was involved in 9/11. George H.W. Bush hired Mossad demolition experts.

             Yes. Smith-Mundt Modernization and the updated NDAA allows any agent of the U.S. Government to come here and legally lie. This isn't even a question AreWeSure. Please read:

              That's funny.             Smith Mundt only applies to the State Department. It's the law authorizing the public diplomacy broadcasting.   It certainly doesn't apply to any agent of the US. Government.  And it's about broadcast and print materials.
             </p>
             <p>
              DUDE. You just linked to an article that doesn't mention SMITH MUNDT whatsoever.    AND what is does discuss are documents produced by the British Government, not the US.

              <p>
               George's biggest problem as a "journalist" is lack of basic training. He doesn't know how to do basic research because he studied computer science and not a research based subject. GW just does not understand the concept of Primary Source.

              <p>
               He also makes the "undergraduate" error of coming up with a hypothesis and then finding evidence to support it.

               I pasted in a link to the Glenn Greenwald Intercept article for a reason. Unless you're going to claim Greenwald made that up this isn't debatable. The U.S. Government now has the legal right to lie to the American people.

               This wasn't always the case. We used to have a government that didn't have the right to lie. Remember those days AreWeSure?
It was way back before Barrak Obama "fundamentally changed America".

                Nothing in that Glenn Greenwald article applies to Smith Mundt.   You can believe me or not, but you completely misunderstand what you are talking about.  But that is article is wholly irrelevant, nothing in that applies to Smith Mundt.

                You're wrong about Smith Mundt. 
You're wrong about the update in 2013.
You're wrong that is applies to individuals on message boards.

                   Which law? I discovered two laws today: Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012/2013 and the updated
                   <a href="https://www.occupycorporatism.com/how-the-ndaa-allows-us-gov-to-use-propaganda-against-americans/">
                    NDAA
                   </a>
                   . In fact I discovered another law after we last talked:
                   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countering_Foreign_Propaganda_and_Disinformation_Act">
                    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countering_Foreign_Propaganda_and_Disinformation_Act

                   Since I haven't read the fine print having just learned about them TODAY. How about I ask you:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Are there laws anywhere on the books in the U.S. that allows the U.S. government to hire shills to spread disinformation and propaganda on the Interwebs? For example like on an internet message board like

             They aren't a problem for me. I love to beat up on shills. I would miss the dummies if they dissapeared. They have no game and are easy to clown. Their angle is fixed, so they are stuck taking losing arguments and resorting to ridicule.

            There was also passage of a bil HR 6393 (I think Will have to look it up again) was passed sneakily into the new NDAA that gave government officials the right to determine what was Russia propaganda and wipe it from the Internet or order news media to not print it. This was slipped in at the last minute by Obama Administration as pizzagate was breaking after the election. It was none other than John Podesta himself who was in R-Devin Nunes office pressuring this to get passed because Russia was behind all the fake news about things like pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I posted about this urgently at the time because it was obvious what they were doing. Shortly after the web began erasing history, youtube was demonetized, the ridiculous lying articles were posted.

             Yes that was very concerning. And I think the elites told us they'd do that years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             Back about 15 years ago, when the internet was a new thing, I remember reading an actual report, I think from the U.S. government but possibly from an NGO, which said the U.S. government would do things like this in the future. I thought it was part of the government's "Global Trends" series - in which experts say where things are heading 10 to 15 years in advance -but I haven't been able to find it. I thought, though, that even some alternative news site talked about it at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             The example given in this report was literally this: in the future there would be an incident, where a fake Fidel Castro video was shown on t.v. He would be digitally created, and it would be the U.S. government behind it for the purposes of propaganda. And I remember this report so clearly stating: "and the target (for this fake Castro propaganda) wouldn't be the Cuban people, but the
             <em>
              American
             </em>
             people."
            </p>
            <p>
             So 15 years ago they were already saying they would turn and use propaganda against America.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is the Global Trends page. It's from the Director of National Intelligence.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
             "Every four years since 1997, the National Intelligence Council has published an unclassified strategic assessment of how key trends and uncertainties might shape the world over the next 20 years to help senior US leaders think and plan for the longer term.

             The MSM, big business/big banks and Deep State have basically joined forces to become the Federal government.

             Until people on both sides realize that they're getting fucked by DC, no matter whether it's a D or R next to the name, nothing will change.

              I also think that is why these guys like the one that shot Scalise are supposedly Bernie supporters.  I think they are trying to make sure the Trumpsters do not team up with the FeelTheBerners.

              Exactly. That is why it was so sickening to watch John Podesta in R-Devin Nunes office helping him craft the legislation over "Russia"
while pizzagate was exploding with his name on it. They save themselves. I think Devin Nunes has now been advised by a whistleblower though.

             I believe you and I'm sure they thought it would help protect them but the Deep State fraud is massive. They can't hide this much longer. The truth will out, it always has and always will.

               DTM I was kicked out of the Upper Class after I failed to secure employment on Wall Street up my graduation from Brown University in Providence RI. I've been falling ever since. I can assure you I'm not one of them.

               I'm the real deal. The problem is I don't agree with you on everything. When you get older you'll realize that's actually a GOOD thing. The last thing anyone wants is to be among people

               How about everyone wakes up to the truth, evil people are simply outed for the slimebags they are, and finally Nature is allowed to correct the wrongdoings of evil. No more bullshit. Just Natural order. How long do you think a child molester would last without the protection of "the law"? Just get rid of bullshit laws that protect evil people, and let True Freedom return to the planet.

            HR 5736 was not passed until January 2013, sneakily, as part of the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act.
           </p>
           <p>
            So a law that legalized strategically contrived domestic media stories to dupe the population was hastily passed weeks after Sandy Hook.

               I always hear this yarn "Americans won't fight back, even if they find out about PedoGate, NSA spying, the works, they're too fat and lazy to do anything." While I do believe that they are pushing obesity on Americans to put them in exactly that state, I think even your average Southern fatass who guzzles Bud Light would having no issue picking up a rifle and shooting both Podesta Bros in the fucking face if PedoGate became a provable fact.

                 There are many black people living in DC and all those missing black children are theirs. I would not want to be in that town when they find out what happened to them all.   And all the other missing children in our land. I am only afraid that the blood will be ours and not theirs.  They have militarized the PDs of the country. Some even have mini tanks.  We may be short of weapons.  Also, remember there is the mafia and their MS-13. This will not be pretty.

                 That's why the "legalize kid fucking" agenda is going to go full-steam ahead, and pretty soon these ANTIFA fucks will be openly pro-pedo as well. They will spin the narrative into "what's the big deal" and try to get as many people as possible to have at least some level of "understanding" or "sympathy" for pedos.

             It's scary they got away with that. I consider myself pretty well informed and I had NO IDEA that's what HR 5736 was.

            <p>
             No one knows about HR 5736 and how it justifies things like Sandy Hook. To prove Sandy Hook was a hoax all people need to see is the text in HR 5736.

               DarkMath is completely wrong in his interpretation of this.   Notice that it says it applies only the State Department and the work of the Broadcasting Board of Governors which do public diplomacy broadcasting mainly through news services.  You can go here and see what it says
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="https://www.bbg.gov/who-we-are/mission/">
                https://www.bbg.gov/who-we-are/mission/
               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               It does not apply to postings on message boards.
              </p>
              <p>
               The 1948 bill never prevented Americans from gettting and using this material.  If I had a radio station, I still could have asked for this material and licensed it to us on my radio station.  if the broadcast used material from the AP or Reuters or other news services, I would need a license from them as well.  In fact, the law says they should use public news sources wherever possible.   The distinction is that you would have to make the request.
              </p>
              <p>
               One of the arguments for updating this bill came about from fighting terrorism.   If you look at the BBG website. The broadcasts are fairly niche, like VOA Somalia.  This is because the law basically has a non compete clause.  If private media is adequately covering a topic, the BBG is not allowed to create programming in that sphere.  Recently people wanted to broadcast VOA Somalia to the Somali community in the US.  The idea was this was the best news source on Somalia and would provide counterweight to the broadcasting/messaging done by the Al Shabab terrorist group which is one of the only  news sources regularly available to Somalis.  And the US is hugely influential to Somalia.   Do you know what the President of Somalia's previous job was ?  He worked in the Buffalo office of the New York Department of Transportation
