Humans have been a form of currency for as long as there have been civilized society. This is also true for drugs and arms. By keeping these things illegal, government discourages open trade, there by naturally creating an oligarchy enforceable by military and law enforcement. We have seen the government deal in illegal arms and drugs, but all of a sudden, humans are off limits?</p>

<p>First step... Can we create a list of high level people that have been at least credibly accused of child trafficking? Does not need to be proven because in order to get law enforcement to act, there just needs to be a reasonable suspicion. We are just trying to show that there is enough allegations to act and no one is acting. This is the organization part of the human trafficking.</p>',
