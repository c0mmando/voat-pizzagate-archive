            This made so much sense. But, I've read other things before where they keep mentioning Robert Steele (Bob). It will say how he knows so much and to ask him. Does anybody ever get the feeling that Robert Steele is actually writing these anonymously and points to himself?
           </p>
           <p>
            He was on Alex Jones a while back and kept saying Trump needs to call me. Trump needs to get ahold of me. I could really help Trump. He needs to listen to me. I don't know if it could be that he knows so much that he gets anxious to spill. Maybe he's an attention seeker wanting to Be well known and have some excitement in his life.  Or maybe he's limited hangout. But, I always feel weird when I read things that keep saying that Robert Steele knows. Ask Robert Steele.

            Just a heads-up: YourNewsWire is not a reliable site. They published fake news about the attorney shot in Atlanta.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, this is old news from February that has been posted and discussed multiple times.

            Thanks for posting this. If people who do not know by now who is really pulling the strings, Howdy Doody's and everyone elses in DC, then VOAT is just misdirection.

            Like that Dutch financier said, "read the Protocols". He should know; he was in the thick of it and was telling people who was behind it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at the big picture, look at who benefits.
           </p>
           <p>
            From the article,"Understand that if Trump and Putin work together to defeat Isis, they are actually defeating a CIA/Mossad creation, and furthermore, Syria and Iran grow stronger, which the Saudis and the Israeli’s fear. Their goal was to divide Syria and ultimately destroy Iran’s regime. It is not just an oil grab, but a much bigger attempt at moving the chess pieces to allow Israel and Saudi Arabia to dominate the entire Middle East."
           </p>
           <p>
            The "royals" of Saudi Arabia were "created" in the 20th century and are crypto Jews. Didn't you ever wonder why they get away with cutting people's heads off in a soccer stadium every Friday? Emptying their prisons to furnish Israeli Secret Intelligence Service? Helping Mossad murder hundreds of Iranians at the Haj? etc. etc. Didn't you ever wonder why the Saudis who are supposed to guard the most holy site of Islam, and who have F16 and all sorts weapons they have been using them only on Yemen, never on Israel?

             Yes Saudi is Crypto Jew.  I did not know this till I ran down a rabbit hole four months ago.  It seems lots of the real religious Muslims know the truth but the Saudi Crypto money bribes the corruptible ones.  The Jew has the strategy to bribe the Goyim they have to and kill the ones who are honest.  Like Malcom X and the Kennedy Brothers.  Carrot and the stick....take the money or take the bullet.

              Most educated Muslims are aware of the Jew Saudis, just as they are aware of the Jewish Jordanian "royal" family.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Jews paid for a fake genealogy for Al Saud after WWII, so that the Jews could control Mecca and Medina and most of all the oil.
             </p>
             <p>
              The worst of it is that even if some people are aware of the fact that the Saudi royals so not even kneel, or prostrate themselves to pray, they are not aware of the fact that for centuries Muslims prayed facing Jerusalem. Or that many of "Mohamed's" wives were Jews, though he was actually a gay pedo.
             </p>
             <p>
              The worst of it is that the Muslim extremist Wahabi sect was founded by Abdul Wahab, who was descended from Donmeh Jews of Turkey( the Donmeh Jews were also the authors and perpetrators of the Armenian, Greek, and Syrian genocide which began in 1915). People in the Middle East are well aware of this, but there is still not much available in English as yet.

               Thanks....I just read your link.....its amazing how the Jew has put the world in a crazy mind cage.  I hope we are breaking it down.  I feel we are having some big successes. but some days are  just very discouraging.   Talking to others definetly helps my mental state.

            I agree that the so-called tense relations with Russia may be nothing more than theatre.  My investigations into the Hampstead children's case led me to the possibility that there was/is Russian involvement  as well as US and UK deep state enterprises.

            "CIA And Mossad Behind DC Pedo Ring"
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you Captain Obvious. Sorry to be so snarky but we've known this almost from day one. The CIA/Mossad/Muslim Brotherhood/the Bush-Clinton Crime Syndicate and probably the Saudis are all in bed with each other on this shit. And it's not just pedophilia and it's not just in DC, it's all over.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a Civil War going on within the CIA about it for sure and the Good Guys leaked the Bad Guys dirty laundry. I don't think there's a Civil War within Mossad it's just "The Jews(tm)" are cunning enough to work both ends at the same time. Let's face it "The Jews(tm)" got to be "The Jews(tm)" because they've been playing this 4D chess shit a lot longer than everyone else.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the Muslim Brotherhood is the junior member of the team and it really looks like they're being set up as the Fall Guy along with some other people and organizations. I don't know about the Saudis. I think they're just the investors supplying the seed capital when necessary.
           </p>
           <p>
            That leaves the Bush-Clinton Crime Syndicates. We learned in "Clinton Cash" that the Clinton Foundation gang raped Haiti and did much worse in Rwanda with Paul Kagame. It's bad and probably worse than anything we can ever imagine.

            Bingo, Trump is a Jew, Putin is a Jew.
           </p>
           <p>
            If your not a Jew, they don't even let you close to power, the GOY who know the game have their children marry Jews so they can be part of the team.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clinton comes to mind, even though they were white trash, Chelsea married into the Jew mafia, just like Ivanka married Kushner family, biggest mob family in Israel after Netanyahu.
           </p>
           <p>
            I always say, if your not part of the JWO ZOG, they don't even let you on TV, or have a website, or a google link. They only person who I trust is Jesse Ventura, you saw how long they kept him on MSM once they figured out they couldn't control him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most MSM like Jones are all controlled opposition, but they're well paid GOY,
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes GOOGLE "Trump is a Jew", his father was a Jew, and his mentor was Roy Cohn, NYC Mob Jew Lawyer.

             This is the Black Pill.   And god help us I hope it is not true.  But it may actually be what is going on.  It explains much.
            </p>
            <p>
             I only hold out hope that Trump is not actually on their team.  I remember his comments at the Catholic Roast style get together when Trump made some very pointed comments about Hillary taking several Villages in Haiti.  I know it was somewhat cryptic but I kind of think if Trump was controlled opposition he would not of dared to touch that open wound.  It leads to Pizzagate and leads to the whole control structure of ZOG.  Controlled opposition is of no value if they reveal TOO much just to give them street cred with us Normies.

             Thank you. Wanted to point out this is old. Still good info. Makes complete sense. Also allows you to view what's going on daily in a different light. Like Assange said this week, FBI will start leaking like Niagra with Comey out of the way. I can imagine it would be a full blown MOAB if they removed McCabe as well, as far as agents feeling empowered to leak. Either way, I hope people know that there are people just like us within the IC who are fed up and sickened by all of this and are working to expose it. Like FBIanon said, it has to be done delicately so as not to cause absolute chaos. The lower level arrests seem like the building blocks to a case.

               Listen the CIA is the MAFIA ran by NEO-CON since 1940's; They don't give a fuck about the USA, if their customer in Saudi wants to fuck white children, then the CIA delivers white children. If Israel wants the USA ppl drugged and dumbed then the CIA fills the USA with heroin and Kardashian TV.

                I didn't check those facts, I asked you to do it as I saw you sharing those three links. There's both truth and fakes in both MSM and alternative media, articles should always be checked not by the media they're on but as independent pieces. Stories related to Syria/Saudi Arabia/Israel (Mossad/CIA) are definitely more faked by the MSM than the alternative sites, but common media criticism should still be used on both.
               </p>
               <p>
                And I'm not telling you CIA isn't involved in drug trafficking. I agree on what you share about Saudi, as my general opinion, while I have not looked into that aspect close or long enough to share anything factual on that. More like a hunch at this point, hopefully more later.
               </p>
               <p>
                For my investigations, it's always helpful when people share links, and even more helpful if they share if (and why) they believed in those links. I also hope people to share opinions as opinions, claims as claims and facts as reliably sourced facts.

Company registration is also another large cost which we covered ourselves. We have not taken any investments (although we did receive quite a few offers and inquiries).

             covering up this stuff? Is he working for Palantir/Dyncorp? To cover-up PEDO-GATE?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
             Let's re-coup here, CIA/MOSSAD are GOV that run PEDO-GATE, but most of the shit is contracted out to private companys. We already know that DYNCORP run's the Royal Helicopter fleet to run children all over Saudi to be fucked. We also know that Palantir/Google ID's the children by face, and if the Saudi's like what they see, the "Finders" make sure the children are kidnapped and transferred to MENA.

            It worked. By long-kniving Flynn, they exposed their hand. Now, Trump has full executive powers to investigate the CIA and Mossad. Notice how there is sound and fury about “Russian influence” and utter silence on “Mossad” influence in our power structure?
           </p>
           <p>
            When FBI anon leaked in early July, the whole idea was to expose the Clinton Foundation,and to hint at the sale of “people” i.e. Pedogate. Look back at his exchange on 4chan. He is a gifted analyst, and knows just what stone to throw at Goliath’s noggin. By triggering the shadow Government, he helps citizen journalists ask the right questions and follow the right breadcrumbs, not the rabbit holes the Elite scum want you to follow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, PedoGate victims are speaking out on their experiences! You just had a story on some lady who went through having her family abused by California-Deep-State-sponsored terrorism. If folks knew that CPS in California is tied into a huge racket that kidnaps children from parents, they would realize just how sick this is. Foster homes, CPS, etc… all get paid well to jail parents and then snatch their kids away. These kids suffer abuse, and perpetuate the growing cancer called pedogate. Politicians who have pedophile tendencies are groomed for power, because they can be later extorted and controlled. Meanwhile, victims have no voice- until now. Suddenly, we have citizen journalism, and it will end up saving the people, in the end.

             Trump has the same amount of executive power to do that now that he had last week. He didn't just suddenly gain more executive power. What are you even trying to say?

             FBI anon is LARPing bullshit. If he knew aanything at all he could have just came out and said so instead of leaving "hints" that can mean anything. He's a rainmaker, nothing more.

              I think you should explain rainmaker for folks who don't know that concept.  But, that is a very useful lens to view FBIanon.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also think he was aware of people online believing in a mass pedophile conspiracy and how folks could buy into that.   That by talking about human trafficking he could tap into pre-existing theories and that such an emotional subject matter would hinder critical thinking.
             </p>
             <p>
              There was a post on here, but someone who said she was with government agency that tore him apart.  That post was deleted.   One of her main points was FBIanon was a pussy.  Every FBI agent she knew would not let kids keep getting hurt if they knew about it.  They would either blow the whistle for real and come out publically.  Or they would take their government issued weapons and go get the kids no matter what.  She was quite clear about their being no "pizzagate" case waiting for Jeff Sessions because there was no evidence and this online energy should directed in a way that would actually have an impact.   She also had a few tips for investigators.  The first of which was "Shit test your theories."   If you don't examine your theory, you could "lock" your investigation focus into something that is really at all, because you didn't do a shit test early on.  You could be making links and finding facts based on an assumption that isn't true.  And you would just be wasting time.

               "FBI anon is LARPing"
              </p>
              <p>
               I hate to disappoint you two shills but FBIAnon is for real.
               <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1480845">
                The proof is the order of the documents the FBI released
               </a>
               on November 1st. The first document referenced Trump's father and an old journal he had of Nicola Tesla's. That's exactly what FBIAnon had referenced as a joke in one of his previous AMAs.
              </p>
              <p>
               "For those who are new to this and don't understand the reference, on the original FBIanon posts, there was a joke circulating about Trump being a time traveler who found Nikola Tesla's time-machine (Fred Trump purchased the property Tesla's lab is on after Tesla passed away) Honestly, I thought that this person was just a very skilled role player and read his stuff bc they seemed fun/exciting. However, closer to election day, he stated that he and a few other agents were going to start fighting back and to watch for the signal on November 1 @ 11.
              </p>
              <p>
               At exactly 11, on November 1, the OFFICIAL FBI Records Vault twitter account, after several months of inactivity, dumped many tweets, the first one being a seemingly random document about Tesla &amp; Fred Trump. A nod to the people familiar with the 4chan posts."

          <p>
           <p>
            Q. So, in the Intelligence community, how chaotic is the atmosphere now?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. In my 34 years of Governmental service, I have never seen anything like it.  It’s the bifurcation of the entire intelligence apparatus.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. It seems the intel community has it in for Trump – is this your feeling?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. There are many Trump supporters within the FBI.  The CIA, however,  is against Trump because Trump threatens to ruin their game in the middle east.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. Can you elaborate?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. CIA and Mossad work in tandem with British intel.  The goal for the CIA was to replace Assad with a puppet and to topple Iran so we could access their oil.  Israel works closely with it’s “sister”, Saudi Arabia, to help this dark cause.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q.  So it seems like the intel community has it in for Trump. How can he protect himself?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Trump has a tremendous opportunity here, but needs to circle wagons. The travel ban included 7 countries chosen by both Jared Kushner and Rudy. Why did it not include Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan, or Turkey or other countries that hate us? The seven nations mentioned were chosen by Israel, that’s why. And the unspoken alliance of Israel and Saudi Arabia should be exposed. They are brother and sister. Jared Kushner needs to be careful with what he says and to whom. But, the biggest thing Trump can do is expose PedoGate via Sessions. Big names will go down hard, and it gets the blood suckers drained from the swamp. There are as many pedophiles on the Republican side as there is with democrats, but Trump is in a unique position to truly “clean up Dodge”, so to speak. I can tell you that what is in Anthony Weiner’s hard drive, and what videos exist via Jeffery Epstein, WILL BRING massive arrests – in time. Trump’s legacy could be truly great if he was to purge the CIA, stop the extortion, prosecute the pedophiles and reinstate the death penalty for pedo’s convicted a second time.  Pedogate is his path to greatness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. How does Russia fit into all this?
           </p>
           <p>
            A.  The CIA and Israel are responsible for the creation of Isis. Isis was created specifically to weaken Iran and destabilize Syria. It worked for awhile until Putin shored up Assad and bolstered Iranian Qud forces. The real reason you see such anti-Russian fever from both Schumer and McCain, Graham and Feinstein, is because the operation has blown up in our faces.
           </p>
           <h1>
            Q. Is Israel behind the anti Russian sentiment?
           </h1>
           <p>
            A. Yes. Israeli intelligence is furious with Trump, and will do anything to keep Trump from working with Putin.  Understand that if Trump and Putin work together to defeat Isis, they are actually defeating a CIA/Mossad creation, and furthermore, Syria and Iran grow stronger, which the Saudis and the Israeli’s fear. Their goal was to divide Syria and ultimately destroy Iran’s regime. It is not just an oil grab, but a much bigger attempt at moving the chess pieces to allow Israel and Saudi Arabia to dominate the entire Middle East.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. So they demonize Putin and try to tarnish the Trump administration?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. The Deep State is at war with both Trump and Putin. Understand that when Israeli intelligence hears “America first” from Trump, they go apeshit. Israel has bribed, extorted and intimidated our politicians for decades and suddenly this upstart billionaire threatens to ruin everything.
           </p>
           <h1>
            Q. You mention the word extort. Does that relate to Pizzagate?
           </h1>
           <p>
            A. PedoGate is only a modern term associated with a long history of Pedo-blackmail connected to both Israel and the Intel community. There is a full court press to stop PedoGate from being looked at because if people knew the true motives behind the pedophilia epidemic, they would do more than march on Washington. They could actually seed a revolution, with the spark coming from decent American parents who want to protect their kids. Our politicians are compromised. The senior analyst nicknamed “FBI Anon” alluded to this in his exchange with folks on 4chan and with you.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. What do you mean compromised?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Do you notice 2 central themes running through the MSM lately?  Those themes are “Fear the Russians” and “#PizzaGate is fake news“.  Both tropes come from the same place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. Can you explain?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. How do we exert power?  Via fear. Do you ever wonder why both Democrats and Republicans fall all over themselves to kiss up to Israel? Odd, since Israel is the size of Rhode Island… The fact is, many of our politicians – on both sides – have been compromised by CIA and Mossad for years. It’s actually not admiration they are expressing for Israel, but fear. Notice Lindsay Graham and Chuck Schumer repeating the same salute when it comes to Israel. How does that even happen? The American people are finally seeing that there is no two-party system, but one big shadow Government pretending we have political dichotomy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q.  So PedoGate is real and “they” have to get Americans to disbelieve it?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Let me explain how threatening PedoGate is… Who wins? Trump. Putin. Americans. Russians. The world…. Who loses? Israel, since they no longer can blackmail our politicians, the same goes for the CIA. The Shadow Government loses. But, the people win.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. Can you give me specific instances of politicians being compromised by Israel?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Sure. Lolita Island. Jeffery Epstein, a billionaire convicted of pedophilia received a soft sentence. His island was rigged with video recorders. Many politicians have been compromised. It was a Mossad/CIA operation. Contact ex-senior CIA CCS, Robert David Steele. Bob knows and has even spoken about this with numerous reporters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. So an ex-CIA senior agent named Robert Steele is on record saying Epstein’s island was a honey trap to lure our most powerful politicians into a extortion scheme?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Yes. There are videos of some of the most powerful players in the most humiliating positions. If this gets out, not only are the politicians ruined, but the extortion game is over and suddenly, the influence CIA and Mossad wield over Washington, is gone.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. Wow ! Now its all making sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Yes. lets continue this conversation later.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. So I checked out Robert David Steele, and he mentions Chuck Schumer being on Lolita Island. So does FBI anon. Is that why Schumer is targeting Trump’s cabinet picks?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Connect the dots.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. How many other politicians have been secretly extorted?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. One in three, roughly. It’s not just the Island, its all of their activities. The reason #Pedogate terrifies the media, the CIA, the Israel Lobby, is because they are all part of this “shadow swamp”
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. Former CIA agent, Robert Steele, says Mossad operated Lolita Island and CIA worked with them. That’s treason on all levels.
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Yes, and its espionage. Just as these leaks from the intel community regarding Flynn.  I expect that at some later moment, Trump will leak some of these videos
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. Wait. Trump has videos of politicians in ‘delicate” situations?
           </p>
           <p>
            A.  No, But the Intel community has them, and Trump has strong support among certain players in the community. Trump has said he wants to “throw a spotlight on the cockroaches”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. But Trump just met with Netanyahu and pledged the usual unbreakable bond with Israel.
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Theatre.  Netanyahu is desperate to both play Trump into attacking Syria,and hate Putin, and to convince him PedoGate is a conspiracy theory.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. That is what Robert Steele says, as well. So, exposing the Pedophiles diminishes Israel’s influence in American politics and also changes the map in a critical mass way?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. The same media screaming “The Russians are coming” is the same media who says “Pizzagate is fake news” That’s CIA and Mossad talking points.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. How do social media giants like Facebook and Google fit in?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. Facebook and CIA are literally the same petri-dish. Google became a Deep State organ courtesy of Eric Schmidt.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. Getting back to the Pedo stuff, FBI anon said in July of last year, that the Clinton Foundation sold secrets to foreign nations. Did they also engage in PizzaGate?
           </p>
           <p>
            A. There are videos of WJC that would destroy him. FBI anon leaked weeks ago, on purpose. There was a reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            Q. Ok, FBI anon gave Schumers initials, and Barnet Frank and others, but so far we have only seen low level arrests.
           </p>
           <p>
            A . FBI anon did a “bank shot”. That’s a pool hall term we use. Ask Bob about it. FBI Anon rattled their cages as other DHS and local authorities rounded up all sorts of street-level human traffickers. The big arrests will come in time, but first the small fish are interrogated, and provide information that leads to larger fish. FBI Anon was firing a shot across the bow, much like you shake a beehive to infuriate the bees. Notice how blatantly hostile McCain, Schumer, Graham, and others are? It was what we call a “targeted trigger“.
