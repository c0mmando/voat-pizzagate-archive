            One question I have is who might benefit from having a blackmailable sheriff in this precinct? Who hired the guy? Who contributed to his campaigns (aren't sheriffs elected?).

              Many of them stand down and are part of the human trafficking. They take kickbacks from the rings. When a Sheriff beat kids in Maryland then found in a county in Florida, where a boy was taken under strange circumstances who got away. The Press reports were strange and didn't make sense and some of the things the sheriff said did not make sense. Regular people reading the paper asked the right questions. Those in the community where the victim was from also pointed out interesting facts.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was the story of the Abduction of Clay Moore,  a 12 year old from Bradenton Fl. This happened while we were deeply entrenched in the Franklin Scandal investigation years later and connecting all of the dots.
             </p>
             <p>
              He was targeted and taken by a man at gunpoint into his truck at his school bus stop. He was taken to a ranch and tied to a tree. 
Later we assumed this was to be a pick-up point for someone else to take him and remove him from the area. Clay Moore proceeded to use a safety pin he had to poke holes continuously in the duct tape, rip it apart and break free. He ran until he found a man on a tractor. He said he was kidnapped by gun and wanted to use a phone to call his parents.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the reporting they said the boy crossed over from one Ranch to another Ranch where he found the man on the tractor. While the police and the Press talked a lot about who owned that ranch and who helped the boy, not once was it ever mentioned who owned the ranch where he was actually taken and tied up to a tree! Then the Press stated the boy was targeted for ransom and the people's brains began to click.
             </p>
             <p>
              In the reporting the neighbors pointed out that they did not understand the ransom conclusion as they are a poor community of mobile homes on a dirt road where he was waiting for the bus. You would not target a child for ransom in this very poor area. You would go to a better neighborhood and wait at the bus stop there.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then Sheriff Charlie Wells who formally beat children in Maryland, in charge of this case, stated he went back to the office and with other officers used a safety pin to see how long it would take them to poke through duct tape and shoe laces to make a hole! They already asked the boy who got away. That struck me as strange  as that's what they were concerned about during all of the strange reporting that didn't make sense regarding this child abduction.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then I wondered if this is when they went to using those plastic wire ties?
Anyway, it was digging on this case where we found the crimes of the sheriff Charlie Wells in other states.
             </p>
             <p>
              This was very similar to the Johnny Gosch case and that pedophiles look for boys who are 10-12 amd have that certain look pedophiles like.
