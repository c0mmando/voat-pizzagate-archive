            There are many silly comedies which have major disclosures in them. Family Guy, American Dad, Sandler movies, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you watch Sausage party there are a ton of blatant disclosures right out in the open, but because it's a ridiculous cartoon no one takes it seriously. Rape, pedophilia, blood drinking, child sacrifice, hunting people, etc. are all disclosed in the movie.

            I watched some movie with a group of friends. Mostly chatted throughout it but it was called Jack and Jill. And they had a very odd relationship.. it made me uncomfortable with slight hints of incest among other scenes that I do not recall. Keep up the good work. And that's for all is voaters exposing these evils!
