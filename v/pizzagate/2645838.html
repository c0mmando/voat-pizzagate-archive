<p>James Daniel Arbaugh, 40, of Stuarts Draft pleaded guilty in federal court Feb. 6 to one count of traveling in foreign commerce to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a person under the age of 18, according to a news release Monday night by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>

<p>James Arbaugh was a wolf in sheep’s clothing: He posed as a selfless missionary, when in reality, he was exploiting his position to prey on and sexually abuse vulnerable children in one of the most impoverished areas of the world,” Brian Benczkowski, assistant U.S. attorney general, said in the news release.</p>
<p>“The defendant abused his position of trust to prey on vulnerable victims, and their lives will never be the same,” Thomas Cullen, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, said in the release.</p>

            ARLINGTON, Va. (ABC7) — A self-proclaimed Christian missionary from Virginia has admitted to having sex with at least 21 boys, ages 5 to 17, while on missionary trips to Haiti.
           </p>
           <p>
            21 BOYS.  5-17.  I am going to be sick.
           </p>
           <p>
            Arbaugh was arrested in 2017 after he allegedly told a counselor about his sexual contact with Haitian boys.
           </p>
           <p>
            What a NARCISSIST.  He had to brag about what he was doing to someone.  It was his undoing.  Thank God.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill C traveled to Haiti in sheep's clothing.  He did not do what he professed either.
