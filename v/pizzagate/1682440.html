</p>
<p>One of the commenters on my post had been doing some digging on the artist i posted about, Angela Strassheim, and they came accross this website called &quot;Pigtails in Paint&quot; who had posted some of her work to their site. <a href="http://archive.is/pDTHd">http://archive.is/pDTHd</a> - Check out their logo/banner <a href="http://archive.is/Zy0R1">http://archive.is/Zy0R1</a> - Its a drawing of a naked girl with pedo swirls and says they are &quot;Dedicated to the portrayal of little girls in the arts and media&quot;. </p>
<p>This site\'s purpose is for &quot;education&quot; and for others to appreciate the &quot;artistic and historical value&quot; of the art they blog about. <a href="https://pigtailsinpaint.org/">https://pigtailsinpaint.org/</a> - Stumbling across this site, I actually found lots of half naked and naked pictures of girls from birth to young teenagers. The site is apparently ran by two guys, Ron and Pip Starr. Here is some of Pips own artwork he posts on his site. <a href="https://pigtailsinpaint.org/archives/pip-starrs-art/">https://pigtailsinpaint.org/archives/pip-starrs-art/</a> They have a &quot;legal&quot; tab on their site, which tries to justify their posting pictures of naked children. <a href="https://pigtailsinpaint.org/legals/">https://pigtailsinpaint.org/legals/</a></p>
<p>&quot; Our site does contain some nude images and videos of children.  Although some may rationalize their objection on arbitrary moral grounds, we endeavor to strictly adhere to U.S. law, under whose jurisdiction this site operates.  Pigtails in Paint will not present material that has been produced unlawfully through the exploitation of children or images that might constitute a “lascivious display” of genitalia in violation of U.S. code. If there are questions concerning the legality of a particular image or video clip, you can direct your concerns or complaints to the Walters Law Group operating out of Florida.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Federal Law, &quot;the legal definition of sexually explicit conduct does not require that an image depict a child engaging in sexual activity.  A picture of a naked child may constitute illegal child pornography if it is sufficiently sexually suggestive.&quot; <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-child-pornography">https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-child-pornography</a></p>
<p>On the Pigtailsinpink website, under the &quot;Archives&quot; tab and under &quot;Little Orphan Images&quot;, the first picture is of a topless young boy and girl, i\'m assuming around 8-12 years of age, and the girl has what seems to be frosting in the shape of a heart over her bare chest. The boy is rubbing the frosting on the girls nipple. Would this not meet the FBI description of being &quot;sexually suggestive&quot;? In fact, one might even argue this could even be considered downright sexual activity. If a boy rubbing cream on a girls nipple is not considered sexual activity, then I don\'t know what is.</p>
<p>Apparently, they were forced to shut down their site in Dec 2016 due to complaints about their content. <a href="http://archive.is/WrnnN">http://archive.is/WrnnN</a>  -  But as of January 2017, it looks as though they found a new service provider based in the UK. <a href="https://pigtailsinpaint.org/2017/01/hell-no-we-wont-go/">https://pigtailsinpaint.org/2017/01/hell-no-we-wont-go/</a>  -  &quot;Our new service provider is in the U.K. and certainly many have commented that a site such as ours needed to be hosted in Europe. Our new host assures us he can handle the usual abuse from fanatical and ill-informed social conservatives and if a legitimate law enforcement authority or an order from the courts is received, we will remove the offending material. In addition, we will continue to comply with U.S. law.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is a rant from Pip Starr who essentially attacks someone who threatened to report his site to NCMEC and goes off trying to justify his posting full frontal nudes of children. He states &quot;This commenter has apparently made it clear that she has reported our site to the NCMEC, since she seems to be under the impression that no one has ever tried this before and that NCMEC is somehow unaware of our existence, which is absurd for a blog of this size and importance.&quot; <a href="https://pigtailsinpaint.org/2015/06/addressing-a-commenter/">https://pigtailsinpaint.org/2015/06/addressing-a-commenter/</a>  I highly suggest reading the full article to see how demented this man is and how he views those who have issue with exposing naked children, as &quot;enemies of artistic freedom&quot;.  
</p>
<p>What bothers me is that Ron and Pip essentially have the task of finding child pornography to post on their site. Why is this not a concern to FBI or NCMEC? In one of his posts, Ron says &quot;I acknowledge the awesome task of digging out relevant work (especially photography in my case) and I am more inclined to solicit the contributions of others. Therefore, if you have input particularly relevant to me and this site, I have a separate email account you can use to reach me. The difficulty is, I cannot just hire a secretary and ask him/her to do this kind of research&quot;  <a href="https://pigtailsinpaint.org/about-this-site/messages-from-the-founder-and-editor-in-chief/">https://pigtailsinpaint.org/about-this-site/messages-from-the-founder-and-editor-in-chief/</a> - He\'s basically saying &quot;Digging through pictures of nude children is awesome. What I\'m doing is wrong and so I can\'t just hire a secretary to help me be more efficient, but please send me your stuff on my separate email.&quot;  Why couldn\'t he hire a secretary if what he is doing is totally legit? </p>
<p>Going through the comments are some very pedo sounding guys who also give links to their own personal collection of girl photos. I am too afraid to look at the links, but this is no doubt a website that is a haven for pedophiles to find inappropriate photos of young girls and share content with each other. Of all the tons of photos of nude content of children he receives, wouldn\'t it be logical to assume that perhaps he has come across some legit pornographic photos of children. Do you really think these guys are reporting every single time he comes across one? Is there no oversight on this guy whatsoever, he basically can establish a system where he is a conduit for receiving child nudes and can share some of the findings that won\'t shut his site down, so long as he writes something artistic or historical about it, and keep a personal stash for all the horrible crap he can\'t post that comes his way?</p>
<p>For those who have checked out their little orphan images &quot;art&quot;, do you think this site should be reported to the FBI or NCMEC? If they\'ve been shut down before, it can happen again. How awesome would it be, if discussion from the Voat community actually led to the downfall of a pedo site? Sure it wouldn\'t be the same as taking down podesta, but it would be a start in giving the PG researchers more credibility that they deserve.</p>',

            Excellent post!  That site is completely disgusting, and I remember your earlier post on it.
           </p>

            NCMEC is "in on it," so I wouldn't waste my time with them.  Now that those disgusting pedoes are in the UK (obviously to avoid U.S. law), it seems to me that the UK authorities would be the ones with jurisdiction.  Perhaps the (international) Internet Watch Foundation, based there, is a good place to start.  Hopefully someone here who lives in the UK can chime in.

                Searching through Alefantis old posts, lead me to artist who takes inappropriate photos of men spanking young girls, half naked children, and has pedo symbols. Very Disturbing.
