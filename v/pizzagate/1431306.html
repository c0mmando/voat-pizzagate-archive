             I wish I could but I have been medically retired since 2001 so Data bases have changed but I can say that you should date all evidence. and it should be put in Catagories . You need to have teams work on specific categories . MY Skype is Blush.Orestes but we should for sure get a discord for investigators.
I want to put this here for you to put out.
he “Suiciding” of Pedophile Investigators
by Dave Hodges
Child sex rings ill kill you
Was Aaron Swartz killed by an MIT satanic child porn ring? Yoichi Shimatsu makes an excellent case that Swartz was indeed suicided by a MIT satanic child porn ring with Zionist ties.
The death of Swartz, the brilliant creator of Reddit and the RSS feeds, died under very mysterious circumstances after looking into MIT files which linked parts of the MIT to international child sex trafficking. Swartz’s death is one of a long line of mysterious suicides which serve to conceal the depth of the child sex trafficking industry controlled by the Zionists.
This article is written in the spirit of speaking up for those who cannot speak up for themselves. Specifically, I am referring to children who are the victims of the heinous crimes of kidnapping, the sex slave trade and even murder.This article also pays tribute to the brave men and women who have lost their lives in their service to humanity in order that we may come to know the truth about so many of world leaders and just how evil and Satanically inspired they truly are.
Jerry Sandusky
            </p>
            <p>
             child sex traffickingMost Americans think that when former Penn State football coach, Jerry Sandusky, received a 30 to 60 prison term after being found guilty on 45 counts of the sexual exploitation of minors, that the case was closed.  And that is what the global elite controlled sex trafficking industry with their allies in the corporate controlled media would have the public believe.
In actuality, the Sandusky case was quickly concluded in order to prevent any investigation from going forth which would reveal the extent to which pedophilia, for fun and profit, have ensnared the rich and famous powerful elite, both in this country and abroad.
Jerry Sandusky was first accused of sexual abuse of a minor in 1999. The case was investigated by local police, referred to Centre County’s District Attorney, Ray Gricar, who refused to press charges despite the fact that the mother of the alleged victim had voicemail tapes and tape recordings of Sandusky and her son and their sexually explicit conversations. However, at a later time, the formerly rejected case, as well as other Sandusky victims resurfaced in 2005 and Gricar reopened his investigation. Shortly thereafter, on his day off, Gricar went missing and has body has never been found. His laptop was found in a nearby creek, but none of the data could be retrieved according to the FBI investigative report.
Missing DA Ray Gricar
Gricar was declared legally dead in 2011, after the Sandusky scandal surfaced. The investigation of the apparent kidnapping and murder of Ray Gricar could politely be described as incomplete. Gricar’s fate is an all too common fate experienced by whistle blowers and investigators into the Zionist-controlled worldwide pedophile ring.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hidden In Plain Sight
Jerry Sandusky’s “The  child sex rings geo bushSecond Mile Foundation”  was recognized as one of President Bush’s top “1000 Points of Light.” Interestingly,  Marvin P. Bush is on the National Collegiate Athletic Association Board of Directors which helped make the selection. Former, president, George H. W. “Pappy” Bush is no stranger to accusations of pedophilia.These same board members have not uniformly disavowed the actions of the Sandusky created entity which was responsible for pimping out children. The board members have not totally disavowed the organization’s complicity in these heinous crimes by resigning. The overall silence of the following board members should give anyone cause for concern.
Second Mile Foundation Official Governing Board Members
            </p>
            <p>
             Mark Greenberg Director, The Prevention Research Center, College of Health and Human Development, Pennsylvania State University
Do the above-mentioned board members of The Second Mile Foundation expect a naive public that from 1977 to 2011, that absolutely no Second Mile official, nobody at all, except for the abused children and Sandusky, had any knowledge of the abuse? Keep in mind that these young victims were pimped out in broad daylight.
What about Ray Gricar? How does a District Attorney, who has shown interest in the Sandusky case, go missing and it does not trigger an internal investigation from the identified board members? The best case scenario is that these individuals are guilty of depraved indifference to the heinous crimes committed by Sandusky et al. The worse case scenario suggests a possible cover-up at the highest levels of this organization.
The fact also remains that former District Attorney, Ray Gricar, is dead and there is no outrage. The obvious connections between Sandusky and Second Mile have been largely ignored by the Zionist controlled corporate media and stunningly, no investigation in conjunction with the obvious interconnections between Sandusky, Second Mile and Gricar’s disappearance has been conducted.
The Suiciding of Carole Kasir
            </p>
            <p>
             Allegedly, the young boys were subjected to appalling sexual abuse. One source is said to have suggested that Anthony Blunt, who was the former Keeper of the Queen’s Pictures and a former Soviet spy, used to go to the illicit parties at the guest houses and participated in snuff films. Subsequently, detectives launched a probe, codenamed “Operation Fernbridge”, in which they obtained a list of ‘prominent people’ who allegedly stayed at the guest house in the 1980′s.
Specific allegations of child abuse in the early 1980′s at the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, London were made by Tom Watson, MP in the House of Commons. The present investigation is stalled in the British legislative body.
Allegations of child sexual abuse perpetrated by the Elm Guest House first emerged after a 1990 inquest into the suspicious suicide of its German manager Carole Kasir, who first brought forward the allegations of child kidnapping, sexual abuse, and murder. Kasir was “suicided” Nancy Schaefer style.
The Murder/Suiciding of GA. State Senator Nancy Schaefer
            </p>
            <p>
             child sex rings schaeferFormer Georgia State Senator, Nancy Schaefer was an outspoken opponent of Child Protective Services (CPS). Schaefer authored an investigation in which, among other findings, revealed the following:
“…the separation of families is growing as a business because local governments have grown accustomed to having taxpayer dollars to balance their ever-expanding budgets.
The Adoption and the Safe Families Act, set in motion by President Bill Clinton,  offered cash “bonuses” to the states for every child they adopted out of foster care. In order to receive the “adoption incentive bonuses”, local child protective services need more children. 
They must have merchandise (children) that sell and you must have plenty of them so the buyer can choose. Some counties are known to give a $4,000 bonus for each child adopted and an additional $2,000 for a “special needs” child. Employees work to keep the federal dollars flowing.
The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in 1998 reported that six times as many children died in foster care than in the general public and that once removed to official “safety”, these children are far more likely to suffer abuse, including sexual molestation than in the general population.
That according to the California Little Hoover Commission Report in 2003, 30% to 70% of the children in California group homes do not belong there and should not have been removed from their homes.
…poor parents often times are targeted to lose their children because they do not have the where-with-all to hire lawyers and fight the system. Being poor does not mean you are not a good parent or that you do not love your child, or that your child should be removed and placed with strangers.”
In this document, Schaefer makes it clear that organizations, such as The Second Mile, procure their underage victims by making children wards of the State. CPS has unchecked, legal authority to remove children, with or without cause. Subsequently, CPS and their partners, the corrupt juvenile court judges can place these children wherever they see fit (e.g. The Franklin House, Boys Town, Elm House, The Second Mile Foundation) where unimaginable horrors take place.
Great Britain is a key link in the biggest ever international investigation into the production and supply of pedophile snuff films in which children are murdered on film after being sexually abused. The investigation includes many snuff films obtained from many countries across Europe with the origins coming out Russian and Israel. The most shocking category  of sex and snuff films made was code-named ‘Necros Pedo’ in which children were raped and tortured until they died.
Many researchers feel that there is an international controlling mechanism behind child sex trafficking. What is the source?  The Marc Dutroux pedophile case in France is an excellent place to start in answering this question.
Dutroux was tried, convicted and sentenced to life for being tied to six counts of child rape and four counts of murder. One of the murders includes Bernard Weinstein. Despite the fact that CNN describes Weinstein as “a Frenchman”, he is actually one the ring’s Zionist masterminds with alleged organized crime links in the Zionist entity tied to the sex rings.
child sex rings the childIn court, Dutroux testified that this “Zionist-Jew child sex ring” is a subset of an international porn cartel which was protected by both French police and French politicians.

             <p>
              with a wall of text like this that contains so much information (info that is IMO, desperately needed) can I ask that you break information like this up into smaller bites? The disappearance of the DA is a standalone post IMO. The Bush burial of the investigations, another.
             </p>
             <p>
              Your experience is sorely needed on this subverse. Organization of so much data needs the assistance of trained investigators, retired or not.

               Where to begin , Let's start with discord it is a chat program. verbal communication is much more concise when communicating. I am going to be very honest. I had not been armed since I was medically retired in 2003. After the investigation, into this matter. I have re-armed myself. I wanted to disprove it to myself, I wanted to prove to my son this was just a conspiracy .
              </p>
              <p>
               You all should be extremely careful..I am, I am scared my son will tell you that I am the bravest women he has ever met in his life. many others would tell you the same. This is no game and I am afraid that none of you understand just how dangerous this investigation is. If you think that the NSA does not know about all of this corruption you are all kidding yourselves. I want to help.But after researching, I am now worried that  just the little  amount of information I found may jeopardize my life. If you want to speak via skype ,my gaming account but you know as well as I do that Skype is monitored by the NSA.

                thanks for replying :) I share your sense of the danger in a citizen investigation into this. IMO, it goes all the way to the top of the Federal Reserve of this country and every other country saddled with a central bank. that system has been gorging on GDP for so long, has fostered breathtaking corruption and will absolutely not go down without a fight.
               </p>
               <p>
                my hope is the numbers of reasonable people becoming aware of this
                <em>
                 syndicate
                </em>
                keep growing at an accelerating rate. civil war could even be on the horizon, but I also believe the military will not support these bloodsuckers, if it came down to it.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'd like to see the individual board of governors for the federal reserve and their ties to all this dirty dealing thoroughly and unrelentingly exposed. my hope is it could kill the head of the snake. or
                <em>
                 dragon
                </em>
                if that appeals to you.
               </p>
               <p>
                i'm older now - i long for simpler, safer days and i believe they can come. i'm glad to see people becoming aware of what's been done in secret. i just hope the discovery isn't too awfully disruptive.
               </p>
               <p>
                stay safe, stay close to loved ones and if you're a praying woman, it can only help. :)

                 If you get a chance lets talk. if you know your community and get get through to them maybe I can help you to grasp how dangerous this is.

                  but it seems there is no way to investigate safely. from what i've read, the people doing the real digging are aware they're shaking the ugly tree but they're doing it anyway. their best insurance appears to be having copies of
                  <em>
                   everything
                  </em>
                  squirreled away in
                  <em>
                   so many
                  </em>
                  places, it will be impossible to scrub the evidence. Like when India drove out the British. Sheer numbers overwhelmed the establishment.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Can you say from which direction the greatest danger might likely come? Or how to protect ourselves or do you suggest we stop this effort?

                   NSA, there is no safety now. I have re-armed myself. I know I should stop, because this will never end well. read my post on The army ,this has been going on a very long time with no real resolution.

             The existence of this subverse IS a form of organization.  I don't see how much more organized we can get, except that I DO feel we need more mods to remove shitposts.
