            First of all, Greenbaum is a Jew and he's covering up for Jewish kahaballism. The FINDERS were JEWISH.  LOOK!
           </p>
           <p>
            "First of all you must understand that there are people here that would rather suppress this information and will try to discredit this post, however please note that nobody will be able to disprove the sourced facts I've presented.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's not a coincidence that Epstein and his network is Jewish. It's not a coincidence that practically all the paedophile rings and Satanic cults that get busted are primarily comprised of Jews. Judaism permits paedophilia. It's no different than Islam in that sense, and Islam is actually based upon the five books of Moses. Islam is derived from the name Ishmael who was the son of Abraham. The conflict between Jews and Muslims is territorial, not ideological. The point I'm making is that Judaism is like Islam in the sense that paedophilia is part of the religion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is Jewish Khaballism. Kahalballism is Satanism which is a wing of Judaism. Anybody that says Judaism and Satanism is unrelated is a flat out liar. Anybody that says Satanism has nothing to do with pizzagate is once again simply a liar. If you want to bust the Italian mafia you must investigate the Italian community. If you wish to investigate radical Islam you must investigate the Islamic community. If you want you investigate Satanic occultism you must investigate Judaism and the Jewish community. Political correctness has no place in an investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Finders Cult
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is nothing new. There was a Satanic cult of Jews that was busted in Florida during the 80s for kidnapping children. The police even raided a warehouse where they found pictures of children engaging in Satanic rituals. Here's some information I've compiled on them. Like I said, Pizzagate is nothing new.
           </p>

            I've identified the first Satanic band in America and more importantly who's behind them. The lead singer in Coven comes from an elite politically active family and she admits this herself and even names who they are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's the first Satanic band called Coven.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">
             https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            They're also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://sli.mg/senxlZ">
             http://sli.mg/senxlZ
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bill Traut Jew
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://wikivisually.com/lang-de/wiki/Bill_Traut">
             http://wikivisually.com/lang-de/wiki/Bill_Traut
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called "Satanic Mass" (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as "the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio")."
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">
             https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            So now I've just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn't surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what's up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.
           </p>
           <p>
            " You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies."
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">
             http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now here's a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/">
             http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it's common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's take a look at their lyrics now. What they're describing is Jewish blood libel. Jews have been accused and found guilty of doing these things all throughout history. Don't forget these lyrics are written by a Jew.

            " The cheif of the circle, Known as Malchius drank the blood of a young baby Offered unto him. "

            Gideon was the son of Joash, leader of the Israelites, he won a decisive victory over a Midianite army despite a vast numerical disadvantage, leading a troop of 300 'valiant' men.

            This whole song describes Jewish Satanism. Remember, this was written by a Jew.

            Judaism is Satanism. It's not a coincidence that all the primary elites busted in paedophile rings are Jews. Epstein has a sacrificial alter on his private paedophile Island.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anybody claiming that Judaism and Satanism are unrelated is a shill looking out for Jewish interest.

            Judaism is Satanism. "

             If you're sincere, I recommend linking to that info rather than pasting it into everywhere.  Also, the Finders were Jewish?  Based on what?  Presumption, or actual indicators?

             So, because some Jews you know about practice Satanism, that means all Jews are Satanists?  Is that what you're saying?
And, conversely, your post seems to indicate that only Jews can be involved in this depraved activity.
Your logic is very flawed.

            <p>
             You will find a variety of religious affiliations in perps who have been arrested and charged.  This is truly an equal opportunity evil...i.e., if you are rich and powerful, chances are we will ensnare you in our crimes by entrapment, and forever after you will be a slave to our whims.  So, quit with the "it's the Jews."  It is in fact the Satanists like Hillary, and so many others.

             Edited to add: It was and is a CIA operation from the beginning to the end.  Read about Operation Midnight Climax in San Francisco.  That's where they got their start in trapping politicians and other leaders with recorded sex.  They learned that it was better to use children through the MK Ultra program.  Combining those two programs leads us to today.

              This is part of the Jewish religion and Jews are typically always the main players in the pedophila and Satanic cults that get busted.
             </p>
             <p>
              Jews aren't the only ones running paedophile rings and doing Satanic rituals  , no, but they're the ones doing it on a political level.

            There's a social analogue to MPD which is called compartmentalization, the separation of specialized administrative or management groups into areas which don't exchange information with each other. Also there is the separation of powers, the judicial, executive, and legislative branches of the civil system. The separation of powers contrasts with sovereign model, where judicial, politicial, and military power coexists in the hands of the king.

            I have received two complaints from airline employees that airplanes containing several hundred children were flown to Paris, France from Denver, Colorado and Los Angeles, California.  Two hundred and ten children were reportedly on the manifest of the Denver plane.  In addition, Paul Bonacci told me about children who were auctioned off in the early 1980’s outside Las Vegas, Nevada and Toronto, Canada.  These children were auctioned off in their underwear with a number on a card around their necks, some for $50,000 each (See the Franklin Cover Up Investigation).  – Ted Gunderson

           <p>
            GOULD: [The reports] include lots of sexual abuse, drugging of the children, pornographic pictures being taken, threats to the child and to the child's family, animal killings and blood rituals and even human sacrifice including the child being forced to perpetrate in that sacrifice which of course is probably the most damaging aspect of the abuse itself. But I think that one of the most difficult aspects of abuse in out-of-home day-care to cope with is that the fact that we're finding that you can abuse a hundred children ritualistically with all the overlay of terror and brainwashing that's been discussed and pretty much a hundred children will keep the secret of their abuse until there's some kind of intervention.
           </p>
           <p>
            HAMMOND: Some of the children may retract a story at some point because, for example, they've seen people killed...After all the senses have been broken down in every conceivable way with electric shocks, with drugs, with fatigue, with lack of food they can be conditioned to do things on cue. And very strongly brainwashed. We've seen people in Korea who were brainwashed but these are children who are completely controlled by the cult that they're in.
           </p>
           <p>
            KLUFT: You hear a kid who's obviously hurting saying something that probably just couldn't be, and you say well, I guess it couldn't be. Actually, that account that couldn't be is a tell-tale sign of something that was so overwhelming that the child could not retain it and could not process it in the normal sequential way.
           </p>
           <p>
            YOUNG: Oftentimes in adults who are describing their own abuse one can then also find the old wounds of things they have described in the reports of their own abuse. I guess what we keep asking, why don't we find more evidence of it? I don't think there'd be anyone trying to advertise satanic activity of this sort publicly. Obviously it would be a secret activity.
           </p>
           <p>
            GOULD: The cases in my own practice represent approximately fifteen different preschools in the Los Angeles area none of which have been closed down since these disclosures have been made, all of which continue to operate and presumably to perpetrate.
           </p>
           <p>
            YOUNG: It's not uncommon for an adult to suddenly recollect events which were occurring when they were small that had been completely held in a state of amnesia. During the course of treatment they began to recover and report events of a satanic type and these can be such things as having adults participate in human and animal sacrifice even as young as three years of age.
           </p>
           <p>
            SACHS: Patients that I have dealt with who remained in the cult and became active perpetrators and became leaders of the cult, when they began to discover what they have done at an adult level there is really very little desire to live. They lose all reason for going on. It's a very difficult treatment issue to work with because it's a reality. Whether they've been programmed or brainwashed or whatever, the truth is they have participated in blatant murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            YOUNG: Two examples I might just make. One was a young girl who described a fire at a ceremony being chosen to be thrown in and burned in the fire but they said that she could save herself if she picked another child to be burned which she claimed is what happened and she has to try to live with that experience. A second was a young girl who to show complete obedience...brought her best friend into a ceremony knowing that child would be sacrificed.
           </p>
           <p>
            HAMMOND: What we're talking about here goes beyond child-abuse or beyond the brainwashing of Patty Hearst or Korean-War veterans. We're talking about people -- in some cases who are coming to us as patients -- who were raised in satanic cults from the time they were born. Often cults that have come over from Europe, that have roots in the SS, in death-camp squads in some cases. These are children who tell us stories about being deprived of sleep all night, of then being required to work at manual labor exhaustingly all day long without any food or water. When they reach a point of utter fatigue they may then watch other people tortured. Perhaps a finger might be cut off and hung around their neck on a chain or a string as a symbol to them that they had better be obedient. They may be given drugs.
           </p>
           <p>
            BRAUN: What you're trained to do is to self destruct if you should remember too much.
           </p>
           <p>
            GOODWIN: Historical accounts of satanic cults: there was a monk who lived from about 300 AD to about 400 AD who in his youth before he became a monk, he later ended up as a bishop, entered briefly one of these cults, the Sybionite Cult it was called at the time and described and this was back now over 1500 years ago he was describing nocturnal feasts, chants, infant sacrifice, cannibalism, ritual use of excrement and various body excretions in a way that's very similar to some of the fragments and material I've heard from patients.
           </p>
           <p>
            SUMMIT: Around the country there are great numbers of centers that have been identified, most of them investigated, most of them confirmed by at least one agency, some fifty centers in my experience where this kind of complaint has been made by dozens to hundreds of children in each case.

             It is hard to speak of but is very true. This is the goldmine it takes you through Nazi Germany the horrific experiments done by Hitler's scientists back to the CIA how we understand MK Ultra, Monarch etc. Understanding DID now. The NWO secret societies, A.Crowley (the book of law) Thelamic religion (Podestas hands #14&amp; fish), the involvement of the Vatican in Nazi Germany etc.  They all share the same history pedophiles, sacrifice, trauma. 
Carry it through to motherload of them all Tavistock (Soros) to Escalen. This is all Luceferian.

            In June 1992, Hammond said, "My best guess is that the  purpose of it [the satanists] is that they want an army of  Manchurian candidates -- tens of thousands of mental robots who  will do prostitution, do child pornography, smuggle drugs, engage in international arms smuggling, do snuff films, all sorts of lucrative things and do their bidding. And eventually, the megalomaniacs at the top believe, [they will] create a satanic  order that will rule the world."

            VAGARIES OF MEMORY
           </p>
           <p>
            Corydon Hammond, Ph.D. published an article in the Fall 1993
Bulletin of the Psychological Hypnosis Division of the American
Psychological Association.  In the article, he complained that he had
been "misrepresented in the media (e.g., Prime Time Live) by producers
apparently wishing to promulgate an FMS point of view, as well as by a
radical FMS spokesman." Hammond proceeded to explain that he holds a
balanced middle ground when it comes to belief in satanic ritual abuse

  Dr. Hammond's complaint that he has been misrepresented by an FMSF
spokesperson (unnamed) is a very serious one. We checked our records.
The following comments by Corydon Hammond were transcribed from a
videotape of a hypnosis workshop at Parkwood Hospital, Atlanta
Georgia, March 2, 1991:
           </p>
           <p>
            "...I will suggest to you that those people [deniers of satanic
cults] are either, one naive and of limited clinical experience;
number two have a kind of naivete that people have of the holocaust;
or number two they're just such intellectuallizers and skeptics that
they'll doubt everything; or number three they're cult people
themselves and I can assure that there are people who are in that
position...There are people who are physicians, who are mental health
professionals who are in the cults, who are raising trans-generational
cults...I'll tell you why I think more of it has come out. I think
more of it has come out because for the first time about six years ago
professionals who treat severe trauma cases started getting together
for the first time at the international MPD meetings and comparing
notes...[I had a patient whose] grandfather had been sent out from
Nazi Germany in the mid 1930's to New York expressly to help spread
the cult to America. They were involved in kidnaping children...There
are transgenerational cults passed down from parent to child through
the generations...I think the research is real clear: we got three
studies, one found 25%, one found 20% of outpatient multiples appear
to be cult-abuse victims, and another on a specialized inpatient unit
found 50%.  I believe that we'll probably end up finding about a
fourth of outpatient multiples are cult-abuse and if you're in a
specialized unit it may go as high as 50% and they're usually some of
the more severe difficult cases.  But I also believe that we're
treating too many of them. That's a cruel terrible thing to say. But I
believe that quite a few of them that we're treating are still
involved in cults and that we should not be treating them if they
are. And it is a danger to them and a danger to us...And I know of
patients where I've consulted on cases -- I only treat four cult
victims myself but I consult in cases all around the country and I
know of cases where people have revealed things in therapy...at one
point a part [i.e. an alternate personality] revealed something she
shouldn't and she was severely tortured because of that, to teach her
not to do that in the future...Some of it is in very organized groups
with interstate communication and who use a very very systematic
brainwashing that comes out of experimentation from Nazi doctors and
experimentation in the intelligence community with mind-control
research and involves medical technology and is very very
sophisticated. And is systematically done from early early childhood
to produce multiples and continues through and into adulthood with
periodic reinforcement truly trying to produce Manchurian
Candidates...In fact, I know of cases where this has occurred where
the Mafia likes to use cult people as hit people because they can have
one personality who will come out and do it, go to another city and
perform a cult blood-cleaning and have no emotion about it, come back
and everybody has amnesia for it.  And it's the perfect ideal
situation...They're drugged up. They're already entrained in a certain
state of consciousness and then if they don't agree and go along with
something and say 'Yes,' like 'if you get angry at anyone in the cult
you will hurt yourself. Do you understand?' And one patient said,
'Yes, but I don't want to.' And they then violently shocked her with
electrodes to her head and her inner vagina. Then they repeated it.
'Do you understand?' Phrase good: she understood. 'Yes.' Then go over
it again. 'And you will hurt yourself by cutting yourself with a
knife.  Do you understand?' 'Yes.'  'I don't believe you.' Zap! Go
over it again. 'Yes!'  Then they go onto something else. Then having
these repetitive conditioning sessions. Now you picture that happening
to a five-year-old, a sweet little five-year-old kid. And a six-year-
old, a seven-year-old, an eight-year-old, a nine-year-old.  You know,
when you got total control of them, they're highly dissociative
person, you've got them a whole lot longer than anyone has a prisoner
of war and you're using all that kind of mind-control technology from
intelligence research that isn't even available to the public and
other kinds of things, you can have a powerful influence on people...I
haven't had to be involved with reporting to the police.  But, yeah, I
think you have to be careful, because, I have a situation where a
cult-victim who I had seen and then somebody else had seen, basically
because somebody prominent in the cult works in the medical center
where I work and she had bumped into him and didn't want to keep
coming to the medical center so she starting seeing somebody else. She
finally fled Salt Lake and we put her in treatment with somebody in
Southern California. And she had come back on one occasion to identify
people for her previous therapist and I. And identified some names
that were part of a larger body of information that we gave to three
investigative agencies. And one of the people I trust that we gave it
to. The other two should be very legitimate investigative agencies,
police agencies, in the state.  Three weeks later -- she had a part,
or parts rather, that were still cult-involvement with cult
allegiance, that would call and tell them where she was and her
address and phone number after she left. And so they had already
picked her up several times. And they came by and basically kidnaped
and picked her up for a few hours and tortured her. And told her
before they said we're going to kill you. This time they said, 'We
should kill you but we'll let you do that to yourself.' And then they
said, 'We know that you've been giving information to Cory,' and they
named me by name in Southern California and revealed information
that had only been passed on to three police agencies. So I think you
have to be careful with the police agencies..."

             This not the forum to discuss case studies or parts as you mentioned. Your understanding is too shallow to grapple with this study history everyone. Think of what was mastered by Scientists in Nazi Germany and brought to the US after the war into our intelligence. MK Ultra +secret societies+satanic worship. Get to the root.

            The op is a link to a long speech by Corydon Hammond, PHD, who was treating patients with MPD and ritual abuse.  What he says is stunning.  No one else in the Psychological community has had the nerve to tell what they have come to know while treating the patients of the elite child trafficking networks.  He says that his contacts with Mental Health professionals all over the country, indicate similar patterns of abuse to create multiple personalities.  There are a lot of key findings in his speech that will provide new paths of investigation for you daring and intrepid investigators.
