<p>More Details Emerge on Boy Scouts\' \'Perversion Files; Thousands of Boy Scout Leaders Face Child Sex Allegations</p>
<p>More alarming details have surfaced about how many people were listed in the Boy Scouts of America’s “perversion files,” according to lawyers who demand the full release of thousands of names of alleged offenders in the files. Nearly 200 of them are from New York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Though allegations came to light Monday night, a victims\' rights attorney who compiled an &quot;incomplete&quot; list of former Boy Scout leaders accused of abuse in New York held a press conferences Tuesday to discuss what he claims to be a widespread pattern of abuse. He also asked more victims to come forward.</p>
<p>The victims’ rights attorney, Jeff Anderson, called it a system of denial and cover-ups. He claims the Boy Scouts have files on child abusers within their ranks dating back to the 1940s.</p>
<p>&quot;For many, many years there\'s been an excavation of what are called the \'perversion files\' — those are files held and hoarded at the Boy Scouts of America headquarters,&quot; Anderson said during Tuesday\'s New York press conference, adding that &quot;those \'perversion files\' that they\'ve had reflect that they have removed thousands of offenders of childhood sexual abuse over the years and they\'ve kept that in files secretly.&quot;</p>
<p>The knowledge of the files themselves is not new, as outlets including NBC have previously reported on them. An Oregon judge ordered their release in 2012 after they were shown to a jury in a civil suit.</p>
<p>However, the number of alleged perpetrators found in the files is new, according to Anderson. He said, citing testimony by a professional retained by the BSA to audit the files, that there were 7,819 suspected perpetrators, while the number of victims total 12,254.</p>
<p>&quot;That is a number not known before today or ever revealed by the Boy Scouts of America,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>The Boy Scouts of America told News 4 in a statement that they “care deeply about all victims of child sex abuse and sincerely apologize to anyone who was harmed during their time in Scouting.”</p>
<p>&quot;We believe victims, we support them, and we have paid for unlimited counseling by a provider of their choice. Nothing is more important than the safety and protection of children in Scouting and we are outraged that there have been times when individuals took advantage of our programs to abuse innocent children,&quot; the statement reads in part.</p>
<p>It continues: &quot;At no time have we ever knowingly allowed a sexual predator to work with youth, and we mandate that all leaders, volunteers and staff members nationwide immediately report any abuse allegation to law enforcement.&quot;</p>
<p>Anderson said his law firm managed to identify 130 former BSA leaders in New York who are found in the files that have so far been made available. According to Anderson, the list of alleged abusers was compiled into what he called the &quot;Anderson File,&quot; but said the list of names is incomplete.</p>
<p>The BSA never released the names of the alleged perpetrators to the public or authorities, Anderson claimed.</p>
<p>&quot;The bad news is that this is far from a full disclosure,&quot; he said, adding &quot;we had to sound the alarm.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Anderson, it is not clear at this point whether the accused are even alive, let alone where they might live, whether they are involved in activities with children or if they have criminal records.</p>
<p>Bridie Farrell, a survivor of abuse and co-founder of NY Loves Kids, an organization that aims to create a safer New York by speaking out about child sexual abuse, was also present at the press conference.</p>
<p>&quot;As someone who has been talking about childhood sexual abuse, I\'ve known of the \'perversion files\' and the Boy Scouts of America problem for years now,&quot; she said. &quot;But when I spoke with Jeff and he told me these numbers, numbers of 7,000 and 12,000, I was shocked.&quot;</p>
<p>Attorneys in New Jersey also scheduled a news conference Tuesday, where they plan to release the names of 50 Boy Scout leaders named in the files who worked in the state.</p>
<p>Anderson plans to file multiple lawsuits against the Boy Scouts on behalf of the victims and demands the organization hand over their files, including names of those accused of abuse.</p>
<p>Although Anderson must wait to file suit because New York\'s Child Victims Act is not effective until Aug. 14, he said he couldn\'t wait any longer and wanted to make the information he received public. The legislation essentially erases the statute of limitations to report a crime of childhood sexual abuse. A similar bill for sexual abuse victims was also passed by the state\'s Assembly and Senate and is expected to be signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy.</p>
<p>Greg Gianforcaro, lead New Jersey lawyer working with Anderson, said during New Jersey\'s press conference they are working to give survivors their voice back.</p>
<p>&quot;This is about the institution failing to do the right thing. Failing to disclose the names,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>Mark Crawford, who identifies as a clergy abuse survivor and is an advocate, said he is not shocked by the numbers since he works with survivors of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>&quot;It\'s not surprising to me,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;We should no longer be shocked, we should be angry and move to action.&quot;</p>
<p>He said he was &quot;glad&quot; the information was being exposed, calling it &quot;important and necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>Pizzagate is involved here because Minor Children have been sexually abused by the Boy Scouts of America.</p>',

            </a>

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             apidan Camp (also known at times as Camp Hoover) in Shenandoah National Park in Madison County, Virginia, was built by U.S. President Herbert Hoover and his wife Lou Henry Hoover, and served as their rustic retreat throughout Hoover's administration from 1929 to 1933.[4] The first family's residential cabin was known as the "Brown House" in contrast to their more famous residence, the White House. Rapidan Camp was precursor of the current presidential retreat, Camp David.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1946, the Shenandoah Park Superintendent reported that the camp was unused and requested federal funds for repairs or demolition. In 1948, the Boy Scouts of America were granted a twenty-year lease to use it as a summer camp, which was also in accordance with Hoover's wishes.
             <strong>
              During its use as a Boy Scout camp, the facility was renamed "Camp Hoover."
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The camp was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1988, under the name "Camp Hoover". [Another red flag.]
            </p>
            <p>
             At Rapidan Camp, President Hoover offered to buy Bermuda, Trinidad, and British Honduras from Prime Minister MacDonald in exchange for most of Britain's war debt (from World War I) to the United States. But days later came the Wall Street Crash that marked the beginning of the Great Depression.[5] In addition, Hoover and MacDonald came to an agreement that formed the basis of the 1930 London Naval Treaty while meeting at Rapidan Camp, talking for hours sitting on an "historic log".[28][29][30]
             <strong>
              Rapidan Camp also gave name to the "Rapidan Plan" for deploying the Girl Scouts of the USA to help alleviate the economic collapse.

             If you or someone in your family was abused I am so sorry.  Some of us here certainly may have been.  But really, others are just plain sickened by this because of the Innocence stolen from all  Our Children.   Go to it.  I can't wait to hear your report.  These names need to be printed in the newspapers and on the internet.

              I never was but apparently I was in a den of vipers. I am kinda suprised as I was a cute little blonde white boy.  Yeah, I wish I could do some head choppin' though.  That would really take the edge off after reading this shit.  I am sad my son will never get to backpack the trails in Philmont or do Wilderness Survival in Wyoming or be tapped out for Order of the Arrow at spring Jamboree though.

               But your son has you.  Take him and do it just the two of you.  Make those memories.  Yes, it's sad.  I took my nephew to BSA for a whole year when his Mom worked.  He loved it.  I really could never get into the boy stuff, but I joined in anyway.  The way his eyes lit up when we got there.  So excited.  My husband took him  sometimes too and wentcamping with the rest of the boys.  Nothing happened.  Must have been one of the few good ones. We  just did it for a year and I am glad we did.  That boy is now in college.  A great kid.  Take your boy.

             Sounds like “boo hoo woe is me” crap.
            </p>
            <p>
             Bet your cousin was a cum slut dick whore who was asking for it.

            <p>
             The real reason you were allegedly banned for life probably had nothing to do with the “incident”. 
More likely it was you being your typical psychopathic asshole self doing something that warranted the life long ban.
            </p>
            <p>
             How does it feel to have rape related incidents in your past being treated with the same scorn and disdain you’ve meted out to other rape victims? What goes around comes around sand monkey.

              lol its a joke, idiot. Cousin got diddled is the setup, I'm banned for life is the punchline (frame-shifting from the passive voice to identifying me as the diddler)

               I am sorry you feel that way.   I said that because even though he/she has said some very nasty things he expressed his condolences to me.  Condolences for the loss of my husband.  There are times when we must lay down our weapons and act like a human being even to an enemy.

                I doubt donkey was being sincere with his “condolences”.
               </p>
               <p>
                Donkey is a psychopath. As such, his inferior “kind” are biologically incapable of empathy nor compassion, thus anything he says regarding the matter is a lie.
               </p>
               <p>
                Donkey’s very open about how much he hates Christians (like any typical muslim) and especially how much he hates Jesus. Therefore he is unworthy of any vague sliver of kindness or unconditional love.

                 I have always believed that  condolences have good intentions.  I just wanted to return same.  This has turned into something that is adding to my sorrow and sadness at a time when I need less. Thank you for your concern.  I always value your opinions.

                  He doesn't want to believe a "Nazi" can express sincere condolences; if we have those normal human motivations and aren't Literal Monsters, our ideas might also be normal.  Hence, Holocaust movies every single year.

            Disgraced Syracuse priest, scout leader faces new claim of past abuse
           </p>
           <p>
            Syracuse, NY -- A former Boy Scout and altar boy is suing a disgraced former Catholic priest over allegations of sexual abuse from the 1980s.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lawsuit, filed Monday, accuses Rev. Donald J. Hebert, now 72, of sexual abuse between 1983 and 1986, when the boy was 13 to 16 years old.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hebert was later removed from active ministry in 2003 after credible allegations that he fondled a different boy during a Boy Scouts trip in 1990, according to the Syracuse Catholic Diocese.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the lawsuit involves earlier abuse, said lawyer Jesse Ryder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hebert was priest at St. John the Baptist Church on the city’s North Side, as well as a Scoutmaster, at the time of the alleged abuse, the lawsuit states.
           </p>
           <p>
            The accuser, who filed anonymously as A.L., is taking advantage of a new state law that allows for lawsuits involving allegations of abuse that were previously too old to be prosecuted in civil court.
           </p>
           <p>
            A.L., who is nearly 40 years old now, says in the lawsuit that he suffered depression, eating disorders, marital complications, distrust of authority figures, and underwent medical treatment, as a result of the repeated abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lawsuit says the church and Boy Scouts are also responsible for putting Hebert in a position of authority and knew, or should have known, of his abuse of children in his care.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lawsuit seeks money to compensate A.L. for past trauma, as well as to punish Hebert for his actions. No dollar figure was included in the lawsuit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hebert also served at Most Holy Rosary, in Syracuse, until 1990, when he was transferred to churches in Utica until his removal from active ministry.
           </p>
           <p>
            A spokeswoman said Tuesday the Syracuse diocese had not yet received an official copy of the lawsuit.
           </p>
           <p>
            “Once the Diocese of Syracuse has been served, we will review the complaint with our attorneys and follow the appropriate legal proceedings,” spokeswoman Danielle Cummings said.
           </p>
           <p>
            All I can say is nothing surprises me anymore when it comes to sexual abuse cases.  A priest and a scout master.  Who Knew?

            Hi Carmen.  Good to see you around.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a tragic story.  Just like the church and other .orgs.  I had a creep for a scoutmaster.  50, unmarried, lived with his mother.  Nothing ever happened, but easy to spot the creep even then.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm pretty sure this will be the end of BSA.  The lawsuits will emerge over the next months.  In the pedo heirarchy, BSA was pretty much at the bottom of the food chain vs the church, Social Services, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the low-profile pedos seeped into BSA under the cover of "Christians".

             I know what a seedy outfit the BOA is, but these numbers are astounding.  Such a shame we can't have an org. for Our Boys and Girls without their being sexually assaulted.  Shameful.

                 Yeah, before we had a name for this, that was where it all started. Funny how it was also an intersection between hollywood, the state, and the catholic church...

                 Ever notice that they don't talk about the orphan trains, and how they leave child labor and work houses in the footnotes of history class?
