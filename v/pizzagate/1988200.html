           </ol>
           <p>
            Most people know something is wrong, but they do not know who to blame.
Make out the enemy, the globalists, always. It's not the Jews, Freemasons or Jesuits. It's not about left or right. Its about wrong (globalism) and right (no globalism).
           </p>
           <p>
            The globalists are the biggest danger to Humanity.
It's the globalists that let kids starve in Greece because there is no money one day, and next day they spend BILLIONS on bringing in and housing lowest quality migrants. The globalists are responsible that our children and women get raped by them every day.
It is not the employers fault you earn so little, it is the globalists fault.
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone steps in dog shit - make sure to connect it to the globalists and their institutions somehow! Like imagine a world without globalists and unhindered human progress - where we would all lay on the beach while little robots clean up the street for us... ok i think you get the drift...

            Thank for your extreme useful help!
           </p>
           <p>
            Some ideas that can use input:
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            We can use some guerilla marketing:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              Start printing the cards
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Spread them far and wide
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Post the cards on main characters social media pages
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Post the cards on the social media pages of the protectors of the main characters
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              If we have a video of one of our main characters holding the card(s)/ interacting with the cards in some way that would help and boost awareness
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              How many printed cards do there need to be "dumped" in front of CNN HQ before they will start reporting about it ?
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            This looks useful and legal ?

            Internet shitposting is much more effective than lone-wolf shooting. Internet shitposting converts people to the truth, this is an information war that can be won without firing a bullet.

             Exactly. And we have only a short window of time before the deepstate panics and then it turns into real war. So shitpost like it's about life and death. Cause it is.

              They are losing power now and any action they take could expose their criminal system. Under Obama regime they had a safety net, thus why they broke the law without worrying but i dont believe Trump's administration is forgiving.

               They are only losing power in some places. Look at France. Mandatory vaccines by 2018, banned combustion engines by 2040, a weirdo that wants to rule the country like the Roman god Jove. They have been playing this game for a long time and we're only now shitposting like the world depends on it.

               <p>
                The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the 'agentur' of the 'Illuminati' between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion. We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time. -Albert Pike 1871

               You want to make a bunch of nihilistic atheists? Raise a generation on Elsa and Spiderman videos that promote drug abuse, promiscuity, and abortions. Raise them in broken school systems and feed them a diet of poisoned food and water. Agenda 30 is real.

                I was thinking only of American Deep State, tho u are correct. We can also add Canada, Germany and Australia to that list. Muslims shouldnt see Christians as immediate threat, after all Christians are raised to be accepting and tolerant to others. Our real enemy are the Jews Zionists, for both of us. If the muslims could be convinced to start fighting Israel and the jews, we would be golden.
