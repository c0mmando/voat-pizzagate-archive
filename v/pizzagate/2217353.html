            It was not that long ago that this A list actor who stars in movies and an almost television show and really should probably be just a G short of an EGOT but is missing two parts almost brought down a secret society all by himself. I'm not saying it would be a bad idea if he brought it down, but it shows that it depends on its members and their guests to follow the rules. If they don't disaster happens. At the annual meeting of this society, no cameras are allowed. Sure, some have been sneaked in, but there are no cameras or phones. If you bring one you are to put it in a locker and you can retrieve it when you leave. Well, our actor likes to record first sexual encounters with guys for later viewing material and he wasn't going to let anything stop him. The society stocks their event with barely legal gay men who make some very big money for some very closeted big money men. Our actor is closeted and he loved every second of his time there until someone discovered he was filming. The s**t hit the fan. The member who invited him got a three year suspension. Other members who also knew but didn't say anything got suspended. Our actor tried to apologize and did apologize - apparently sincerely which is why his member only got suspended for three years and not expelled. The actor had to turn over all the recordings. Some involve other members and those will probably be used to blackmail them. This is the craziest place and that incident just added to the craziness.

           </p>
           <p>
            "Paula poured out her heart regarding the horror that her former husband, Jim Shaw, had endured after being forced from childhood to become one of 'Ed Teller's boys' that Teller used in grim SABBATEAN SATANIST rituals, not ONLY in the BOHEMIAN GROVE, but also in other Jewish Sabbatean satanist rituals nationwide, as well as in Hollywood."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Paula shared how, from the time Jim Shaw was turned over as a child to Edward Teller, he was used for pornographic and pedophilic purposes, and especially in JEWISH SABBATEAN SATANIST RITUALS, forced to sacrifice babies under Teller's orders and control, and used sexually in such rituals as well.

           <p>
            "She also revealed Jim's firthand account of how he was introduced to Teller's many Jewish friends in HOLLYWOOD, and passed around to big names and Hollywood producers acquainted with Teller, to be sexually abused, often beaten up for sport as well."

            Sabbatai Zevi, 1626-76, who lived in the Turkish empire, was the founder of the Jewish Sabbatean movement, 'based on a satanic strain of Cabalism.'
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1666, he proclaimed himself to be the "Messiah".
           </p>
           <p>
            He 'pretended' to convert to Islam.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reportedly, his followers now include the Rothschilds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reportedly, the Sabbatean 'satanic cult' has infiltrated and subverted most governments and religions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Forty-one years after Shabbatai Tzvi's death, in 1717, the Sabbateans reportedly infiltrated Masonry guilds and established Freemasonry. (Cached)
           </p>
           <p>
            Reportedly, the Sabbateans encourage licentiousness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reportedly, 'religion is ultimately meaningless to them, although they use it to manipulate others'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Reportedly, 'the Sabbatean sect has indulged in wife sharing, sex orgies, adultery and incest for more than 350 years'.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many Sabbateans live in Istanbul, Turkey.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sephardic Jews who were expelled from the Iberian peninsula and developed an underground culture, merged with the Sabbateans in Turkey, and they developed a spring festival.

             Yes, I was remembering that too. He got in trouble trying to bring in a camera/cell phone to do this. All I could think is "doesn't he know who he's dealing with?"
