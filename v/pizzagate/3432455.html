<p>Posted on September 18, 2019</p>
<p>The two major stories I have been covering seem to be converging with bad actors from one showing up in  the other.</p>
<p>The two stories I’ve been chasing are the Trump Russian collusion hoax and the second is Jeffery Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell being far more nefarious than child sex traffickers.</p>
<p>The huge question I will attempt to answer is in this multi-part story is: Was the key to the Trump take out before and after the 2016 presidential election to protect Epstein and his espionage ties with Democrats working with Russia and Israel?</p>
<p>The Epstein saga, which I stand by in saying that he and his Mossad handler Maxwell were primarily Israeli spies as well as drug and weapons dealers, who used child sex trafficking to blackmail the rich and powerful. Despite it being an horrific act, child sex honey traps have a long history within the Mossad.</p>
<p>The first strange connection between Epstein and the Trump Russian hoax deals are with FBI’s Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. While Strzok and Page were with the CIA (yes these two jump back and forth between the two intelligence agencies depending on the assignment) they worked for Epstein’s financial backer Les Wexner.</p>
<p>Wexner owned an outfit called Mission Essentials, which was a CIA-backed global translation services company. Both Strzok and Page speak Farsi. ABC News’ Brian Ross reported on much of the this in 2010.</p>
<p>Page reportedly was stationed in the New Albany, OH main office bringing in Afghanistan “translators” traveling under diplomatic passports, which some federal agents suggest was merely drug mules for opium. Many of the translators could not speak English.</p>
<p>Strzok allegedly worked in the Chantilly, VA office of Mission Essentials working the other silk road countries in the Middle East to find “translators/mules” to bring in the drugs.</p>
<p>Both Page and Strzok would attempt to arrange for the “translators” to travel with a State Department officials as diplomatic couriers to evade inspection of their luggage. It would not surprise me in the least if some of these “translators” were also underage teens from eastern Europe for Epstein’s other side job.</p>
<p>As I have written earlier,  Wexner — owner of L Brands including Victoria’s Secret and Bed, Bath and Beyond — and Epstein purchased the  ex-CIA airline fleet formerly known as Air America and renamed it Southern Air Transport out of Columbus, OH.  Air America was infamous as an illegal gun- and drug-running operations while under the spy agency. Remember Epstein was a pilot and his personal 747 jet shared the same call letters as a State Department aircraft.</p>
<p>Southern Air Transport filed for bankruptcy in 1998 on the same day the CIA’s Inspector General charged the cargo company with Nicaraguan drug-running back in the days of Iran-Contra.</p>
<p>I will come back Thursday with more connections between these two important stories.</p>

            Interesting.
           </p>
           <p>
            First of all, Epstein seems to have been a CIA asset as well, and the sex trafficking / blackmail operation was certainly a joint project of the CIA and Mossad. I think one of the reasons why Epstein was busted was that the CIA wanted to have a bigger piece of the cake, and wanted to get rid of the Mossad.

            I'd recommend reading Whitney Webb's article about the Mega Group (Wexner is a member). Really an eye-opener.
