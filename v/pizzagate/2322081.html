            Kinsey report is still being sighted by many sexologists today even though it has been exposed as a fraud - his data came from homosexuals, prison inmates, mentally ill and the pedophiles (form of mental illness). And yet self alleged reputable 'experts' in the field of sex-psychoanalytics still use Kinsey Report - just shows you establishment hegemony over all institutions! It's time to break the spell. A few days ago I read a voat post on how 31% of British men allegedy fantasise sexually abusing minors - I sighted Kinsey's selective fraudulent polls and debunked immediately. I got a backlash (mind control is not easy to break) 31%?!! More like 0.1% or lower. No men I have ever came across (normal, heterosexual with good normal parents who are not into Satanism - ie A.Cooper) had any penchant toward anything but sexually mature women. Top of man's fantacy is having a threesome with models, that is the height of deviancy. Kinsey report has to be exposed and debunked once and for all!

            Great addition to Kinsey related PG info, I had not read/heard that University of Massachusetts-Amherst recognized pedophiles as a protected minority at the time the article was written.  How many other Universities have become havens for pedophiles since then?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Behavior Today, on Dec. 5, 1988, on page 5: "pedophilia . . . may be a sexual orientation rather than a sexual deviation." In fact, the University of Massachusetts-Amherst already defines pedophiles as a "protected minority" within its nondiscrimination code, according to Hillsdale College President George Roche! According to Dr. Joan Nelson, cited in Dr. Reisman's book,
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              "pedophiles are visionaries who "participate in sexual contact not for her or his own gratification, but in response to a child's attempt to acquire practical knowledge."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Such visionaries are advocates of "children's rights" in all areas, and "believe the troubles that characterize our times are rooted in childhood sexual repression that prohibits age-free expression of sexual affection." Dr. Nelson is the founder of the Institute for the Study of Sexual Behavior. She describes her childhood submission to incest as "the happiest period of my life."
            </p>
            <p>
             ...the Kinsey team touts the benefits of sexual contact (incestuous or otherwise) with children. Incredibly, we find on p. 115: "Some of the pre-adolescent contacts had provided emotional satisfactions which had conditioned the female for the acceptance of later sexual activities."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            People unfamiliar with the methods and conclusions of Alfred Kinsey's so called "research" (paying pedophiles to molest their own kids or others), should reconsider those lies about child welfare, given that the true nature of his studies goes far beyond supporting the pedophiles' world view agenda to normalize their delusional heartfelt concerns in 'helping infants and children discover sexuality'; it was to also to gratify his own sado masochism, by promoting the rape of young children, through his collaboration with serial rapist pedophile Rex King and his other notable 'research interviewee',  Dr. Frisk Von Balluseck (a former highly placed Gestapo officer).
            <em>
             Considering all we've learned during PG research, would it be much of a stretch to connect Kinsey's operation to a certain intelligence agency that profits off of children?  That would explain the FBI's disinterest in the child abuse he was promoting via his "scientific' correspondence with a Nazi pedophile
            </em>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             For some time, long-time Nazi party member, Dr. Fritz von Balluseck, mailed his on-going child abuse crimes to Kinsey.  Von Balluseck's diaries appear to date from 1936 to1956, revealing Balluseck's regular correspondence with Kinsey.  In fact, Kinsey sent his sympatico Nazi aide books about child sexuality--books that would have supported and encouraged the serial child predator's incestuous and pedophile crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the mid 1950s Interpol contacted the Kinsey team for help in locating a child sex killer the team had interviewed. The Kinsey Institute protected their WWII Gestapo agent (as they have always protected all their pedophiles and pederasts). They refused to give his name to Interpol under cover of shielding a possible child murderer from investigation based on "scientific" ethics.
            </p>
            <p>
             This defense was then and is now unconscionable, criminal and self-serving.  Indeed,   Kinsey and his fellow WWII draft-dodging team feared public exposure for aiding and abetting a WWII Gestapo agent in his ongoing, even murderous sexual violence against children.  Naturally, all of Kinsey's biographers deliberately covered up Kinsey's intense relationship with and training of his Frankfurt Gestapo aide.

             The German press called von Balluseck the worst sex criminal since the end of WWII. German papers had the Kinsey-Balluseck collaboration on page one. The American press was silent and all of Kinsey's biographers have steadfastly covered up Kinsey's Nazi connection.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            "Kinsey had asked the paedophile specifically for material of his perverse actions.He made statistics.and he sent them.to the American sex researcher, Kinsey.[to whom he] repeatedly and explicitly reported his perverse crimes.  [They] corresponded.for some time."
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...In May 1957 every major German newspaper headlined the sensational news about the Nazi and Dr. Kinsey.  Yet, no American media reported the trial.  The Kinsey Instutute continues to hide Kinsey as von Balluseck's guiding light, his authority, his master educator.

              To fully  comprehend and witness the fruit of that delusion, fast forward to today and the UN sanctioned child abuse that is the Transgender Protocol, where a baby won't be born without a panel of strangers politically vested in the 'gender' waiting to be revealed as it grows through ages that appeal to various preferences of pedophiles.

            Wow, this is a really good article, short, well written and ahead of its time for 1994.

            "The reader must bear in mind that the people who are quoted in the paragraphs below are not "just " individuals writing about their personal sexual preferences, and that these are not "simply " the ravings of the lunatic fringe in the North American Man/Boy Love Association (Nambla).

            These are the professionals who train and certify sex education teachers, who write the textbooks that are being used in grade schools and universities, and who widely influence the shaping of public opinion, the news media's views on the subject and, ultimately, the writing of legislation."

             And the Cosmo and Cleo articles sight these 'experts' when 'educating' unsupecting public about all things sexual!!!! Bear in mind that Terry Bean, a gay porn director and a NAMBLA advocate is photographed on Airforce1 along Obama! This is who has been running the once proud Christian Moral America.
