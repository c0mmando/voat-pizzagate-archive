             This has pizzagate written all over it. The Clintons intentionally disrupted the medicine supply in Africa  causing a huge surge in disease. This allowed their friends to profit from USAID, and it gave them a massive pool of victims for clinical trials. Big Pharma is all over this, and see my other post.

              yes its a big crime ... but there's no pedo crime in there.
pizzagate is about pedos and the DC pedo  ring. I put stuff semi-related over on

               For people struggling to put food on the table and a roof over their heads, "voluntary" participation in clinical trials is a slippery slope. While disclosure of new data from pharmaceutical companies is a good first step, questions remain.

              <li>
               The purpose of clinical trials is to find out if the newest wonder drug is all that wonderful, and what kind of side effects we humans might expect. It worked on animals, but will this drug kill people, and/or turn them green? Every warning you see on a label is there because a test subject -- or 50 of them, or 500 of them -- have suffered that side effect.

               Billionaire CEO of Synthes USA
In 2009, top executives at Synthes were indicted by U.S. Attorneys for Eastern Pennsylvania for using an untested calcium-phosphate-based bone cement on human patients without the authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, which resulted in the deaths of three people. Wyss was not indicted but four of Synthes' top executives were convicted and sentenced to prison terms.

              <ul>
               <li>
                Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, whose former company conducted illegal human experiments where three elderly patients died.
               </li>
               <li>
                The Examiner reported July 23 that John Podesta received $87,000 as a paid consultant to a Wyss-controlled foundation before joining President Obama's inner circle of White House advisers.
               </li>
               <li>
                Podesta has also benefited from the more than $4 million Wyss has given to the Center for American Progress since 2008.
               </li>
               <li>
                Podesta was the founding president of CAP and remains as chairman of its board of directors, which also includes Wyss, former Secretary of State Madeline Albright; former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D; and former Obama White House energy czar Carol Browner.
               </li>
               <li>
                The loyalty appears to be reciprocated, as liberal groups continue to remain silent about their acceptance of millions of dollars in donations from the reclusive Swiss billionaire even as CEO Wyss conducted abhorrent human experiments.
               </li>
               <li>
                Wyss, who was Synthes CEO and majority stockholder at the time of the indictment, sold Synthes to Johnson &amp; Johnson in 2012 for $21.3 billion.

                When medical device company Synthes decided to illegally test a bone cement on people, the results were disastrous. A disturbing tale of corporate crime and punishment.

               <li>
                Synthes not only disregarded multiple warnings that it was flouting the rules, but also brushed off scientists’ cautions that the cement could cause fatal blood clots.

Pfizer representatives traveled to Kano, Nigeria to administer an experimental antibiotic, trovafloxacin, to approximately 200 children. Local Kano officials report that more than 50 children died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities.

                During a trial for the treatment of acute mania, psychiatric patients were taken off their existing medication and told that it was discontinued and no longer available. They subsequently received risperidone or a placebo. This was controversial because the patients receiving a placebo could suffer unnecessary harm by being taken off their medication. One patient explained that he signed a form because the doctor required it, but had no idea that he was participating in a clinical trial.

           <ul>
            <li>
             Huma Abedin, Clinton's right-hand woman, was for 12 years the assistant editor of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs.
            </li>
            <li>
             In 2002 the supposedly academic journal published claims by a Canadian law student about the 1998 bombing Bill Clinton ordered in Iraq.
            </li>
            <li>
             Sina Ali Musati claimed he did it as a distraction from the Monica Lewinsky scandal - which was then at its height.
            </li>
            <li>
             Clinton campaign claims Abedin was not involved in actually editing the magazine saying she was 'just on the masthead'.
            </li>
            <li>
             But did not explain how that squared with her being on the editorial board.
            </li>
            <li>
             Her mother is editor-in-chief and suggested U.S. was responsible for 9/11 while another article said Jews were 'adept' at influencing politics.
            </li>
            <li>
             The article was written by Sina Ali Muscati who was the time described as a 'second year law student' at the University of Ottawa. His academic credentials were not declared.
             <ul>
              <li>
               Muscati wrote about the 1991 conflict and its aftermath, which saw Saddam Hussein remain in power throughout the 1990s, despite being bombed twice - in 1996 and in December 1998.
              </li>
              <li>
               'The crisis with Iraq has also probably benefited Clinton, serving as a good deterrent of attention from personal crises, such as his campaign funding scandals, legislative failures, or the Monica Lewinsky affair,' he said.
              </li>
              <li>
               'By occasionally bombing Iraq in the name of humanity, at least, he has been able to look strong and presidential.'
              </li>
              <li>
               Clinton's bombing of Iraq in December 1998 was widely mocked as 'Monica's war'.
              </li>
              <li>
               He ordered four days of strikes by bombers and cruise missiles at the height of his impeachment trial, brought in the wake of his admission that he had had a 'not appropriate' relationship with Monica Lewinsky.

             Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality.
            </li>
            <li>
             The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.
            </li>
            <li>
             Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.
            </li>
            <li>
             The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.
             <br/>

            <li>
             Two of every three dollars spent acquiring anti-tuberculosis drugs through the program, which is administered by the World Bank, have gone to two companies—Swiss health care giant Novartis and Indian drug company Lupin Ltd.—that together have donated up to $130,000 to the Clinton Foundation.
            </li>
            <li>
             The project, dubbed the Second National Tuberculosis Control Project (SNTCP), is financed by the World Bank’s International Development Association, which receives the bulk of its funding from the United States, Britain, Japan, and Germany.
            </li>
            <li>
             Clinton has pointed to her foundation’s work in promoting access to pharmaceuticals in the developing world as an example of its laudatory humanitarian mission.
            </li>
            <li>
             However, critics have noted how beneficiaries of other foundation-backed pharmaceutical access programs have made large financial contributions to the group. Companies that received funds from the foundation to provide low-cost HIV drugs, for instance, were donors to the foundation.

             Asked to name the enemies that she is most proud of during Tuesday’s Democratic presidential debate, Hillary Clinton cited industries represented by lobbyists who are among her top campaign fundraisers.
            </li>
            <li>
             In addition to Iran and the Republican Party, Clinton said she was proud to count “the health insurance companies” and “the drug companies” as her enemies.
            </li>
            <li>
             Those industries’ lobbyists do not appear to share that enmity. By mid-July, seven of them had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for her presidential campaign, according to campaign finance records.

             They include Heather and Tony Podesta, the recently divorced Democratic power brokers. Heather Podesta represents health insurer Cigna, while Tony lobbies on behalf of pharmaceutical firms Amgen and EMD Serono, a division of drug giant Merck.

            <li>
             The Podestas have also given as much as $150,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to that group’s list of donors.
            </li>
            <li>
             Insurers Humana and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and drug company Pfizer have donated between $1 million and $5 million. Merck has given $250,000 to $500,000; AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson have donated $100,000 to $250,000.

             The December 1998 bombing of Iraq (code-named Operation Desert Fox) was a major four-day bombing campaign on Iraqi targets from December 16, 1998, to December 19, 1998, by the United States and United Kingdom.
            </li>
            <li>
             The contemporaneous justification for the strikes was Iraq's failure to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions and its interference with United Nations Special Commission inspectors.

           <ul>
            <li>
             Former U.S. Army intelligence analyst William Arkin contended in his Washington Post column January, 1999 that the operation had less to do with WMD and more to do with destabilizing the Iraqi government.
             <ul>
              <li>
               It is clear from the target list, and from extensive communications with almost a dozen officers and analysts knowledgeable about Desert Fox planning, that the U.S.-British bombing campaign was more than a reflexive reaction to Saddam Hussein's refusal to cooperate with UNSCOM's inspectors.
              </li>
              <li>
               The official rationale for Desert Fox may remain the "degrading" of Iraq's ability to produce weapons of mass destruction and the "diminishing" of the Iraqi threat to its neighbours. But careful study of the target list tells another story.
              </li>
              <li>
               Thirty-five of the 100 targets were selected because of their role in Iraq's air defense system, an essential first step in any air war, because damage to those sites paves the way for other forces and minimizes casualties all around. Only 13 targets on the list are facilities associated with chemical and biological weapons or ballistic missiles, and three are southern Republican Guard bases that might be involved in a repeat invasion of Kuwait.

            - Wolfowitz says he will consider taking South Africa's approach to other malaria-affected countries. He committed around US$48 million for malaria control in 14 African countries, which could increase, depending on success.

The budget presented for the fiscal year 2016 included a request for $1.11 billion for PEPFAR as well as contributions from global organizations such as UNAIDS and private donors.

             In 1996, an outbreak of measles, cholera, and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria. Pfizer representatives traveled to Kano, Nigeria to administer an experimental antibiotic, trovafloxacin, to approximately 200 children. Local Kano officials report that more than 50 children died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities.

              The controversial insecticide DDT — which most nations have banned — is back on the menu for malaria control after the World Health Organization reversed a 30-year old policy on Friday (15 September).
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The move puts annual indoor spraying of DDT alongside drugs and bednets as one of the three main tools for controlling the disease.

              "The scientific and programmatic evidence clearly supports this reassessment," said Anarfi Asamoa-Baah, assistant director-general for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria at the World Health Organization (WHO).

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              "[Indoor spraying] has proven to be just as cost-effective as other malaria prevention methods, and DDT presents no health risk when used properly."
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The chemical kills the mosquitoes that spread malaria. It helped eradicate the disease from southern Europe and North America in the 1960s.

              DDT is also toxic to birds, fish and mammals. It accumulates in the food chain and remains in the environment for many years. In the 1970s, growing awareness of these threats led many countries to ban its use in agriculture.

              Research in Kenya indicates that the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS across Africa could be linked to malaria.

             <p>
              The work has important implications for public health policies in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the need to tackle both diseases together.

             <p>
              There is considerable geographical overlap between HIV/AIDS — which infects over 40 million people in Africa — and malaria, which causes 500 million clinical infections each year.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              People with both malaria and HIV/AIDS are more likely to transmit the HIV virus, according to the study published in the journal Science today (8 December). This may have promoted the rapid spread of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa.

             <p>
              "We have always known the relationship between [malaria and HIV/AIDS], but we did not know the impact it had on the spread: now we have a reference point," says Ayub Manya, an epidemiologist with the Kenyan National Malaria Control Programme.
