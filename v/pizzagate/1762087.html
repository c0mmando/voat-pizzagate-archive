            Thank you for replying!  Sorry it took me so long to respond. I took a break from pizzagate for a few days.  I'm feeling very discouraged so had to step away as nothing is being done so I feel I'm wasting my life away investigating.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is there anything that we can do?  Why won't President Trump do something ? :(
           </p>
           <p>
            Are you safe?  I'm praying for your safety.
           </p>

            What does Julian think?  Does he think children will forever be taped tortured and murdered at the hands of our governments or does he think they will eventually be fully exposed and prosecuted?

             Me too.  I step away for a day or 2 then get roped back in.  But I feel so helpless.  We have so so so so much that we've compiled from our research that supports pedogate, yet nothing is being done.  The "elite" are still practicing their evils on children :(

            Have we not seen this before? I believe that Gagosian Gallery network is involved in something much more than just ugly artwork.  There is more here. I think worth looking into further.

            This story has all the elements of finders, money launderers, ritual abuse symbolism and traffickers. May or may not be but with the alleged threats, and just reading the bio's on these guys

 Larry Gagosian indicted on human trafficking charges. For Buying sex slaves from Russia

            "New York art dealer Larry Gagosian will be indicted next month in Moscow on multiple charges of buying sex slaves from a well known Russian collector. The charges of human trafficking span a decade. Gagosian could face life in prison, although experts in the Russian judicial system express doubt he will be convicted. The Russian judicial system is notorious for its corruption including alleged pay offs to drop previous charges brought against the collector who will be indicted along with Gagosian.It’s reminiscent of stories about 1980s New York art dealer Andrew Crispo."

            Update: Gagosian’s Co-Conspirator
05/04/2010
tags: human trafficking, Larry Gagosian, Roman Abramovich
           </p>
           <p>
            Roman Abramovich is the Russian oligarch and serious art collector named in connection with human trafficking charges brought against New York art dealer Larry Gagosian. Abramovich is accused of both selling countless sex slaves to Gagosian, as well as exchanging slaves for pieces from Gagosian’s private art collection.
           </p>
           <p>
            Abramovich , born 24 October 1966, is a Russian business- man and the main owner of the private investment company Millhouse LLC.
In 2003, Abramovich was named Person of the Year by Expert, a Russian business magazine. He is known outside Russia as the owner of Chelsea Football Club, an English Premier League football team, and for his wider involvement in European football. Abramovich is currently the 3rd richest man in Russia and the 50th richest man in the world according to the 2010 Forbes list with an estimated fortune of $11.2 billion. Abramovich has recently boosted his security staff to a 40-person “private army”, making him one of the best protected businessmen in the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            In May 2008 Abramovich emerged as a major buyer in the international art auction market. He purchased Francis Bacon’s Triptych for US $86.3 million (a record price for a post-war work of art) and Lucian Freud’s Benefits Supervisor Sleeping for US$33.6 million (a record price for a work by a living artist).
           </p>
           <p>
            Chris Hutchins, a biographer of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, claims that the relationship between the former Russian president and Abramovich is like that between a father and a favorite son.
           </p>
           <p>
            Boris Berezovsky (his one-time business partner) alleged in 2008 that Abramovich harassed him with “threats and intimidation” to cheat him to sell his valuable shares at less than their true worth. Abramovich has been sued for US $3.3 billion.
           </p>
           <p>
            On 5 July 2008, The Times reported that Abramovich admitted he paid billions of dollars for political favours and protection fees to obtain a big share of Russia’s oil and aluminium assets as was shown by court papers The Times obtained. Yugraneft, an affiliate of Sibir Energy, is seeking billions of dollars in damages in a lawsuit in London against Roman Abramovich and his investment company Millhouse Capital, alleging that it was cheated out of its Russian assets.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1992 he was arrested in a case of theft of government property: AVEKS-Komi sent a train containing 55 tankers of diesel fuel, worth 3.8 million (Roubles), from the Ukhtinsk Oil Production Factory. Abramovich co-operated with the investigation, and the charges were dropped after the oil production factory was compensated by the diesel’s buyer, the Latvian-US concern, Chikora International. An allegation emerging from a Swiss investigation links Abramovich, through a former company, and numerous other Russian politicians, industrialists and bankers to using a US$4.8 billion loan from International Monetary Fund as personal slush fund.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Times said that Abramovich “famously emerged triumphant after the “aluminum wars”, in which more than 100 people are believed to have been killed in gangland feuds over control of the lucrative smelters. He avoided the fate of a rival oligarch who annoyed the Kremlin and ended up being transported to jail in Siberia for ten years,” and “Numerous officials and executives are said to have lost their lives”.

            EDIT 4:Artists' Dreams Imploded Along With Bankers'

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "The economic meltdown is supposed to "reenergize [the] creative economy" of New York by breaking the city's expensive obsession with finance. Instead, it's wrecking artists' best shot at wealth: Through Larry Gagosian.
           </p>
           <p>
            The top-tier art dealer, who bridges the worlds of art and finance, seems panicked by the recession, turning into even more of a workaholic jerk than he was before the crash. Gagosian won't talk, but the New York Times surmises he's in trouble along with the rest of the art industry:
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone is vulnerable. Especially Larry Gagosian...
           </p>
           <p>
            The prices of work by the young artists he has been luring into his galleries... are falling like bank stocks.
Christie's and Sotheby's are in trouble, too, but Gagosian's bread and butter is brokering private deals between rich people. Since the wealthy have lost much of their taste for art acquisition, Gagosian is especially vulnerable.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why should anyone care about Gagosian's fortunes? Because this was the guy who, through his access to the filthy rich, could make a young artist. That's why most in his stable were poached from rivals: Gagosian could pluck the best.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the Times put it, "the postwar art world is basically a stock market with a couple of thousand really valuable shares." Gagosian was the gateway to being listed on that market.
           </p>
           <p>
            "His apparent decline indicates that artists have seen their own bubble burst along with Wall Street's other false economies. The vast majority of artists won't have to adjust their lives to that, but they will have to adjust their professional fantasies."

             NEWSPAPER | NOV 3, 2016
“Jeff Koons has donated more than $50,000 in cash and through his work to support the US presidential candidate”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Jeff Koons’s donation of $50,000 to Correct the Record, a “Super Pac” (Public Action Committee) backing Hillary Clinton, is the biggest cash donation by an artist to this year’s US presidential campaign. According to reports from the Federal Election Committee, Koons made the donation on 17 June this year.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “But the artist has potentially donated significantly more in kind: he created a print in an edition of 40, Gazing Ball (da Vinci Mona Lisa), which was given to those who bought a $50,000 ticket to an auction hosted by Larry Gagosian in September.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “If all 40 of those prints sold, it would raise $2m for the Hillary Victory Fund, however a spokesman for the campaign said it could not release such donor information.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Koons was not available for comment, but recently told Monopol magazine that he had supported Clinton for 20 years. She awarded him with the Medal of Arts in 2013, when she was Secretary of State.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Other prominent artists to have supported the Clinton campaign according to the FEC reports, through cash donations or auctioned works—many given as part of September’s Gagosian auction—include Marina Abramovic ($2,700 cash donation made in May), Glenn Ligon ($30,000 “joint fundraising contribution” in September), Ed Ruscha ($12,500 contribution in September), Richard Serra ($28,000 contribution in September), Cindy Sherman ($33,400 and $75,000 contributions in August and September) and Sarah Sze ($21,000 contribution in September).”
            </p>
            <p>
             “Art dealers including Gagosian and David Zwirner have also donated to the Clinton campaign.”

             "Anthony Haden-Guest—who, and, really, I'm not going to explain—was roasting artist Damien Hirst (who is an Important Artist right now selling Expensive Art to Fancy People) at The Standard in Miami (where Art Basel is wrapping up) and he did it with this fairly crafty poem, entitled "A Brilliant But Inexplicably Underappreciated Artist Contemplates Some Figures in the Landscape."
            </p>
            <p>
             It went:
            </p>
            <p>
             "Why would I want to see him immersed / In formaldehyde next to his putrid shark / And sold as a set to an oligarch?"
            </p>
            <p>
             " This was in reference to a Hirst piece sold to a billionaire. What I like about thinking about artists who only sell paintings for bazillions of dollars because they all blew Larry Gagosian is that they're a fine lesson in exactly what kind of art sells in this world: theirs, and their poster reprints at the MoMA. And that's really all you need to know! [Page Six]"

               salvador dali
              </strong>
              . as a child, his parents told him they believed he was his dead brother reborn, and he developed psychopathic tendencies at a young age. almost killed a kid and would torture animals. he was not sexually active whatsoever, but was obsessed sexually with

               adolf hitler
              </strong>
              . additionally, has a painting of

               mkultra

               freud
              </strong>
              and freud took an interest in him more than any other artists.

               carl jung
              </strong>
              and freud also were close at one point but had a falling out iirc. carl jung was a conspiracy theorist himself (accused gov't of covering up/witholding ufo information), and also deep into the occult and secret societies. salvador dali can be tied to the cia through

              , who was working with the

               israeli military

              . related artist would also be

               rene magritte
              </strong>
              who hinted to the occult and did not like freud one bit.. also

The Tokyo bomb story_was word play. just wondered if this was also. I think i remember Gagosian being connected to some sort of illegal arms dealing in the 90’s but that’s really hazy now. I guess for some people everything is never enough. thanks

            I spoke with that woman on GAB once. Its either legit or shes crazy. (I know that this isnt a good time to pull the female-crazyloon card, but she was spamming the everloving shit to me about this Richard Prince guy that he stole all of her art and is harassing her and her children. Very odd and concerning. If it is indeed real she needs somebodies help.

             I am an artist and I can tell you artists like Prince are scum. They love destroying someone else's life. For me, it is very believable what she is saying. Richard Prince, admittedly, is a rip off artist.

              So weird.  I never knew this type of stuff went on with artists.  I mean I knew they painted weird stuff for shock value, but I have never heard about this copyright rip off artist type stuff.  It's a thing?

              I suppose my normalcy bias is stopping me from imagining that some rich thief would target an innocent young woman to rob her of fortunes, fame, time, mental health, etc. This world is full blown satanic inversion now. We need a third world war...if only it wouldnt result in another white mass culling.

             Same here! And another one DearIvankaTrump something (I posted her link on here too). But digging into these "art" types, there were some creepy stuff. That Prince guy is SUPER rich, super connected. His latest "art" was basically stealing random strangers' instagram pics. How the hell is that art anyway?

            This is crazy how you can have this on Twitter or worse it is considered "art" but people actually exposing pedophiles are banned.

             I was on a liberal site the other just commenting about JP's weird art collection and what does that say about his character.  NOTHING about PG, the post was completely scrubbed within 24hrs.  Not removed, scrubbed. There is something with this art.

             Wow.  Just wow.  How do we get the word spread about this?  It's too much to put in a tweet.  But his posts about a "CIA thing" we wouldn't understand supports this woman saying he's CIA.  He definitely has disturbing art and comes right out and writes "pedo files" on one of his "paintings".

              I don't know. Like I said, I tried to bring it to everyone's attention and basically was told "yes, it's sick, they push pedophilia through art and entertainment". I really though maybe there was more but my research skills aren't the best. I gave up. I'm trying to find the info I had to add if it wasn't added already.

            I think it's her 5th tweet. She has screenshots of the guy's tweets.  Some are screenshots of her retweeting it, but one is just his, and she "liked" it. I'don't say go to his feed and see how many others she "liked"
