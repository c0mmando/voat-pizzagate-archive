            I’ve read and listened to pretty much everything John Wedger has ever put out and have actively spoken out many times on his behalf.  He has a long comprehensive interview on U.K. Column with Brian Gerrish where he describes the timeline of what happened to him and why - not once have I ever heard him mention anything about using boat living as a loophole to avoiding the SO register - even if it was possible, which it isn’t.  Daily Star is a scumrag known for printing shit and embellishes of it’s own accord.

            He said: “I found a lot of paedophiles were going off the radar. There was a loophole in the law that allowed them to live on canal boats without being on the electoral register.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Some may remember that I went on vacation last summer to Paris, well this story brought to mind that I saw those Same Boats/Barges in Paris docked under and near the Bridges.  Hmm.  Could the same thing be going on in Paris?  They have Electoral Registry Rolls as well.  I remember seeing them when I researched in England AND France.  Would not be impossible to imagine.  Especially with their protections of Roman Polanski and now having a Pedophile Wife married to Macron.

             Not being on the electoral register is not a loophole, has absolutely nothing to do with living on boats. It's your choice to register, anyone can decide not to do so, if you don't register you don't get to vote, it affects nothing else, there's no benefit to pedophiles in not registering to vote and there's no benefit to the "authorities" in pedophiles registering to vote.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think someone is working too hard to try and call boaters pedophiles, it's probably some rich kike in an expensive canalside apartment who doesn't want canal boats spoiling their view of the canal, wouldn't be the first time.

              NO ONE on here is calling All Boaters Pedophiles.  You are accusing us and others of making Blanket Statements.  I am positive there are many boaters that are not.  BUT as we know there will be Some.  Those are the ones we are talking about.  I think you are working pretty hard to get us to believe it is all a ruse and pointing a finger at "some Jew" is a familiar tactic of a racist.  I don't trust racists.

What IS happening is aspersions are being cast at the boating community by falsely alleging that being a boater is somehow advantageous to pedophiles, that somehow pedophiles are exempted from parts of law by being boaters, which leads to the inference that a boat dweller is statistically more likely to be a pedophile than the average person. This is simply untrue, a series of evidence-devoid
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipse_dixit">
                ipse dixit assertions
               </a>
               . The same deception has been used to suggest that boaters are "pikeys" and thieves, that having no eligibility for bail is somehow advantageous to thieves. it's not a new tactic, just a slightly different twist on one that's been around for decades and is usually to be found around misplaced "gentrification" efforts where an expensive canalside development wants rid of the neighbours who have been there decades. In a few places where liars have driven out the boaters the crime rate rose, more street robbery and more rape because there's less people living against and looking after the towing paths. The opposite is also true, more people on the towing path means less crime on the towing path, areas which previously had private fenced-off paths were crime hotbeds where boaters were afraid to go, and now most of those are gone.
              </p>
              <p>
               If I'm wrong, someone will link to the actual law or legislation which hands boat dwellers this perceived advantage. That's not going to happen though, as there's no such thing, read all the laws you like it just does not exist, it doesn't exist in the laws controlling sex offenders, it doesn't exist in the ancient laws establishing canals and navigations, it doesn't exist in the Transport Acts or Waterways Acts of the 20th century which adopted the canals and turned them from a series of private trade routes into a national heritage asset, it's not in Common Law and it's not in any of the Constitutional Acts.

            I don't understand how living on a barge is supposed to somehow avoid the sex offender's register, as someone who knows a whole lot about living on the waterways it seems to me like someone made that up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's how it really works.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a registered sex offender you are required to provide your residential address. If you don't you will be arrested and imprisoned for failing to do so.  That address must be a RESIDENTIAL address so no commercial premises, no homeless, no living in the car or on a patch of wasteland.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some "barges" are residential addresses, no different to a house except they're sat on water. If a sex offender had one of those as a residential address the only thing they're doing different to a sex offender in a house is they're on water. Some of this type of "barge" can't even move, around London many have been stuck in mud for a decade or more and technically not even floating any more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other "barges" are movable, many have people living on them. These fall into 2 categories, the first has a "home mooring" which is not registered for residential use and the second is what is called a "continuous cruiser" with no home mooring who keeps moving around the 3000 miles of canal network from one visitor mooring to the next. Neither of these has a home address which would serve to register for court bail or as a registered sex offender, anyone trying would simply be refused.
           </p>
           <p>
            nice imagined tactic, but doesn't fit the reality on the ground (or water), the reality is that by living on a barge you would be more likely to be held in custody.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone trying to use the waterways of London to get rid of kids bodies would also fail, busiest waterways in the country, tens of thousands of visitors a day in places.
           </p>
           <p>
            The waterways have one of the most close knit and developed communities in Britain. Anyone looking to do wrong would soon find themselves watched everywhere they went, curtains would be twitching every time they slipped their moorings. A beautiful example of how safe and secure our waterways are is the fact that in the last 50 years there's only one "barge" ever been stolen that wasn't found later, anyone who wants to go reading canal enthusiast forums can see for themselves countrywide searches being carried out for missing boats and miscreants on boats.
           </p>
           <p>
            There have been a few unsavoury characters lived on boats over the years, but they've all been well known to the community, everyone knows who to avoid and we tell everyone else who to avoid. Pretty sure any pedophiles would find themselves getting driven out of these tight knit communities or sunk.

             what's betting the paedostocracy may have written a clause into the relevant legislation such that canal dwellers are exempt from having to register. Of course, i wont say that explicitly in the legislation, im guessing it may more likely have the impression of being an  'oversight' or 'omission'

              I can say with absolute certainty that no such exemption or omission exists.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only thing in the entirety of law which canal dwellers are exempt from is some of the smoke emission regulations. Anyone continuous cruising or living on a non-residential "leisure" mooring is also exempt from council tax in the same way that anyone living in their car in a back alleyway or sleeping rough is exempt from council tax.
             </p>
             <p>
              The fact of the matter is that the law treats anyone without a fixed residential address the same as a fully homeless person. If you lived on a boat and required to register as a sex offender they would keep you in custody until they found you a place at a "halfway house" or bail hostel, and then you would be required to stay at that hostel every night. Knowing how the authorities work in this country it's probably safe to say that hostel would be at least 5 hours travel from your boat, so you would not be able to keep up to looking after the boat and the Canal &amp; Rivers Trust would possibly end up seizing the boat after it ended up half sunk.

              There's community who happen to live in the same place and there's community with a common interest. The common interest makes the community even tighter knit, despite being spread across about 3600 miles of canals and rivers. I have people I would call "neighbour" whose moorings are 2 weeks or more travel from mine by water. Many of the boat dwellers are the descendants of the original working boaters whose families have lived on the water for 5 or 6 generations, others like myself are history enthusiasts concerned with restoration of historic vessels and the preservation of a very important piece of our industrial heritage.

               Since ur into boats and law...whats ur take on the law of admiralty superimposed on our commonnlaw of rights...
The solution to the pedoempire lies in understanding how legally they gain claim over our name ..which represents title over our earth vessel..
There is a reason why the Normans had the flag of the red cross..when they invaded and r occupying the land that was once under common law of land..
They were funded by a separate entity..but definitely had the licence slip from Rome to set up a roman pirate shipping corporation ..that now functions as England.
              </p>
              <p>
               All residences act as roman pirate bays..we reside roman property ..ie our name ..into the jurisdictiin of the pirate ship known as a country..running the acounting of Rome 
I dont think even people in england undrstand the spells of the roman language known as english..
Would like to know r u aware of this side of the law

                Admiralty law is a long long way removed from legal rights of navigation and use of the waterways. It seems to be used to crush our rights, but these days everything is being used to crush our rights, take our possessions, they've stopped using the law pretty much and now they just use force. Prime example being the unlawful theft of the vessel "Planet" from Liverpool, but I can give many other examples if I try.

                I can know the law, but if the cop is nothing more than a criminal thug with a badge it doesn't help. Around here they're pretty much all criminal thugs with badges, pedophiles and sexual degenerates. upsd.co.uk

              And there are the Grosvenor family which owns a lot of London, and the Cecil and the Howard families. Richer than the Rockefellers by a long way, they all came to Britain in 1066 with William the Conquerer.

                Fiona Bruce seems like a lovely lady, shes been on the BBC for years. Always does crime reporting.  Never heard this about her family!  My ancestors came over to Ireland in the Norman Conquest, my maiden name is VERY French lol, why were we not related to any of the rich people, not fair?
