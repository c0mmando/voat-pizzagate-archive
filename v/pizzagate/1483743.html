            Hey guys, I'm a liberal (well, I'm left wing) and I think having child sex slaves and paedophilia is disgusting.  I believe that there is worldwide trafficking industry in adults and children, and that the Clinton Foundation is as dirty as they get.

            The pedo prophet thing originated with one of the stories of the Hadith which was about the age of Aisha at the time of her marriage. This story was refuted by a careful reading of Mohammad's first biography.

            WOW, so this is what liberals believe? That we are living in fantasy land making shit up to scare them..

            You ain't seen the half of yet, Islam has video's on YouTube instructing how "thighing" a little girl. Thighing is where the male husband of a child where the child is too young for them, they fuck them in between the thighs. At least they limit their sexual abuse to that, till the girl bride reaches the age of 9, depending on the instruction of the specific Imam.
           </p>
           <p>
            They also have video's on how to properly beat their wives, training on how to decapitate people etc etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nope, this is not fear mongering, this is very real! And so is Satanism!

            These are some of the reasons why the founding fathers made the constitution because any country can become a likeness to Bolshevik communism where 130 million people could be murdered in just a couple years, and another 130 million sent to the Gulags.

            Yes sir, this is where they got the pictures from to fake the holocaust and spend the next 80 years lying about the only people who tried to stop them. And today, we are facing all of them in convergence!

            If we don't win this one, get ready to kiss your ass goodbye but whatever you do, kiss it goodbye while you're fighting, because if you get captured alive, you will regret it so bad, I can't even say.
