            Therapeutic support availability is lamentably low all accross the board in this country - God only knows how such victims must fare.  I pray that you're right about reformation 2.0. But we have a long, long way to go.

            I was just about to write of my experience when studying for my BSc and Masters in Psychology and I read your post.  We too were discouraged from DID research and I had many a debate with lecturers who consistently claimed it as debunked or attributable to 'false memory syndrome'.  However we had one lecturer who stood up for DID and had written books and papers in support - it was he who successfully dissuaded me from accepting what was then considered a prestigious post-grad placement with the Tavistock - and gave their involvement in mind control techniques as one of the many reasons.  I'm glad he did.  He was fired from his post at the end of the year.  I know more now and have a fuller understanding as to why.  I'm not sure if you're UK based but if you're not then it would lead to this debunking of DID as being a universal standard.

            Agreed! It's sad when you think of all the people that could be helped with adequate training, but they won't do that since it would expose SRA/human trafficking.  Even worse is that the school is in on it.  I can't comprehend the greed that trumps compassion for another human being.

            They also removed Narcissism from the DSM 5 manual when in reality its at epidemic proportions. Research into Narcissism has been in reverse since the 70/ 80's while research into even the most obscure of Psychological  conditions has risen inexorably - that should tell you something right there.

             Adulturers... Adulturating whatever they can. Do not understand innocence or purity. Have been likely denied it, stripped of it, or maligned against it in a way they have not yet been able to undo. A simple prayer of forgiveness and dedicated repentance to Jesus, son of God, should remedy their problems, but they have chosen to revere and idolize their own violations and sadistic ways of operating because they are afraid of losing an ounce of joy EVER. Purely impulsive entitlement with little to no foresight or loyalty toward anyone outside themselves, and therefor anyone who would help them in their depravity.

            Try this on for size: Christiano, whose personal website features essays arguing for the “sexual autonomy" of children that would allow them to "embrace sensual pleasure as a birthright," says his organization is “invested in dispelling the vitriol which serves only to prevent minor-attracted people from coming to terms with that challenging aspect of themselves and responsibly integrating it into everyday life."

            Not only do they try to normalize it but they lobby the American Psychological Association to stop classifying it as a mental illness.  This is exactly how homosexuality was normalized.

             Please don't ask for sources, but the APA is an ongoing CIA operation. Anyone asking can do their own research.

              At this point, I could believe it. That's probably why most psychologists, social workers, counselors, etc., don't receive much education on DID (dissociative identity disorder).  Governments across the world are creating DID patients every day but they don't want the professionals to have any knowledge how to diagnose and treat them. Most of the 25+ psychological professionals I've interviewed have not had any experience treating DID. They see it as being so rare, they'll never have a DID patient. Only one counselor had training, and that was outside of requirements for her degree.  Now it all makes sense.
