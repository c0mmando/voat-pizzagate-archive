<p>On Thursday evening the academy said the board had “unanimously decided to resign … to honour those men and women who made cinema happen in 2019, to find calm and ensure that the festival of film remains just that, a festival.

<p>The head of the academy, Alain Terzian, accused of autocratic behaviour by his many critics, brushed aside the complaints, saying the academy “should not take moral positions” about giving awards, but French feminist groups have urged César voters to boycott Polanski’s film and called for a protest outside the award ceremony, to be held in Paris’s </p>

<p>The academy said a general meeting would be held after this year’s awards ceremony to elect a new board and management to work on implementing reforms and modernisation. It had already announced a series of measures to boost female representation: barely 35% of its nearly 5,000 members are women.</p>
<p>The signatories of the open letter include the directors Jacques Audiard (The Beat That My Heart Skipped), Michel Hazanavicius (The Artist), Cédric Klapisch (The Spanish Apartment) and Bertrand Tavernier, as well as the actors Omar Sy, Bérénice Bejo, Chiara Mastroianni, Ludivine Sagnier, Karin Viard and Roschdy Zem.</p>
<p>While it made no mention of the Polanski controversy, it complained that the founding statutes of the Césars had not changed in decades and that the academy’s members had no real say in its decisions or in the running of the ceremony.</p>
<p>The academy’s board said in response that it would ask the national cinema centre – part of the culture ministry – to appoint a mediator to oversee a “root and branch reform” of its statutes and governance.</p>
