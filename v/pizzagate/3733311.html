            <p>
             Oliver Hazard Payne (July 21, 1839 – June 27, 1917)[1] was an American businessman, organizer of the American Tobacco trust, and assisted with the formation of U.S. Steel, and was affiliated with Standard Oil. He is considered one of the 100 wealthiest Americans, having left an enormous fortune.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was the son of Henry B. Payne, a businessman, U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator, and Mary (née Perry) Payne. He was named for Oliver Hazard Perry, a relative of his mother. He was the
             <strong>
              uncle of William Payne Whitney and Harry Payne Whitney
             </strong>
             . He was also the uncle of Congresswoman Frances Payne Bolton.
            </p>
            <p>
             Payne began his career shortly after the war, investing in iron and then oil refining. His oil interests were the first acquired by Standard Oil, and he became a trustee of that firm.[3] He was charged with bribing members of the Ohio Legislature to attain a Senate seat for his father (before the U.S. Senate was directly elected), and
             <strong>
              with bribing the Democratic Party to name his brother-in-law United States Secretary of the Navy
             </strong>
             , though the charges were dropped.
            </p>
            <p>
             Payne, who did not marry nor have children, died at his home, 852 Fifth Avenue in New York City, on June 27, 1917.[1] He was buried at Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.

            <p>
             The Whitney Museum was founded by a Vanderbilt and that made me think of the recent posts on the Biltmore Estate (like this one). Around that time was a military unit SHAEF, which also dealt with art and psychological operations/propaganda and began the Rainbow Unit of the military.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just a reminder, Gloria Vanderbilt did an interview with Charlie Rose about the suicide of her elder son (I suppose she trusted him) where she mentions that she was just 13 feet away from her son when he went over the ledge
            </p>
            <p>
             So I guess it's no surprise that as the Biltmore Estate was used to 'store art' during WW2, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney would go on to found the Whitney Museum of Art.

            , can you put together some kind of TL;DR for this? What are you saying Cornell Medicine has to do with abuse of kids? What exactly does "affiliated" mean in this context? Does that mean they're all under the same ownership? Are you saying the pedo Joel Davis was paid by Cornell? Because it looks like you're also saying he was paid by Soros. Are you implying Cornell itself gets Soros money?

             Okay, I've added 'some kind of TL;DR' at the beginning of the post.  But for me this is still an emerging picture, so if you still feel the post does not warrant a place on this forum I don't have any resistance to it being deleted. As I said before, I've put a link to it in the pizzagatewhatever subverse.

              Thanks MB2. By "emerging picture" I take it you mean you're not clear how closely related they are, but they are popping up in the same places when you research a particular topic?

              I'm not asking you to delete or move the submission (I didn't even flair it). I am just trying to get clarity about the relevance to abuse of kids, or to those we suspect abuse kids.

             17 Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.
            </p>
            <p>

             19 Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.

              After some reading through voat comments doing research for this coronavirus wargame, looking for the ackground to the Red Cross and their role in pandemics and coming across more connections to the Vatican,  I also stumbled across

            On Arthur Sackler / Part 3:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <a href="http://archive.is/DY96y#selection-457.3-2188.0">
              http://archive.is/DY96y#selection-457.3-2188.0
             </a>
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            “Dr. Sackler was a psychiatrist who published 140 scientific papers on neuroendocrinology, psychiatry, and experimental medicine.” What they didn’t mention is that the vast majority of these were self-published in journals and “medical newspapers” that Sackler himself had launched as promotional vehicles.
           </p>
           <p>
            During this same period, his business dealings and associations were secretive and conspiratorial. He created hidden corporations, and listed them under his first wife to hide his own ownership. Behind the scenes, he colluded with his supposed arch-rival, agency head Bill Frohlich, whose company International Medical Statistics (IMS) would marry databases with the AMA physician masterfile, reselling the progeny to pharma companies, and allowing them to track individual physician prescribing behavior. His own secret ownership stake in IMS would be revealed after his death. But while alive, he quietly purchased the near dead pharmaceutical manufacturer, Purdue-Frederick, and mothballed it for future use.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a single decade, Sackler also invented the pharmaceutical rep – a business attired professional “detail man” that would visit doctors offices with branded trinkets and provide the scientific details and new drug samples doctors needed to keep up; and launch pharmaceutical funded “scientific advisory boards” and speakers bureaus that would assist friends like heart surgeon Michael DeBakey as they climbed the integrated career ladder from academia to industry to government and back again.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1957, he aired the first drug advertorial on television, an extravaganza describing a new mysterious condition called “Ataraxia” which kept stressed out business men in a state of psychic distress preventing sleep and relaxation. Sadly, no cure was mentioned in the broadcast. That came a few months later when Pfizer released their new tranquilizer, Atarax.
           </p>
           <p>
            By 1960, he represented two new drugs that risked cannibalizing each other – Valium and Librium. He skillfully promoted one for nervous tension and the other for psychic stress, making both record breaking success stories. By then, 1 in every 7 Americans were on tranquilizers.
           </p>
           <p>
            But for Arthur, this was just the beginning. He had a grander vision, and had already laid the seeds that would create wealth beyond his wildest dreams, and eventually threaten the health and stability of our nation.

            Kathleen Foley is involved in the "palliative" medicine movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            She worked with George Soros, Purdue Pharma, and J&amp;J to manufacture the opiate crisis
           </p>
           <p>
            Palliative Care trades the conventional concept of curative medicine with one that focuses on pain relief (opiates)
           </p>
           <p>
            She began working with George Soros in 1995 when he founded the "Project on Death in America" in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
           </p>
           <p>
            They used the term "opiophobia"
           </p>
           <p>
            The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is the "charitable" foundation of Johnson and Johnson (PharmaCo)
           </p>
           <p>
            This project began sponsoring doctors, nurses, teachers, universities, and textbooks to lower the threshold in which doctors would prescribe opiates. They created a "painscale" for patients and doctors, and integrated pain as a "vital sign". It started with terminal cancer patients and slowly opiates became the preferred first line strategy for all pain mgmt.
           </p>
           <p>
            They even funded propoganda stating opiates were "perfectly safe" and acetominophin and  ibuprofen were dangerous due to liver damage
           </p>
           <p>
            PDIA also supported "right to die" legislation and other euthanasia initiatives.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Sackler family got the raw material for their opiates from J&amp;J's farms. They too sponsored Kathleen Foley.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mortimer Sackler and George Soros were tennis buddies and neighbors in Gstaad.
           </p>
           <p>
            Purdue patented a buprenorphine cure
           </p>
           <p>
            Soros was the first person to bring buprenorphine to the USA in 2006 when he flew french doctors to Baltimore's Open Society Foundation
           </p>
           <p>
            Soros also lobbied to get methadone and buprenorphine onto the UN List of essential medicines.
           </p>
           <p>
            These guys are profiting on both sides of the Drug Epidemic they created.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, a junkie's organs can still be "donated". And increasing overdose rates are benefitting the transplant industry
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, Soros foundation is still using "opiophobia" as a battering ram to bully countries into prescribing more smack

            <p>
             On February 10, Dr. Warren D. Johnson, Jr., former Chief of Infectious Diseases, and now Director of the
             <strong>
              Center for Global Health
             </strong>
             within the Department of Medicine's Infectious Diseases Division, was honored during an inauguration ceremony, in which a new clinical facility was named after him in Port au Prince, Haiti: The Warren D. Johnson, Jr. Medical Center.
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Founded in 1982, GHESKIO is the first institution in the world exclusively dedicated to the fight against HIV/AIDS. The construction of the new clinical facility was sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development and will double the space available at GHESKIO for research, training and clinical services. A second laboratory building was also inaugurated at the ceremony and was named in honor of Rodolphe Merieux, the late son of the President of the French Biotechnology company, BioMerieux, Lyon, Alain Merieux.
            </p>
            <p>
             The dedication ceremony of the Medical Center was attended by over 300 people including local supporters, international visitors, and Haitian dignitaries. International attendees included Dr. Andrew I. Schafer, Chairman of the Department of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College, as well as individuals from the NIH and multiple universities such as Vanderbilt University, NYU, Dartmouth College, and others. Haitian dignitaries who attended the ceremony included the Minister of Health and Population, Dr Gabriel Thimothee; US Ambassador to Haiti, Mrs. Janet Ann Sanderson, and French Ambassador to Haiti, Mr. Christian Conan.
