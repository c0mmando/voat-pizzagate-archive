Daily Mail, U.S Editor, <strong>Piers Morgan</strong> and <strong>President Trump</strong> are supposedly having a little fisticuffs over DM publishing references to Melania\'s nudie past. I wonder if this is Morgan\'s attempt to let Trump know he has the power to \'let slip\' what he, Morgan, a professional journalist of 30 years knows about pedogate....</p>',

            I've seen many theories that the island of Little Saint James is a CIA/Mossad Honeypot, where the world's richest and most powerful people are brought to exploit their vices. The whole place is allegedly wired and bugged, and video is then captured of their ill behavior and compromising positions. As far as the Trump connection goes, he is in Epstein's black book, but so is Ivana Trump and Ivanka Trump.

            The truth is that Trump didn't ban Epstein until the police were made aware of his extracurricular activities. At that point his hand was kind of forced in the matter as to avoid a PR nightmare. This sort of coincides with him saying how great Epstein was.

            Im hopeful that trump is gonna drain the swamp, but im perplexed that others havent picked up on trump-epstein connections.   Hes being sued over it w some serious allegations.

             When pedos are being exposed they try to cloud the situation to confuse. Either child rape rings don't exist, or everyone's involved. It's bullshit and that's why we follow evidence not heresay.

              Idk...evidence like within epsteins blackbook was like 10 numbers for trump. He had definitely been on the plane w jeff.  Theres been info on this way before this election. U should check out some of p i. Ed oppermans discussions on epstein- dudes an expert.  Half the stuff that is cited on this site is victim stories (like the girls lawsuit) or someones interpretatiom of a swirl on a t shirt...again hope hes changed or wasnt involved, but theres def a suggested troubling connection

              I've been following PG since day one and I'm just wondering what evidence we have. What did I miss. Weird subjective emails are not evidence. Sick and twisted instagram posts are not evidence. All the connections we have made is not evidence and just because we all believe it to be true is you guessed it, not evidence. So tell me, what is the evidence you're following and how is it different from Trump having connections to Epstein.... Oh that's right, if it was Podesta it would be evidence.....

            Epstein was stalking Trump is what it sounds like. Trump was pretty open about how Epstein was going to get in trouble for his island. Trump was pretty open at the Jesuit dinner about Hillary Clinton taking children out of Haiti.
