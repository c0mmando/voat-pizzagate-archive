<p>7 Years ago. Sleazy Film Director James Toback\'s Underage Pick-up Attempt by Adrian Chen at Gawker, March 31st 2010</p>

<p>About 10 years... when I was about 14. This man approached me on the street around 72nd street and broadway. He told me his name was James Toback and that I had &quot;the look&quot; and that he could make me a star. He told me he was working on some movie called &quot;Harvard Man&quot; and name dropped Sarah Michelle Gellar. He gave me his phone number and told me he was giving a lecture at like Hunter college (I think) the next day and that I should come to the lecture. I went home and told my parents about this. They said I could call him, but they would need to speak to him if this was to proceed any further.</p>

<p>and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Toback did this to my friend when she was seventeen years old, picking her up at a deli near our NYC high school. He took her to a taping of Charlie Rose and asked her how often she masturbated. She wisely declined an invitation to audition for him in a hotel room.</p>

             I know, it does seem like this is a "setup" in a way. They do have impeccable timing, so this may be a way of slowly leaking so people "get used to" this and we "move on".

              Could it be possibly that they are hoping that normies and others will think this is the Pedo thing we are trying to erase, that when this is over then  our Pizzagate has been solved?  I am waiting to see what is at the end of this long litany of abusers so long awaited and welcome.
