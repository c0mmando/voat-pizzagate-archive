<p>Montauk also expands on the idea of putting kidnapped children into the service of the US Government/CIA/Military.  Because of the stories about the base (Camp Hero) and after it closed, a number of young boys in the area of the Camp tried to investigate the facility which was rumored to be largely underground and have at least 9 levels.</p>
<p>One of those young men is the source of the documentary, along with former CIA/Harry Eisler and journalist and skeptic, Steve Volt of Philadelphia.

            MK Ultra is real. Is it still around today? Maybe, but if it is we probably wont know or have solid evidence until its too late. But I think its happening and I think they could very well be using the media and Electromagnetic Nervous system stimulation to do it. I think that is evident by the US Patent" Nervous system manipulation by electromagnetic fields from monitors

             Certainly the individuals they put in play may still be active -- 
can't speak to the program as it's reported to be on-going still but
under a different name (forgotten at the moment, but will try to remember)...

and, of course, the effects of what was created in the past are very much still active.

             <p>
              “Oh we do have our stable of weird people working for us. Did I ever tell you about the Pedophile Academy? We actually had one down at Camp Peary, (in Virginia) right near (the CIA’s) Jim Critchfield’s place. I don’t know if you’re aware of it, but we called it ‘The Farm,’ and it was supposed to be a secret training center for young agents. Allen Dulles set up this training center down there for pedophiles. They were in training to seduce, molest, and most especially photograph the young children of targets. Not only, Allen reasoned, would our graduates have a spanking good time but they could get wonderful action photos of the wee ones to blackmail their families with. I understand they broke it up when one of the graduates nailed a (CIA) Deputy Director’s son at a summer camp.”

              Much needs to be said of Al Bielek. I first heard him on the radio with Art Bell about 1995, which I think was a repeat broadcast from 1994. During that 3 hour interview, I was amazed to hear the details of the Philadelphia Experiment. I had only read an article about the Philadelphia Experiment in Newsweek magazine somewhere around 1984 I believe,
              <strong>
               but I had no idea of the incredible technology that was being employed or the eventual consequences that humanity would have to pay for the folly of that experiment; since it ripped opened a hole in the space-time continuum that allowed unwelcome (and unenlightened) aliens to literally pour into our galaxy.

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In 1988, Al Bielek started to recover fragmented memories of his involvement in the Philadelphia Experiment after seeing a late night TV airing of the 1984 movie, The Philadelphia Experiment. Because of Al's involvement with the Philadelphia Experiment, the Montauk Project, and other secret, black budget programs,
              <strong>
               he's been subjected to mind control (as have all personnel connected with such projects), with the goal of eliminating from his conscious mind all memories of his involvement in the black projects.

               as the Philadelphia Experiment began to spiral out of control on board ship, Al and his brother found themselves in a future hospital in the year 2137. Hospital personnel and other people with whom he spoke, told Al of the great changes and cataclysmic events that occurred in the opening years of the 21st century.

             <p>
              Some years later, he was
              <strong>
               recruited into the Montauk Project which was developed in a multi-level underground facility beneath Fort Hero, near Montauk, Long Isalnad, New York.

             </p>
             <p>
              During his Montauk work, he would work his normal day job in California,
              <strong>
               and take a highly classified , high speed, deep tunneled underground magnetic levitation subway train from Los Angeles to Montauk, Long Island
              </strong>
              in about 2 hours to carry out his duties at Montauk and take the same 2 hour subway ride back to Los Angeles by early morning.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               After the time tunnel was perfected at Montauk, he would simply be teleported to the Fort Hero, Long Island underground base and returned back to his apartment in California using Montauk's time tunnel machine.

Both he and Duncan used the Montauk time tunnel to travel to Mars on several occasions.  He now remembers several other trips he took with special teams to 1. a research station in the year 100,000 BC; 2. to other planets to get canisters filled with Light and Dark Energy; and 3. to future time periods, sometimes thousands of years in advance of our current time.
