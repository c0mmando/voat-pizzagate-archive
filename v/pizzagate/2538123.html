            Okay, in an effort to keep everyone in the loop, people are classifying this as fake news. They're saying it's Photoshopped, and then in the next breath saying it's a surgical scar. Huh? I thought Frank's Report took stills from her movies? No, I'm not willing to watch those films! I'm still gearing up for 5:5 video.
           </p>

            Here's the debunking article:

           <p>
            I think the most pertinent part of it is the date. The photo was taken in 2010. The author of the article says the brandings didn't start until 2015, but I don't know that for a fact.

             Former #NXIVM Publicist INSISTS the rumor about Stormy Daniels &amp; her alleged involvement with NXIVM is NOT TRUE. Time to put yet another bit of fake news to bed. So much at stake in spreading disinformation.

            Would we really believe a former NXIVM publicist?

            Now that porn stars are in this, I highly suspect NXIVM is connected to honeypot/brownstone operations.

           <p>
            Suspect ties to Mossad/CIA if my deductiob is correct.

            Honeybee posted on twitter a close-up of Stormy's tattoed covered belly where the scarring from branding (eye of Horus) is too evident. She became an informant. It all makes sense. No ordinary porn star with a child would put herself in such a perilous predicament unless she had the backing of powerful figures. And notice how these individuals seem to pop up from nowhere and inexplicably seem
to get massive publicity. David Hogg comes to mind (until he screwed up his script) Stormy was on SNL skit!!! Try explaining that to an impressionable teen girl. Nobody gets this much publicity unless they have been initiated. Great find Blacksmith 21.

            Seems like she already was man. - 2010 tweet? - Branded? - She was in. She's got knowledge of what time is. ...3:33 ? - lol - These fucks. Neonrevolt article is eyebrow raising. Not sure about the site, but yeah. I bet she was in there, with deep knowledge of some shit that we'll all probably be understanding soon enough. - Time will tell.

            The fact a helpful post like this even needs: "Relevance: Stormy Daniels now looks likely to have been recruited into the "sex cult" NXIVM, whose members are currently under indictment for child sex trafficking." is disgusting and pathetic.
           </p>

            Just tell the pedomods that removing this post is why pedophiles can escape Justice.

           <p>
            The censorship godMods are a pedophiles best friend and lover. The punks shut down open debate with red tape and rules.

            Nice post by the way, even if you have been Groomed by pedoMods.

             I did my tour as a mod and my lifestyle isn't conducive to such an endeavor.  Keeping a minimum of a writing standard helps keep the shitposts (chaff &amp; noise) to a minimum.  I do support the relevance rule as I was the original proponent of the no link-only rule which currently isn't being enforced.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a reason for things.  I don't agree with all of the mods on everything, but I do not believe any of the mods I interacted with have any agenda other than exposing pedophilia.

              Censorship is rules, regulations and control of the media by shutting down "any" opposition. Both sides lose and evil wins.

               Without "censorship," we'd have a forum full of crap. There have to be rules, otherwise people could come in and post all sorts of unrelated nonsense.

               Order brings rule to chaos.  Have you ever seen a database (SharePoint portal) which manages evidence used in complicated court cases?  You've heard about the millions of pages of relevant FBI records?  Taxonomy exists for a reason.  Intelligence is born from data.  Structure from disorder.  Custodes vero.

Strike back against us?
MSM not happy?
"Conspiracy" label.
Re_read crumbs re: "conspiracy" / MSM coverage.
Who will be next?
They are here.
They will try to discredit.
They are stupid.
They bring more eyes.
The 'proofs' are important.
'Proofs' provide new 'eyes' ability to question.
This board in the coming months will be spread &amp; discussed across ALL PLATFORMS.
Important to be prepared.
We will help.
TRUTH always wins.

            This is from a recent scene. SFW.  I cannot validate the authenticity to this video loop.  I found this in a reddit link and by posting this link am making no claim about Stormy the whore and her potential connection to an underage sex cult

             Very interesting indeed.  TImeline is right.  Explains why POTUS would tweet about it in 2013.  The sepia photos have the right contrast to see the scar well.  Assuming it's not a fake.  (Don't think it is).  So either she is a NXIVM deep plant who did fuck Trump or she's on team Trump and playing a role.

            Thanks for reposting. Damn! If true, it also answers my question of what the purpose of this cult was! It certainly couldn't have been to get women/children for that dump douchebag to sleep with.

                You're being a lot kinder than I am. No excuse to hand somebody your freedom. It's Kanye's slave mentality. We'd better accept it's real or we'll never get a grasp on eradicating someone throwing away their freedom because a dump tells them to lose weight.

I include family court judges as the criminal masterminds.

                 It wouldn't shock me one bit.  I don't make it a secret, but I live inside the swamp.  Like, inside the Beltway close.  And I'm a professional.  I know lots of things and lots of people.  Nothing surprises me at all.

             If before, then the tweet was either made post-induction or unrelated.  If after, then she was in the cult, and is being used as a pawn by the Clinton-allied lawyer Aventti (who is likely trying to cover his ass by pulling DoJ resources away from the Clinton email server investigation).

              The FBI and DoJ are obstructing Justice and require Martial Law to clean house with public punishments that leave a blood trail.

               Really?  Who in the FBI and DoJ is 
 currently obstructing justice?

              <p>
               Comey and McCabe?

               Sally Yates and that Deputy AG whose wife worked for Fusion GPS?

              <p>
               James Baker and Lisa Page?
              </p>

               Am I the only one who is noticing a pattern here?

              <p>
               Now, if you listen to some Jew-controlled opposition, you might mutter something about a "Sessions coup" or "Deep State Rosenstein".

              <p>
               If that was true, why would they repeatedly give interviews where they casually reveal the existence of some of their long-running secret investigations (all of which look poised to lock up the whole corrupt Swamp, including "the Clinton Corpse Bride" and Obongo, in one go) and repeatedly hold classified briefings about said investigations with the leaders of the relevant Congressional Oversight Committees?  That sounds like either a terrible schemer or a defamed patriot...

                 Do you know why a police department doesn't constantly give public press conferences about the latest updates to their cases?
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's because a criminal investigation is a very careful and precise process, which can be quickly undermined if the criminals know what specifically they should hide/destroy.  Thus, the standard procedure is to get the case into a state where it is partially ready for the spotlight (such as when you've already found all the evidence for one portion of the criminal charges), then you hold a press conference about that part of the case, not allowing any extra information beyond what has been approved for public release.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Do you know what Congress has a habit of doing these days, particularly when DemoRats or RINOs are involed?
                </p>
                <p>
                 <strong>
                  IT LEAKS LIKE A GODDAMN SIEVE, SPILLING CLASSIFIED OR CLOSED-DOOR TESTIMONY OUT INTO THE OPEN LONG BEFORE IT EVER WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE.
                 </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                 The FBI
                 <strong>
                  <em>
                   is still giving Congress overnight
                  </em>
                 </strong>
                 , it is just being more selective about why they authorize to be shown this information, due to the bad habits of some Schiff-y Senators and Representatives.
