<p>Nathan from Lift The Veil also archives his work at TwitchTV. The twitch videos are longer because this is where he builds his videos before posting them to youtube in a shorter version. This longer version has listeners calling in and asking questions. If you notice during the call in session he receives a veiled threat. Some guy calls in and says his username is &quot;GpsData&quot; and speaks in a cryptic way and tells Nathan that when Nathan chooses sides &quot;it will come full force.&quot; The guy is clever with his threat, it is subtle, but I think it was a threat. </p>

            I actually listened to it this morning. I find him very credible. Tragically, his (the interviewee’s) misplaced trust in the whole QAnon racket has now put his life in danger (as I think he himself is saying?). As Anonymous says, it’s only a matter of time before the whole QAnon thing gets one of us killed.

             Thats the way I took it. He thought more people would have his back if he spoke because the asshole known as Pamphlet Anon from CBTS Patriot Stream, also pretending to be Q, created false expectations in his mind. Several people have been hurt, arrested, and as far as I am concerned one person has been killed because of Q and that would be the Flynn guy

             I damn sure hope so and I hope Coleman Rogers gets put in jail for this bullshit. NOW that NBC publicly printed his name I bet some massive shit is headed his way, one way, or the other. If the law does not lock him up, somebody will probably fuck him up, because he has pissed off A TON of people.

               I saw that article. I have known all that stuff in that article for months. I know who Q is and have known for a long time. A couple of people here that I really like and consider a friend believe the Q thing. At this stage of the Q game, especially considering how much its changed since the beginning, because the people playing Q have changed about three times, I am having a hard time understanding how they still believe it.
