<p>This excerpt from the essay about Craig Spence in the 1980s makes Alefantis seem like a flashback:</p>
<p>*Consider the case of Craig Spence, a behind-the-scenes Republican powerbroker in Washington. In June of 1989, the Washington Times published a story that sent shock waves across Capitol Hill. It seems that Spence had been operating a call-boy ring that supplied young boys, some of them very young boys, to the Washington elite of both political parties. 
*
*It was rumored that a list of influential clients ran to some 200 names, and some of them were publicly identified. On the list were such names as former CIA director William Casey, former prosecutor and current cable ‘news’ talking-head Joseph diGenova, nominally liberal Congressman Barney Frank, political activist/propagandist Phyllis Schlafly, and former Attorney General John Mitchell – who once co-hosted a party with Spence. </p>
<p>Also connected to the case were prominent figures in the media; on the guest lists for Spence\'s ‘parties’ were names such as Ted Koppel and Eric Severeid – who had both been close friends of Spence’s for more than two decades. Koppel had first met Spence when he was serving as the ABC bureau chief in Hong Kong and Spence was purportedly working as a correspondent in Vietnam. </p>
<p>Spence\'s mansion was found to be overflowing with surveillance equipment, including hidden cameras and microphones and an abundance of two-way mirrors. It was alleged that the ring was part of a CIA sexual blackmail operation, gathering compromising evidence on Washington politicos and foreign dignitaries. In August, following his arrest on weapon and drug charges, Spence gave an interview to the Times in which he openly claimed to work for the CIA and with high-ranking members of the Reagan and Bush administrations. </p>
<p>His claims were scoffed at and he was largely portrayed as a self-important blowhard. There are indications though that Spence was involved in covert operations as far back as Vietnam, working under journalistic cover. An associate of his from that time told the  Washington Post: “Spence pulled disappearing acts in Vietnam -- sometimes for weeks at a time … Then he’d turn up, refusing to say where he’d been.” </p>
<p>In Washington, Spence was known to take his show on the road, giving some of his boys regular late-night tours of the White House. These tours were reportedly arranged by Donald Gregg, the national security adviser to then-Vice President George Bush. Though Gregg adamantly denied the accusation, there were undeniable connections between the two men, including the fact that Spence had once sponsored a dinner for Gregg. </p>
<p>The story quickly dropped off the media radar screen, and Washington and the press proceeded to pretend as though it had never been aired at all. According to a Washington Times reporter, the paper trail was quickly covered-up – some 20,000 documents pertaining to the case were sealed by court order. By the time Spence turned up dead in a Boston hotel room less than five months after the story first broke, he was all but forgotten. </p>
<p>The UK’s Independent reported that: “Boston police said he was found lying on his bed at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, dressed in evening clothes, with no obvious signs of injury. The police refused to comment on the cause of death.” The Post had earlier reported that Spence had told a friend: “I may be disappearing soon. It will be sudden. It may appear to be a suicide, but it won’t be.” *</p>',

            I can't help but feel like we are now living in the movie Underworld, where our society has been completely infiltrated by vampires who are completely integrated into society and indistinguishable from us during the day, and who quietly abduct our children for their secret nighttime feeding frenzies. They convert into evil predators those victims who they do not kill outright, thus infecting society like a virus, continuing the cycle over generations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Probably the script was informed by knowledge of our real world dilemma. The actual leaders of both the fictional and real world social order are the top predators.
           </p>
           <p>
            This shit has to end. If we are not vampire killers then we and our children are vampire food. For the sake of humanity need to redpill every able body and bring out the crosses and silver stakes. It is time.

             What if I told you that the predator-prey paradigm is inescapable thing that reasserts itself throughout all of nature, and that even if you 'staked' every last one of the 'vampires', you'll eventually just get new, smarter ones.
