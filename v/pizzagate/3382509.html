<p>Readers of my threads will be familiar with Michael Mates MP, one of the main donors to Harvey Proctor\'s shirt shop, campaign manager to pervert Patrick Rock, and the man who lived only 200 m from where the body of Vishal Mehrotra was found. <a href="https://twitter.com/ciabaudo/status/1160998540912537600">https://twitter.com/ciabaudo/status/1160998540912537600</a></p>
<p>Mates, a former Defence Minister,  recreated the comic songs of Flanders &amp; Swann to raise money for orphaned children. He sang classics like Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud and The Gasman Cometh in aid of Dannatt\'s charity Hope &amp; Homes For Children.

              In 2003, Walker Digital devised an Internet–based surveillance system called U.S. HomeGuard. The basic concept was to hire 1 million work-at-home employees who would log in over the Internet to provide constant surveillance of image feeds from some 47,000 security cameras. These webcams would be installed nationwide at security-sensitive sites including border crossings, water reservoirs, chemical plants, nuclear power generators, airports, etc. Observers would report any suspicious activity to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security within 30 seconds. Wiredmagazine called the idea "intriguing"

               This post is a thread that was posted on Twitter by someone who is well known within the  alt community in the UK who campaigns hard against paedophilia.  I thought much of the material in the thread was of interest  here.

              <p>
               Portillo has  long been a point of discussion for activists within the UK.  He's not someone that I have spent any time looking into adn I really don't want to spend any time on this o I will take the offending sentence out.

             Child abuse scandal raises disturbing questions about UK establishment -

              https://www.rt.com/op-ed/180616-british-home-secretary-child-abuse/
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Before his latest role at the NSPCC, Wanless was a “highly respected” civil servant, permanent secretary to cabinet minister Michael Portillo during the 1990s when Portillo was Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and crossing departments with him when Portillo became Secretary of State for Employment. Again – an establishment civil servant investigating his own. A recipe for a cover-up.
             </p>
             <p>
              More serious, though, are the persistent rumors about Wanless' close friend and confidant Michael Portillo, now like Savile, a BBC TV personality, being allegedly involved in a Westminster sex scandal himself. Rumors circulated in 1994 that Portillo and another Tory Secretary of State, Peter Lilley, had got sexually involved with Britain's first openly gay footballer, Justin Fashanu.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unfortunately for the two secretaries of state though, a disgruntled Fashanu supposedly decided to “blow the lid,” threatening to “bring down the government” by leaking evidence of these affairs to the Daily Express. When MI5 allegedly threatened Fashanu, Tory MP Stephen Milligan, a part-time journalist, is said to have weighed in on the footballer's behalf on a mission to get to the bottom of it all and “clean up the Tory party.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Within days, however, Milligan was found hanged in his London flat, naked, with an orange in his mouth in an apparent suicide, made to look like he was a sexual deviant. Fashanu was swiftly sacked by his football club and got on the first flight to the United States. Several years later Fashanu was also tragically found hanged, this time in a garage in Shoreditch, London.
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Whether or not there is any truth to the original allegations, the mysterious deaths surrounding them should have prohibited any senior civil servant associated with Portillo from taking up a job heading the NSPCC
              </strong>
              , and totally exclude Wanless from heading any inquiry into the Whitehall child abuse scandal. Would anybody who has been abused, or with evidence of abuse, and is capable of doing an internet search, be likely to confide in him?
