<p>As pointed out the other day, the War is progressing classic form in the context of Sun Tzu, Clausewitz and others.  The continuum of MILOPS is very identifiable.  We are now starting to exit phase 1 and enter phase 2.</p>
<p>“Phase 2:  Seize the Initiative. Hostilities commence during this phase. Combat power is applied to delay, impede, halt, or dislodge the adversary as well as to gain access to theater infrastructure and enhance friendly freedom of action.  Concurrently, assistance is provided to relieve conditions that precipitated the crisis in order to promote stability.</p>
<p>Phase 3:  Dominate the Enemy. The focus during this phase is on the exploitation, pursuit, and destruction of the enemy in order to break the opponent’s will for organized resistance. Stability operations will also be conducted as needed to facilitate transition to the next phase.”</p>
<p>Things are about to get crazy.  We all saw the DDOS and other forms of attack today on 8Chan.  The enemy is getting stronger.  The algorithms are getting stronger.  And the attacks are about to become stronger.
This means that we can anticipate a direct on the board/sub, as well as potential direct attacks on individuals soon.  I’ve commented that <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">v/pizzagate</a> has been largely immune from attacks.  I think it is for a reason.  “They” use us an intel source as do the white hats.  Who can act quicker?
What will an “attack” look like?  I’m open to ideas:</p>
<p>•	DDOS to Voat
•	Increased shill attacks on sub
•	Increased attempts to elicit personal info (PII) of Voaters
•	Increased attempts to “tempt” Voaters into following links to CP sources
•	Increased attempts to induce Voaters into clicking links which may contain malware
•	New users asking questions or being “suddenly bold” in an attempt to get Voaters to divulge unnecessary information
•	Other tactics</p>

            I don't mean to be a party pooper but I think you're entirely wrong. Maybe I've been around too long and have grown too cynical. You've only made it this far because THEY'VE ALLOWED you to make it this far. You do not scare them at all. You excite them. They've grown so bored, can't you see it? That's why you're making progress.

            Not saying you should give up but you're definitely counting chickens that haven't hatched.

            This is very good advice and it is greatly appreciated, especially the part about not reposting verbatim on other platforms as that could be used to uncover your identity (self doxxing). Thank you!!!

            Thx Blacksmith21, Simple point but - be aware of the 'Autoplay' on YouTube -
The other day I was watching this video from Victurus Libertas VL
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymn-PG_LXs4YouTubeYouTube">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymn-PG_LXs4YouTubeYouTube
            </a>
            and because it mentioned ‘Child Porn’ in the title, the following autoplay video that was suggested, was ‘5 Best Porn Sites’!!! I did not notice this as my screen was on full screen, and I had popped out to the other room get something real quickly, when I came back in this video started to play. I immediately paused it and deleted it from my history, but I think this is a ‘SNEAKY’ way for YT to put these things on as though you are watching sick stuff. Now, I don’t know if this video would have shown porn, but just in case it would have its an easy way for them to put it on your history.
           </p>

            It's not hard to make a IP+browser+time log from successful access requests. If you care about leaking data, even if you're using a spoof method, you should avoid links to blogs and other "non-professional" web-space. I'm aware this is limiting but if you choose to not protect yourself you will become a target on a list.

            Ya I have thought about that, self-plagiarism. I just really don't care. Use your voice, you have every right to say what you are saying, there is no need to hide.

            HTTPS, tor, VPN. Its essentially impossible for anyone to discover you by traffic (They can still be in your router, on your computer).

            Tor browser disables scripts and enables HTTPS everywhere by default.

              As long as you have https and a vpn, what are they going to do about it? The OP is suggesting that we're already a target because of this subverse/website, so you're not losing anything anyway.

             If you're going to run TOR you should be running your VPN before it. I find it hard to trust either of them, clowns created TOR and VPN's will turn your info over to clowns.

            ) on a public wifi. If you just have to sit at home, build a biquad dish. Then you can pull open wifi from over 5 miles away. My 2¢

              Tails is a operating system that you can run off of a memory stick that doesn't leave any traces on your computer. It runs TOR by default for the web. The reason I say public wifi... I personally don't trust TOR, because clowns created it. NSA might not be able to crack it, but I'm pretty sure one of the alphabets can. (Just my opinion) Plus, people make mistakes..

                Yes. Tails is a full mini operating system based on Linux. It comes with it's own version of the TOR browser. Everything runs off the stick. As a matter of fact after you set it up you'll have to edit your boot options to boot the stick first when you want to use it. Your original system doesn't even start up with it.

                Hotspot generally needs account login, I know Comcast does, so no if you have to log in. Anywhere that has open wifi works. There's a Starbucks on every corner.

               This is why you run a VPN before TOR, so your ISP can't see it.

               Oh I know.  The only comfort is that the NSA are white hats.  Hopefully the DS doesn't have the key.  Adding a VPN and other tactics makes it much harder to pinpoint.  If "they" want to find you, they will.

              Besides protecting the ip and geolocation. I think varying the speech patterns and avoiding the cut/paste habit are also one of the most important precautions to take. A couple of wrong moves, by pasting certain passage onto known social media such as facebook, is all it takes to put a red-flag on your back.
             </p>
             <p>
              Furthermore, be very very careful of any detail too specific to your identity, such as location and timing of certain specific events, which may be recorded/published by third parties.

             +1 for this. Also don't use the same account name or even similar across multiple platforms. I have seen many pgaters doing that

             VPN services are not super trustworthy. They may sell you out especially if they hear the warrant knock. There are scripts to further obfuscate the TOR network but I've never tried it. A lot of the tor "compromises" are computer specific (someone physically planting a tap), your isp selling you out, no one in your area is using tor except you+a combination of you having really specific habits/searches, and revealing personal info.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government has an incentive to keep tor safe and public because it's set up to keep their agents anonymous. Actually hacking TOR/backdooring means throwing billions down the toilet and having to find a new way to communicate. Of course the gov shoots themselves in foot sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             The best thing you can do is encrypt everything but you hardly ever see people do that. It really slows down conversations if that's what you want it for.

             Another good point.  Time is money.  The harder it gets to track you, the more it costs.  Make it worth it.
