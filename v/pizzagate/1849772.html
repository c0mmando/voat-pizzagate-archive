<p>Last Friday, highly incriminating court transcripts were released following a hearing in which lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and Debbie Wasserman-Schultz argued for a Motion to Dismiss a massive class action lawsuit filed against them. The lawsuit seeks damages on behalf of Bernie Sanders donors, Democratic party donors, and Democrats as a whole following leaked emails that exposed illicit collusion that favored a Clinton nomination.</p>
<p>The transcripts reveal numerous damning revelations about the way the Party views its obligations in conducting the primary nominating process. In defending their Motion to Dismiss in the hearing, the DNC has told the Court, America, and the world, that the party views itself as effectively too big to jail: despite the guarantee of impartiality assured in the organization’s Charter, the DNC has asserted that they see themselves as having no legal obligation to actually run the primary impartially, so they could have favored a candidate (but they didn’t).</p>
<p>It’s a confusing show, and a humiliating display for the Democrats, who now have backed themselves into a corner with the duplicity of their argument: If they “win” and the case is dismissed, voters will lose all incentive to participate in any future Democratic nominating processes. If not, the case moves forward into a Discovery phase, and the crimes of the Democrats cement themselves further into Federal Court record and indisputable history.</p>
<p><strong>Unless the Motion to Dismiss is granted, which seems unlikely</strong> given the numerous issues raised by Federal District Judge William J. Zloch in the hearings, the case will proceed to identify the classes owed damages and prepare for depositions. The <strong>list of parties that could be called to depose (testify) is a laundry list of the Party’s most powerful</strong>: In addition to Wasserman-Schultz, Attorneys for the Plaintiffs could–and should–seek to depose Clinton herself, campaign manager John Podesta, disgraced DNC Interim Chair and ex-CNN employee Donna Brazile, DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda, all senior leadership at the DNC and Clinton campaign, and every superdelegate that pledged unwavering support to Clinton, will of the voters be damned.</p>
<p>Beyond this impending earthquake set to rattle the political establishment at any moment, the depositions implicate more than 38 influential anchors, reporters, and editors exposed in the Wikileaks releases who may have abetted this fraud in their development of a strategy of controlled opposition to elevate Donald Trump as a “pied piper” candidate and facilitate the DNC’s strategy to “muddy the waters on any potential attack lodged against HRC” before a single American cast a primary vote.</p>
<p>This bears emphasis: The Democrats decided Hillary Clinton would be their nominee without any idea of how many people would actually vote for her. At off-the-records meetings, the Party, Clinton’s campaign, and the media elite designated her to be the Party’s nominee before the first Americans cast their primary votes in Iowa on February 2, 2016... </p>

            Well hello new friends, I feel better already. We are in for one wild ride what with the Comey firing, DNC case and the upcoming Jeffrey Epstein trial. Trumps timing may have been perfect after all. I'm a big believer in giving them enough rope to hang themselves and that's just what Comey did.

            Well, now we know why they had to throw Bernie under the bus.  Think of what they would lose if they let him win, for win he would have. Those of us that were really close to the election and researched the election fraud know that.  Little did I know how deep the Rabbit Hole went.  There were so many people at the trough that they could not afford to lose all that money and their sick pleasures and the organs.  What a Revolting Outcome.

             I donated over a thousands dollars to Bernie, and am part of this lawsuit. We're suing for damages too, so I might make money off the deal. I'll donate it to

                   We're suing for damages, so i should get not only my $1,100 back, but another $1,100 plus, before lawyer fees. Karma baby!

                Oh well, politicians will be politicians. He might have been somewhat sincere, but his platform was free everything for everybody 
 and we're $17 trillion in debt. Made no sense. I haven't voted for years 'cause I caught wind that it's all a game, divide and conquer. Trump seemed, w/ all his warts, a real person to me.

            Thanks so much for this post. I'm here now in part due to the debacle that was the Democratic Primary. I was a Bernie Sanders supporter and due to a prolonged illness I spent most of the primary in bed watching and listening to the primary battle 8, 10, sometimes 12 hours per day. Even though I was a registered independent , I couldn't believe the illegal and immoral conduct of the DNC, the MSM and the the Clinton camp. It changed my worldview entirely. When Pizzagate broke out, I had no trouble accepting that the vile accusations could be and probably were in all likelihood true. Once upon a time I was a liberal, I don't know where I belong now on the political spectrum. I just want truth and justice and partisan labels be damned. I do blame the Clintons for unleashing one of the most corrupted forces ever in American politics.

             Ya I used to be a full fledged liberal, but have become more conservative over the years.  I value politicians that embody integrity these days the most. What happened to Bernie was disgusting and I am still shocked by how many people just overlooked it or turned a blind eye. The corruption of MSM and the democratic national committee regarding the election, in my opinion, was a travesty, but unfortunately not surprising.

              Then you haven't grown up much. Liberals were behind the social justice movements of the 1960s and 1970s and supported the Bill of Rights like freedom of speech, freedom of press and right to assemble. We once fought corruption, now the limousine liberals have cornered the market on corruption. .There's been a total inversion it seems. They have become the thought police and believe that the end justifies the means, just look at BAMN. Sorry for the lecture. Maybe you don't know post WWII history as much as my generation does to see the ebb and flow and transformation of people and ideas.

               Yes you're right, we shouldn't fight. We have a common enemy. There are plenty of good Liberals and Conservatives. We let a few rotten apples ruin everything for us. I'm so tired of fighting.

                I have several jobs TYVM, but  I'm smart enough to realize trickle down economics has never worked and democratic socialism simply means restrained capitalism to ensure certain institutions like education EPA and healthcare remain strong for everyone not just some people and that it is in your own self interest  to have a government that protects them i.e. a small limited government that hasn't been corrupted by money

             Our stories are quite similar.

             This is said to be one of the most important cases in US history, and the media isn't reporting on it at all.

             The Young Turks is the InfoWars of the "left" - the shiny giant media that touts itself as an alternative voice, yet spouts mainstream propaganda and votes for Hillary. They are downplaying this case, and even called the lawyers "opportunists". They had their most respected journalist come out and do a complete smear on the independent journalists who actually were fairly covering the case. So almost as interesting as the case itself, is the implosion of faux alternative media that has been successfully fooling people and herding the unsuspecting back to the DNC for years. There is a great cleansing afoot!!!

             Here are the lawyers being interviewed about the case, this is a little clip where they call out the reporter for shilling
