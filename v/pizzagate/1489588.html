            We wait...seriously until all the facts are digested. Because at the moment we are witnessing an election which quite frankly is very strange . It coincides with the fact that we know that certain  people who make laws, have some very nasty moral problems, and a lot of shit to hide, and they would love to have an excuse for a more totalitarian government, than we have been noticing in the past twenty years or so. Its no coincidence that pizza gate is occurring at this time. 
How do you manipulate a free people? well if it appears you are removing freedoms you will  get a reaction, if you suspend elections you will get an uprising, if its a big uprising they can bring in marshal law...so we wait.

            Advocate harsher consequences, punishment, for pedophiles, our laws are too lax, and use RICO to prosecute.  The more push citizens put on their elected officials, the more concessions we will get.
