            Good points. Those are all things that made people hate BLM protests and led them to hate BLM altogether. We do not want #Pizzagate to be the next BLM...

            We need to work as hard as we can until Trump gets to office and there is a settling of the newly appointed positions. There is too much internal strife for them to be able to even help at this point, it was indicated in the wikileaks emails that the DOJ has completely fucked over every agency, within and without the US, and that the next candidate was inheriting a badly damaged, unorganized, and cucked system. Protests aren't going to do anything but make the roaches hide even more. We want them to remain comfortable in the fact everyone thinks its an unfounded conspiracy while we dig.

            I'm on this shitty train.Unless we find some seriously damning evidence of specific activity we don't have shit. All we have is conjecture at this point. Conjecture with a lot of very compelling evidence but what we have right now is stuff that you would use to convince not to prove. We have to keep digging and keep finding shit.

            No you shitbird reeree we don't have hard evidence to call them out with all we have now is a lot of very fishy circumstantial shit. As soon as we can go oh look here here it is for all the world to see. Podesta is diddling a kid in this picture. Or if someone goes and catches them in the act.

            anon adapts.  like a virus to a vaccine, your methods of control only last a generation, tyrants.  We are ever-learning, infinitely adaptable, corruption and evil will be rooted out in the end, always.  Reveal yourself to the light of truth, cleanse yourself in its rays, and make penance to the people you have wronged.  And there may be something of you remaining.

The results in all 3 states have to be reversed for it to effect Trump.

             It's over, done, finished.

Not really! If they don't make the deadline, those electoral votes are null affectively lowering the margin.
            </p>
            <p>
             If the null PA taking 20 from Trump there that leaves him with 286 then if he loses MI that takes him down to 270 and HRC up to 248, if HRC also takes WI Trump would be at 260 and HRC at 258. Then if any of the electoral votes are additionally in her favor, which is likely, she will win.
            </p>
            <p>
             The numbers they were stating as stats were also fluff. If the margin of error is 2% than the election could be recounted a 100 times and flip flop all over that 2%. The reason we use machines as apposed to hand count is because the margin of error is so much higher by hand counting, as much as 15%.
            </p>
            <p>
             They could also have re-hacked the failed rigging of the machines. As they said, expecting a close call would make it easy to fluff the election by a small margin. Such as a self destructing virus that counts a flip factor of 2-5% But that would be if they had assumed the states in question were going to be close as they are usually blue states.
            </p>
            <p>
             But with over whelming Trump voters, the hack would fail. Since then, they would then have to get the virus back into the machines and do the recount with a higher factor like 4-6%. to flip the votes. Or they could also infiltrate the poling places, as they already have people working there, threats and money can swing those votes in a hand count. Attributing to why there is up to a 15% error factor with hand counting!
            </p>
            <p>
             And his stating that auditing just 100 poling places would be insufficient is absurd based on his own numbers. What he suggests is as little as one poling place could have swung the votes. That would mean the error factor would have to be so significant at that poling place that it would not be possible to miss! Not even for a 4 year old child!
            </p>
            <p>
             This is criminal absurdity!

This means of the 538 electoral votes, HRC and company have already "persuaded" at least 20 of the electoral college voters outside of those states! EDIT (if my previous scenario applies, HRC only needs 2 "persuaded" electoral college votes leaving Trump 258 and HRC 260.) Somebody archive my comments because you might use these as evidence. Predicting the outcome of this scam!

            We could simply do some clever viral marketing with banners, t-shirts, etc, and maybe go so far as that the guys in the background at a TV interview of Podesta yelling "I've read your emails, Podesta!"

            Doing it in front of CNN just makes them seem important and thus gives them undue power. Who cares about CNN. They are dying, let's let them die instead of expecting them to be journalists which they're not.

            It would be very difficult to pull off. If the lame stream media gave it any attention at all it would be so they could discredit it. They would look for the looniest person in the group, like some Jew conspiracy nutball. It also wouldn't surprise me if one of the shill's on voat would contact the media and offer to be a (mis-) representative of the group.  Quit deleting this.

            I think we should plan about it and once Trump takes office in Jan, we can go out in full force (in all major cities). I think we only have one chance. We should be careful with it and make sure it's a success.

            quite a bit more than conjecture. something that will go before a grand jury would be nice.   and there's no need for insults. all this stuff can't be coincidence, but that alone won't put handcuffs on anyone.

            Easy ways to get into their loop.. Feminist organizations would be an easy in. They love new recruits into their liberal indoctrinations!!
           </p>
           <p>
            But women who do so, must be very careful not to let them selves become brainwashed but still play the part.

            Tougher and more time consuming and a hell of a lot more dangerous would be to get directly into politics..

             I think you're close. It's not about packaging it for the media, it's for the public. Once enough people know the story, the media won't be able to keep saying we're over-reacting to a dinner invitation, or being fooled by a "fake news site". I never thought I'd type this sentence in my life: We need memes.
             <br/>
             I'm not saying that should be our only method of getting the word out, but it's one way to get people to Google "pizzagate". Hell, the first time I heard about it was someone making a joke on reddit about it being crazy. I agreed with them, then I actually read into it. That's what we need right now. Things that get people asking "What the hell is Pizzagate?". It's basically guerilla marketing, and yes, you're right, we are playing their game, and we're gonna fucking win too.

            I think it's a great idea to do it in front of the CNN building! I think I'd wait a little longer though. Also be sure to wear masks, change clothes and be as anonymous as possible.

            To what end? If someone is lying about you then protesting to them is unlikely to change anything.
If you want publicity then I'd suggest organizing a rally for truth and only inviting the alternative media. Big crowds are hard to ignore.

             Actually that's not a bad idea, only I would suggest a conference with live feeds rather than a rally. Keep it simple ,keep it safe.Keep it in the same format of millions of conferences around the world. Rallies,I feel, rely on msm to really work and we know they are not onboard,in fact they would ridicule it.A conference is more respectable and normal. We really need to emphasize that this is an altruistic effort.Keeping things classy and professional should be the way to go.

            I think pedophilia is insane.  I think participating in rituals where babies are sacrificed is insane.  I think greed is insane.  I think people that take money from those that feast upon this sick network are insane.

            I agree with pizzaaccount. I believe those investigating in the NYPD are putting all their ducks in a row and this is the time we want to be quietly gathering information. They already know the heat is on them and are probably busy destroying and deleting lots of evidence. We kinda don't want them to know we're onto them yet. I believe the powers that be are waiting until Obama is officially out of office on Jan 21st before they make any moves. That keeps Obama from having any power to stop anything or pardon anybody.
Patience! Our time will come ; )

             Actually,to the people concerned I think it's fairly obvious,I'm sure they are glued to pizzagate threads.I think what OP meant was that as an under reported topic in msm we have the time to prepare an infallible case before presenting it to the greater public majority.

             BERNIE PEOPLE are already investigating, mainly the child human trafficking part...The Satanism aspect is alarming but tracking Silsby, Podesta, CF, Ghisalaine Maxwell, Epstein etc seem be tying together a HUGE child human trafficking ring. I think it's mainly about dark money capitalism and pedophilia with some disturbing sprinkle of satanism, I'd say it def needs looked into by the cops but the NYPD and Trump's cabinet picks seem dead set on bringing this to light, if Trump's inaugurated and nothing happens... then we will have to get crafty

            Just make sure it's well-organized and that everyone presents themselves well. Oh, and make sure you have designated speakers within the group in case someone does ask a question ... which is doubtful. But remember the interview with James Alefantis when he came outside? No one was prepared to actually ask him a question, so be prepared and articulate.

            Also have pamphlets to hand out to those wanting to know more. Maybe put a landing page together so you can collect subscribers for a newsletter to give updates.

             Great advice.
Be organized and have one head. Remember the saying too many Chiefs and not enough Indians but also watch your back. Be aware of infiltrators who would want to cause crap.

             Great advice! It is much harder for them to make us look crazy if we are articulate and well prepared with undeniable evidence and speakers and researchers in the field backing us up.

             It is incredibly hard to be on the internet frontlines trying to reveal this information to a largely dismissive and distracted audience but we cannot give up. The REAL smoking gun evidence is out there and we must gather information and spread it far and wide.

             I worry daily that this will lose momentum by people losing heart &amp; giving up...tired at shouting at deaf people. What would we say to the children at the mercy of these monsters then. "Sorry, it just got too hard"??  I burn with this subject daily since finding out.
            </p>

             It's agonizing not being able to take to the streets but for now we gather and disseminate.

             Ps- I'm also starting to think that Alefantis interview might have been staged. Those two guys were way to placid. Barely asked any questions let alone the right ones and Alefantis played it waaay to cool. 
Wouldn't surprise me!

            I've mentioned it before, but I'll say it again here: Until we have a smoking gun, we shouldn't take to the streets. Right now, most people don't know about us, and that's what we should be working on. Until more people are on our side, a big, visible protest in public will only serve to make us look like the crazies that MSM says we are. Keep researching, keep discussing, keep spreading the word. The time will come for us to put ourselves out there, but it's not that time yet. Be patient, and stay vigilant.

             You should be working on getting the smoking gun, not caring what your PR image is...  We're interested in truth here, not half-baked investigations and assumptions.

             How about something like a brochure promoting child abuse &amp; pedophilia awareness. We need a cover that hasn't been tainted by MSM that can appeal to the brainwashed masses. Simple, straightforward, unbiased messages that sort of give them an idea what to look out for. State our strongest evidence without getting to deep into it. Let people put it together themselves.
I haven't gotten much as I just had this idea now. We need solid facts, maybe a few of our coincidences. 
-include pedophile symbols from FBI report
-statistics on missing children per year etc
-a few quotes from podesta emails linking with pedospeak terms
I dunno, I'm trying to create something but I need to organise my thoughts and plan.
People in general are lazy so if we go into too much detail they'll just gloss over info and won't get the message. Maybe quietly mention pizzagate somewhere as a reference or something.
Assuming there are mailboxes in your neighborhoods maybe post them around, that way they are unavoidable. It may cost a bit though, but just an idea

             I'd upvoat you if I could, commenting to say that's definitely the right track. After all, look how much the offenders have managed to accomplish secretly in the background for eons.

             besides; i see new faces on voat every day, people are still being drawn in and a lot of discussions and information is going on repeat. we need coherence and direction before we can make any definitive claims, even more if we try to organize a large scale protest.

             I was involved with the tea party and occupy movement. Both extremely valid and important grassroots movements that got co-opted by big players as soon as they started getting national media attention. Don't let that happen here.
