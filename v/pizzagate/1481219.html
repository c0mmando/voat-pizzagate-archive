            What part are you calling BS?  After reading that "Boat" thread yesterday I immediately thought of this email from Podesta. I'm sure I wasn't the only one. It's hard to make sense of the email if you take it at face value. I'm just asking a legit question. Nope, haven't been on voat long, don't post often, haven't earned many votes, but lurked for 2 weeks before I had enough guts to create an account. Please help me understand which part you think is BS. TYVMIA.

            It's not proven that there are two Andrew Klines. It is just proven that there are three registered lawyers with that name, one of them is involved in human trafficking, and the other is involved in real estate. We don't know if one is using a fake name, pseudonym, etc.

            Saudi Arabia is the number 2 foreign donor to the CF. So either you believe that SA is deeply involved in CF corruption, or you believe that Saudi Arabia really, really cares about getting HIV vaccines to Africa. Give me a fucking break.

             I don't have kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             I understand that you find the concept of private delivering boxed babies to be tin foil absurd, at least on the surface. I do too. But try to remember that this entire forum is dedicated to researching a child trafficking ring. If you're trafficking children, you're already committing evil on the level of Hitler. It's not that far to progress toward delivering them by private mail.
            </p>
            <p>
             The beauty of the explanation is that it explains the bizarre Herb email quoted above.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for Bethlehem Steel, someone else pointed out that it is involved in shipping and has a giant ton of CF people associated/running it. It was burning hours after the election. Could it be evidence destruction? Sure. Maybe. We don't really have any way to know right now. It was reported that it had serious fires earlier in the year too, which makes me less suspicious.
            </p>
            <p>
             Honestly, after FBIanon, pizza gate, and the Sandy Hook videos (sloppy sniper) I don't know what to believe any more.

              Well, I won't bother you about Hitler just yet, then.  ;-)  There is indeed a mind-blowing amount of bullshit that we've been fed, for a long, long time.  This is the first time we're seeing a semi-effective mass rebellion against our "elite" and their gatekeeping media mesmerizers.  They're pushing back hard, but it's a really sloppy push.
             </p>
             <p>
              I actually don't know what to think about the baby delivery idea.  It's pretty crazy, but then, so is raping and eating them.  &gt;:-(

            They ship via Wash-DC via AIRPLANE private saudi owned airlines, they fly the cargo in a diplomatic pouch, which means no inspections.

            next to besta-pizza is a drug store where they can get knock-out drugs, its only 8 hours flight DC to Mediterranean;

            A snuff-film is worth $250K, a live baby that is blue-eyed blond is worth a million USD, some children are sold 100's of times, a wife for a day, $10k/day,
           </p>
           <p>
            These kids fetch ONE MILLION USD they must arrive quick and in perfect condition, use your fucking common sense people.

              Most of the Saudis all have diplomatic immunity, that means they can drive their car without search right up to the airplane and board, with all their 'dog kennels' or coffins or anything they wish.
             </p>
             <p>
              Been this way forever, and USA-GOV has police to arrest anybody who objects.
             </p>
             <p>
              Remember its the USA-GOV that is sending children to SAUDI to be fucked.
