            I agree. We must stop their gaslighting and manipulation. Their exposure weakens them . Thats why they go crazy with their feeble attempts at self 
preservation.

            This hunter Thompson reporter guy that they suicided supposedly had ties to Stanley kubric and Paul bonacci.  This is one serious rabbit hole.  One of their other ties had family in the occult involved in paedophelia that wrote a book titled "rabbit hole"

            Fear is an illusion.  If you delve into fear in your body and feel the sensations of it, accept them, welcome them even, it will start to dissolve.  Fear is an overwhelming sensation produced usually by a thought (thoughts like;"this is good and that is bad".  The constant distraction that people keep feeding does not allow for space in the mind, therefore, the anxiety, fear, thoughts of not being good enough swirl around as truth.  An never-ending cycle of samsara.

            It's made me realise that if the world's people were left to their own devices, without the intrusion of the Satanists, we'd probably all be living in peace.  I agree with you.  I just don't understand their objective.

            It definitely seems that way...I keep wondering if I'm losing my mind or is this really happening?  I think once you start to reexamine reality through the lens of Pizzagate, everything you thought you knew becomes distorted.

            Yes!!!!!!!!  Our power is unfathomable,(but it doesn't belong to us personally).  That is why they do this horrendous stuff to little kids because they can't fight back.  They have to get people to join their club and sign in blood, promising them all the riches and power. (Just look at the pathetic music industry....omg) 
I firmly believe that you cannot go against the light, God, the Tao, whatever you call it, it just won't end well.  Trust.  Have faith, stay aware and act when it's called for.

            Actually, my take is that they are creating a society of people who will not fight back.  Make people as feminine as they can. Make pedophilia normal, make people so confused that they don't even know if they are men or women.  Men are being feminized....look at the pm of Canada.  Eventually, there will be no one to fight back.
I do agree that the degenerate elites (they really don't deserve the elite title) are the problem.  Definitely.  They are called i l l u m i n a t i s

            They are purposefully bringing drugs in.  They want people addicted not fulfilling their potential or completely broke on the streets dying and killing.  The left is too stupid to realize this.  zombie lunatics.  Ashley Judd- she seemed more insane than madonna!  Perfect example of a zombie lunatic.  Scarlett Johansson was on the cusp.  It seemed as if she felt peer pressured.  Hopefully she will wake up.  If she doesn't, she will end up completely nuts like the rest of them

            Yes.  Supposedly we are not considered beings of consciousness.  They are conscious and we are not.  Well.......not anymore!  I've been quite conscious for the past 10 years and more so now that pizzagate has been brought to light.

            Yes they are obviously very sick but the important thing to realize is they believe they are getting power from causing trauma and doing ritual occult ceremony. It doesn't matter if we believe in demons or not or if indeed it evens works or not because these satanists are abusing and killing children because they believe in it. This stuff is happening and people need to be arrested for it.

             I hope all you retards are just religious wingnuts and no CO-INTEL. What is so hard to understand about the scientific link to stem cells and young blood containing tools to either extend or research the extension of life? All this occult bs is for the feebs they indoctrinate who have yet to figure out they're about to be blackmailed for life. You're a disservice to the actual investigation. I would downvote this post if i could.

These elite luciferians believe in what they are doing and they are trying to take over the world.  Im not religious but all this stuff is strengthening my resolve.

              I think you need to do a bit more research. Check this out for a better understanding of what drives these nutters. Its not just blackmail and stem cells.

              And btw I am not religious, I am an atheist and just as surprised as anyone to find out there is actually a church of satan and people who would be into this wretched stuff. 
The ritual abuse of children is much worse than everyday pedophilia it is absolutely inhuman and needs to be stopped. There are numerous testimonies from victims. Try reading about the Franklin cover up, Fiona Barnett, the Detreux case or Cathy Obrien. Your heart will break when you read what these people endured as children.

            It is shocking to believe but this does happen as we know. Psychological warfare is happening yes. But if you can recognize the patterns and start to see that several motives are behind all of it. They are the puppet masters. Blackmail/Trauma/MK ULTRA training all under the cover of justification for N. Sec. 
At the same time this is spiritual. Not believing does not make this go away. It can be helpful to see clearer if you search for the possibility a spiritual dimension is in play. They clearly do.

            Ultimately you lose control and have a traumitized society. And Silent Witnesses!!There might be many trapped in a moral crisis longing for truth!

            If you read up on NWO theories, both new and ancient final day ones, we're looking at a totalitarian one world government that'll probably mask their flavor of communism as socialism with mandatory labor assignments (this is already happening in western Europe), led by the antichrist who will be the messiah to the jewish people, which makes sense given their ever tightening control of world finances and politics.

            9-11 was an occult ritual: the unveiling and impregnation of Isis. Check out the tarot card with the High Priestess:

            </a>
            ... The High Priestess represents the magical dual nature of the Female Goddess. She has an earthly form, but deep inside her, something magical can manifest: deep within the female, beyond our understanding, the Divine is able to enter Its creation, create a new life, and imbue it with a soul. This is what this card is all about: the most divine and most mysterious aspect of creation, and how it is hidden behind the veil, held up by the two pillars.
           </p>
           <p>
            Masonic temples are laid out according to this principle. The aspiring magician must first fully understand what he is getting in touch with behind the veil. Only when Isis is unveiled does she become a true magical conduit by which the magician can try to get in touch with the highest powers in the hope to have his intent manifested in the flesh.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is what happened on 9-11. Is was a most evil and vile occult ritual. Because when the Twin Towers fell, Isis was unveiled and impregnated with evil intent and empowered by the despair of thousands of freshly harvested souls. Google "Statue of Liberty Isis" and you can spend the next year reading about the many ways in which the Statue of Liberty is actually an occult representation of Isis.

            But there is more: did you know that the Statue of Liberty is pointed straight at the Ka'ba in Mecca?

           </p>
           <p>
            And that in front of the Twin Towers there used to be a slowly rotating spherical statue called the Great Spherical Caryatid that was intended by the artist to mimic the crowds circling the Ka'ba in Mecca? Doesn't it also look like some dark creature about to hatch from an egg?
           </p>

           <p>
            The word "caryatid" means "replacement pillar". This theme strongly resonates with the myth of Osiris, who was cut into 14 pieces, and was resurrected by his wife Isis. The 14th piece, his penis, was replaced by a penis made of gold. Osiris is now sublime. He has passed the veil, and his magical wand is now ready to impregnate his wife. So here we have a "golden replacement penis"; a magician's wand, ready to cast a spell. What kind of spell? Again, I remind you, the Sphere rotated slowly to mimic the procession in Mecca:
           </p>

             http://images.wisegeek.com/pilgrims-gathered-around-kaaba.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a similar theme at work here. The Ka'ba, black cube (representing Saturn/Satan; look it up), is surrounded by all these men. Doesn't that remind you of semen circling an egg? The "offering temple" of 9-11 was intentionally magickally linked to Islam, and through the Caryatid/Ka'ba link, 1.500 years of built-up hatred for females was poured into the mix.
            <em>
             The female aspect of creation was forced to give birth to her own worst enemy.
            </em>
           </p>
           <p>
            It is any wonder that Isis was "born" in the Middle East a few years later? Ever wondered WHY Hillary Clinton riding her WW3-agenda just
            <strong>
             had
            </strong>
            to be president? Because the boyfuckers at the top of the pyramid set it up that the end of mankind would be brought about by
            <strong>
             a woman
            </strong>
            . It would be the final defeat of their biggest enemy: the Goddess.

            I have come to the belief that most homosexuality is from the occasional errors that occur in the DNA as it is splitting and the male / female expressions are slightly off.  I think getting genders is a pretty fancy DNA trick that is complicated.  And the show goes wrong at a statistical rate that can be estimated at 1-2 percent of the male population.  I think female homosexuality has less evidence of being genetic.  I think more women that go lesbian have been sexually abused than the Gay Rights crowd wants to admit.

            Second point is programming susceptibility and amount of time spent in front of the television.  Not to mention subliminal advertising.  Don't forget, they banned subliminal messaging in television back in the early 70's I think.  It was too effective.  What could have been so effective as to make the government of the seventies ban something which sounds stupid today?  Something which worked.  Do you think the government and corporate world let that trick go to waste?  And it plays all into MK programming.  Let's not forget about "complicated displays of art" (para)

            Wow. It's so refreshing to hear you speak. Spot on. Monday - Friday.. more illusions to keep the mind moving.. Time itself reduced to numbers on a clock.. more illusions.. Linear.. this thought.. then this thought.. then this thought... no break in the pattern created in the mind. In real time (circular)... the thoughts come and go and morph and change.. and you are the one watching them all from your awareness.. they do not take over your mind. Fuck.. this is getting to much for where people are at right now with consciousness.. any more and I might just disappear back into the oneness of the universe haha :)

             The point is they believe in this satanic crap. Not us. We can gain an insight into their motivations by looking into this stuff. For example investigate why so many Freemasons do child satanic abuse.

            they want to divide us I can see some people here are already racist and have fallen to the first part. the family unit is what they are after they wish to divide the family and then divide us all into groups. all of this is happening. we must stick together and not let our enemy so easily persuade hate into our hearts. come on.

            What is this crap? Seriously this is the kind of thing that will get us all discredited. Stick to the fact and real world please. At least if you want to investigate this, put it on another sub, And all this talk about homosexuality being degeneracy and how they were raped. Careful what you say here. And seriously, they're creating a portal? This is tinfoil conspiracy. How can you even believe this? At least keep a doubt. We should always doubt theories, the same way we doubt the MSM and choose not to believe them.
Just my opinion. (I know my account was created litterally a minute ago, I did it for the sole purpose of saying this because i've been following this since Day 1 but it's the first time i see something like that.)

             So you think they're just raping kids and apparently babies as well (those munching on stacks of currency) for entertainment and blackmail or is there more to it? How about the #killroom ? Just sadistic fun?

             High level participation in satanic rituals is more or less proven, in the Dutroux affair as well:

            Yes I think they are. Check out the opening ceremony of the Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland near CERN, last year which was attended by some of Europes most well-known leaders, such as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Francois Hollande of France and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, where the most bizarre and shocking occult rituals were openly performed.

             yeah I remember seeing this tunnel. it is so obviously a ritual done right in our faces. its creepy and shows the workers who actually died while building the bridge then shows bugs in the same place shortly after. almost like the human race are just insects in which to produce and to continue to conform and build and not ask any questions.

            I've been looking for a post to put all this info about Hellfire and Demons into. This seems like the place.
           </p>
           <p>
            While I do not believe in hell, or hellfire, because Jesus did not teach it as a real thing, I do believe they are in contact with real demons. Especially since they claim to worship Molech (Moloch). There is nothing lower, or more Satanic than the sexual abuse and murder of children.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Even if you are not a Christian, you cannot refute the biblical evidence from the Bible. Look at it as a history book. If more preachers and ministers did that, there would be a lot less people trying to refute it altogether. Instead they coat the bible in mystery and paint God himself as a mystery when in fact he is not, as you will see.
            </strong>

            SOME who believe the doctrine of hellfire point to Jesus’ words recorded at Mark 9:48 (or verses 44, 46). He mentioned worms (or maggots) that do not die and fire that is not quenched. If someone asked you about those words, how would you respond?
           </p>
           <p>
            Depending on the Bible version being used, the person might read verse 44, 46, or 48 because these verses read similarly in some versions.* The New World Translation reads: “If your eye makes you stumble, throw it away; it is finer for you to enter one-eyed into the kingdom of God than with two eyes to be pitched into Gehenna, where their maggot does not die and the fire is not put out.”—Mark 9:47, 48.
           </p>
           <p>
            In any case, some claim that Jesus’ statement supports the view that after death the souls of the wicked suffer forever. For instance, a comment in the Spanish Sagrada Biblia of the University of Navarre says: “Our Lord uses [these words] to refer to the torments of hell. Often ‘the worm that does not die’ is explained as the eternal remorse felt by those in hell; and the ‘fire which is not quenched,’ as their physical pain.”
           </p>
           <p>
            However, compare Jesus’ words with the final verse of Isaiah’s prophecy.* Is it not apparent that Jesus was alluding to the text in Isaiah chapter 66? The prophet there apparently refers to going out “of Jerusalem to the surrounding Hinnom Valley (Gehenna), where human sacrifice was once practiced (Jer 7:31) and which eventually became the city’s refuse heap.” (The Jerome Biblical Commentary) The symbolism at Isaiah 66:24 clearly is not that of people being tortured; it speaks of carcasses. What it refers to as not dying is worms—not live humans or immortal souls. What, then, is the import of Jesus’ words?
           </p>
           <p>
            Note the comment on Mark 9:48 in the Catholic work El evangelio de Marcos. Análisis lingüístico y comentario exegético, Volume II: “[The] phrase is taken from Isaiah (66,24). There the prophet shows the two ways corpses were usually destroyed: putrefaction and incineration . . . The juxtaposition in the text of maggots and fire reinforces the idea of destruction. . . . Both destructive forces are described as permanent (‘is not quenched, does not die’): there is simply no way to escape them. In this image, the only survivors are the maggot and the fire—not man—and they both annihilate anything that falls within their power. Hence, this is not a description of everlasting torment, but one of total destruction which, as it prevents resurrection from occurring, is tantamount to final death. [Fire] is, then, a symbol of annihilation.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone who knows that the true God is loving and just should be able to see how reasonable it is to understand Jesus’ words in that way. He was not saying that the wicked will experience everlasting torment. Rather, they are at risk of total destruction that prevents resurrection from occurring.

            The most reliable Bible manuscripts do not include verses 44 and 46. Scholars acknowledge that those two verses were likely later additions. Professor Archibald T. Robertson writes: “The oldest and best manuscripts do not give these two verses. They came in from the Western and Syrian (Byzantine) classes. They are a mere repetition of verse 48. Hence we [omit] the numbering 44 and 46 in our verses which are not genuine.”

              You are interpreting Romans 3:7 as what that scripture says by itself without viewing the surrounding scriptures. It's same as people interpreting Jesus saying "If you are to be my follower you will drink my blood and eat my flesh." He was speaking symbolically.
             </p>
             <p>
              That scripture is speaking in contrast to man’s sinfulness. The degraded practices of non-Jews(at that time period) and the disobedience of the Jews to God’s law in no way brought harm to the Creator personally. Instead, his truthfulness, holiness, and righteousness stood out in sharp contrast, and this to his glory. But the fact that man’s wrongdoing makes God’s righteousness stand out in even greater prominence provides no basis for claiming that God is unjust in executing an adverse judgment against wrongdoers. Being a creation of God, a person has no right to harm himself by sinning.
             </p>
             <p>
              The above is the argument that Paul used in his letter to the Romans, saying: “If our unrighteousness brings God’s righteousness to the fore, what shall we say? God is not unjust when he vents his wrath, is he? (I am speaking as a man does.) Never may that happen! How, otherwise, will God judge the world? Yet if by reason of my lie #
              <strong>
               [compare Ps 62:9]
              </strong>
              the truth of God has been made more prominent to his glory, why am I also yet being judged as a sinner? And why not say, just as it is falsely charged to us and just as some men state that we say: ‘Let us do the bad things that the good things may come’? The judgment against those men is in harmony with justice.” (Ro 3:5-8) God has delivered his people, not for a course of sin, but for a life of righteousness, that they may glorify Him. The apostle says later in his letter: “Neither go on presenting your members to sin as weapons of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead, also your members to God as weapons of righteousness.”—Ro 6:12, 13.

(Isa 40:12, 15) Scales were sometimes used to represent accurate measurement in judgment.—Job 31:6; Da 5:27.

               No I'm not. There are several cases of Paul lying in the Bible: his lie to the Sanhedrin  about the reason he was brought before them, his lie to the Galatians about the four points from the Council of Jerusalem, and most notably his lie to King Agrippa about his appointment as an apostle on the road to Damascus.

               The symbolic reference to blood drinking should raise red flags since it is forbidden to drink blood in Judaism. The Synoptic Problem is one hint that the gospels have been redacted, the divergence between the Christian new covenant and the new covenant of Jeremiah 31:33 is another.

               When Paul speaks of "my lie" he is arguing that the ends justify the means, i.e. that he should not be judged as a sinner for serving a divine purpose. This argument is used to refute the allegation that he advocated doing evil, i.e. it is Paul's contention that it is not evil to lie for the greater good.

                  Regarding Paul Lying
                 </em>
                </strong>
                (Acts 26:1-28) Paul was not lying about Jesus appearing before him on the road to Damascus. In the book of Acts, Greek terms for persuasion are repeatedly used in association with Paul. The words of Festus indicate that Paul faced trumped-up charges of sedition—a crime that carried the death penalty. (Acts 25:11) However, Paul was innocent. The charges stemmed from the jealousy of religious leaders in Jerusalem. They opposed Paul’s work as a Kingdom proclaimer and deeply resented that he helped others to become followers of Jesus Christ. Under heavy guard, Paul was brought from Jerusalem to the seaport city of Caesarea, where he appealed to Caesar. From there he would be taken to Rome.
Imagine Paul in the governor’s palace before a group that includes the ruler of an important part of the Roman Empire. King Agrippa turns to Paul and says: “You are permitted to speak.” As words flow from Paul’s mouth, an extraordinary thing happens. What Paul says begins to affect the king. Indeed, King Agrippa says: “In a short time you would persuade me to become a Christian.”—Acts 26:1-28. &lt;--- Read this. 
Just think! As a result of Paul’s skillful defense, a ruler was affected by the penetrating power of God’s Word. (Hebrews 4:12) What was it about Paul’s defense that was so effective? And what can we learn from Paul that can help us in our disciple-making work? If we analyze his defense, two main elements clearly stand out: (1) Paul was persuasive in his presentation. (2) He employed his knowledge of God’s Word skillfully, even as an artisan uses a tool effectively.

                  Regarding the New Covenant
                 </em>
                </strong>
                : Well, this law is also called “the law of the Christ.” It was first given to spiritual Israelites (a symbolic term), those in the new covenant. (Gal. 6:2; Rom. 2:28, 29) You could sum up “the law of the Christ” in one word: love. (Matt. 22:36-39) How do those of the anointed get this law written in their heart? Key ways are by their studying God’s Word and approaching Jehovah in prayer. Accordingly, those aspects of true worship should be regular features of the lives of all true Christians, even those who are not in the new covenant but who want to benefit from it. (Which is everlasting life on a perfect Earth and NOT a heavenly hope) Luke 23:43 - Isaiah 65:21-25
“The law of the Christ” is referred to as “the perfect law that belongs to freedom” and “the law of a free people.” (Jas. 1:25; 2:12) Many were born under the Mosaic Law, but no one is born into the new covenant or under the law of the Christ. None who become obedient to the law of the Christ are coerced into serving God. Rather, they are delighted to know that God’s law can be written in hearts and that lasting benefits of the covenant that Jeremiah foretold are available to humans today.
                <strong>
                 How is God’s law written in hearts? When a person loves God’s law so much that he has a fervent desire to do Jehovah’s will, it can be said that God’s law is written in his heart.

                </strong>
                However, the people take exception to Jesus’ words. “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” they ask. (John 6:52) Jesus wants them to understand that he means this figuratively, not literally. What he adds shows this to be his meaning.
“Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life, . . . for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. Whoever feeds on my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me.”—John 6:53-56.
They might think that Jesus is suggesting cannibalism or a violation of God’s law against consuming blood. (Genesis 9:4; Leviticus 17:10, 11) But Jesus is not referring to eating flesh or drinking blood literally. He is showing that all who want everlasting life must exercise faith in the sacrifice that he is to make when he offers up his perfect human body and pours out his lifeblood. Yet, even many of his disciples do not understand this teaching. Some react: “This speech is shocking; who can listen to it?”—John 6:60.
Because Jesus realizes that some of his disciples are murmuring, he asks: “Does this stumble you? What, therefore, if you should see the Son of man ascending to where he was before? . . . The sayings that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. But there are some of you who do not believe.” With that, many disciples leave and no longer follow him.—John 6:61-64.
So Jesus addresses his 12 apostles with the question: “You do not want to go also, do you?” Peter responds: “Lord, whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life. We have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.” (John 6:67-69)

                 Straw man. The issue is that Paul lied about being appointed as a witness on the road to Damascus.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Well, this law is also called “the law of the Christ.”
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 Paul's summary (Galatians 5:14) omits the most important part of Matthew 22:36-39.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  He is showing that all who want everlasting life must exercise faith in the sacrifice that he is to make when he offers up his perfect human body and pours out his lifeblood.
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 The central doctrine of the Pauline death cult isn't supported by the prophetic references to the crucifixion (Isaiah 53, Psalm 22 &amp; 69) or by the deprecation of blood sacrifice by the prophets. Saturnalia is a much better fit for the myth of the father killing the son in relation to the eating of flesh than Judaism is.

                  How is this in anyway a contradiction, or omitting what is stated in Matthew about loving your neighbor as yourself? He says the second commandment, which is "like it", or "like the first commandment."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And I am in complete agreement as to what you last said about the Pauline Death Cult and the Crucifixion. Let me elaborate. First touching on the Crucifixion.
“THE cross,” says one encyclopedia, “is the most familiar symbol of Christianity.” Many religious paintings and works of art depict Jesus nailed to a cross. Why is this symbol so widespread in Christendom? Did Jesus really die on a cross?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Many would point to the Bible for the answer. For example, according to the King James Version, at the time of Jesus’ execution, onlookers made fun of Jesus and challenged him to “come down from the cross.” (Matthew 27:40, 42) Many other Bible translations read similarly. Today’s English Version says of Simon from Cyrene: “The soldiers forced him to carry Jesus’ cross.” (Mark 15:21) In these verses, the word “cross” is translated from the Greek word staurosʹ. Is there a solid basis for such a translation? What is the meaning of that original word?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Was It a Cross?
                  </strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  According to Greek scholar W. E. Vine, staurosʹ “denotes, primarily, an upright pale or stake. On such malefactors were nailed for execution. Both the noun and the verb stauroō, to fasten to a stake or pale, are originally to be distinguished from the ecclesiastical form of a two beamed cross.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The Imperial Bible-Dictionary says that the word staurosʹ “properly signified a stake, an upright pole, or piece of paling, on which anything might be hung, or which might be used in impaling a piece of ground.” The dictionary continues: “Even amongst the Romans the crux (Latin, from which our cross is derived) appears to have been originally an upright pole.” Thus, it is not surprising that The Catholic Encyclopedia states: “Certain it is, at any rate, that the cross originally consisted of a simple vertical pole, sharpened at its upper end.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There is another Greek word, xyʹlon, that Bible writers used to describe the instrument of Jesus’ execution. A Critical Lexicon and Concordance to the English and Greek New Testament defines xyʹlon as “a piece of timber, a wooden stake.” It goes on to say that like staurosʹ, xyʹlon “was simply an upright pale or stake to which the Romans nailed those who were thus said to be crucified.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In line with this, we note that the King James Version reads at Acts 5:30: “The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree [xyʹlon].” Other versions, though rendering staurosʹ as “cross,” also translate xyʹlon as “tree.” At Acts 13:29, The Jerusalem Bible says of Jesus: “When they had carried out everything that scripture foretells about him they took him down from the tree [xyʹlon] and buried him.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In view of the basic meaning of the Greek words staurosʹ and xyʹlon, the Critical Lexicon and Concordance, quoted above, observes: “Both words disagree with the modern idea of a cross, with which we have become familiarised by pictures.” In other words, what the Gospel writers described using the word staurosʹ was nothing like what people today call a cross. Appropriately, therefore, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures uses the expression “torture stake” at Matthew 27:40-42 and in other places where the word staurosʹ appears. Similarly, the Complete Jewish Bible uses the expression “execution stake.”
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <strong>
                   Origin of the Cross
                  </strong>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  If the Bible does not really say that Jesus was executed on a cross, then why do all the churches that claim to teach and follow the Bible—Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox—adorn their buildings with the cross and use it as a symbol of their faith? How did the cross come to be such a popular symbol?
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The answer is that the cross is venerated not only by churchgoers who claim to follow the Bible but also by people far removed from the Bible and whose worship far predates that of “Christian” churches. Numerous religious reference works acknowledge that the use of crosses in various shapes and forms goes back to remote periods of human civilization. For example, ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and depictions of their gods and goddesses often show a cross in the shape of a T with a circle at the top. It is called the ansate, or handle-shaped, cross and is thought to be a symbol of life. In time, this form of the cross was adopted and used extensively by the Coptic Church and others.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  According to The Catholic Encyclopedia, “the primitive form of the cross seems to have been that of the so-called ‘gamma’ cross (crux gammata), better known to Orientalists and students of prehistoric archæology by its Sanskrit name, swastika.” This sign was widely used among Hindus in India and Buddhists throughout Asia and is still seen in decorations and ornaments in those areas.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is not known exactly when the cross was adopted as a “Christian” symbol. Vine’s Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words states: “By the middle of the 3rd cent. A.D. the churches had either departed from, or had travestied, certain doctrines of the Christian faith. In order to increase the prestige of the apostate ecclesiastical system pagans were received into the churches apart from regeneration by faith, and were permitted largely to retain their pagan signs and symbols,” including the cross.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Some writers point to the claim by the sun-god worshipper Constantine that in 312 C.E., while on one of his military campaigns, he had a vision of a cross superimposed on the sun along with the motto in Latin “in hoc vince” (by this conquer). Some time later, a “Christian” sign was emblazoned on the standards, shields, and armor of his army. (Pictured at left.) Constantine purportedly converted to Christianity, though he was not baptized until 25 years later on his deathbed. His motive was questioned by some. “He acted rather as if he were converting Christianity into what he thought most likely to be accepted by his subjects as a catholic [universal] religion, than as if he had been converted to the teachings of Jesus the Nazarene,” says the book The Non-Christian Cross.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Since then, crosses of many forms and shapes have come into use. For example, The Illustrated Bible Dictionary tells us that what is called St. Anthony’s cross “was shaped like a capital T, thought by some to be derived from the symbol of the [Babylonian] god Tammuz, the letter tau.” There was also the St. Andrew’s cross, which is in the shape of the letter X, and the familiar two-beamed cross with the crossbar lowered. This latter type, called the Latin cross, is erroneously “held by tradition to be the shape of the cross on which our Lord died.”

                   Except that you previously diverted to an irrelevancy rather than address the actual issue. Luke's account (Acts 9) and Paul's first account (Acts 22) do not mention him being appointed as an apostle, but rather that he was told to go to Damascus for instructions on what to do, which is inconsistent with his account to King Agrippa (Acts 26).

                    Please, elaborate how Paul's summary of the law relates to love of deity or a false idols? He's saying love your neighbor as yourself. The apostle Paul said: “He that loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.” He then names some of the commandments of the Law and concludes: “and whatever other commandment there is, is summed up in this word, namely, ‘You must love your neighbor [ple·siʹon] as yourself.’ Love does not work evil to one’s neighbor [ple·siʹon]; therefore love is the law’s fulfillment.” (Ro 13:8-10; compare Ga 5:14.) James calls the command to love one’s neighbor as oneself “the kingly law.”—Jas 2:8. 
So far, all I am able to decipher from you accusations is that Paul is lying because he is retelling his account of Jesus confronting him about his persecuting of Christians who believe in Jesus. Paul was Saul. After his anointing by Jesus on the road to Damascus and to get baptized and repent he became Paul. Just for reference, here is Acts 22:
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    “Men, brothers and fathers, hear my defense to you now.”+ 2 Well, when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they kept all the more silent, and he said: 3 “I am a Jew,+ born in Tarsus of Ci·liʹcia,+ but educated in this city at the feet of Ga·maʹli·el,+ instructed according to the strictness of the ancestral Law,+ and zealous for God just as all of you are this day.+ 4 I persecuted this Way to the point of death, binding and handing over to prisons both men and women,+ 5 as the high priest and all the assembly of elders can bear witness. From them I also obtained letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to bring those who were there in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.
6 “But as I was traveling and getting near to Damascus, about midday, suddenly out of heaven a great light flashed all around me,+ 7 and I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me: ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’ 8 I answered: ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me: ‘I am Jesus the Naz·a·reneʹ, whom you are persecuting.’ 9 Now the men who were with me did see the light, but they did not hear the voice of the one speaking to me. 10 At that I said: ‘What should I do, Lord?’ The Lord said to me: ‘Rise, go into Damascus, and there you will be told about everything it is appointed for you to do.’+ 11 But since I could not see anything because of the glory of that light, I arrived in Damascus led by the hand of those who were with me.
12 “Then a man named An·a·niʹas, a devout man according to the Law, well-reported-on by all the Jews living there, 13 came to me. He stood by me and said to me: ‘Saul, brother, regain your sight!’ And that very moment I looked up and saw him.+ 14 He said: ‘The God of our forefathers has chosen you to come to know his will and to see the righteous one+ and to hear the voice of his mouth, 15 because you are to be a witness for him to all men of the things you have seen and heard.+ 16 And now why are you delaying? Rise, get baptized, and wash your sins+ away by your calling on his name.’+
17 “But when I had returned to Jerusalem+ and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance 18 and saw him saying to me: ‘Hurry up and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your witness concerning me.’+ 19 And I said: ‘Lord, they themselves well know that I used to imprison and flog in one synagogue after another those believing in you;+ 20 and when the blood of Stephen your witness was being spilled, I was standing by and approving and guarding the outer garments of those doing away with him.’+ 21 And yet he said to me: ‘Go, because I will send you out to nations far away.’”+
22 Now they kept listening to him down to this word. Then they raised their voices, saying: “Take such a man away from the earth, for he is not fit to live!” 23 Because they were crying out, throwing their outer garments about, and tossing dust into the air,+ 24 the military commander ordered Paul to be brought into the soldiers’ quarters and said that he should be interrogated under scourging, so that he could learn exactly why they were shouting against Paul this way. 25 But when they had stretched him out for the whipping, Paul said to the army officer standing there: “Is it lawful for you to scourge a Roman* who has not been condemned?”*+ 26 Well, when the army officer heard this, he went to the military commander and reported it, saying: “What are you intending to do? For this man is a Roman.” 27 So the military commander approached and said to him: “Tell me, are you a Roman?” He said: “Yes.” 28 The military commander responded: “I purchased these rights as a citizen for a large sum of money.” Paul said: “But I have them by birth.”+
29 Immediately, therefore, the men who were about to interrogate him under torture backed away from him; and the military commander became afraid when he realized that he was a Roman and that he had bound him in chains.+
30 So the next day, because he wanted to know for sure just why he was being accused by the Jews, he released him and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanʹhe·drin to assemble. He then brought Paul down and had him stand among them.+

                     It doesn't, that's the whole point. Paul's summary omits the greatest commandment of your text of the summary in Matthew:

                     Paul's summary is limited to the second commandment of Matthew 22:39.

                      This will be last reply regarding the Apostle Paul lying and contradicting himself. I have looked up all of your references trying to prove Paul is lying and it's just not so. The reason is this:

                       <p>
                        Paul was saying the second part of the law about brotherly love to show that without brotherly love, you cannot have love for God. The two go hand in hand. He was speaking to people of the congregation of that time. And his words go hand in hand with
                        <strong>
                         1 John 4:20, 21
                        </strong>
                        ** which says: "
                        <strong>
                         20
                        </strong>
                        ** If anyone says, “I love God,” and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar. For the one who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.
                        <strong>
                         21
                        </strong>
                        ** And we have this commandment from him, that whoever loves God must also love his brother."
You may have knowledge about scriptures, but knowledge is different from understanding and wisdom. Knowledge is seeing the bus coming at you when you're standing in the road. Do you have the understanding to know that if you don't move it's going to hit you? And wisdom is getting out of the way. Rather than accuse Paul of lying, why not try to understand why he said it, or worded it the way he did.

                        The Bible has no contradictions. If there was contradiction this would make God himself a liar. Numbers 23:19 - "God is not a mere man who tells lies, Nor a son of man who changes his mind. When he says something, will he not do it? When he speaks, will he not carry it out?"
Hebrews 6:18 - "in order that through two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to the refuge may have strong encouragement to take firm hold of the hope set before us."

                     </ol>
                     <p>
                      Here is one lie that Religions teach about God: He is part of a Trinity. God's name is Jehovah, or Yahweh (Hebrew: YHWH). His son, who was the first born of all creation is named Jesus. His heavenly name is Michael. The Holy spirit is God's active force that he uses to accomplish his will. All this truth can be found in the bible.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      You know who told me once that the bible contradicted itself? A Catholic Priest when I was 16 years old. Since I know all the truths about Catholicism and their religion based on pagan tradition, as do you, I can prove to myself and have that the bible does not contradict itself. I have tried. I don't accuse it's words, I try to understand them.

                    What First-Century Christians Believed
                   </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The Bible shows that in the first century, many who heard Jesus became believers and accepted the redeeming value of his sacrificial death. After the apostle Paul preached to the Jews in Corinth, proving that Jesus is the Christ, says the Bible, “Crispus the presiding officer of the synagogue became a believer in the Lord, and so did all his household. And many of the Corinthians that heard began to believe and be baptized.” (Acts 18:5-8) Instead of introducing some religious symbol or image into their worship, Paul instructed his fellow Christians to “flee from idolatry” and from any other practice drawn from pagan worship.—1 Corinthians 10:14.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Historians and researchers have found no evidence to validate the use of the cross among the early Christians. Interestingly, the book History of the Cross quotes one late 17th-century writer who asked: “Can it be pleasing to the blessed Jesus to behold His disciples glorying in the image of that instrument of capital punishment on which He [supposedly] patiently and innocently suffered, despising the shame?” How would you answer?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Worship acceptable to God does not require objects or images. “What agreement does God’s temple have with idols?” Paul asked. (2 Corinthians 6:14-16) Nowhere do the Scriptures suggest that a Christian’s worship should include the use of a likeness of the instrument used to impale Jesus.—Compare Matthew 15:3; Mark 7:13.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   What, then, is the identifying mark of true Christians? Not the cross or any other symbol, but love. Jesus told his followers: “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”—John 13:34, 35.
                  </p>

                   Point: Catholicism is not True Christianity. It's what Revelation describes as Babylon the Great. A symbolic verbiage that represents the World Empire of False Religion. I think that very well shows just by investigating Pizzagate and seeing the Catholic Church's involvement. Not to mention they're support in Nazi Germany back in the 30's and 40's as well as the $4 Billion Dollars in child abuse lawsuits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So on this subject with Catholicism and the Crucifixion, I am in agreement. Christmas itself is based off of Saturnalia. Which is why I never have and never will celebrate the false religious custom.

               I completely understand the term you are using in reference here. Jonah himself in the bible, when he was swallowed by, what was most likely a whale shark, said he was in "hell." In the original text it says Sheol. Which is the same as Hades, the common grave of man. So yes, some of these kids are most definitely living in a hell. It's really, truly awful.

              If there are any doubts regarding this research, everything is backed up by the biblical versus they come from.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             (Job 38:7) We need to know where the angels came from. Colossians 1:16 tells us that after Jehovah created Jesus, “all other things were created in the heavens and on the earth.” That includes the angels. How many of them were created? The Bible says that there are hundreds of millions of angels.—Psalm 103:20; Revelation 5:11.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Bible also teaches us that Jehovah created the angels before he created the earth. How did they feel when they saw the earth? The book of Job tells us that they were joyful. They were a close family serving Jehovah together.—Job 38:4-7.
            </p>
            <p>
             Angels have always been interested in humans and in Jehovah’s purpose for the earth and humans. (Proverbs 8:30, 31; 1 Peter 1:11, 12) It must have made them very sad when Adam and Eve rebelled. They must be even sadder now to see that most humans have disobeyed Jehovah. But when someone repents and returns to God, the angels are joyful. (Luke 15:10) The angels are very interested in those who serve God. Jehovah uses angels to help and protect his servants on earth. (Hebrews 1:7, 14) Let us look at some examples of this.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jehovah sent two angels to help Lot and his family escape the destruction of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. (Genesis 19:15, 16) Hundreds of years later, the prophet Daniel was thrown into a lions’ pit, but he was not harmed, because “God sent his angel and shut the mouth of the lions.” (Daniel 6:22) Later, when the apostle Peter was in prison, Jehovah sent an angel to set him free. (Acts 12:6-11) Angels also helped Jesus when he was on earth. For example, after he was baptized, “angels were ministering to him.” (Mark 1:13) Just before Jesus was executed, an angel “strengthened him.”—Luke 22:43.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today, angels no longer appear to humans. But God still uses angels to help his servants. The Bible says: “The angel of Jehovah camps all around those fearing Him, and he rescues them.” (Psalm 34:7) Why do we need protection? Because we have powerful enemies who want to harm us. Who are they? Where do they come from? How are they trying to harm us? To answer those questions, let’s see what happened shortly after Adam and Eve were created.
            </p>
            <p>
             OUR INVISIBLE ENEMIES
            </p>
            <p>
             We learned in Chapter 3 that an angel rebelled against God and wanted to rule over others. The Bible calls him Satan the Devil. (Revelation 12:9) Satan also wanted others to rebel against God. He was able to trick Eve, and since then he has tricked most humans. However, some, such as Abel, Enoch, and Noah, remained faithful to Jehovah.—Hebrews 11:4, 5, 7.
            </p>
            <p>
             In Noah’s time, some angels rebelled and left their home in heaven to live as humans on earth. Why? The Bible tells us that they wanted to have wives. (Read Genesis 6:2.) But it was wrong for angels to do that. (Jude 6) Like those wicked angels, most humans at that time became corrupt and violent. Jehovah then decided to destroy wicked humans by flooding the whole earth. But he saved his faithful servants. (Genesis 7:17, 23) To survive, the wicked angels returned to heaven. The Bible calls those wicked angels demons. They chose to join Satan’s rebellion, and the Devil became their ruler.—Matthew 9:34.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because they were rebels, Jehovah did not accept the demons back into his family. (2 Peter 2:4) Demons cannot change into humans anymore, but they are still “misleading the entire inhabited earth.” (Revelation 12:9; 1 John 5:19) Let us learn how they are able to trick, or mislead, so many.—Read 2 Corinthians 2:11.

              The Bible tells us how to resist the demons and how to break free from them. For example, some in the city of Ephesus were communicating with the demons before they learned the truth. How did they break free? The Bible says: “Quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody.” (Acts 19:19) Because they wanted to be Christians, they destroyed all their books about magic. Similar action is necessary today. Everyone who wants to serve Jehovah needs to get rid of things that have anything to do with the demons. This includes books, magazines, horoscopes, movies, music, games, and even posters that make magic, demons, or the supernatural seem harmless or exciting. It also includes things that people wear to protect themselves from evil.—1 Corinthians 10:21.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some years after those in Ephesus destroyed their books about magic, the apostle Paul wrote that they still had to “struggle” and fight “against the wicked spirit forces.” (Ephesians 6:12) Yes, even though they had already burned their books, the demons were still trying to harm them. So, what else did they need to do? Paul told them: “Take up the large shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish [or, stop] all the wicked one’s burning arrows.” (Ephesians 6:16) Just as a shield protects a soldier in battle, our faith can protect us. If we have absolute confidence that Jehovah can protect us, we will be able to resist Satan and the demons.—Matthew 17:20.
             </p>
             <p>
              How can we make our faith in Jehovah stronger? We need to read the Bible every day and learn to rely on him to protect us. If we have strong confidence in Jehovah, Satan and the demons will not be able to harm us.—1 John 5:5.
             </p>
             <p>
              What else did the Christians in Ephesus need to do? They lived in a city full of demonism. So Paul told them: “Carry on prayer on every occasion.” (Ephesians 6:18) They needed to ask Jehovah for his protection at all times. What about us? We also live in a world that is full of demonism. So we too need to ask Jehovah for his protection, and we need to use his name when we pray. (Read Proverbs 18:10.) If we keep on asking Jehovah to deliver us from Satan, Jehovah will answer our prayers.—Psalm 145:19; Matthew 6:13.
             </p>
             <p>
              If we get rid of everything in our life that has to do with demonism and rely on Jehovah to protect us, we can resist Satan and the demons. We do not need to be afraid of them. (Read James 4:7, 8.) Jehovah is far more powerful than the demons. He punished them in Noah’s day, and in the future he will destroy them. (Jude 6) Remember, we are not alone in our fight. Jehovah is using his angels to protect us. (2 Kings 6:15-17) We can be confident that with Jehovah’s help, we can win our fight against Satan and the demons.—1 Peter 5:6, 7; 2 Peter 2:9.

                HOW DEMONS TRICK PEOPLE
               </em>
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              The demons trick people in many ways. When people contact the demons they do it either directly or through someone else, such as a witch doctor or a psychic. Contact with the demons is called demonism or spiritism. But the Bible commands us to stay far away from anything that has to do with the demons. (Galatians 5:19-21) Why? Just as a hunter uses a trap to catch animals, the demons use tricks to trap and control people.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of their tricks is called divination. That is the use of supernatural powers to try to find out about the future or the unknown. Someone might try to do this by looking at the stars, searching for omens, reading tarot cards, using a crystal ball, or reading the palm of a person’s hand. Many people think that these practices are harmless, but they are not. They are very dangerous. For example, the Bible shows that demons and fortune-tellers work together. At Acts 16:16-18, we read about “a demon of divination” who helped a girl to do “fortune-telling.” After the apostle Paul sent the demon away, the girl lost her ability to foretell the future.
             </p>
             <p>
              The demons use another trick to trap people. They try to make us believe that it’s possible to talk to the dead and that those who have died are actually still alive somewhere and can communicate with us or hurt us. For example, someone whose friend or relative has died may go to a person, such as a spirit medium, who says he or she can talk to the dead. The medium may tell the person something interesting about the dead friend or relative and even imitate the dead person’s voice. (1 Samuel 28:3-19) Many funeral customs are also based on the belief that the dead are still alive somewhere. These may include funeral celebrations, funeral anniversaries, sacrifices for the dead, widowhood rites, or some wake rituals. When Christians refuse to take part in these customs, their families or village communities may criticize them, insult them, or refuse to have anything to do with them. But Christians know that the dead are not alive somewhere else. It’s impossible to communicate with them, and they cannot harm us. (Psalm 115:17) Be very careful. Never try to communicate with the dead or the demons and never get involved in demonic customs.—Read Deuteronomy 18:10, 11; Isaiah 8:19.
             </p>
             <p>
              The demons not only trick people but also frighten them. Today, Satan and his demons know that they have only “a short period of time” before God removes them from the earth, so they are more violent and aggressive than ever. (Revelation 12:12, 17) However, thousands of people who once lived in fear of the demons don’t fear them anymore. How did they break free from their fear of the demons?

                I agree with some of what you said. Except the life after death teaching. This is a false religious teaching, I'll show you in the bible where it proves this to be so. But yes, prayer and faith do keep demons away, however that is not enough. Belief in God is not enough. Faith in God is not enough. Why? Because even the demons have faith in god and that he exists.
               </p>
               <p>
                <strong>
                 <em>
                  James 2:18 "Nevertheless, someone will say: “You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.”
                 </em>
                </strong>
                <strong>
                 <em>
                  James 2:19 "You believe that there is one God, do you? You are doing quite well. And yet the demons believe and shudder."
                 </em>
                </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                Faith is clearly not enough if the demons also have faith and their works are pure evil. They're intelligent spirit creatures who now how mislead humans because they were their from the beginning during our creation.
How can the Devil and his demons mislead, or fool, us?— They can if we are not careful. But we do not need to be afraid. The Great Teacher (Jesus) said: ‘The Devil has no hold on me.’ If we keep close to God, he will protect us from the Devil and his demons.—John 14:30.

                 How do demons affect us?
                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                Just as many people on earth have acted badly by disobeying God, so also in heaven many angels have rebelled against God. (2 Peter 2:4) Disobedient angels are called demons. Foremost among them is Satan, the Devil. Satan and his demons are misleading mankind.—Read Revelation 12:9.
               </p>
               <p>
                Satan has used corrupt businesses, human governments, and false religions to influence people and to turn them away from God. Thus, Satan is responsible for the injustice, violence, and suffering that afflict mankind.—Read 1 John 5:19.
               </p>
               <ol>
                <li>
                 How do demons mislead people?
                </li>
               </ol>
               <p>
                Satan has deceived many people by teaching that the dead become spirits that can communicate with them. The Bible, however, says that the dead can do nothing at all. (Ecclesiastes 9:5) But demons often deceive people by imitating the voice of dead loved ones. (Isaiah 8:19) Demons mislead others through spirit mediums, fortune-tellers, and practitioners of divination and astrology. God’s Word warns us to avoid all such practices. So we should discard anything in our possession that is related to the demons and the occult.—Read Deuteronomy 18:10, 11; Acts 19:19.
               </p>
               <p>
                If we love Jehovah, we do not need to live in fear of the demons. When we study God’s Word and do as it says, we oppose the Devil and draw close to God. Jehovah is more powerful than the demons, as is his Son, Jesus. His faithful angels can strengthen us in time of need.—Read Psalm 34:7; James 4:7, 8.

                 I agree with what your saying. 
Some people are just born with the ability to sense spirits and demons.  I do not ask for any entities to meet me because there is no need for them . if your love one has died, pray that they are able to ascend to heaven with god and be at peace.  Demons are liars,  destroyers,  deceivers.  I have seen the demons.  They appeared to me when i was at my weakest. It is true they are frequencies of energy. I prayed that they would leave me alone and they did.  I accept life and death. I have no need to use the occult for my own selfish purposes. I know the occult and understand its power but i have no desire or need for it.

               The New World Order translation of the bible is Masonic in nature. It denies Jesus' Godhood.
              </p>
              <p>
               You're on the internet, isn't that verboten for a Witness?
              </p>
              <p>
               Any religion or sect that serves men more than God and denies Jesus isn't worth following. The Bible allows for salvation without being beholden to earthly judgements. Do not fear being disfellowshipped. Read a real bible yourself and find out what you're missing.

                Why are you saying I deny Jesus? I don't deny Jesus at all. Jesus is a God. He is the son of god and was the perfect representation of God. Don't assume what I know to be the truth. And by the way, I don't fear anything. And you called it the New World Order Translation? That's the wrong title. New World Translation, meaning new language, not King James or Latin. Easier to understand. There is nothing different that you cannot compare to other Bible's regarding the NWT. The only difference is that they did not take out God's name which are in all the original text. 1800 times in the Torah, or first five books of the bible, and almost 8,000 in the bible's entirety. The fact you are saying it's forbidden for a JW to be on the internet tells me you are completely ignorant. You just told me what I believe and backed nothing up with facts or scripture.

               I used to not believe in much religious stuff.  I am not so sure anymore.  These Satanic Clowns hate Jesus soooooo much there must be something to it.
              </p>
              <p>
               So I will make a rare prayer for me.....Jesus please smite these evil devils in human form....and free us from this Satanic Jewish Masonic Cabal that believes they own all of humanity.  Let them realize the error of their ways and let them feel the same pain they inflicted on the children.  Amen.

                While I admire your open prayer, and Jesus being a judge and a king, you're better off praying and using the name Jehovah when praying. At the end of the prayer, or somewhere within your prayer you just mention that it's through Jesus that you are praying to Jehovah. I'm not at all trying to discriminate what you said. I completely agree. I'm just saying from what I know by studying the bible my entire life; and I mean a deep study, leaving out all traditions, when you pray, pray to Jehovah.
               </p>
               <p>
                Remember in my references there are scriptures that show that Satan is the god of this system, or the Earth. So use god's name when you pray so you're singling out him as being the one you're praying to.

            Wow, interesting. I never thought of the power lines in that way. I read an interesting sentence on the net somewhere years ago.. stating that language is a an error in evolution. I get that. If you think about it they program language into you at a very young age. A means ah.. B means buh... etc... then whenever the child sees these symbols the programmed response to what they were told they mean blinds them of anything else.... and then chunking the symbols together into words and then language.. hence absolute.. and black and white meaning to an infinite string of symbol. Hypnosis you could say. Language would be great if you could just turn it on when you need it.. then turn it off after.. but that would require a very deep understanding of the self and take a lifetime of practice at this point... I'd love to undo the conditioning of language one day. Open up some real powerful areas of my brain :)

             No. There was a video though of some occult sacrifice filmed at CERN but I think it was a prank.

              LOL....why would it be a prank?  You know all the big wigs at Cern are in the cult.   Or they would of never given them the job.  They run the show.  That girl most likely really is dead.  She was either drugged with valium or xanax like the poor souls who are brought before the camera and the idiotic Isis morons cut their heads off....they all seem way too calm.   I think they drug them and then kill them.  That girl likely either volunteered or was not thinking well.

               Your right. She was ritualistically sacrificed.  You gotta remember about these elite people. Their driving force is narcissism. Their initiation 
Into such secret cults and practices merely compliment their uniqueness and power over the masses therefore 
Reinforcing their collective belief they are special and above all, they are above all laws to do as they please.

               No where did I see it was a prank.   It was unexplained.  The Heads at Cern just said they didnt know who did it and offered no explainations at all.  They said some people must of just got carried away having some fun.  But everyone on that campus has to have an ID with a scan card.   They have top notch security cameras.  They know what happened but they are just embarrassed that someone not in the group managed to take video on their cell phone.

                Not mention the guy who released the video was killed. No one thinks that was weird. People really don't think anymore.
Also that girl looked kinda young. She was probably a kid or young teen.

            i dont think its specifically anti-white. Its just that western 1st world whites currently are an impediment to the paedostocracy cult - being educated, some have equity / resources to resist, and are resistant to paeophilia in a way other cultures arent so much

            But to me, the moral argument comes into play with the response to homosexuality, not homosexuality itself. I believe it's a moral decision to either respond with love or with hate.

            Op is onto something. Lower vibrations are easy to control. The understanding of what is going on requires inward work on oneself for knowledge. The mind control they use is brutal.. I'm disgusted and shamed with what they did to my mind with the entertainment industry.. and the education system... Indoctrinated me... just like everybody else... It's literally a cult.. the way they shut your spirit down into mental slavery.. And now that I can see.... I'm absolutely pissed and feel so paralyzed... humiliated for all the ways I acted while under their spell.. and overwhelmed with how massively infinite reality really is and how it is up to me to create it.

             Took the words outta my mouth.  I am pissed too, really pissed.  Pissed enough to go into absolute non-compliance with any nwo company.  Ditched apple and it took an hour to completely delete my account with a senior supervisor.  I am sick to death of being taken over.  Ditched netflix, amazon, the list goes on.  No more starbucks crap.  This is what it will take to get some action.  Non consumption.  As someone mentioned on a post, if everyone stopped buying from amazon or starbucks or netflix for even a day, the loss would be immense to these corporations who are following the nwo agenda.   Simple life....get back to basics... if you can.  Oh, and teach your children well, because they are the ones who will suffer big time.

              You left out Walmart. It's  been so long since I shopped there that just pulling in the parking lot makes me nauseous now.  I've started looking at the CEOs and top officials of major corporations,  most especially their earnings as compared to the average salary of their employees. Those with gross spreads, I boycott as much as possible.  Remember, at the worlds fair in Chicago the big question was "what are people going to do with all of their extra time?"  They believed that technological advancements would allow one person to support their family on just one day's work.  They didn't calculate greed into their equations.

             That's what buddhists think regarding the afterlife, however parallel realities are more or less accepted by quantum physicists these days and for all we know they might have developed a life of their own. The biblical devil was after all a fallen angel. For all I know demons were evil humans before that want to be admired and respected etc.

            The center of a sphere (such as  the Earth or Saturn, for example) is essentially a 'bottomless pit'.

            I think its a battle for souls.
           </p>
           <p>
            They promote debauchery because they can feed off that negativity, of selfishness (pride, no regard for others),  envious of others, violent and vengeful (hatred of others), lustful, never satisfied (consumerism, for e.g.), lazy and of course, greedy.  But if we are in fear, that is probably enough for them as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can see that lying and conspiring against the majority of the populace is clearly evil.   I figure they feed off the emotions, but maybe its like an appetizer, and feeding on a soul is more like a feast?  I'm not sure if they need 'food' to live (doubt it), reproduce (also doubt it), or act in the 3d world (to appear as an apparition, orb, UFO, ghost, shadow person, etc).

            Rule 1 is (by current population) decrease 95% humans. The time span to reach that is the big ? . Can be in couple of decades, can take centuries.

             step right up, you can be the first to give your life up. How much land is sitting empty that the AG pays farmers not to farm. The food shortage is man made because someone wants people to starve. Who? on this planet has the right to cull the herd? We are sustainable, but Some people wont let that happen because they think thier shit dont stink and feel some kind of privilage. Where does that leave you?

              You misunderstood me, i fight against that depopulation agenda. It's what i do 24/7, not that i want to, but for some reason i can't just let it go. Survival instinct and the unintentionally "brainwashing" from my parents, "If you see unjustice you can't and are not allowed t accept that taciturn, you have to act."

              Over population is just a myth that work in some parts of the world. More than enough room for all.

            It's only a defect in that it doesn't lead to procreation, but loving relationships do not require procreation to be meaningful, so in that area it is not a defect, it is simply a difference.

            The definition of degeneracy is a perversion of morals or an impairment of virtues. If you are calling homosexuality an example of degeneracy, then that means you are saying that heterosexuality is the more moral of the two. Which doesn't make sense to the many people who feel that forcing someone to only be able to marry someone of the opposite gender is an immoral thing to do, and the more moral choice would be to allow people to love whoever they want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.

            Once again, I absolutely believe Satan can have an influence on the world, but to me, the traditional interpretation of what Christ taught is Satanic, and the decision to accept homosexuals is the more Christ-like thing to do.

              Well scripture supports the idea of stoning someone to death for working on the sabbath. I can love Christ while also recognizing that stoning anyone for anything is immoral. Also if I were you I would look up the differences between what Christ taught and what Paul taught. Paul never even met Jesus, and yet what most Christians follow are just the teachings of Paul, who, in my opinion, hijacked Christianity to be less about the message of Christ and more about arbitrary rules that have nothing to do with morality.

            You say you're not Christian but you view homosexuality as degeneracy? If you ask me, the right's obsession with money and forcing people into corporate servitude is way more satanic than pornography, homosexuality, and non-traditional families. I'm not a shill, btw, and I'm actually someone who loves Jesus, but come on, the idea that deviating from tradition must be degeneracy is an idea that the powers that be have convinced people to be true.

              Never would of believed this a year ago but today however.   I can.  They are doing some very bad stuff to us and since they are obsessed with the whole gay/tranny movement I can see them playing around and making more of us gay with vaccines or food additives.  These people have absolutely no limits.  If they can sex an infant slit its throat then they can do anything.

               I am of the understanding that this is to curb the "macho alpha male" who would be a threat to resistance. They want relaxed, feminine men who pose no threat or won't stand up and fight for their rights. Plus with the wars, the ones who do fit in the alpha category are now traumatized with PTSD or have been wounded or killed in combat. The rapid decline of the manly man is fast and steady it seems... sadly.

             I used to be very liberal and accepting of homosexuality however now I believe a lot of gay people were raped as children (not necessary by gay guys) and are thus much more likely to become pedophile than straight guys as a kind of early sexual trigger / re-enactment.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is also much more deviant behavior going on like constant unprotected sex with random partners despite common knowledge of disease risks.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd say even in cities that are very accepting for every gay guy who laids a normal sex life by straight definitions there are a lot more who do not.

              But who is encouraging that form of degeneracy? Last time I checked, people are conditioned from a young age to only practice safe sex, whereas people have been having unprotected sex since the beginning of time. So if you look at it from a historical POV, it's getting better, not worse. And I also believe that the more homosexuality is accepted in the mainstream, the less it will exist as a counterculture where things like promiscuity are normal. If the only people who will accept your homosexuality are homosexuals with a predefined culture, then you're likely to join that culture; whereas if you are treated just like everyone else except you are attracted to the same gender, then it becomes a non-issue.

                Absolutely not. We can observe homosexuality in nature without seeing any pedophilia with it, because they are two much different things. Most men like women, some men like men, most women like men, some women like women. You can't expect 100% consistency from a natural process like human sexuality, nature always produces anomalies.
               </p>
               <p>
                BUT none of the above causes anyone harm if it's consenting adults. Children suffer from real problems caused by pedophilia, so that makes it a completely different situation. Most people have a knee-jerk reaction to anything involving pedophilia because it is and always will be seen as a horrible problem that ruins lives.
               </p>
               <p>
                Humans have a deeply rooted instinct to protect children, think about how often in nature getting near an animal's babies means fighting of its angry parents. That's something in our DNA that isn't going away. But people don't have any built-in reason to care about how other adults around them go about porking each other, the only place homophobia exists is in our cultural upbringing, and since cultures change, people have begun to evolve on an issue they realized isn't as scary as they thought.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sorry for the rant, I just feel like accepting homosexuals is something that is an obvious step forward, and I still am 100% against pedophilia because it truly hurts people and I want it to be dealt with and made a thing of the past.

               A lot of guys hate condoms I guess and while gay sex clubs offer them they neither encourage or force people to use them.

              <p>
               I used to party a lot at a place next to a gay sex club and they encourage the most degenerate stuff like scatology parties on their agenda. This specific subset of gay people encourages the most degenerate stuff to more normal gay guys.

                I just don't see any sign of that kind of stuff on the rise. There have always been kinky people, and that isn't going to stop. As long as they aren't hurting anyone/themselves, then I think they only satanic part is people trying to stop them from doing what makes them happy.
