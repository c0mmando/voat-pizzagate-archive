            Yes and a mod deleted my bank boycot thread and said I needed more examples of what a boycot was and also complained that it was too broad and should mention which specific banks. I explained that all banks must be boycot and continued to post it until I was banned. Proving that I was spot on. MF and Vindicator pull stunts like that all the time.

            When it comes to the Elite the expression TIME IS THE BIGGEST KILLER comes to mind. Look how many of the worst have died in the last year alone - Rockefeller, Brizinski soon to be followed by McCain.... Bush senior, Kissinger and Soros can't be far off. And look at their Looserville kids - does anyone believe the Alex Soros or Clay Rockefeller are going to take over the world?

            You're probably right - more is always better, but he does accomplish a lot for one person! More than I could handle for sure. I check for new videos of his every day and I have to remind myself that he has a huge family to care for on top of researching and creating videos. I'm just glad we at least have one of him honestly lol

            Yeah I agree - If we had a hundred more like him, we could probably rid the internet of all the creepers trying to talk to little kids on games! He seems like a really genuine person to me, and that's my favorite thing about him.

            Yeah I love his videos. He's the only youtuber I really follow when it comes to pg. I've watched videos about it from lots of different channels but I like his the best because he relies more on facts and less on speculation. Plus he has a great, clear voice :)

            Check out the  "Out of Darkness, Into The Light" series by End Times News Report on YouTube. Its comprised of fairly short videos on all things pizzagate. Very professional, easy to follow, and informative. He's making more videos soon to add to the series as well.

            You want to know the
            <strong>
             one and only
            </strong>
            way to destroy the pedo elite? You need to destroy and replace the monetary system, and by default the global economy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Think about it, what lays at the very heart of the elites power structure, is it Satan or the desire to rape young children? No it's the desire for more money and wealth, plain and simple.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until we as a species can move past this medieval system of slavery that is slowly killing us all, not to mention the very Earth that we inhabit, NOTHING WILL CHANGE. Kill the money, and you instantly kill the pedo elite.
           </p>
           <p>
            Humans don't need money to survive, humans need money to control other humans.

            Savitz died while awaiting trial for child abuse in 1993.  This death should be researched.  Also the statement by Ed Rendell is highly suspect.  Saying that the guy that told Dr. Phil there was a pedophile ring involving Sandusky, was crackers.  In other words, nuts.  He is involved imo.

             Carmencita, that is one of the 'tells' in trying to analyze and understand these situations. When people emphatically make statements declaring innocence of seemingly guilty parties, that should raise a yellow flag, if you will.
Not saying the defenders are either incorrect or themselves involved in any way, but - as you noted - it is not normal behavior to take such firm stands in these very serious matters, most especially by cavalierly dismissing critics.
Follow up, check out Ray Gricar, local prosecutor in early Sandusky matter.
Mysteriously disappeared, not found to this day.

            All of the cases he brought up have been brought up in here. However, he put this all together four years ago. Amazing. His conclusion is like ours. An impressive researcher. Must have been lousy to try to bring people around to this cabal when he was the lone ranger doing this.

                          Well The Rothschild family started Wikileaks. 
The Masonic emblem contains a "G" which refers to Golgotha meaning both Skull and Bald Head.  Now of course, we know The Fox King is bald as an eagle...

             Exactly why it would make absolutely no sense for this user to just disappear. I've trolled around Reddit conspiracy a bit and can't find anyone with that writing style, eloquence, and ability to logically lay out the evidence that no conscious person can deny.

              There is I think very significant risk of severe psychological trauma associated with researching things of this nature.  It's the nature of the Web and how the mind works that together a person can become bombarded with material sought out in an adictive type of information feeding frenzy. Factor in sleep deprivation as just one risk factor and who knows what a human mind is capable of doing to itself or others unwittingly or knowingly.  So many known and uknowns.

            The depraved things you read in these stories are nothing new. It's a pattern, with the elements of the cases repeated with near precision everytime. This is the web holding the globalist elite together. They draw people into their horrific circle and ensure they have enough blackmail on said person. They then use their influence to push that person into a position of power, and yet another person willing to look the other way.

            What REALLY scared me in this thread was this quote I've never actually seen before.
           </p>
           <p>
            Former CIA director William Colby gave a warning to his friend Senator John Decamp (not an insider, was a Vietnam war hero who got elected with strong local roots ), in regards to his campaign to get to the bottom of the Franklin Savings &amp; Loan scandal:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ”What you have to understand, John, is that sometimes there are forces and events too big, too powerful, with so much at stake for other people or institutions, that you cannot do any­thing about them, no matter how evil or wrong they are and no matter how dedicated or sincere you are or how much evidence you have. That is simply one of the hard facts of life you have to face. You have done your part. You have tried to expose the evil and wrongdoing. It has hurt you terribly. But it has not killed you up to this point. I am telling you, get out of this before it does.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I think this made it kinda hit me how vast and widespread this is. Breaking this open totally smashes the entire worldview people have held their whole lives. It will not go well. It will trigger wars, mass casualties, absolute chaos. Can this be realistically brought down if we want to retain a shred of the civilization we have created?

             Don't forget that Colby was killed while canoeing alone in the middle of the night. Kay Griggs claimed that it was a Seal Team that did him, as an initiation/graduation, the premise being that higher up the kill, the more prestige you earn.

             They're above the law. The only way to stop them is to unite all good humans, figure out a way to eliminate/silence infiltrators, somehow overcome their insane stockpile of weaponry and then just kill them. There's no way to account for raping kids and murdering innocent people. They just need to die.
            </p>
            <p>
             Civilization can wait till after. That's easy. Once we remove the mind control and the corporate/political greed, we can create a real society based on taking care of each other's children and not fuckin' raping them or abusing them and keeping all of humanity fed, make sure we don't overpopulate whatever that's easy

             Your point about the consequences of bringing down the pedophocracy is a salient one. From John DeCamp's book on the Franklin scandal:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              I shook my head. "I don't understand. I just don't understand," I kept repeating. "Everybody knows what is happening, but nobody is willing to do anything about it. Why? Why?!!"
             </p>
             <p>
              Judge Enbody looked at me and said, very slowly, "If you want to understand the entire Franklin case, I can help you. Go read 'Billy Budd.' Read 'Billy Budd.' If you will do that, John, and if you understand the book, then you will understand the what and why of Franklin, and why it can be no other way. I do not say you will like it. I do not say you will agree with it. But at least you will understand it. That, I promise you. Go read 'Billy Budd'."
             </p>
             <p>
              [after DeCamp watches Billy Budd]
             </p>
             <p>
              Now I think I do understand the Franklin case. I know, now, that all the public officials involved in Franklin-whether they ever heard of Billy Budd or not-fully understood what they were doing.
             </p>
             <p>
              And what they all have done, and will continue to do in this case, Franklin, and no doubt many others like it, is this: Protect the "system" at all costs. The "system" is the only ultimate sacred cow-not any particular law or constitution, but only "the system." Because, ultimately, it is the system which makes certain that the individuals functioning within it-from judges to lawyers, to prosecutors, to politicians, to businessmen have their places and positions, and opportunities and pecking order, and future.
             </p>
             <p>
              And, though it is unfortunate, that on occasion the protection of the "system" requires the deliberate sacrifice of perfectly innocent people, that is hoped overall to be the exception rather than the rule. But without the "system" ...
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             The stability of our civilization is built on the horrific exploitation of innocent people. But that doesn't make me falter at wanting to bring the pedophile elite down. No system that willfully harms the innocent, especially children, is so sacred that it's worth preserving.

              I remember reading a fairly academic account of child sacrifice/abuse through the ages (posted here I think) . It allegedly is  rooted in actual sacrifice in the belief that bad things will happen or that the good thing that have been received need to be paid for by offering theor young.  Naturally the taboo aspect is likely a driving factor in  the abuse in mamy cases.

              You put that perfectly. I hope I wasn't unclear... what I meant was "is there a way to bring this system down without literally wiping the slate?" I don't want to live in a world where those horrors are allowed to exist either, but think of all the pure, good, innocent, decent people that ARE here. Just asking the question of how we can get the humans of our world united and organized to wipe out the subhuman filth :(

               That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
