<li>
<p>James Achilles Alefantis is regarded as the 49th most powerful person in DC </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James Achilles Alefantis has several global holdings, most of which involve &quot;kid friendly&quot; bastions where groups of children gather. He, his registering agents, and administrative functionaries use several different aliases, but they can be seen if you dig hard.

</li>
<li>
<p>James Achilles Alefantis works in producing &quot;films&quot; and &quot;music videos&quot; with Amanda Kleinman, the quality of which indicates deep budgets. As someone with a decade of experience in cognitive science and studies in perception, I can tell you the &quot;films&quot; and &quot;music videos&quot; contain highly professional hypnotic inductions and neuro linguistic programming techniques to induce trance states in the viewer and embed suggestions and commands. What is called &quot;mind control&quot; in popular parlance. Example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31rQiiqsv4A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31rQiiqsv4A</a> (watch with volume off, and in short segments, do not watch continuously as it is designed to embed suggestions and values in your other-than-conscious mental states). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James Achilles Alefantis has not been arrested, despite overwhelming empirical evidence that he is a central figure in an international child trafficking and child prostitution ring. Far from it, there was a questionable event involving a &quot;gunman&quot; who was found to be a paid actor. That event was then used as a pretext to censor us. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James Achilles Alefantis is being protected by key figures in mainstream media, social media, local law enforcement, and government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James Achilles Alefantis has visited the White House five times and is working intimately with and on behalf of the Clinton Foundation, Podestas, Carlos Slim, Frank Giustra, Jeffrey Epstein, and Soros.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>James Achilles Alefantis\'s inner circle collects imagery and artwork depicting torture techniques and psychiatric conditioning employed on children, including pulling teeth and putting children in coffins with insects, the very same techniques that the CIA used at black sites on Iraqi children. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Folks, it\'s time to open your eyes. <strong>James Achilles Alefantis is a CIA operative and the CIA is involved in child trafficking for billionaires.</strong> We have been staring this in the face this whole time, but haven\'t drawn the proper inferences. </p>
<p>I have never been one to promulgate talk of &quot;CIA child trafficking and torture&quot; but, unfortunately, that is what we\'ve been looking at here. </p>
<p>Think of the CIA as a rogue organization that works on behalf of a select group of billionaires who are about to have a heart attack right now. Yes, this goes directly to George Soros. </p>
<p>I have many friends who are watching me and whatever comes my way, so I have no fear in conveying this info, and nor should you. </p>
<p>Yes, this intelligence agency and the billionaire ideologues for whom it works is what is behind all of this. Comet Ping Pong is one small glimpse into this, but one that is sufficient to pull back the curtains and reveal Soros, Giustra, Slim, Clinton standing there naked. </p>
<p>This is why you see everyone from Hillary to the Pope trying to stop us. This is why you see unprecedented censorship. They are pulling out all the stops, because you are all right, and these people are finally exposed to the world. They have been exposed, and their international spheres of influence are now being shredded as well. Their operations in and with Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the Eurozone, Turkey, etc. They\'re finished. </p>
<p>They should hang themselves, because it\'s going to be hell for them otherwise. </p>
<p>Good work everyone, now\'s the time to increase the exposure and fight with everything you\'ve got. Those of you who have the eyes to see, and the relevant background knowledge -- this will &quot;click&quot; if it hasn\'t already. </p>
<p>To the stragglers who say &quot;this isn\'t proof,&quot; as if James Alefantis needs to email you his CIA payroll records directly, I recommend introspectively questioning and revising your presuppositions about what constitutes adequate proof, and think carefully about the probability assignments to the data points and patterns involved.</p>

<p><strong>Footnote:</strong>
I\'m going to offer some further thoughts on the roots of this &quot;agency&quot; and some worldview considerations. But these are just my own, and nothing that was shown above hinges on what follows. That we have been outing the CIA as a child trafficking ring (and worse) is true regardless of the veracity of what I\'m going to say next. </p>
<p>At the root of this is a relatively small organization of individuals with a worldview according to which they have been freed from the constraints of morality which bind ordinary folk. These are not religionists per se, but they create cults and cult symbology as heuristic devices for the initiated to have a sense of power. Perception is intertwined with reality. </p>
<p>Another researcher has uncovered the connection between all of these cults, their involvement in child trafficking and torture and programming: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1475307">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1475307</a>. In my view, this is an international operation. They start these &quot;cults&quot; everywhere to gain influence at the highest powers and &quot;initiate&quot; people. The blackmail keeps everyone silent. The South Korean cult is an example, the Moloch/Crowley cult in the US is another example. </p>
<p>These are individuals who created the CIA and other organizations and used their wealth to maintain a stranglehold on society and culture, not vice versa. </p>
<p>Whether you are an atheist or a Muslim or a Christian theist, it does not matter. You do not have to believe that the entities they talk about actually exist, the point is that <em>they</em> believe &quot;Lucifer&quot; and &quot;Moloch&quot; are real, and that by participating in blood letting and debauchery without limit they are thereby privy to hidden knowledge, technologies, and strength. </p>
<p>When they cut open children and drink the blood, they get a biochemical rush, and it only serves to strengthen their belief in &quot;Luciferianism&quot; or the other silly gods they serve. They are, of course, deceived and delusional. A bit of superficial reasoning leads them to their ideology; but depth in reasoning would show them that they are delusional. They are tortured by the realization of their mortality -- they\'re going to die, yes, and it\'s their biggest fear. They\'re going to lose everything, and they\'re going to burn.</p>',

            A missing link that might help is explaining CIA evolution how German Doctors in WW11 learned through experiments about mind control DID some came to the US. Connections to the Tavistock Institute. Also try and understand why the Pope would speak now the role of the Catholic Church in Germany while Evil came to power. This is Luceferian worship hiding in plain sight open your eyes even though it is hard.

            Good post. 
I hope people do not give up exposing all aspects of #pizzagate, no matter where it leads.

            Also, EVERYONE needs to be at least familiar with the history book called "Acid Dreams" which details the CIA's intimate involvement with using LSD both within the agency and to achieve objectives since before the late 60s.

            For Mind Control techniques and info that are alive and well on the planet today in factions - entertainment faction is mostly covered here go to VigilantCitizen.com if you never have before.

           <p>
            Finally, I theorize that what we are seeing with pizzagate is the result of extreme hubris.  "Magnificent Ape"?  I can assure you the man behind that character believes his own hype. The blackmail pedo culture of DC just basically started to "flouresce" from about 2005-2015 to the point that the denizens believed their own mindset and felt pedostuff was normalizing or almost normal because the "art" the "parties" the "social set" made it all seem okay, combined with the rise of social media and an absolute belief in being untouchable and protected.  The result? openly displayed pedophile Instagram pages and etc.  After all, they are just really edgy libertines, right?  And there is a philosophy behind that idea, and there is ritual and satanism to give their emptyness some meaning.
           </p>
           <p>
            We STILL wouldn't be looking at any of it if it weren't for the leaks.

            Pretty sure point 2 has been disproved. I mean good work keeping this all together, but I really doubt Alefantis is at the center of anything. He and Comet Ping Pong if anything are on the peripheral of this investigation. They seem more important because we were able to gather so much from their social media accounts... If anyting, Comet Ping Pong is located in a place central to trafficking operations, but as always Podesta/Clinton Foundation is the center and heart of our efforts. Don't let Jimmycomet be the focus of our motivations.

              James was the boy toy of David Brock.  They were a DC power couple.  The money, contacts, media help, etc. all could be explained through that intimate relationship.   They were together for years and bought a house together.

             To truly understand, you need to get to the roots, and where these awful programs originated.  I highly suggest you start with CIA Operation Midnight Climax.

               yes, and it became more - it became part of the culture of the CIA, and the begining of rogue elements in other parts of the government, breakaway shadow ops, funding etc.  LSD is a powerful substance.   Remember, Heavy Breathing is characterized as a "psychedelic" band by their own PR.

                I think your best argument for this are the really creepy music videos with hidden images.  Someone broke down one of the videos and it was creepy as fuck.
