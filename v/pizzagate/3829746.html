             Racine is the #1 bellwether that accurately predicts the outcome of Presidential elections 86% of the time

            , it may be relevant that
            <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2008/07/28/mccain-to-stop-in-wisconsins-bellwether-county/">
             McCain campaigned in Racine

            . I also had no idea Reince Priebus was the Wisconsin Republican Party Chairman.
           </p>
           <p>
            While researching these connections I also stumbled across
            <a href="https://journaltimes.com/mccains-honor-was-racine-mans-tumult/article_1922a141-5f46-5ee7-b6bd-6cf9a8b10f18.html">
             this article which may indicate that Les Aspin was a Communist sympathizer
            </a>
            . This article portrays this story in a very positive light, but given what I know about the connections between communist infiltrators and Racine, I can't help but wonder if the soldier mentioned in this article may not have been more guilty than he is portrayed here.

             Yes, it's all related to McCains involvement in Child Trafficking. It seems like all the people who claim to help kids are actually gatekeepers to keep them quiet. The 70s show connection to this town is strange, and the link of kid actors in a town of rape culture. Foxconn is the cherry on top. You don't find these overlapping events odd?

            Your mention of a "quantum computer" put me in mind of a possible connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember Seymour Cray ?  Seymour Cray was a computer genius who built the first super-computers in Wisconsin, of all places.  The technology was so far advanced, and in an area that was so outside of the technology centers of that day, that many people questioned how he came up with such ideas.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't really have an idea how this fits in with pizzagate, but I thought it might be an interesting connection.

            Racine is the smallest key “Smart City” that will serve as the national and global model for all small and mid size communities. What they cannot control through the Smart City directly will be controlled by regional networks and “Resilient Communities”. What is the Milwaukee 7?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why is water the world’s most valuable resource and where is it? It is not in Silicon Valley. It is in Wisconn Valley. Why is it spelled Wisconn?
           </p>
           <p>
            The silence and secrecy from all parties about The Deal speaks volumes. They have their own police force. They have extreme perimeter security. They have transformed the entire area ‘overnight’. Amazon, Johnson, Uline, Emerson, Nestle and select others did the initial work to pave the way. They have partnerships in place with corrupt authorities in the area. They demanded their own driverless lanes in the freeway reconstruction. Many of these construction efforts are cover for the real Agenda and underground tunnels. The construction never stopped or slowed down during the outbreak.
           </p>
           <p>
            Secret deals were made with cities around the state of Wisconsin for “innovation centers”. Several key buildings in Racine were given to them as part of The Deal including properties owned by the Johnsons. They have become a landlord and key player for incubators and integrators. The amount of property owned by these groups is mostly hidden. They have transferred many other properties to Chinese investors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing you have ever read about The Deal for the 8th Wonder of the World tells the real story. First they said they were manufacturing large televisions as a Gen 10 plant, but later changed that to smaller screens as a Gen 6 plant. They floated stories about building automated coffee machines, and recently about manufacturing ventilators. This was never about manufacturing. This has always been about Quantum computing and 5G+ AI.
           </p>
           <p>
            Terry Gou is connected to a group leading Taiwan back into the arms of China, and ran for President. Both he and his right hand man stepped down after The Deal moved into construction. Scott Walker threw his election and Paul Ryan resigned. Reince Priebus was ‘fired’. Tank Murdoch resigned. The mayor, city administrator, district attorney, city council members and development directors all suddenly resigned amid allegations of extreme corruption and abuse. They recruited other corrupt administrators from Tinley Park, Rio Rancho and other areas that were compromised to push through the Agenda. They have all since left including another one resigning yesterday to move to Ohio.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vox and The Verge run fake opposition stories to control the narrative. The lead editor Nilay Patel is from Racine and his family is well connected. He is part of the Agenda paving the way for big tech, education and healthcare. They are also connected with NBC (Tonight Show), Wall Street Journal and All Things D.
           </p>
           <p>
            They reduced their coverage once the real opposition began dying down. Those they chose to interview as key opposition are closely connected with corrupt officials including the “Root River Siren”. Both major parties are involved in The Deal and cover up. Racine is the Bellwether for America effectively predicting the national elections in a key swing state. Remember who lost to Obama the first and second elections - McCain and Palin, then Romney and Ryan. Who was Mitt Romney named after, and what happened to the FLDS church and Boy Scouts? Why did Ashton Kutcher wink at McCain? Why did McCain’s strategist push for Clinton after an HBO movie was made about him?
           </p>
           <p>
            This is the largest foreign Greenland investment in U.S. History called “The 8th Wonder of the World” in a deal made with corrupt officials who all since resigned that has been extremely secretive and ever-changing since the initial deal was made.
           </p>
           <p>
            A deal of this magnitude does not happen overnight as they told everyone it did. This has been planned and orchestrated over an extended time period aligning school districts, water and sewer agreements, highway construction projects, Smart City models and tech legislation to pave the way for The Deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are the reason why Trump closed the signing of the Deal at the last minute. It was reportedly blamed on a group of protestors from Milwaukee as cover.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the key signings happened with the Johnsons as the Frank Lloyd Wright designed headquarters. Who designed the research tower? Who designed Wingspread? What has been decided at Wingspread? Why does Racine have a unique customs office and international airport? Who controls the harbor? How did the mafia traffick drugs, alcohol and people?
           </p>
           <p>
            Did Trump and Q know they were signing the most significant deal of his administration with a family of Luciferian pedophiles and corrupt officials?
           </p>
           <p>
            Was the election safe where a billion dollar referendum endorsed in a “highly unusual move” by Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders was rigged to pass by 5 votes? How is Common Core based on the World Core Curriculum that was established at Wingspread?

             </p>
             <p>
              There are a bunch of news articles showing that Lake Forest is still a suicide cluster as late as 2012:
             </p>
             <p>
              <a href="https://www.scottholleran.com/writings/news-ideas/feature-teen-depression-and-suicide-on-chicagos-north-shore/">
               We’ve had painful reminders of those facts with a recent rash of teen suicides in Lake Forest, where Judith Guest set the 1976 novel on which the film is based. There was a teen suicide trend when I lived on the North Shore, too. Back in the 1980s, it was estimated that we had
               <strong>
                33 teenage suicides in an 18-month period
               </strong>
               . Many teens had stepped in front of trains.
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              The movie mention in that article seems to contain predictive programming about suicides involving trains:

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               There’s a moment in Robert Redford’s 1980 movie about the disintegration of a Lake Forest family, Ordinary People. It’s a short scene, barely memorable, really, and it occurs early in the picture. Conrad Jarrett, played by Timothy Hutton, is sitting in a car with other kids on their way to high school. The car is stopped at a gate waiting for the Chicago &amp; North Western train to pass. We hear the bell, see the flashing lights, and,

               </strong>
               and trying to take charge of his life—squirming in the backseat, disturbed by something internal we don’t yet know about.

Sophomore Farid Hussain, 15, walked in front of a Metra train on Jan. 9 in what the Lake County coroner ruled a suicide. Last week, as classmates began spring break, senior Edward Schutt, 18, became the third to be killed by a train.

Now, his estate is cooperating with the Senate Intelligence Committee by turning over unspecified documents it requested, Lake Forest attorney William Ensing told the Tribune last week.

                , that guy seems to know a decent amount about the area and the surrounding region. If you have any knowledge yourself that I haven't already mentioned I am all ears. It seems like there is a lot of bizarre stuff going on there.

              iMET Center is also a manufacturing lab for Gateway and Racine. They control all incubator, accelerator and integrator programs and identify the “talented and gifted” through schools as young as they can. What is 21 century prep? What are higher expectations? Who is ‘common core’ for? What are Foxconn “innovation centers” for?

              There are connections with Krasnodar trafficking of all kinds including baby farms, baby drop boxes, mafia corruption, cannibalism, child rape and pedophilia and also the aquatic biological resources. A main part of the Machinery Row development in Racine included special deals for urban farming and aquaponics also connected with the Wild Root Co-Op that received handouts as part of a local buying club for elites in the area. Garbage for the masses, organs and organics for the elite.

             don't worry about answering every single question, just pick a few and answer those. It's impossible to answer everything at once, so just take it one step at a time and let your knowledge expand over time. Here are some of the answers that I was able to learn over time this way:

            </p>
            <p>
             I know that the Mound Building Natives believed that water was the surface of the underworld, and that upon leaving the body the soul had to search for water before it could leap into the Milky Way, which is the Path of Souls (the Galactic Center of the Milky Way passes directly over Racine).

             The FLW Fellowship was a safe haven for homosexuals in FLW's time so I assume homosexual blackmail went on here. FLW also essentially enslaved his apprentices and had them perform unpaid labor for him.

             I can’t stand Q style questions just state the concise info I can’t follow so many questions. I would have to agree on the special highway lanes. I would bet these slow ass road construction guys Above ground are just covering the noise of underground drilling. Very interesting lead, very very interesting. Look up maps of Costco/Sams club... a few amazon warehouses in strange Remote areas on mountaintops. Imagine how set you would be in a disaster next to these places with tunnels feeding into the basement. Look how many bulk food places Denver has... it’s almost 5x the number of stores needed for their population.
            </p>
            <p>
             Can you try to reduce this to something I can follow? I’ve clearly laid out a few players in my post here that’s proven. You’ve shared a lot of information without connecting it properly.

            I honestly was skeptical about the Racine stuff I left out of this post. But the absolute downvote smash here has me curious. This goes much deeper with this town. Thanks to some guy on here that sounds like an absolute lunatic, he just might be onto something with this Foxconn Global mafia HQ theory.

             Look at one of the blog sites in the Racine area that crunched the numbers on the Billion dollar referendum endorsed by Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.
            </p>

              A quick look at the referendum by the numbers
             </h2>
             <p>
              RUSD serves the following 7 communities.
             </p>
             <p>
              Racine, Caledonia, Mt.Pleasant, Wind Point, Elmwood Park, North Bay, Sturtevant.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are approximately 20,000 students within the school system.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are about 150,000 residents within RUSD
             </p>
             <p>
              So what is the average cost of the referendum divided into the number by residents?
             </p>
             <p>
              What is 1 billion dollars divided by
             </p>
             <p>
              One hundred fifty thousand residents?
             </p>
             <p>
              The answer is biblical, even prophesied!
             </p>
             <p>
              $6,666,66…… per resident.
             </p>
             <p>
              Let’s try this again
             </p>
             <p>
              1,000,000,000 divided by One Hundred fifty thousand equals 6,666.66…………..
             </p>
             <p>
              The math works out.

              I try not to get into the numerical stuff, it's likely true but not evidence. The McCain involvement with child trafficking is very obvious here.

             Trump broke ground for Foxconn alongside Scott Walker and Paul Ryan. This is significant because Trump is both the 45th President AND the
             <a href="https://imgur.com/a/tMKDk2w">
              45th ancestor of the prophet Mohamed
             </a>
             , and Scott Walker is the 45th Governor of Wisconsin, and Paul Ryan is the 54th Speaker of the House. They used golden shovels to do it.

              The symbolism always seems to be there. I mostly look at that for the laughs, but in this string of coincidences things start to be a bad comedy.
