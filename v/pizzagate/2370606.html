            Had the cringe worthy mis-fortune to listen to two dumb-downed disc jocks on the radio lamenting about him, while i was in the car this morning. Commenting how sad it must be for his family and those that knew him, quoting friends of the actor on "how troubled he must have been" etc, really pulling out the usual 'such a tragedy, poor guy' malarky.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did they mention anything about cp or the huge amount of images of under aged children being sexually exploited??. Nope. Did they in any way call him out for being a degenerate sick paedophile??. Nope. Did they have any mention/sympathy for any of the victims??. Only a passing nod that focused on money, in that complainants will miss out on $50 000, as now a court case will not proceed. Again No mention of  their age, the cp or other under aged victims being harmed. Completely oblivious....
           </p>
           <p>
            Completely free of any references to the true nature of what occured, who /what was involved and any sort of public disgust, condemnation of him as an individual and the activities he had engaged in, and me shouting at the radio like an absolute lunatic "what about the cp !!! .... what about the cp !!!.... mention it was cp !!.... you stupid muthaf**ers ...". Things like that from the MSM (that intentionally frame in a way to leave out the very important parts) just "grind my gears".

            It was released on 8chan that The Standard Hotel in WeHo was involved in murder coverup. Adam Schiff is believed to have known pedo ring was operating out of hotel.  General Manager of Standard was just killed in helicopter accident with financial director for hotel. One hotel in a Miami, one in New York and one in WeHo.  GM worked as concierge for elite and procuring items they requested.  GM was planning on singing what she knew. Silenced.  Hotels looked kind of twisted. Kinky rooms, fetish wear, bathrooms look out over the street and people on street can see them in bathroom. One of their ads shows two women having lunch and a teenage boy has his head buried down this woman’s sweater as if he is nursing. Another shows a furry in bed with a woman.  Still digging on this story.

             Oh God.  These people are disgusting.  I saw yesterday someone had Adam Schiff in a picture with Ed Buck in Cali.  Also there was one of Jerry Brown with Ed Buck as well. Ed Buck was and maybe still is a Big Fundraiser for Dems.  A black man ended up dead in Buck's apt.  So now these two, Brown and Schiff have their pics on the internet with Buck.  What a laugh.  There is no end to their indecency.  Perverted Scumbags all of them.

            50,000 images looks like a buying and selling operation. In order for that to occur there has to be both buyers and sellers. Meaning he probably knows a lot of people connected. Damn good chance this guy got whacked in my opinion.

             I always find it odd when paedophiles are arrested that police find so many images and videos. Nobody has 50,000 images of anything for their own personal use. Whether its cars, dogs or something wicked. If I see someone has 50,000 pics of children being abused I would suspect they are trading them/selling them to others.
