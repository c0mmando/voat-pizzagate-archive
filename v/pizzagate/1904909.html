<p><strong>Background on the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) led by David Skaggs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don\'t know anything about politics but the <a href="http://archive.is/sHwxG"><strong>OCE, created by Nancy Pelosi in 2008</strong></a> strikes me as a &quot;shame and often unfounded allegations machine&quot; for the pedophocracy to keep people in line.  It has no real power other than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>the <strong>OCE does not have the power to compel testimony, subpoena documents, determine whether a violation has occurred, or impose sanctions....limited to conducting a preliminary investigation</strong> </p>
<p>the OCE will <strong>often publicly disclose witnesses that do not cooperate with their investigations, which can cause reputational harm.</strong> In general, individuals and entities must exercise extreme caution and should be represented by counsel when interacting with the OCE.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Politico:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though it would feature no subpoena power, the office’s most important bludgeon was its ability to <strong>make public any reports that the House Ethics Committee decided not to pursue. Since its creation, OCE has launched more than 100 inquiries and dismissed about two-thirds of them.</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New York Times:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The office was created by <strong>Nancy Pelosi,</strong> the San Francisco Democrat, in 2008 after she became speaker and promised to \'\'drain the swamp that is Washington.\'\' But it has been controversial from the start, and Ms. Pelosi struggled to get enough votes to create the independent watchdog.</p>
<p>lawmakers quickly complained that the <strong>ethics office was opening cases in response to frivolous allegations.</strong> Most of the cases brought by were ultimately dismissed by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, which retains the power to formally charge lawmakers with wrongdoing and recommend disciplinary action.</p>

<p>Also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wielding <strong>the sheer power of political shame</strong> over a Congress seemingly unwilling to police itself....tiny band of lawyers in the Office of Congressional Ethics...</p>
<p>“They are a <strong>very arrogant, dangerous little outfit,”</strong> said Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who defended one House member cleared by the ethics committee. “They are a <strong>rogue operation</strong> that needs to be shut down.”</p>
<p>lawyers said they had begun to <strong>advise their clients to not cooperate....does not have subpoena power.</strong></p>
<p>“We are still....at the beginning of <strong>the experiment,” Mr. Skaggs said....</strong>Then he added, <strong>&quot;This was never a popularity contest.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>I put the various things I found in chronological order.  There may be something new in there to help the investigation, plus there is old information I had never seen before, i.e.,</strong> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DCa0rRm3m9UC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;dq=washington+hotel+pedo+ring+scandal+tom+flocco&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Rez6KTyUvj&amp;sig=MiSgETYNwHxyOTwWii4KHtiQgWQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjK_p-kgJ3UAhUC7oMKHby_C2IQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=washington%20hotel%20pedo%20ring%20scandal%20tom%20flocco&amp;f=false"><strong>the 2006 DC hotels politician pedophile ring.</strong></a></p>

<li>
<p><strong>1999:</strong>  The body of a 12-year-old boy was found in a shallow grave at a boarded up ice cream stand <a href="http://archive.is/FkrkV">less than a half hour from Chappaqua.</a>  This tragedy <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4246/34214145673_4314d0ca92_o.png">prompted a sweep of area Internet pedophiles including Chappaqua resident Nicholas Puner,</a> a Harvard-educated attorney who at the time was head of the New Castle Planning Board which covers Chappaqua.  (By the way, other \'elite\' child sexual abusers caught earlier in the 1999 sweep handled by Westchester County DA now &quot;Judge Jeanine&quot; Pirro <a href="http://archive.is/uCwwx">included a former PR executive at PepsiCo who was HIV-positive, a former Somers school board member, and a Yonkers city economic development officer.)</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2000:</strong>  Nicholas Puner was convicted of sexually assaulting two minors and sentenced to <a href="http://archive.is/Ny05W"><strong>only sixty days in jail and five years of probation.</strong></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2001:</strong>  While on probation Puner contacted an undercover police detective who was pretending to be a 14-year-old boy and discussed sexual acts.  <a href="http://archive.is/Ny05W">He was sent back to prison for three years.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2005:</strong>  Puner attempted and failed to have his sex offender rating reduced from Level 3, the highest, claiming:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Puner further argued that he was not as great a risk because he was no longer hiding his homosexuality and was not inclined to seek out under age boys who were easy to manipulate. </p>
<p>In fact, a clinical polygraph examination was submitted by the State showing that Mr. Puner had admitted to having sexual contact with ten minors under the age of 18, after he himself had turned thirty years old. </p>

            The office was created by
            <strong>
             Nancy Pelosi,
            </strong>
            the San Francisco Democrat, in 2008 after she became speaker and promised to ''drain the swamp that is Washington.'' But it has been controversial from the start, and Ms. Pelosi struggled to get enough votes to create the independent watchdog.
           </p>
           <p>
            lawmakers quickly complained that the
            <strong>
             ethics office was opening cases in response to frivolous allegations.
            </strong>
            Most of the cases brought by were ultimately dismissed by the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, which retains the power to formally charge lawmakers with wrongdoing and recommend disciplinary action.
