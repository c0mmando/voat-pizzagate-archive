<p>Continuing with <strong>RAY CHAMBERS</strong>, United Nations Advocate and Special Envoy</p>
<p>His distinguished career is described in wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Chambers">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Chambers</a></p>
<p>For example, In February 2008, the Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed Mr. Chambers as his first Special Envoy for Malaria.</p>
<p>But things aren\'t always rosey there.  As Inner City Press, an independent journalist who covers the corruption at the UN  <a href="http://www.innercitypress.com/ban1unicef112908.html">wrote in his blog</a>  :</p>

<p>Continuing with Ray Chamber\'s wikipedia entry: <em>In February 2013 the Secretary-General expanded Mr. Chambers’ mandate as his first Special Envoy for Financing the Health <strong>Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)</strong> – the internationally agreed set of humanitarian targets</em></p>
<p>Let\'s delve a little into the origins of the UN\'s MDGs:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lucistrust.org/it/blog_wgun/sustainable-development-goals-planning-for-a-culture-of-goodwill-2014-06-27">Sustainable Development Goals – Planning for a Culture of Goodwill</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words the story of the MDGs is an important part of the story of the awakening will of humanity as a whole. As a species we are in process of developing a common will.  
</p>
<p>Right now there is a process underway to define a new set of goals (Sustainable Development Goals – SDGs) that will focus government and UN development plans for the next 15 year period, 2015 – 2030. Much has been learnt since 2000 and goodwill networks around the world are becoming more actively involved in pushing governments to come up with goals that reflect current human aspirations for a better world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\'<strong>Culture of Goodwill</strong>\' has a very specific meaning at the UN.  <a href="https://www.lucistrust.org/world_goodwill">https://www.lucistrust.org/world_goodwill</a> .  This information is published at the website of the <a href="https://www.lucistrust.org/">Lucis Trust</a>.  Who is the Lucis Trust?  Why, it’s the <a href="https://www.lucistrust.org/arcane_school">Arcane School</a> of the United Nations, of course and its <a href="http://freemasonrywatch.org/lucistrust.html">spiritual foundation</a>.</p>

             I know my entry went nuts, but wanted to tell you if you didn't see my comment that the eighth card on the Economist cover is missing children stars like on a milk carton.  With a comet over top FFS.

            Sandusky's pedo grooming operation The Second Mile was also famously named by serial pedophile / crime boss George HW Bush as one of the 1000 points of light in the New World Order.  Penn State still hasn't even begun to deal with that mess. I'm on some of their mailing lists and every time a new bombshell comes out where John Doe #150 says the administration knew all about Sandusky for decades or something like that, there's an email whining about how John Doe #150's claims are unsubstantiated and nobody should believe them et cetera. That's all well and good except for the fact that John Doe #149 and John Doe #151 pretty much say the same things even though they graduated a decade apart, never met each other, and currently live in different states.  No wonder cover up artist Louis Freeh got called in to deal with the whole mess. Supposedly Sandusky was running a multi-state operation and Pennsylvania is a keystone state in the national organized elite pedophile scene.

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 Under Wells' tutelage, Huxley was first introduced to Aleister Crowley. Crowley was a product of the cultist circle that developed in Britain from the 1860s under the guiding influence of Edward Bulwer-Lytton -- who, it will be recalled, was the colonial minister under Lord Palmerston during the Second Opium War. In 1886, Crowley, William Butler Yeats, and several other Bulwer-Lytton proteges formed the Isis-Urania Temple of Hermetic Students of the Golden Dawn. This Isis Cult was organized around the 1877 manuscript "Isis Unveiled" by Madame Helena Blavatsky, in which the Russian occultist called for the British aristocracy to organize itself into an Isis priesthood.

                <p>
                 In 1937, Huxley was sent to the United States, where he remained throughout the period of World War II. Through a Los Angeles contact, Jacob Zeitlin, Huxley and pederast Christopher Isherwood were employed as script writers for MGM, Warner Brothers, and Walt Disney Studios. Hollywood was already dominated by organized crime elements bankrolled and controlled through London. Joseph Kennedy was the frontman for a British consortium that created RKO Studios, and "Bugsy" Siegel, the West Coast boss of the Meyer Lansky syndicate, was heavily involved in Warner Brothers and MGM.

                Huxley is also fairly credibly tied to the CIA and MKUltra by

                On a few recent podcasts on Gnostic Media, I can't recall which in particular,
                <a href="http://www.gnosticmedia.com/">
                 possibly episode 52, 53, or 54
                </a>
                , they briefly talk about theosophy.  If you listen to podcasts they're pretty good, though they back up claims in previous episodes and simply present certain elements as fact.  However, I've looked into it, and recommend anyone does, that Gordon Wasson and much or all of the major instigators of the LSD counterculture (Leary, Huxley) were connected to CIA and intelligence.

                  They say the reference to the return of Christ applies generally to all people and religion, but seems to be a coded way of duping Christians, because Alice Bailey's page shows she's clearly not for Christianity.  Not that I am pro-Christianity, but that seems deceptive to me.

                   Yes, there is deep deception here but I can't seem to get to the core of it.  The Bailey story is the official story of the Lucis Trust and therefore, of the United Nations.  But it doesn't make sense to me.

                    Ah, I had only had a chance to read through your post a little when I first commented, so I didn't realize that's what Lucis Trust is (I got caught up in the HW Bush connection - CIA of course).

                    But yeah, the real question is why of any of this shit associated with the UN?  We're given a picture that the UN is a meeting place of the different countries to work out international disputes, not promote some New age quasi-religious bullcrap.
