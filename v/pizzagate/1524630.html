            Allegedly, the UN and WHO (whose trucks were involved in shipping weapons to Syria) inserted a section into Obamacare that seem to be an attempt to covertly pre-legalize mass murder?
           </p>
           <p>
            The WHO is run by its major donors, Bill Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation both of which are major donors to the Clinton Foundation, implicated in Pizzagate.

             The WHO is financed by contributions from member states and outside donors. As of 2012, the largest annual assessed contributions from member states came from the United States ($110 million), Japan ($58 million), Germany ($37 million), United Kingdom ($31 million) and France ($31 million).[94] The combined 2012–2013 budget has proposed a total expenditure of $3,959 million, of which $944 million (24%) will come from assessed contributions. This represented a significant fall in outlay compared to the previous 2009–2010 budget, adjusting to take account of previous underspends. Assessed contributions were kept the same.

            <p>
             In recent years, the WHO's work has involved increasing collaboration with external bodies.[96] As of 2002, a total of 473 non-governmental organizations (NGO) had some form of partnership with WHO. There were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal "official relations" – the rest being considered informal in character.[97] Partners include
             <strong>
              the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

            If the CF and/or its donors are involved in pizzagate (pedogate) activities that include the potential deaths of children, could this "legal executions" section in Obamacare, if real, be an attempt to legalize satanic ritual abuse of children?  Is that the item that is listed as "specified" while nothing at all is specified?
            <strong>
             Nothing is mentioned or described,
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are the items listed, only one of which is currently a means of legal execution in the US:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.centralx.com/diseases/icd889.htm">
             ICD 9 E 978 “Legal Execution”
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            All executions performed at the behest of the judiciary or ruling authority [whether permanent or temporary] as:
           </p>
           <pre><code>- asphyxiation by gas

- beheading, decapitation (by guillotine)

- capital punishment  

       [This is not a means of execution.]

- electrocution

- hanging 

- poisoning 

       [This does not say "lethal injection."]

- shooting 

-  **other specified means**

- Injury undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted 

       [How can it be a "legal execution" if it is accidental?]
</code></pre>
           <p>
            It sounds unbelievable but then whoever heard of using a secretary of state having sarin gas sent to terrorists and then blaming the deaths on the head of that country, as a war crime, in order to try to justify bombing the country to "save" it from their innocent president.
           </p>
           <p>
            For that matter, who can believe anyone would eat babies?
           </p>
           <p>
            George Webb is exposing how sarin gas is being used to clear areas for pipelines and also as part of trafficking children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice how disease (not independently confirmed) is being used by the WHO/UN to get vaccine teams into areas that the US or CF have a military interest in toppling.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             UNICEF oversaw the starvation deaths of at least 250,000 Somalis, mainly children, during the last “Great Horn of Africa Drought” and famine of 2010-2012 (at the time the worst in 60 years) all the while being led by Anthony “Tony” Lake, former National Security Advisor to President Bill Clinton and failed nominee to head the CIA (nomination withdrawn following corruption reports).
            </p>
            <p>
             Under Tony Lake’s direction, UNICEF only budgetted US$35 million for 2011 to feed a million Somali refugees.
            </p>
            <p>
             .... Ten cents a day is not enough to feed anyone anywhere on this planet and Tony Lake knows this better than most, and deliberately and knowing full well what the result would be, failed to provide food for those most vulnerable, children, entrusted to his care. Mass murder by starvation took place - genocide, really.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is not the first time Tony Lake has been involved in genocide for he was Bill Clinton’s National Security Advisor in 1994 and later admitted publically that he knew about and did nothing to prevent the genocide in Rwanda, something he “regretted.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            UNICEF works with the WHO which is run by 2 top CF donors.  WHO and UN are supposed to have inserted a section into Obama that includes beheadings and various forms of mass murder.  Is the section real?  If so, was CF involved in getting it into Obamacare?
           </p>
           <p>
            What is listed in that section is horrific.  But one item is strangely not described.  What could be worse that beheadings as a means of "executing"?  Could it be Infanticide and cannabalism, the deepest concerns behind and reason for the pizzagate investigation?
           </p>
           <p>
            Hoping people look into an area not touched before - health - but clearly a perfect cover for many things.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this Obamacare section is real, who inserted it and with whose authority?  Is it legal for a non-US organizations to insert sections into US law?  Is it a pre-legalization of satanic murder and cannibalism?
