It\'s good to know these things so here it is. 
There is somebody in charge to complain to, Von Hansen Alertsense CEO who made Laura Sislby VP at Alertsense which is the main computer Amber ALert uses. Interoperable. This is VON HANSENs public contact info for work.

<p>Von Hansen Idaho Sislby Alertsense</p>
<p>MyStateUSA CEO, Claudia Bitner, founder of MySateUSAappointed Silsby-Gayler the CFO and corporate secretary in 2011. MyStateUSA changed its name to AlertSense&nbsp; Von Hansen is now the CEO and owner. Hansen announced Sislby-Gayler is, as of, October 2015 the VP of Marketing. In October or 2015 Laura Silsby (now Laura Gayler) married Norman Gayler of Nampa Idaho. Von Hansen is a former HP VP whose son, Blake Hansen, of Alturas Capital in Eagle Idaho invested in MyStateUSA in 2011. </p>

<p>Looking at Alertsense headquarters Boise. Boise, it does have history that pertains to this investigation, this post is part of that pizzagate investigation as to why is silsby at amber alerts? shes a child kidnapper? Boise is Home of its own personal 1955&nbsp; Pizzagate called THE BOISE HOMOSEXUAL SCANDAL , with a number of 100 boys having sexual contact with elites. The investigation turned ugly and went away. It sounds like from reading a tiny bit that they tried to frame ending the investigation because it was focused unfairly on gays.&nbsp; And reflecting badly on the state.

<p>This software engineer interview review on glass door.&nbsp; Com is interesting cause it&apos;s bad short and lists the job that was interviewed for, so you could ostensibly find that person. But after it, like directly, Alertsense actually comes on the interviewed persons review and attached to it a sort of total fake apology/shaming and they sort of tried to say this person is lying about the whole thing, and they don&apos;t know them. So here&apos;s the short review of an interview process with Alertsense <a href="https://ibb.co/iG0w7F">https://ibb.co/iG0w7F</a></p>

revealing the tech connection of human trafficking. From this article 
There are over 3,000 animal shelters in the United States but less than 300 beds for sex trafficking victims that are children,&quot; Jost said, drawing gasps from the audience.

<p>&quot;Boise is kind of a hub stop where you have these human traffickers who travel with these girls all over the country. They may be on their way from, say, Denver or Salt Lake City. What&apos;s a natural place to stop but Boise? They may be in Boise for a day or two, but then they&apos;re gone,&quot; Pacheco said.&lt;br&gt;</p>
<hr />
<p>Seems like boys are targeted in Idaho too though to me. Getting rid of Silsby is pointless when the remaining people are the ones that tried to lift her up, speaking about Von Hansen, how should he be held accountable for the promoting of a kidnapper to higher level of vp of Alertsense? I say fire them all. Not to be trusted. Hello they got all these gadgets.</p>

           "Boise is kind of a hub stop where you have these human traffickers who travel with these girls all over the country. They may be on their way from, say, Denver or Salt Lake City. What's a natural place to stop but Boise? They may be in Boise for a day or two, but then they're gone," Pacheco said.&lt;br&gt;

           Seems like boys are targeted in Idaho too though to me. Getting rid of Silsby is pointless when the remaining people are the ones that tried to lift her up, speaking about Von Hansen, how should he be held accountable for the promoting of a kidnapper to higher level of vp of Alertsense? I say fire them all. Not to be trusted. Hello they got all these gadgets.

            I think the key about Idaho is Mormonism. I am not blaming all Mormans at all but the CIA has been placed in positions of power in the Mormon Churh...think Mitch Rimney. They are very secretive and follow the laws of the sect not if the constitution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Operation Under Railroad is an example of this. It is funded and run by ex-military snipers as a Mormon child trafficking rescue group. They are not. They are involved in trafficking and organ harvesting themselves.They make a few low level "John" arrests to seem legit.

             YES!  We had an article about the Railroad group in Haiti and it turned out to be bogus.  It is great that we are all working together to root out these Sick Fakes. It is bad enough going after those we know are complicit, but bad actors parading as good samaritans or undercover rescuers is something altogether different.  But thank God we have good people on here with open eyes and ears.  EDIT:  If I remember correctly, they were from Australia. Land of Antony Kidman.

               I appreciate all your posts and all your rage. Fundamental uncertainty is our enemy family is bonded by knowledge. The opposite of denial of atrocieties done to self/others (color code green).  Contrasted with that knowledge of atrocities done ap on oneself as you said YOU ARE BEING FKT WITH well so am I. I think they may just have took my kid. If I fight for ger, maybe I'll get killed. They have more power. And have done this atrocity thru the county state turned against. Commited SiN I believe and God is handling it. Thank you for your rage against child fucking gaggots. I need to learn more about the oto you speak of.

                  You can call a US call conferencing number and enter the chat room on a regular DMTF PSTN phone - home line  if you are not PC savvy, or you can listen online even without logging in as a guest on talkshoe. Tech savvy people can call for free with a SIP client. I don't run talkshoe. The only safe way if you have made posts and you think the deep state is after you is to use an anon vpn and sip to call in.

                    I guess I could put on a show and invite him into the chat anon as a guest :) He'd like that hey to hear people talking about him. And then he can say we are all mental because we oppose pedophilia normalization - which is the normalization of the metal illness known as pedophilia!

                    I've got documents proving that homosexuality wasn't properly de-listed from the DSM-IV on American Psychological society letterhead. That would trigger him.

                       Luke-- I apologize, but I have an aversion to trolls ("darkmath" fpr example). I think that they're a waste of time and effort-- although I understand the reason that other people do it and so I don't judge. I prefer to be in a supportive environment (such as supporting you)-- while others balk at that and call it an "echo chamber." I greatly prefer hearing an echo than engaging with morons.

                  .  Come on the talk show. Its not a debate, its just you saying who u are and why you hate pedophiles and us saying us too. We all are sick by it and that  there's something to gain by exposing it. Possibly some child's life and possibly dignity that all kids deserve. Protection.

                   The burden of proof isn't on me. His "proof" I'm Drew West Best is based on "sentence structure". Is that proof beyond a reasonable doubt?

                     Yes a long time ago. All I know is Laura Silsby was desperate for money when she went to Haiti. Her business went bankrupt about that time. I highly suspect she was acting as a "Finder" for a child trafficking network and she used the Christian Missionaries as cover.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Basically I think Laura Silsby is the Spawn of Satan.

                           Here in America a prosecutor has to convene a Grand Jury to bring a criminal trial. Innocent until proven guilty holds there as well.

                          <p>
                           Would a Grand Jury bring a trial based on "sentence structure"?

                                Hey DarkMath. Sorry, man. There is nothing we can do about threat comments unless they involve direct threats to your real life identity (i.e. you have to show evidence to mods the person really knows who you are and where exactly you live and is making a credibile threat). Downside of Voat's anti-censorship policy.

                                  Stop swearing at people again and again at people and then roleplaying the victim when they beat you in an argument. It's a poofter tactic to get power from authority by claiming your a victim when you are the troll who harrases people first. typical boylover

You should only fear for your life if you are are DREW WEST PEDO PRESS AND I KNOW WHO YOU ARE assuming you are a pedophile, adn you are threatened by my earlier statement that I will kill all proven pedophiles I come across and have the means to do so - and your not in my country unfortunately so what are you worried about?

                                    Bitches please.... A persons most useful asset is not the ability to wreck each other, but a heart full of love, an ear ready to listen, &amp; an hand willing to help. You both sound like Neo-Nazi's and are causing this community a lot of harm.

                                    I completely understand your points concerning DarkMath. I've also had run-ins with him, sometimes, he's like a pot with poison, but so is everybody else, we are all fuck ups in our own unique little ways.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    I've gone over your claims, but the evidence you offer is weak and flimsy. Please do not take it the wrong way. Even if you was right and math did enjoy being slapped around by cocks, it doesn't make him a pedophile. I have many friends who are gay, unfortunately, that's the way the world is, people are products of their own fucked up environment. Its not their fault and it certainly doesn't make them monsters who get kicks off raping babies.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    So both of you, stop crying like little bitches, have a scotch, smoke a cigar and eat some leeks.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    DarkMath, you keep down voating me into oblivion.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    hojuruku, you want someone to take your shit out on. For the world being so gay.

                                          How the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) publishes disinformation articles about pro-family leaders
Here's what they've written about Brian Camenker of MassResistance
Attempts to misinform and demonize.
May 5, 2017
The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) libels pro-family, conservative, and Judeo-Christian organization around the country as “hate groups.” The SPLC also posts recklessly untrue, inaccurate, and dishonest articles about individual pro-family leaders. Unfortunately, these articles are often referenced as “fact” by leftwing websites, Wikipedia authors, and the mainstream media.
For example, here are excerpts from the SPLC’s article that includes Brian Camenker of MassResistance.
Here's what the SPLC writes about Camenker -- and the truth below.
At a 2006 religious right gathering in Washington, D.C., Camenker insisted that gays were trying to get legislation passed to allow sex with animals. "One bill in Massachusetts takes away all the penalties for bestiality," he claimed. "This is where this [homosexual] agenda is going." A little later, he added, "They [gays and lesbians] are pushing perversion on our kids."
SPLC writes this as if Camenker was falsely claiming that the LGBT lobby was trying to repeal the bestiality statute (Ch. 272, sec. 34). But in fact, the LGBT lobby DID quietly file bills to repeal it – not only in 2006 but several times since then, including a bill filed in the recent 2015-2016 session. It was bizarre. Luckily, none of them have ever gotten out of committee.
The basic point is that the Left (and particularly the LGBT movement) is trying to overturn all laws concerned with sex that they consider “archaic”.
In 2006-2007, Mass-Resistance pushed for an amendment of the 1996 statute that would have required that parents be notified of any discussion of gay or lesbian issues in the schools. The group proposed language that lumped sexual orientation (which includes heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality) in with criminal behaviors like bestiality and polygamy.
This is not accurate and purposely misleading. The bill (S321) didn’t reference “discussion” of anything. It said that if schools were “presenting, implementing, or maintaining a school program” that included a list of subjects (all connected to sexuality), then parents are given the option to “opt in” to that program – not forced to “opt out” if they didn't want their child included. It’s completely reasonable.

                                          Why do you hate me for exposing LGBTI leadership is fighting to make dog fucking legal? Is it wrong to be against dog sex normalization like pedophilia normalization too? Is that why you troll me pedo lover? What drives you to hate someone who clearly hates child and dog sex so much? That is the question everyone needs to think about here.

                                            It's personal here is why: My dad was accused of the crime of linking to a video about Mark Netwon and PEter truong raping babies, then used science against the faggot trolls by saying faggots are more likely to rape kids according to the US library of congress. For making a scientific argument he was sued for his free speech by a gay child fucking pedophile who sends his penis picture to rent boy child prostitutes - you can see the penis picture he sends. unfortunately i can't share the child porn that was in his email box the boy sent back to him.

                                           <pre><code>Mr McKee said that the audio clip and his comment represented a serious and legitimate concern about an increased risk posed to children brought about through commercial surrogacy. He said that he was discussing the nature and risk of paedophilia in connection with the purchase of surrogate babies by male homosexual couples. He said he was motivated not by hate but by an appreciation of the vulnerability and needs of children. Mr McKee said he also considered public discussion of same sex marriage to be important in Australia due to possible changes in the law. He said that the concerns he raised could influence the state of mind of voters in a future referendum on same sex marriage in Australia. Mr McKee said that it was understandable that public discussion of scientific data relating to the relative incidence of paedophilia within the male homosexual community and compared to the male heterosexual community would be strongly resisted by political lobby groups set up to push for same sex marriage. He said that his one paragraph commentary dealt with what he described as “controversial and challenging” child protection concerns in relation to legalised gay marriage between two males of unknown or unverified sexual orientation.

In support of what he said was the academic or scientific basis for the statement made in the second sentence of the publication Mr McKee referred to the article:
</code></pre>
                                           <p>
                                            “Freund K and Watson R J ‘The proportions of heterosexual and homosexual paedophiles among sex offenders against children: an exploratory study’, Journal Sex Marital Ther. 1992, Spring; 18(1): 34 – 43.”
                                           </p>
                                           <pre><code>He said that a hyperlink to this reference was provided in the internet discussion which followed the 30 December 2013 publication. Mr McKee made reference to the abstract of the article on which he says his statement was based. The abstract and the article were in evidence. The abstract read as follows:
</code></pre>
                                           <p>
                                            “Previous investigations have indicated that the ratio of sex offenders against female children vs. offenders against male children is approximately 2:1, while the ratio of gynephiles to androphiles among the general population is approximately 20 to 1. The present study investigated whether the aetiology of preferred partner sex among paedophiles is related to the aetiology of preferred partner sex among males preferring adult partners. Using phallometric tests sensitivities to calculate the proportion of true paedophiles among various groups of sex offenders against children, and taking into account consideration previously reported mean numbers of victims per offender group, the ratio of heterosexual to homosexual paedophiles was calculated to be approximately 11 to 1. This suggests that the resulting proportion of true paedophiles among persons with the homosexual erotic development is greater than in persons who develop heterosexually. This, of course, would not indicate that androphilic males have a greater propensity to offend against children.”
                                           </p>
                                           <pre><code>In his evidence Mr McKee set out his conclusions based upon his reading of the article saying:
</code></pre>
                                           <p>
                                            “If one is reasonably capable of doing arithmetic, one can roughly apply the above data to, say, a representative sample of 100,000 adults in the Australian population. The ratio of 20:1 referred above implies that there will be 95,200 opposite-sex attracted adults and 4,800 same-sex attracted adults in that sample size. If we now assume, for arguments sake, that approximately 1% of all children suffer from some form of sexual molestation at the hands of an adult, then we can assume that 1000 children have been sexually molested in some way by that sample size of 100,000 adults. The above ratio of 2:1 suggests that, of those 1000 unfortunate children, 667 will be girls and 333 will be boys. The report says that it is rare that an adult female sexually molests a child, so we will ignore such unlikely events and assume that only adult males molest children. Therefore the sample size of 100,000 adults would contain approximately 47,600 opposite-sex attracted males and 2,400 same-sex attracted males. These numbers indicate a ratio of 36 heterosexual adult males per female child sexually molested, but a ratio of 3.6 homosexual males per male child sexually molested. On this simplistic analysis of the data, a homosexual male is 10 times more likely to molest a child than a heterosexual male.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            The Respondent's comment that a homosexual male is three (3) times more likely to sexually molest a child than a heterosexual male therefore appears substantiated.”
                                           </p>
                                           <pre><code>Mr McKee said that he concluded upon the basis of the material in the article and his calculation as he put it “society faces a significantly increased risk of sexually abused children if two men of unknown and unverified sexual orientation are legally permitted to marry in the same way as a man and woman are legally permitted to marry.”

Mr McKee was cross examined on his expressed motivation for the publication and as to the relative incidence of paedophilia among homosexual persons when compared with heterosexuals. He said that it was “a combination of status quo views combined with concern for scientific data that suggest that homosexual men are ten times more likely to have paedophilic sexual orientation compared to the same sample size of heterosexual males”. He said that this was his opinion based upon his scientific research. He said that he had consulted other people on the technical paper and they had come back with similar conclusions. He did not elaborate on who those people were or the specific nature of their conclusions. He said:
</code></pre>
                                           <p>
                                            “Even though it’s unpalatable for the homosexual community, the fact is that you can make other generalisations about the homosexual community, for example, ACON says that the use of drugs is much, much higher in the homosexual community that in the heterosexual community, probably by a factor of ten. Justice Kirby says the prevalence of Aids is higher in the homosexual community. That is not inciting hatred. So I say the prevalence – based on my scientific research and my gut feel and based on the YouTube clip that the instance of paedophilic sexual orientation is higher amongst homosexuals than heterosexuals and the YouTube clip demonstrated that”.
                                           </p>
                                           <pre><code>He went on to say:
</code></pre>
                                           <p>
                                            “… but I believe that scientific statement and that’s why I have great concerns about two men of unknown sexual orientation being allowed to marry in Australia and adopt babies. I see an ocean of suffering in the future caused by this. I am entitled to have that pessimistic view of same sex marriage – mainly between men …”.
                                           </p>
                                           <pre><code>Mr McKee was also cross examined on the difference between the publication in which he stated that homosexual men are three times more likely to commit sex crimes against children and his statement in the evidence in which he said they were ten times more likely to offend. He responded:
</code></pre>
                                           <p>
                                            “The three times was a less onerous comment. That was based on calculations done at the time based on percentaging the Australian census … number of homosexuals in the Australian population based on the 10% figure that 10% of all crimes against children were done by homosexual paedophiles, whereas when I researched the actual scientific paper and did calculations on a spreadsheet it came out at ten times …”.
                                           </p>
                                           <pre><code>On further questioning Mr McKee said that it was his honest belief based on his research that homosexual men are ten times more likely to have paedophilic sexual orientation compared with the same sample size of heterosexual men and that he was being conservative in the estimate contained in the publication.

I have no desire to fight with you. I'm actually just as anti-Pedophile as you are and probably more so. You're fighting the good fight but you need to be cool.

                                               Ever hear of Robespierre and his downfall during the French Revolution? He lead the charge against the French Aristocracy. He took them on almost single handedly. Then he started attacking anyone that would criticize him. He thought everyone was out to get him and he start killing friend and foe alike.

                                               Long story short he was one of the last to get guillotined because he wouldn't listen to reason. I'm not saying you'll get "guillotined" I'm just saying in these kind of things it's easy for people to become judge, jury and executioner. They stop being rational and then everything turns to shit.

                  Call me up anonymously through talkshoe. I wont know where you are - you can use skype to call american number, or sip over the internet for free. Debate me with your voice just like you are doing with your keyboard. It wil prove to all I was wrong about you being Drew west Press. You don't want to prove me wrong, because all can see I am right about you being a faggot pedophilia normalization activist and NAMBLA supporter as exposed on the thread above.

                   You are using a logical fallacy called the
                   <a href="https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof">
                    Burden of Proof Fallacy
                   </a>
                   . Here's its definition:
                  </p>
                  <h2>
                   burden of proof
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                   You said that the burden of proof lies not with the person making the claim, but with someone else to disprove.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The burden of proof lies with someone who is making a claim, and is not upon anyone else to disprove. The inability, or disinclination, to disprove a claim does not render that claim valid, nor give it any credence whatsoever. However it is important to note that we can never be certain of anything, and so we must assign value to any claim based on the available evidence, and to dismiss something on the basis that it hasn't been proven beyond all doubt is also fallacious reasoning.

                    Example: Bertrand declares that a teapot is, at this very moment, in orbit around the Sun between the Earth and Mars, and that because no one can prove him wrong, his claim is therefore a valid one.

                    Anyone can see you can't disprove the claims I made against you. You don't want to pick up the phone and prove me wrong. It's not fucken hard to call me up anon using talkshoe.com You can debate me live, I wont even mute you. We can make a podcast going at it - and all of /pizzagate/ will get some entertainment. Rather than seeing your whining posts, people can hear your whining voice. It will be awesome.

                    It's actually possible to provide the proof I'm seeking not something IMPOSSIBLE. So you didn't even use the logical fallacy website properly you fucken moron.

                        Drew West Press go fuck yourself - This stigma of supporting pedos to get kiddy fuck dolls and trying to deny that NAMBLA icons are forced on little kids by Californian Bill SB 48 as a topic to be studied will follow you around pizzagate until you prove me wrong. Why don't you call up someone else on talkshoe or some other website to debunk me?
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        It may not prove anything if you don't line it up right fucken now. All you have to do on the call to totally debunk me is within 10 seconds paste a phrase that I tell you to paste. OR we can get someone else like
