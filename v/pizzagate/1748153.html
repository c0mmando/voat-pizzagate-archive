<p>why is Alex Gatekeeping for CNP?</p>
<p>Well maybe because a little bit of research into them will take you from Rothschilds all the way to Trump.</p>
<p>Well first we can start with you see Jerome Corsi (Washington correspondent Infowars) is a member of CNP - council for national policy.</p>
<p>As is Bannon. Conway. Erik Prince of blackwater fame. Oliver North. Iran Contra. Cocaine running under Bush. So we see the same necons of Bush cabinet, behind Trump this time around. Breitbart was founded by the Mercer family..</p>
<p>The Mercer family are an old Rothschild proxy, very old money.
Its a rarely discussed but very relevant fact that Mercer was decisive in securing key positions for his long time family advisers - Kellyane Conway &amp; Robert Bannon . In addition to working as assets on Mercer family projects, Mercer had Conway organise the spending for Cruz\'s failed campaign. . After which they changed their support to Trump. The Mercer Foundation also happens to be the #1 financier of CNP. You may have seen Rebekah Mercer named as part of Trumps transition team.</p>
<p>150 CNP members recently signed a draft of an executive order, to protect Religious Liberty .</p>
<p>If signed it would create wholesale exemptions from a range of nondiscrimination laws and regulations “for people and organizations who claim religious objections to same-sex marriage, premarital sex, abortion, and trans identity.”</p>
<p>After 8, years of liberal policies from Obama, the introduction of such a bill is designed to cause extreme unrest and division. As is always the case- when we fight each other, we remain blissfully unaware of the hidden hands.</p>
<p>So it becomes clear, not only is Trump controlled opposition, but the alternative media that support him, his advisers, shady conservative think tanks that produce his policy and the (sadbuttrue)worlds most recognisable conspiracy personality are all Rothschild/ Cabal entities. Alex has acknowledge his family worked in the CIA.</p>
<p>None of this new however. If you\'ve been following Trumps cabinet picks, you might remember Wilbur Ross?. Working for Rothschild inc in 1990 Ross helped Trump avoid bankruptcy after the latter missed multiple bond payments on the struggling Taj Mahal. At the time it was known Trumps finances were unravelling and he\'d been unable to secure finances until Rothschild Inc sent Ross to save the day.</p>
<p>When asked why he\'d made a deal with Trump, Ross insisted that Trump was worth saving. &quot;“The Trump name is still very much an asset,” he said.</p>
<p>The Rothschild were wise to deploy Mercer &amp; Ross to assist Trump over the years, they certainly seem to have accquired a prime asset in Trump, no doubt. The President of the United States is fully under Rothschild/Cabal control. A traitor is in the White House.</p>',

            Also somewhat connected is Trump's ties to Evangelicals.  Many of these same themes regarding Satanism, MK Ultra, NWO etc also pop up:

            The only way i can see Trump being an asset too, is if they fully expect and want society to breakdown and turn into uprisings and they used him to drive it, maybe he doesn't even know that's what the plan is. For someone with a 160 IQ i find that hard to believe. I saw legitimate fear in opponents eyes and body language, i see every day the force of the deep state against him and i see the drive toward world war inching closer. I think we will see something big happen one way or the other around or before the china/russia/nato meetings in the first week of April. There's a reason NATO and deep state puppets keep pushing for a meeting before he meets with putin and xi jinping.

             These Rothschild owners don't take into account  peons like Clinton.   Her wikileak email to Lynn Rothschild shows her grovelling and snivelling to do her bidding, while  Rothschilds tweet about  J podesta shows that they are disposable and useful idiots.  These pawns are richer useful idiots than the average plebs like you and me, but plebs none-the-less and at some level I suspect these plebs know it. That's why they grovel and do their bidding.
