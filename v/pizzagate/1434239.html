I apologize in advance if this has already been posted and discussed here as well as the lack of links and actual quotes.  I have never signed up under blogs before but, after having thoroughly read through comments and articles from posts on this site, and after doing some light research, I might have a theory and the more I think about it, the more I\'d like to get others perspective as to whether or not I am way off point or not.   Please have patience with the length of this.  It will all tie together at the end.  I was reading the FBI Anon Q &amp; A\'s, Anon mentions looking into Eliza Lam bizarre death.  Which lead me to the now-famous elevator video.  I believe the video shows that she is aware she is being followed and was jumping out to try and catch them following her.  Either she finally catches them or they know she has seen them so  they begin a monologue of some kind. In the video it appears she is speaking to someone out of camera range.  Now I looked up the approx dates in the area that this death occurred.  The only thing that stood out was an outbreak of tuberculosis within a few miles ( maybe even quite less) of the hotel, I believe a few months before she went missing.  It is my theory that she discovered she was being followed and, having confronted them, they, whomever, she thought she had shaken them off her trail.  I think her goal was to test the water in the tank (reminiscent of Erin Brokovitch) - IMO to confirm her theory on deliberate water contamination.  I\'ll bet she went up there at night, so as not to be seen, unaware  she was  still being followed, was murdered and thrown into the tank.  I then looked at (per FBI Anon) large corporations associated with CF, which led me to a post on here about a company called Tavistock.  &quot;In short, Tavistock is an organization interested in mass psychological persuasion, particularly through crisis creation, to make large amounts of individuals rally behind a united cause and deteriorate morale, and psychological persuasion, particularly that involved in child development.&quot; Tavistock was involved in a court action a few years before. It involved a woman named Kim Noble.  Kim Noble was mentioned in a court case involving her claim that she was a Tavistok Institute victim and was a test subject who went public with her accusations of satanic child abuse.  She somehow ends up BACK at Tavistok for &quot;therapy&quot; and then takes back her claims. Turns out, Kim Noble became an artist and her works could be seen on the walls of Comet Ping Pong.  Now I am down the rabbit hole because this leads me to a story about farmers and seeds and how there was a bill attempting to regulate seeds.  There was one lab in particular who is or has created seeds that require replanting each year and spraying them with the laboratory created spray to either kick start the growing process or kill off last years seeds before planting new ones.  Please have patience with me - I am trying to tie this all together.  Now I come to the Zika virus (per FBI Anon) and how (once again from a post on here)  the virus was laboratory created.  And what do we see them doing to combat the virus?  spraying to kill the mosquito\'s who carry the virus. And one side effect of Zika are babies born with small heads.    SO here is my attempt to tie in my entire theory based on what I have learned, mostly from other people\'s posts.  FBI Anon kept saying what could be worse than killing babies, satanic cults and dismemberment?  He kept saying it was much bigger than a pedo-ring.  What would be so huge as to possibly trigger a civil war as well as possible world wars?  I think that if we were to find out that our own gov. is regulating population by introducing disease through certain means, it would certainly cause a civil war.  And if these same techniques were also used on other countries, that could trigger a world war.  Remember, these secret societies claim that they must rid the globe of at least 1 billion people.  Combine war, disease, drought (weather manipulation) starvation and poor to no medical care (Obamacare) it makes for a sure fire way to start filtering out society.  I think that the major laboratories connected to all of this have been creating forms of viruses etc., and quietly distributing it to society, not only through the virus they created i.e, Zika, but in the spray they use to ward off the mosquito\'s. We reacte to the fear of the sisease and they introduce a fake spray to solve it.  The object of Zika provides 2 benefits for them: 1. it is &quot;dumbing down society by creating babies with birth defects such as smaller heads as well as providing an avenue to spray additional hazards in the guise of protecting us from it while actually causing population reduction.  And the farmers seeds, if it is true, may also have harmful side - effects in the very spray they provide to start and stop the growing process.  It is also probably in the seeds. Here again provides them with multiple benefits; 1. farmers must purchase regulated seeds each year, instead of using heirloom seeds - which creates another huge cash flow and 2; reduction in human population through human consumption as well as air-borne and water borne diseases.  Then I came across a post from a gentleman who described wifi signals? cement slabs where he drilled holes in the cement slabs and one just kept draining while the other holes filled up.  As someone stated, it might have easily been an underground bunker of some sort.  I think it is part of an underground tunnel network.  When following the Malheur Refuge Takeover, I started looking into the land around Oregon with regards to CF/BLM (Bureau of Land Management) stealing the land from the ranchers and selling it for it\'s mineral rich plutonium. I found out there are miles upon miles of massive underground tunnels in and around Oregon.  Most are used to hold Masonic meetings with some having bleacher seating in them.   Others are equipped with small roadways, vehicles, lighting....Once I started researching tunnels throughout the US (and they are EVERYWHERE) and reading about the tunnels in Washington DC, I realized that these tunnels may serve for human trafficking.  Anon said it is about HUMAN trafficking, not just children and sex slaves.  Which made me wonder if the human trafficking also provides the big pharma laboratories the humans necessary to test their different viruses, sprays, diseases etc.  And another benefit?  the huge amounts of money going back and forth between the sex rings, AS WELL AS the human trafficking ring supplying test subjects to pharma\'s. Read in Wikileaks where John Podesta was involved with the &quot;accidental death&quot; of three people being used for a  form of illegal pharmaceutical drug or procedure of some kind.  I think the pedo ring (being the worst part of it for me)  isn\'t the main issue.  The pedo ring was a convenient subsidiary of the bigger plan.  As cold as it is, we are dealing with monsters and this was just another added benefit toward the bigger plan and their narcissistic twisted amusement.  Provides another convenient way to smuggle children for their sick agenda\'s.  This last part was also taken from a post on here and would like to give credit to whomever post this was from...&quot;I leave you with a quote from Aldous Huxley, a member of the Tavistock group. &quot;There will be, in the next generation or so, a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude, and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies, so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them, but will rather enjoy it, because they will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda or brainwashing, or brainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods. And this seems to be the final revolution.&quot;   Anyone who stuck around long enough to read this entire comment, I thank you.  P.S.  Not sure whether this was mentioned on here at all but did you know that if you took a birds eye view of Washington, D.C. it forms a perfect owl?  There very street layout, city road map is a clear owl when observed from above.  Did you also know that the Gates Foundation is a huge contributor to vaccines in poor areas of the globe, particularly Africa?  The same place that is ripe with disease, water borne disease, drought, famine....Looks like those vaccines aren\'t serving a purpose very well...or are they? How pissed would the average human being be if they were to find out that not only are &quot;they&quot; creating the diseases, the very care provided to get rid of them is actually another avenue to speed up the disease?  Flu shots?  How do we know whats in them? The average prescription is based on our taking their word for it on the label that it is what it says it is.  FBI Anon - &quot;Open your eyes - its all around you - it\'s right in front of you&quot;.</p>',

            Kim Noble, has 20 personalities as a result of "trauma based mind control" 14 of her 20 peronsalities are artists. Look at the one called Ria Pratt (and especially the one with the white handkerchief under the child being raped.

            Is not Soros connected to Tavistock.
I remeber following the discussion about the FEMA camps a couple of months ago and then there was I brave guy that had filmed when big trucks drow done the tunnels under Walmart. He spoke to one of the drivers that said that the tunnelsystem was enormous.Perfect to have a completely restricted world under our feet. You can have all kinds of businesess there.

            Do not forget about the electromagnetic fields. I have been working with that since 1996. Been to research conferences etc. It is obvious that the microwave radiation is very biologically active meaning it effect us in many ways. According to russian science the most dangerous frequency is between 1-3 Ghz. Almost everything today is approx 2.4 GHZ. If effects memory, concentration, sleep. It can create headache, anxiety, depression, effect the heart and in the long run give you different kind of cancers and demetia. What they have done is that they have put there own people on all the important jobs(commitees, authority) and the MSM are not allowed to even present facts about all the studies that show helth effects. Look up and see for yourself. Here is an example of over 200 scientists trying to warn the public,

           <p>
            Chemtrail, I believe,  is another sinister thing. I have been observing it for 2 years and to me it is obvious. I made an interisting discovery with our water. We have one drilled well(90 metres) and one digged(4 metres). I took two water samples and send it to analysis. The digged one had aluminium leves 100 times higher than the drilled one and we live "in the woods" near a hill and noone lives higher up the hill than we do. Cant find any other explanation than that the aluminium comes from the rain.

           </p>
           <p>
            I saw a very interisting doc from a CIA whistleblower years ago that said that one of the biggest industries today is the chemotherapy industry. Brilliant to first give us cancer and then force us into this treatment although there seems to better ways to cure cancer. Destroying the immune system doesn´t seem to be a good idea to me. And then we die anyway.

            And imagine if they have now taken that one step further and now inject WITH the very disease they are pretending to avoid...To me there is nothing worse than how the children are involved.  However, FBI ANON kept repeating that it is so much bigger than the pedophilia and that was only a small part of it.  Personally, finding out my Gov is actually slowly euthanizing citizens would be disastrous with global implications.

            Good post, I'm totally with you on the vaccines and Bill Gates. Just check if the art of Kim Noble was actually on Comet's walls because I don't think it was. Kim Noble's art was mentioned after the hankerchief email, sorry if I'm wrong. Interesting about the deaths surrounding John Podesta, it was to do with one of his Swiss financial backers by the name of Hansjorg Wyss. I found an article today that I thought was very interesting.

             Good to know about the art work/Kim Noble.  The W.E. article was the incident I was referring to with regards to Podesta.  Made me start thinking about what Anon said about it not only being children but human trafficking.

              Yes I think your on the right track, it all ties in. Makes me wonder what happens to late term abortions and where planned parenthood fits into all this although I suspect we all know the answer.

            Who knows if it's related but there is someone with the last name Alefantis that works on vaccines. From what I've read the name isn't that common which leads me to believe it was changed at some point.

            Whilst the wall of text was a nightmare to read. You do raise good points. There is already so many sneaky methods of depopulation that have existed for hundreds of years... the legality of Ciggerettes &amp; Alchohol, the push to have every human on some sort of ongoing medication, flu shots, mandatory vaccinations become more and more prevalent, cloud-seeding, chemtrails, GMO, is just the tip of the depopulation iceberg!

              Yeah that &amp; the refusal to acknowledge or do anything about climate change as well. 
Even just the simple fact of fast food costing vs buying wholesome food is ridiculously skewed &amp; a large reason for why lower socioeconomic brackets suffer from weight &amp; poor eating habit related issues.

               Have you read the Paris Agreement regarding climate change?  It goes off into many documents and sidelines -but skim it. They take about emissions must be controlled to reduce the change. Think PEOPLE!  All countries have actually ageed to reduce emissions- by a certain count and by a future year and this was effective 2016!  Reread it thinking people = emissions. It says there will be no penalty yet, if each country does not meet the goal of reducing emissions by their date. This is the UN we are talking about- a new world order government body. If they are talking people- and they all know, we just don't know!!! Trump is a nationalist and wants out of the UN. Meaning he is not Illuminati, or wanting a new world order. Reading that agreement will give you some sleepless nights.

                This was exactly where my mind kept going.  He said to open yours eye s because its right in front of you and much bigger.   WE are the emissions.  WE to them, are consuming far too much food, drinking up the water, using precious resources.  Our shadow government has already sold water rights to other country's, Clinton sold plutonium to Russia,  Africa being the second largest continent and having the largest mining operation on the planet.....gold, uranium, diamonds, oil ...all there for the taking.  Makes sense that they would test de-population programs out in a land rich in valuable minerals and where the population has been broken by drought (weather manipulation), famine and disease.

                 I have no clue where to go w any of this information but FBI guy said it much larger, worse than we can imagine. That's about as bad as I can think. I agree re the Gates and their meds. In fact who knows what's in any meds, vitamins, food, ANYTHING anymore. Terrifying. What do you do with a theory- is there a main person to tell on this site?  What could they do either?  Does someone actually monitor and read all these posts?

                Ive found that any document related to climate change if you assume that emissions = people then youve got a fairly good idea of what they actually mean.

                 Scary right?   All the Dems talk about is climate change. I got curious and started reading, found the actual document, and it spells out in detail what each country promises to reduce in emissions by a specific date. What if climate change is a code in plain sight, just like all this pizza = sex.

            Have you seen the Illuminati Stones in Georgia?  The first order is re population control. I like the theory above. I think, as described, the sex, Satan are secondary to Illuminati orders. These people want, and fully expect to rule everything and everyone. Baring a nuclear war, which would make the world inhabitable for a very long time &amp; in actuality they may not survive-how can you get rid of a whole lot of people easily. Disease or poison.
           </p>
           <p>
            Using the theory above, Monsanto is going to slowly poison us, I'm sure there are others. I won't take the flu shot, I'm convinced it makes me sick- and maybe what if it really does?  I gave no doubt they could cure cancer by now, but instead what if they are actually doing the opposite?  Even prescription drugs- what really is in them. We believe they are tested and approved, but approved to kill us instead?  I am not usually a doubter of the government, but just the opposite now. What is true is not. Think- what they say is true is actually false-  it's in the Bible, Isaiah.
           </p>
           <p>
            My point being that it is bigger than child abuse, it's people abuse to reduce the population, and reduce the world to the Illuminati tenants. Again pls google Illuminati stones in Georgia, in USA. Creepy. Read the history too-  frightening in fact.

             Weird but I was going to mention the Georgia Guide stones and left it out because the post was too long as it is.  They actually removed one of the stones and when they turned it around, it had a number on each side of the stone cube.  People on you tube were breaking up the cube and taking pieces as a souvenir.  I found that a rather disturbing reaction as I wouldn't want any piece of their agenda anywhere near me. Perhaps those who wanted a piece of it didn't do enough research.  However, it was clearly evident by some peoples reactions, they HAD clearly done their research and said "nah ha".

             I too relegated the flu shot to the proverbial "bullshit drawer".  All I know is I have been a care giver to far too many loved ones, all ages and a few were cancer related.  In both cases, the individuals took a SERIOUS turn for the worse once they started receiving the treatment.  If the cancer is inoperable, the treatment, IMO is merely a means of speeding up the dying process.

              I saw this, re the breaking of part of the stones. No way would I want a part of that. I just think, and religion is going to come in here- this is good vs evil right here right now. Period. And they are the evil, and want to get rid of enough of us to manage control. Which goes to the quote you cited above. Get us small enough, and controlled enough and they can literally do anything they want. I think I started thinking along this line when the Kayne incident occurred. I think sex with children is just part of their daily life, the sacrifice of children is part of their worship/religion to the evil one Satan, and their basic tenets are the Illuminati. So essentially it is a society like we live now- just based upon inherent evil rather than society via God.
             </p>
             <p>
              None of this of course solves anything to bring them to punishment- but I do think it shows how very dangerous it is. I don't think we are just dealing with normal people here. We are dealing with emissaries of Satan. I think some famous people who died young- maybe they decided not for me, started talking and were killed. The Clinton's are just a part of it in America.
             </p>
             <p>
              Back to religion- I don't know if you have heard of any of the prophecy re Trump, as it relates to Cyrus in the Bible who took down all the evil in Babylon.  If this is so, and what the prophecy says will happen, It will be discovered and Trump will issue America into more religious America or at least one without Satan being in control as is now. And the perpetrators of this child abuse found out and will be punished. It's just interesting to listen to- and I know turns some people off. The guy is on you tube.
             </p>
             <p>
              Personally I would like to get about 100's of us to go into the tunnels all at once. With a big cross. I can't sleep at night thinking about the children

             <p>
              One other idea- the FBIanon said look who the Clinton's were with toward the end of the campaign. I have heard George Clooneys name multiple times. And his wife Amal- who strangely enough represented Julian I believe ( fact check this)as legal counsel.  However George is very very pro Clinton.  That's odd in itself...  HRC spent a lot of time in Hollywood for the campaign and with the FBIanon statement- mmmm a clue in some of those people??

               You are correct and after looking into this, I think you may have stumbled across something that, on the surface seems logical, but take a closer look and it doesn't make sense.  You mention George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin.  Didn't take long to run across this info:  John Jones, Britains top Human Rights lawyer representing Julian Assange was the gentleman they "claimed" suicided by jumping in front of a train at 48 yrs old in April of this year.  John Jones and Amal Alamuddin were colleagues together at the same law firm - Doughty Street.  And it appears you are correct as Amal represented JA in 2011 during his extradition hearing to Sweden, which ultimately lead to him taking up residence in embassy.  JA quoted as saying “Amal is a friend and a lawyer with a global perspective who is not afraid to deal with corruption of power or to tackle politicized cases,” Assange told the London Evening Standard.   Could JA have really been that gullible? I think not.

              <p>
               And I agree 100%.  This is a battle between Good and evil.

                It's very odd to have George on one side and Amal on the other. It appears Amal has switched sides. Which makes me wonder after the marriage was she given secrets that George knew and drawn into the circle?  I saw a video re Hollywood and the elite, Illuminati, essentially selling your soul to the devil type thing. This all would have seemed so far fetched a year ago- not so much now :(

            Makes you wonder about chemtrails. Harald Kautz-Vella's "Bases" lecture would definitely give you some food for thought. Take "mysterious" illnesses like Morgellons. Most of their communities' theories are based on GMO food and high levels of metal in the body (vaccinations, chemtrails, food additives, etc). Your theory could be plausible.

             Having done a wee bit of research on chem-trails.  It didn't take long to realize how simple the process really is.  I even asked friends to make it a point to observe the sky on clear days.  If they noticed chem-trails, I asked them to be observant of certain things such as patterns/grids within the chem-trails and any corresponding weather changes.   A few laughed at me but a few quietly pulled me aside and agreed that there may be something to it. However, the realizations I have learned recently make me look twice and doubt almost nothing.

              Before this election I would have discounted all of this- not now after Wikileakes. We have been a North Korea nation with propaganda news from the government, we just thought we were free. Half the nation is blinded by either stupidity, or brainwashing, or just afraid to think about it.

            Since the advice was given and I took it, how nervous should I be about posting this? I know..."Now you ask?"  Like I said, not very computer savvy, as I clearly just demonstrated in my paragraph-less post.  I know very little about covering my tracks. I debated for days to even post this but as the days went by and I continued reading the copious amounts of knowledge flying around here, I pushed the "fuck it" button.

             The realization you have made is not new at all. It's just that the wall between those who are "awake" and those who are not is crumbling. Believing this stuff means accepting a horrible truth. It's easier to label someone crazy than it is to accept.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's those who have been speaking out for years but whose evidence has been laughed at by the MSM that should be nervous.

             We already have the answers, we have just been prevented from putting the pieces together with hate, selfishness, disconnection and looking out for number one. It's time to put the phones down and look eachother in the eye. We've got some shit to take care of. Mini rant over :)
            </p>
            <p>
             Make sure you have someone to talk to. The rabbit hole branches off into other rabbit holes.

              Yeah - no kidding!  It's the stuff of nightmares, and just when you think it can't get any more bizarre or cruel, it does.I have to step back from it some times.  Take the dog for a walk to clear the head.  I agree that we have become lambs, I only hope it won't be lambs to the slaughter.  I am probably one of the few individuals in the world left who only uses my cell phone in emergencies, don't know my own cell # without looking it up, have never texted and am only vaguely familiar with some of the lingo i.e., lol, imho.  It's always important to be aware of your surroundings and what is going on around you,  Kind of difficult to do that with your head buried in the phone. After all, I do believe it was our collective lack of attention that brought us to where we are now.

              Don't fret about posting on Voat.  if we don't like it, typically it'll just get ignored, unless it's inflammatory.   I love the latest influx of new users, and invite all of them to contribute.  I didn't say or post much until i'd been here quite a while.  I should have started earlier tho.  I had some trepidation about posting, but the more you get involved, the more you'll get involved, which only makes this place better.
