<p>“NOT STUPID  8 weeks ago I was born and raised in AZ, a small town between PHX &amp; TUC. I learned of Midnite productions as an adult. I had moved to Mesa. I met a young girl that years before was held hostage, raped for months by a man known as Peg leg Bill! Through out the years in mesa i met many girls/women that had been connected some way with this group. Peg leg bill his name came up quite often. I dont know why but some of them would open up. They trusted me! I was told he was responsable for the kidnapping of a little girl in mesa years eariler! Mikelle Biggs! At that time in my life I was using meth. I was around bikers &quot; hells Angels&quot;. Its insane because this group all knew what happened to Mikelle Biggs. I assumed they knew because they had found her body. Then one evening sitting in the home of an old school Ex Dirty Dozen /Hells Angels member the 5:00 news came on there was a story about Mikelle Biggs her parents were talking about her how she was still missing! In that home were many hells Angels members, I cant explain the change in the living room when the story came on. They were uncomfortable, I guess would be the word. I just wanted to run out of there. All the info i new i wasn\'t sure who all knew what i was told. I could go on and on with details if I did some can figure out who I am. But Im going to put names out there ones that opened their own mouths with little comments about Mikella Biggs. Some names were said when i was being told what happenen to her. Some of theses people just have info not all were involved! FisherMan Joe Mesa,Az its said he has a copy of the snuff film she was killed in, hes got it hid. Michael Bellowich &quot;Pig&quot; has deep information, his bestfriend was Peg leg Bill. Pam Robles in prison in Az. Shadow shes in prison in Az she as a child was a hostage of the sickos her job was to clean up the small children after they were raped, abused. Melisa Brown from Coolidge Az has info also. Its also been said her body was buired on a property near a cemtary in pinal county between Coolidge and Florence! This ring of sickos goes so deep. It involves law, lawyers, judges! If i were to tell you what all I know it would blow your mind and the proof. I never wanted to know as much as i do. This has been eating me up for years. What blows my mind is these men theses sickos i have been around some most of my life, some just years are all involved or know more than I do! Its all around us here in Az! Joseph Valcarce hes in Tucson. Ray Hurst. Robin Robles. There are so many more names. I think with the ones I put out will bring more info for whom ever wants to dig deeper.”</p>',

            John Hamp is in Phuket Thailand right now. You can only imagine what he’s up to there. Also, his girlfriend is a vet and they are an extremely odd couple, they seem like polar opposites (no not because of race). She appears “normal” he is a gym junkie kiddie porn producer laundering money through his screen printing shitty T-shirt business.

             Yes.  I read in the human trafficking general threads on /pol/ there is a connection between some vet hospitals and child trafficking.  They do use animal drugs, also animal cages, dog collars and leads on trafficked kids.  They also need  places to wash them or fix them up medically.

            Looks like the ATF/Feds infiltrated and rolled right through the Mesa HA chapter a couple years after she went missing-
            <a href="https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/crime/2018/06/15/jay-dobyns-ex-atf-agent-infiltrated-hells-angels-biker-gang-visit-el-paso/699150002/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Side note- Obama visited Mesa a month after she went missing -

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also looks like ATF wasn't very friendly to the agent that went undercover and didn't protect him from retaliation or threats afterwards. I wonder what he heard or knew, to have Obamas ATF treat him like that when he was only doing his job. You think in that case he would've ended up dead by now, but ended up retiring in 2014 so something doesn't add up for moi

             Oh and apparently the police were suspicious of the father right away and ignored other leads. I noticed this pattern when LE is involved with the crime itself, the get the victims advocates and family on the defense right away by accusing one of them instead (likely strategy to hinder their ability to go on offense). My priority in this case would be to find a local power pedo who had influence at that time in that area and who is still alive today. Narrow them down by their actions and response in the wake of the crime, it usually gives them away, can't prove it though usually, but at least you know who to look at and try to catch them in something else down the road now that you know what they really are

             Links below - 1 is of her sister in more recent times appealing to reddit for information or tips, said their neighbor was the likely suspect, behavior matched up afterwards (contacting the family directly, attending the vigil, making comments on the news etc..classic predator moves). Had a trailer the cops couldn't search without a warrant then got rid of it after, since sentenced to 187 years for different crimes.

             2nd link is an account of the parents visiting him in jail to get answers, their intuition was he did it. So now this is '"seeming" like maybe like he did snatch her, took her to HA for their ongoing porn, pedo and prostitution business, wouldn't doubt they partnered with their local power pedos to partake (judges, cops, politicians, businessmen etc), the guy who did the dirty work is locked up for life (same old pattern).

            Fuck the Hells Angels they say they don’t touch women and children BULLSHIT. They run snuff film companies making and producing this shit all over the world. Why do you think they are regularly stationed in Thailand of all places? They are lying deceiving evil psychopaths. Look at the Pickton case in Canada it was shut down immediately when the Hells Angels were mentioned about regularly meeting there and the fact that mens DNA was found all over the place. They were filming snuff films there and the Hells Angels got busted for their snuff film enterprise they flooded the darknet with around the same time. The Freemasons use the HA as their muscle as many of the top members are also Freemasons. Sick fucks.

              Jeff Gannon came out of nowhere-supposedly he was a journalist-more likely he was an asset and prostitution so they would have blackmail and it worked. Jeff Gannon was a prostitute that advertised on a gay military hookup site. He probably Was Johnny.

            One of this guy's friends literally admits that she is a Satanist. Also, there is a lot of panda imagery on his Instagram. There is a Satanic pedo bestiality cult involving those animals.

             The image on the shirts is also a sticker. I saw one on a newer SUV while driving about 4 days ago in Sarasota Fl. I also saw the triangle within sticker a year+ ago. We have a nest of these types here.

               Yeah, but they are also promulgating the stuff to normalize. Lot's of Hollywood lives here part time. Financial, and just plain old fashioned own's stuff. You are correct though.

                 I don't think blood would work as a dye, just as a direct staining agent. But of course this would not be too crazy for the sickos.

            The white man is the devil.  Here you have this Tough ass cracker white boy Hell's Angels group...  they cover for their brother.  The white man is a coward on one hand and the devil on another.  This is your world.  If you want to read about your history, read the book in the Qur'an titled "The Cave".  That is your exact history.  It cracks me up watching you and your dogs, carrying dog shit in a bag, talking to other dog shit bag holders lol...

               In 1880, the age of consent was set at 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of
               <strong>
                Delaware where it was 7
               </strong>
               .[2] The ages of consent were raised across the U.S. during the late 19th century and the early 20th century.[3][4] By 1920 ages of consent generally rose to 16–18 and small adjustments to these laws occurred after 1920.

                 During the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), bacha bazi carried the death penalty under Taliban law.[10]
