            Sounds like your search or browsing history has a lot of Pizzagate in it, and the notifications didn't fully get disabled.
           </p>
           <p>
            So Flipboard read your history and thought you'd like to read some fake news about Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately, such tactics to "serve" you are quite common.

             That's what I thought too, but I dont pay much attention to pizzagate, I only read up about it maybe once it twice a week at most. There is so much more in my browsing history to pull from
