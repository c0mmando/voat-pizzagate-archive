            , this is a very interesting theory. However, I am not seeing how this research helps us stop the trafficking of kids by the global elite? Please repost with an explanation of the direct connection to Pizzagate. How's this about helping kids? Thanks. Removing per Rule 1.

             I'm a little confused by your confusion.  As I mentioned, I believe that this half-century-long parade of trannies is where the Pizzagate victims have been all along.  People (naturally) want to know "where are all the victims?"  Here they are -- at least a whole bunch of them (if I'm right).  So this would answer that key objection, and thus allow us to take the conversation further with many skeptics who currently dismiss what we say.  That, in turn, allows us to expand our ranks and strengthen our force, bringing us closer to success.
            </p>
            <p>
             If I incorporate that explanation into my posting would that suffice to meet your objection?
            </p>
            <p>
             As an aside, it seems rather destructive to delete an entire conversation over something such as this when a simple amendment to the OP should be sufficient to remedy the defect.  What do you think?  (I'm not in any way trying to tear you down personally on this, just pondering the way the system is currently designed.)  Thanks.

              Okay...I see what you are saying. However, it doesn't answer the question of where are the kids this is happening to? If there is a whole industry to turn little boys into leading ladies, where is it? How is it being carried out? Why haven't we heard about it? Wouldn't parents, friends, aunts or uncles or the victims themselves, at least a few of them, resisted and spilled the beans as happened with Cosby, Polanski and others? Pizzagate is about the kids, not adults who can make their own decisions. That's why it didn't satisfy Rule 1.
             </p>
             <p>
              Zales, if I thought there was a good chance you had evidence of child actors and singers being turned into trannies all these years, I would have asked for an edit rather than removing. But I figured you don't, which makes this a purely speculative post supported only by confirmation bias. The current submission rules designate
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
               v/pizzagatewhatever
              </a>
              as the sub for this type of post. If I hadn't removed it, the next mod on duty would have. I have to administer the rules consistently. It's this rule, though, that allows us to remove all the shill forum-sliding posts like those from PGisStupid. Sorry, man.

             <p>
              If you have evidence of kids, please repost this including it here in

              <p>
               Just to separate things out here:  the tranny factor is not speculative.  The connection to PG is.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, I'm not suggesting child actors and singers are being turned into trannies.  I think it's the other way around.  The continual river of trannies which we're now discovering have been in front of us all these years are being cranked out from abused, transgendered kids.  PG... what happened to all the victims?  Tranny invasion... where did they all come from?  I simply suggest that
               <strong>
                the two answers are the same set of people.
               </strong>
               My hypothesis is that the PG abuse victims are the trannies, and vice versa.  Abused when children, placed into celebrity lives as women when they get older.  (I thought I had articulated that in my OP, but I can clarify it further in a repost if that's the problem.)
              </p>
              <p>
               As to
               <strong>
                where
               </strong>
               the conversion industry is, I don't know.  I agree that it must exist somewhere.  Some doctor, or doctors, have to be somewhere doing all of these operations over the years.  I don't know where that somewhere is.  All I do know is that there definitely are a WHOLE LOT of trannies being put in front of us as women in various roles.  Of that I am 100% sure, and so will anyone else be once they follow my leads.  (I've only posted a very small bit of what I've found, and there are many, many more I haven't even thought of looking at yet.)
              </p>
              <p>
               That raises the question of where would all of these trannies be coming from?  It's too many, and they're too alike in their behavior, for this to be only a ton of random, "free-range" individuals.  The Playboy factor alone sinks that possibility.  JMO, I suppose, but it seems intuitively obvious to me.  If so, then there must be some kind of network or system to create them from... some young people.  Somewhere.
              </p>
              <p>
               Is it unrelated only because I can't
               <strong>
                definitively
               </strong>
               say that the PG abuse victims are the trannies?  Are we not allowed to attempt to make such connections collaboratively from a plausible hypothesis, except in /pizzagatewhatever?  If that's the case then I will repost there.  It just seems a little constrictive to me, but if that's the way the system is set up then I will go with it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Thanks again for your time.

                No, I'd say that is definitely speculative. The only proof you've offered is "look at these images and imagine really hard they are men". That is definitely speculative.

                Yes, that's the way the system is set up. Remember: this subverse was founded to forward collaborative research on the Clinton Cabal/Deep State/globalist abuse of kids to blackmail those they wish to control and line their pockets. We set up the multi-sub network to allow the kind of spitballing you are talking about (which is easily twisted and hijacked by disinfo shills, btw) without cluttering up the research focused main board. We DON'T want to shut down brainstorming. That's why we have a sub specifically for it;
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                 v/pizzagatewhatever
                </a>
                . Once you've developed the theory and rounded up some supporting material you can link to, please repost here on the main sub.
               </p>
               <p>
                ZalesMcmuffin, thank you for your lateral thinking, innovative research and your willingness to respect the sub structure. I'm sorry it seems draconian...we have a lot of people paid to disrupt and discourage us here and the rules were created by a lot of savvy Voat goats skilled at wrangling trolls and shills while maintaining a free speech environment. Don't forget there are MANY pizzagate subs other than this one. Do crosspost. Do post links in comments of other submissions asking for help in
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
                 v/pizzagatewhatever
                </a>
                . A lot of our most dedicated researchers do check that sub.

            Wrong and Crazy. The boys are abused then they grow up and turn into James Alefantis he was a boy long ago who was sold into the pedo network and they groomed him and made him a vital part of the network. That's what happens to the boys who don't get killed most of them do end up dead and buried.

            Without arguing the definition of words,  I think I see your point    and it is good that you brought this up
           </p>
           <p>
            maybe, I do not see it as clearly as you do but look, as you said, at Sigourney Weaver - constantly portrayed as A He-Woman for sure.  I completely agree.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also - note that VOAT always deletes these discussions!  We never get to talk about this!
           </p>
           <p>
            The de - masculinization  of men -----  the other side of this coin ---- is rampant.
           </p>
           <p>
            This includes the  "gender fluidity" plan illustrated by the recent you tube video ----  of the  300 lb man who dressed up like a clown woman and had the preschoolers  shake their hips to the transvestite song.
           </p>
           <p>
            My comment on that post included information like this:
           </p>
           <p>
            this is the overall plan. big  Agriculture is spraying thousands of tons of pesticides onto food  which, in studies, changes the sex of frogs and fish
           </p>
           <p>
            big Pharma is injecting vaccines into kids and turning them into zombies.    The definition of "zombie" in that sentence is :   No personality,  no sparkle in the eye.     This has been noted by child photographers among many other professionals who work with children. If you doubt it, walk into Walmart and  look at children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why aren't we allowed to talk about this on VOAT?

            100% stupid. 'models' and actresses often starve themselves to achieve ridiculous standards of 'beauty' - the lack of fat on the female body result in low estrogen levels... and so you see a lanky boy look at times. never mind the fact that Gender is a Spectrum! and if you look long enough for 'trans' features you will find them EVERYWHERE!! all babies actually develop as female first and then later differentiates to become male if correct hormone appears at correct time... labia fuses and clitoris grows to be a penis. consequentially humanity represents a ~rainbow~ of all the myriad possibilities that can be created from this body/brain/chemical interaction. duh.

             Gender is binary.  That's nature.  All else is confusion.  Look carefully enough and long enough at our bodies and this emerges as a clear element of our very selves, not only observable in the binary genitalia, but in many other ways in which our natures are complementary to one another.  I don't see trannies everywhere, only where they actually are.  There are real women, and real men, all around me.  There are even -- I'm pretty sure -- some real women in Hollywood and other prominent places.  Here are some famous ones I currently believe to be female:
            </p>
            <p>
             Miranda Kerr, Taylor Swift, Candice Swanepoel, Demi Lovato, Mischa Barton, Amy Adams, Kristen Wiig, Katie Holmes, Rachel Bilson, Bella Thorne, Maria Menounos, Busy Philipps, Ashley Graham, Uma Thurman, Jennifer Lawrence, Gigi Hadid, AnnaLynne McCord, Lady Gaga, Reese Witherspoon, Beyonce, Vanessa Hudgens, Halle Berry, Lorde, Elsa Pataky, Bella Hadid, Katy Perry, Bella Thorne, Rihanna, Melissa Joan Hart, Rita Ora, Jill St. John, Eva Gabor, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Jayne Mansfield, Ann Miller, Nancy Allen, Betty Brosmer, Kim Novak, Lucille Ball, Shirley Jones, Cheryl Tiegs, Betty Grable, Lynda Carter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Each of those passed at least my initial "smell test" and I got a feminine vibe from them, not a tranny vibe.  I'm probably going to find that some of them fooled me so far.  But I don't think they all did.  I remain sure there are
             <strong>
              some
             </strong>
             real women out there among them.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am glad, though, that you expressed your view, as it helps me understand who would be downvoating my efforts and why.  Thank you for your feedback.

             Gender is not a spectrum, it is actually binary save for hermaphrodites who really wish they were one or the other. Masculinity and femininity are a spectrum, but they are not genders.

               When you do, then gender is non binary. Until then, masculine or feminine simply refer to common traits.

                no, because you are confused, read a book next time. sex and gender are different concepts. sex is binary (but even this is not actually true as intersex and hermaphroditism do occur).... but for your sake i will acquiesce. Gender however is a spectrum with extreme masculinity at one end and extreme femininity on the other. 
ding dong! Class Dismissed!

                 Books are as good/bad as the minds which produce them.  Some books have royally screwed up our minds; others are accurate and can help straighten us out.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I didn't use any books to get where I am now.  I used a very large amount of images and a load of porn, plus my concentration and will to understand what is.  That resulted in becoming aware of both the binary nature of masculinity/femininity as well as the zombie tranny invasion.
                </p>
                <p>
                 That's not to say there aren't any books which might help in the same direction.  Just saying I didn't end up needing any, FWIW.  I only needed to look at our bodies with no distractions and contemplate why they are the way they are, and what it means that they are that way.  Everything followed logically from there.  (Well, that and already being aware of MK Ultra and Pizzagate.)

            Was the real purpose of this post to provide a peep show under the guise of research and debate re: trannies?  This should be deleted ASAP. For every macho woman you identified, I can find a sissyfied man.  And i certainly dont want to see any debate about small breasts equals a masculine female.  The issue of promoting trannies and drawing young teens or children even younger into their clutches is valid. And I do think the fashion and entertainment industry is intentionally  promoting unisex and androgynous personas. Which fits nicely into the One World Order scheme.  Sexually neutral humanoids slaving away for the sole benefit of the One Percenters.

             No, your hypothesis about my post is 100% wrong.  These are not "macho women".  These are NOT WOMEN at all.  You are seeing something which is not actually there.  Look again, and look carefully at ALL of their bodies, not just a few parts.  Carefully study the "chassis" which underlies all the choices/accessories on top of it.  When all the "structural parts" are male but all the choices are female... what does that indicate to you?

             Then there's personal energy: masculine or feminine.  We each have one or the other, and we use it to do whatever we do.  I began to pick up on this as I looked at thousands of images.  I can't precisely explain it, but I don't know what else to call it.  A female can develop male behavior patterns, or vice versa, but their energy remains of the same nature.  That's why women make bad men, and men make bad women.  But the results, while unnatural, are very often interesting, because "I've never seen a [man | woman] act like that before!"  And the magazines fly off the racks.

             I've got a lot more to say about the gender issues involved and how this affects society and each of us, but I want to see what others here have to say about this rather than starting off with trying to write a whole book.  I believe this is the answer to "where are all the victims?" (and the "tranny agenda" might explain the motivation behind the MK ULTRA / RSA stuff) and as such it is incredibly important within PG to expand our view and see this part of the situation.

            i posted about child treatment groups. Since digging into all of these childrens groups around sonoma almost all of them have their own LGBTQ program. Some of these programs have been around a long time with very little people claiming they actually came from there or had treatment etc. Where are these 1000's of kids going after they have been "treated". Maybe some of these very programs helped develop these future hollywood stars when they were children. Remember teens and adults come to CA to become "superstars" at all cost, so do families that come over with children and babies into "acting" schools or other brainwashing programs to mold them and make them "perfect" at extremely young ages all for monetary gain of course.

             It's more than fleshly build, though.  It's basic body construction.  Look at how men and women are built in their skeletal and other fundamental parts.  That's where we bust these impostors.  For example, men and women have different chin structures.  Men tend to have a broad chin with a small cleft; women tend to have a narrower, pointy chin.
            </p>
            <p>
             Every body is different and it's risky to conclude anything from just one or two attributes (male bodies can have an occasional female characteristic, and vice versa).  I look at many things about each person and the truth reveals itself further the more body parts I can examine.

             I don't mean these are literal zombies like we have them portrayed in movies.  They're not brought back from the dead.  But they are walking dead.  Their manhood has been removed.  They cannot bring any life into the world as the living can.  They are essentially already dead, just still able to walk among us and act upon the world for a while more.  This is what I mean when I compare them to zombies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Stepford wives were robots, IIRC.  To be sure I understand your meaning there, are you suggesting that we should regard these trannies as similar to robots?  It is definitely a comparison which can be drawn.  I'll have to think about that.  Neither concept fits exactly.

              No.
             </p>
             <p>
              After the movie of the same name,the term "Stepford wife/wives" took on a more general meaning. It means a mindless, controlled, robotic-acting female.  NOT a LITERAL robot.  That would be a female cyborg or android.
             </p>
             <p>
              "I don't mean these are literal zombies like we have them portrayed in movies. They're not brought back from the dead. But they are walking dead."
             </p>
             <p>
              You did use the term "zombie."  Unlike "Stepford wife/wives," I don't know of a broader application of "zombie."  If zombie/walking dead is not what you actually meant, you should have fleshed out your post to indicate that.  The onus of clear communication is on the transmitter, not the receiver.
             </p>
             <p>
              If you're trying to make the distinction, then you need to find the proper term.  Or invent a new one, if necessary.

               Thanks for clarifying about "Stepford wives".  These "women" are not women, so I don't think the term applies directly.  However, there may still be some usefulness in the comparison; in the movie, the robots replaced the actual women, and in reality, trannies have replaced our real women.  So there's one parallel.  Also, the robots and the trannies both seem to be controlled or directed (at least in some large-scale sense) from someplace, rather than being self-directed.  Also both the robots and the trannies have a source; I'm confident that there's no possibility that this many trannies could be emerging into all these positions for this long just by happenstance.  The Playboy factor alone renders that impossible.  Something long-term, coordinated, and intentional is going on here.

               Fair enough.  What I meant was that these creatures are the remains of what used to be real humans.  Something converted each one from a real human into something having the appearance of a human but being changed into an unnatural creature neither male nor female, unable to procreate (at least in the natural way), offering nothing but death, and thus being a creature belonging only in the grave.  When I look into the face of a tranny and I see the "boy face" lurking behind the painted-on mask, and I see into the eyes of what used to be my brother man, and I see the deadness of its soul, I know that what has been done to him is unspeakably evil, and that it must be stopped.  I also know that I can't save the boy I still see in that face.  He's been sacrificed already to this evil.  His flesh, though altered, still walks and breathes, posing as a living woman, but his soul is already dead inside the body.

               I wouldn't probably come up with this comparison from just one or a few trannies.  I've now seen
               <strong>
                hundreds
               </strong>
               of them, though, and I can see that there are many, many more.  And they just keep coming.

               I hope that brings out more clearly the aspects of this which remind me of zombies.

               I'm considering posting a link to a list of more obvious, less-famous trannies, just so you can all (if you want) see what I'm talking about here.  It's not my imagination.  Here are links to just two such for example.

               (but bear in mind they're not females, just mangled men; you aren't seeing any actual female naughty things)  There are literally hundreds of these things and they are being presented in many places,
               <strong>
                continually
               </strong>
               , as women. Their willingness to be depicted as lewd, sleazy women who not only degrade themselves but are
               <strong>
                eager
               </strong>
               to do so separates them from real women, who might sometimes be persuaded to degrade themselves, but have no reason to enjoy it and thus make poor models/actresses for portraying such perverted eagerness.
