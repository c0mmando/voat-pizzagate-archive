            Sorry for the late reply. Oh yeah, I forgot about that one too! 
That, plus the "Prime Minister fucking a pig on television" (in the very first episode I think), I'd say the showrunner Charlie Brooker must be aware of some stuff...

            Hard Candy ....sympathetic ? not at all... why would u say that ?
           </p>
           <p>
            The only reason , I can see, why Hollywood made such a movie about  exposing pedophilia was bc the 14 year old heroine !!
           </p>
           <p>
            women power trumps the need to protect pedos in this  tale.

            Absolutely. She owns the pedo in "Hard Candy". It is not sympathetic, more like a horror film for pedos.

            Hard Candy was excellent...she not only tricked him into killing himself she terrorized him first.  When she faked him into thinking he was being castrated was priceless.  Hardly sympathetic to him at all unless murdering one of his victims is considered sympathetic.

            I don't know about those, but one disgusting movie from a pedophile's point of view (and never from the child's POV) is "Lamb".
           </p>
           <p>
            I noticed there are more and more child actors with roles in which they play smart kids that act like little adults (the argument of pedophiles to advocate that they can consent if they're like "little adults"...).
           </p>
           <p>
            Actress from Lamb, Oona Laurence has two younger sisters already actresses in Hollywood. In the show Big Little Lies there's a girl, Darby Camp, and a boy, Iain Armitage, with the same type of "little adult" roles. Iain is already destined to be a star with the role of Sheldon in Big Bang Theory prequel. And apparently he's known for being a "child theatre critic"
            <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3361577/Broadway-s-smallest-fan-Precocious-seven-year-old-theater-critic-seen-50-plays-year-sweet-video-reviews-star-right.html">
             daily mail_7yo theatre critic
            </a>
            and is the grandchild of former deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wonder if those children are being abused... I have the feeling those roles may be used as showcases for a trafficking purpose, like that catalog of models &amp; actresses in that photography book, don't have the name in mind. They would probably be from some of those satanic families involved in pedogate. (Armitage child is from Arlington, Virginia.)

            Sympathy for the pedo in Hard Candy?? It's everything but! Nothing good happens to him. He's made to appear the lowlife and then tricked into humiliating and killing himself. Haven't seen The Woodsman however.

            I didn't see The Woodsman. But I did see Hard Candy, and it did not seem all that sympathetic to the pedo. Ellen Page's under-age character tricked and bullied the pedo into suicide. I can see where it came off a little hard-edged, like she's this avenging angel, but that's a premise built right into the title. The bad guy died and the victim endured and won; to me, it was a suspenseful and ultimately satisfactory ending. If we're ever going to make any progress against the pedos, there will have to be movies like this, in which their creepy ways become common knowledge and public revulsion for them takes concrete form. Also, I know at least one under-age girl who has actually been extremely bullied and harassed, who praised Hard Candy and called it her favorite film.

            I do agree that Kevin Bacon has a bit of a creepy vibe. I will put The Woodsman on my to-do list.
