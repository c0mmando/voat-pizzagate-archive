<pre><code>quote:  Italian Jewish Union President Amos Luzzato told the media he was disturbed by the Savoy\'s failure to reach out to the Jewish community.

</code></pre>

<p>Amos Luzzato is the Italian  Jewish Union President communicating with  The Savoy’s, who  are the Italian Monarchy / Royalty.  
</p>
<p>Note the next WikiLeaks also  involve  Anne and Tammy Luzzato;  one appears to be  in regard to an undetailed   pay for play?? party   in the thousands of dollars. 
 The event dinner itself wasn’t detailed, except the money was detailed, and what may be some unusual sentence wording (code?).</p>
<p>The members of that party were listed on a past voat thread, but I\'m not sure if much came of that data dig.</p>
<p>How are the other 2 Luzzato  females related to the Italian/Jewish Union President?  This appears to be generational. <br />
 Tamera/Tammy Luzzato got a golden position with her hand in many, many government affairs, not to mention Clintons; as did Anne  Luzzato.   
</p>
<p>....but what’s Amos Luzzato up to these days?   Did he have major connections with the government in Italy and USA by aligning Tammy and Anne in high USA government positions.   Or did they get in through another rathole?</p>
<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/46736</a>    This email  coincides with a review of a Luzatto’s  archived page showing the children she’s bringing to a farm for hot tub enjoyment.  (I can’t locate the archives on this forum.)    
</p>
<p>I landed on a site called,  LittleSis, which is peculiar choice of name caught my attention,  along with the logo/symbol of a child inside a balloon. </p>
<p><a href="https://littlesis.org/person/35332/Anne_Luzzatto">https://littlesis.org/person/35332/Anne_Luzzatto</a>   
</p>
<p>Isn\'t it interesting that Anne Luzzato  also has her hands in a lot of top government positions, in as a  SPECIAL ASSISTANT for the National Security and as a US Trade Representative?    Security and Trade would be essential for trafficking children to Dubai,  UK,  Canada,  Netherlands,  Japan, etc. </p>
<pre><code>I checked her husband, David Leiter, on the same site LittleSis.
</code></pre>

<p>Farmer L, seems to refer to  the Leiter Farm.  I’m wondering if the police have thoroughly investigated that farm based on the wikileaks in regard to providing children as hot tub entertainment.   Likely not.        
</p>
<p>At this point I\'m confused as to the exact difference between Tammy and Anne Luzzato,  but what I really want to know is  AMOS!   
</p>
<p>Does anyone have research on that dude?   connections etc?</p>',

            I couldn't help but notice that your spelling with the single t. When we do a web search the double t yields better results. However, in the leaks, Tamara has only 1 t in her last name.
