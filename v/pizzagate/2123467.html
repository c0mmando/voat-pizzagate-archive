             Mouscron is located on the boarder to France.

            These clowns love boarder areas, for an example Dutroux travelled a lot.

             See the numerous comments I made after posting this. And ritual abuse is central to pizzagate. Dutroux, which also happened in Belgium, is linked to the ICMEC which has been extensively covered here. Anything ritual abuse related is automatically pizzagate because it is the central point of what was exposed in the emails. In addition to child trafficking as in the Silsby case.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unlike spam posts about DWS and the Awans which have nothing to do with child abuse but do show corruption. There are a lotof subs on various forums for that. Topics like ritual abuse and child trafficking are often removed from such subs as off topic, which is another reason they are important to include here.
            </p>
            <p>
             Scandals like Dutroux, Franklin, The Finders, and many many more all shed light on and give context for the latest round of exposed practices like spirit cooking. If you could not post about those issues here, pizzagate would make no sense to most who have not researched the topic.
            </p>
            <p>
             So. This looking like a ritual killing in the home of the Dutroux scandal has everything to do with pizzagate.

            The sooner we can take the power out of the hands of these crusty old, piss-stained pedo fucks, the sooner we can advance as a species. This means a complete disintegration of our current (flawed) economic system.

            Previously, we have seen the deep ties between the ICMEC/NCMEC and the IT industry as well as the pharmaceutical industry. In part 3, we will explore the political connections of the power elite who are on the board of directors at the ICMEC. In particular, we’ll investigate the connections between the Dutroux Case and the ICMEC.
History of the ICMEC
           </p>
           <p>
            According to their webpage, the ICMEC was created in response to the public outcry surrounding the Dutroux Scandal. An estimated 300,000 Belgian citizens took to the streets to protest the crimes and the handling of the investigation.

            Disclaimer: Any accusations of guilt are completely speculative and I’m not accusing any of the members of the ICMEC board of crimes. I’m simply showing the connections that exist between the powerful and well connected who make up the board of directors.
ICMEC, Ambassadors and the State Department
           </p>
           <p>
            Let’s begin by profiling a few key members of the ICMEC’s board of directors:
Hillary Rodham Clinton (HRC)
           </p>
           <p>
            – Co-Founder of the ICMEC in 1998, former First Lady of the US, Former US Secretary of State from 2009-2013, 2016 Democratic candidate for US President, member of the Council on Foreign Relations
Elizabeth Frawley Bagley
           </p>
           <p>
            – Top-tier DNC Bundler (Fundraiser), US State Department 2009-2017, Former Ambassador to Portugal, Senate Liaison for NATO Expansion 1994-1997, US representative to UNGA, widow of Smith Bagley heir to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco fortune (also formerly a Top-tier DNC bundler), member of the Council on Foreign Relations
Maura Harty
           </p>
           <p>
            – Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affair at the US State Department 2003-2008, Foreign Service Officer, President &amp; CEO of ICMEC 2014-present
Ambassadors Linked to the US State Department
           </p>
           <p>
            • Anthony Luzzatto Gardner – EC Ambassador (in Belgium) • Howard Gutman – Top-tier DNC Bundler, US Ambassador to Belgium 2009-2013, Allegations of soliciting sex from minors as Ambassador (See -

            </a>
            ))
Rewarding top-tier bundlers with ambassadorships is a common practice in politics. As a successful fundraiser for the Obama campaign, Howard Gutman was appointed US ambassador to Belgium in 2009.
Gutman was a popular ambassador among those he came in to contact with during his tenure in Brussels from 2009-2013. Gutman’s honeymoon with the Belgian public abruptly ended when it was revealed that he had attempted to solicit sex from a minor in a public park. Despite the accusations, Gutman unequivocally denied the claims and stayed on as Ambassador completing his term.

            Missing Children Europe is an umbrella organization that incorporates dozens of child advocacy groups spanning across Europe.
Belgian Ties
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the central personalities at the ICMEC is the Baron Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer (Cardon). Cardon was the first president of the organization. Mr. Cardon is deeply involved in a plethora of organizations dealing with missing, abused and exploited children.
Cardon spent his entire career in the Belgian banking world and has been a long-time member of the business community. His banking career started at Bank Brussels Lambert (BBL), where he eventually became CEO. He belongs to the Brussels business association known as: Le Circle de Lorrain.
            <a href="https://i.imgtc.com/3TcAOHk.jpg">
             https://i.imgtc.com/3TcAOHk.jpg
            </a>
            Cardon was selected as the ICMEC’s first president (1998) and has served on the board of directors since its inception. To receive the title of ‘Baron’ in Belgium is akin to being ‘lorded’ / ‘sired’ in the UK. It is an honor bestowed by the monarch for service and achievement. King Albert II awarded the title of “Baron” to Daniel Cardon in 1998.
As we will see, both King Albert II and Baron Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer are named in the Dutroux Scandal and cover-up. King Albert is identified by a witness as being present at a gathering described as a ‘hunt of children”. It's unclear if the witness was referring to King Albert I or King Albert II. The Baron however, is not named as being involved in the sexual abuse of children but he was involved in the cover-up.
(Source: To be added shortly)
This is intriguing, the wife of the King, Queen Poala, and a wealthy banker baron both emerging as champions of abused children, acquiring lead roles in the new international organization while at the same time being intimately linked to an accused in the Dutroux Scandal.
Not only that, but the Baron suddenly takes on a leading role in Belgium’s own child advocacy organization Child Focus (1998) and later with greater Europe’s equivalent; Missing Children Europe (2001). But that’s not all, he's also a board member at Italy’s children's foundation Foundazione Child who’s president and founder, Ernesto Caffo, also happens to be a member of the ICMEC board of directors. Furthermore, Cardon is also identified as being part of the support committee of several other children’s organizations: Kids’ Care and the Belgian Kid’s Fund.
Now, perhaps it’s unfair to cast the Baron Cardon in such poor light, as his involvement with these organizations may truly be altruistic. Besides, he's a Baron. A man ‘lorded’ by the highest order of the country and a respected pillar of the Brussels business community. A reputable organization such as Le Cercle de Lorrain surely would never allow their ranks to be filled by scoundrels and degenerates, would they?
Le Cercle de Lorraine

            Le Cercle de Lorraine was established in Brussels in 1998 and is an association of businessmen from across the city and throughout the country.
A few notable foreign members of the Cercle de Lorraine include:
US Ambassador Anthony Luzzatto Gardner

            Incredibly, members of the business association Le Cercle de Lorraine have also been implicated in the Dutroux Scandal and subsequent cover-up. There are several members of the organization that were identified as pedophiles and child rapists....."

              I agree this is a good question. My first inference is this as a role he had prior to becoming mayor which carried into his time as mayor.

             <p>
              Imho I don't think this is of crucial significance here. If he was targeted to be silenced it wouldn't matter where he was murdered to these ppl. It's all a matter of convenience/opportunity when it comes to shit like this. What better place to murder someone than a quiet cemetery at lock up time when nobody else would be expected to be present?

             Could have, but the cemetery location rings alarm bells. Lawmaker surely to god would not need to double as an undertaker, and if they did, I cannot imagine a legit reason for it.

               You are right, it's part of a potential series of options.  But the first step is large scale education and propaganda.  Few are aware of this, very few.

               You cannot touch pizza gate type offenders because they are shielded by the owners of the federal reserve, they are the source of all the issues.

               Christianity invented Capitalism when Feudalism was no longer sufficient to run their Papal States.

                This is the illegal usury that enslaves and oppressed all Americans. This stolen wealth (well over a trillion a year) goes directly to the owners of the federal reserve. This makes them the unseen oligarchy of the USA. This is why the .1% are so insanely wealthy and have more wealth than the bottom 90% combined.

                   Neither should it be confused with NAZI party which was ONCE actually a liberal
organization concerned with labor and labor unions, women's rights/abortion, health
care for all and other liberal programs ... BEFORE having been take over by Hitler
and turned upside down.  Hitler also ran a dictatorship having nothing to do with socialism.

              The now still short-lived recovery that began in last part of Obama Administration isn't something that GOP is happy with and they want it stopped.  They're trying to bankrupt the nation -- in something similar to that in Puerto Rico in government there creating huge and corrupt debt and then laying it on the people.  This is becoming common practice under criminal government.

               the Connecticut hedge funders did this to PR because as a non-state territory, it is not allowed to declare bankruptcy and default on the debt. I don't know the details but I think there are parallels to what was done to Greece. Meanwhile, CT is actually going bankrupt so where is all this money going? It is certainly NOT being invested into the state.
