            The third (Mercedes Sosa-Ayala) one is a huge mystery to me, not listed any more and not showing up as found or even showing up as having been missing in the first place. Was she erased from the system? Interesting to note, a man with the same hyphenated last name as her was involved in some investigation about a decapitated body.

            This is her missing report online.
