<p>This email is coming from someone who is clearly unhinged, and the people responding to him treat it that way, but he definitely says several things that ring of true events, albeit coming through a distorted filter. Then I saw the line &quot;You\'re not going to smoke my pineal gland&quot; and I suddenly remembered that in <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em> there is a scene where they talk about getting high from human glands:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHbuaED5Tw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaHbuaED5Tw</a></p>
<p>Dr. Gonzo starts talking about how he got a client that is a SATANISM FREAK who couldn\'t pay him with money, and gave him an ounce of pure adrenochrome instead, which they then go on to say is only possible to get by extracting it out of a living human. Gonzo then talks about how his client is being accused of CHILD MOLESTATION and might try to rip out his pineal gland if he didn\'t accept the offer. They then talk about getting extract of human pineal and what would happen if they took it, and Dr. Gonzo says you would turn into something out of medical encyclopedia, and then he transforms into a demon. There is also an earlier scene in which a group of well dressed lizards have a blood orgy. Watching this film again with the knowledge of Hunter\'s connection to Bohemian Grove, satanism and child trafficking gives it a whole new meaning. It may be a much more literal depiction of reality than it seems upon first viewing.</p>
<p>So we know that these people are sacrificing children, eating the bodies, drinking the blood and worshipping dark gods. But why? I think this is the question that everyone investigating pizzagate is burning to know the answer to. Why would someone commit the most vile and atrocious crimes against humanity for promises from disembodied entities that may not even be real? Well, Hunter may be telling us indirectly that these entities may not be so disembodied after all, at least to them.</p>
<p>Anyone who has done any research into DMT knows that it is a ubiquitous aspect of the experience to have contact with non-physical entities, regardless of whether you believe they are real or not. I think it\'s very possible that these people are not only drinking human blood to stay younger, but eating human pineal (and other) glands in order to have intense psychedelic trips that bring about the experience of communicating with dark &quot;gods&quot;. Their agenda is not only to control the masses through occult knowledge, but for the few in the ruling class to reach ultimate spiritual enlightenment. The all seeing eye on the pyramid that we know so well is the symbol of this goal, but the all seeing eye, also called the eye of horus, is the symbol of the pineal gland as well. The third eye is a spiritual concept, but it also literally refers to a piece of our anatomy. Considering everything that I\'ve learned in the past few months, I would say that it is not at all a stretch to assume that the rulers may have learned something about how to have the ultimate drug trip that the rest of us are too human to ever have any knowledge of.</p>
<p>If anyone has any more info on rituals that involve eating specific body parts for a specific effect, it may be worth looking in to.</p>',

           Anyone who has done any research into DMT knows that it is a ubiquitous aspect of the experience to have contact with non-physical entities, regardless of whether you believe they are real or not. I think it's very possible that these people are not only drinking human blood to stay younger, but eating human pineal (and other) glands in order to have intense psychedelic trips that bring about the experience of communicating with dark "gods". Their agenda is not only to control the masses through occult knowledge, but for the few in the ruling class to reach ultimate spiritual enlightenment. The all seeing eye on the pyramid that we know so well is the symbol of this goal, but the all seeing eye, also called the eye of horus, is the symbol of the pineal gland as well.

           If anyone has any more info on rituals that involve eating specific body parts for a specific effect, it may be worth looking in to.

            Excellent information.  Obviously this is witchcraft and there are a lot of ties to what we are hearing about Pizza Gate and pedophilia.  Not being a practitioner of witchcraft and not wishing to learn first hand, these tidbits and tips are not only thought-provoking but may provide the key to finding, exposing and eliminating such practices.  Disgusting though.

            After reading the above post, I would like to share a DMT trip of mine that I had recently experienced just a few months ago:
           </p>
           <p>
            A Female Buddha had reached out to me who called herself Vajrayogini. She spoke with me, and the trip was very intense.
           </p>
           <p>
            After the trip, curiosity got the best of me, so I did some research online and discovered she was some Buddha that was worshipped way back in the day.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't speak about it often because I would obviously look like a nutcase to most people, but maybe these Satanic Pedophiles are using the DMT harvested from their sacrifices to further communicate and become closer with these entities?
           </p>
           <p>
            I know this is incredibly farfetched, but I felt obligated to share since I found it somewhat related.

            Watch "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". Supposedly about Hunter S Thompson..  The Main characters get high on Adrenochrome.  They experience shapeshifting with slit eyes while high on this stuff.  There is no mention of where they got the Adrenochrome from though.  Hunter Thomson in his book also talks about September &amp; October being the biggest months of child kidnapping by the super wealthy.  Football season.  Then the child auctions follow.

            do you think this would have any effect on the trip? because like i said each time felt a little different, like the crystals were unique every time, almost as if no two batches could produce the same exact trip each time, again its hard to put into words, as im sure you understand if you've tried it too

            You only have to watch the very beginning of this video (it is part 3 of 7 in LAST MESSAGE's series entitled Our Children and The Devil...all parts are relevant) to understand this:
            <a href="https://youtu.be/2GEal7_mcxI">
             https://youtu.be/2GEal7_mcxI
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The point here is that these people who indulge in these sick practices are always dealing with the energetic realm. They see pedophilia, human sacrifice, cannibalism, etc. as ways to forcibly make contact with the spi-ritual realm. Think of the act of communion at your local church... "this is the body, and this is the blood." Communion literally means "the sharing or exchanging of intimate thoughts and feelings, especially when the exchange is on a mental or spiritual level." You're supposed to be able to better commune with God after you figuratively eat his son's (Jesus's, in case you are not familiar) flesh and drink his blood (usually grape juice and a cracker at contemporary churches). I always thought that practice was weird but never stopped doing it until I stopped going to church years ago. These Satanists practice the same things, except much worse. This is all tied together.

            Pretty sure the woman meant to say "endorphins," not "endomorphins," but anyway...there is precedent to your theory. As an aside and for further pondering, have you ever wondered why they allow the abuse/torture our livestock before butchering them? There is widespread evidence of ritual (i.e. habitual and repeated) abuse at factory farms. Many of us eat that meat, especially at fast food restaurants. Remember...this is all connected...

            This is strange because my co-worker the other day was talking about how in California they put fluoride in the tap water which calcifies/harms the pineal gland. Then there's this: "Recent information on the role of the pineal organ in humans suggests that any agent that affects pineal function could affect human health in a variety of ways,** including effects on sexual maturation**, calcium metabolism, parathyroid function, postmenopausal osteoporosis, cancer, and psychiatric disease. "

            It is clear you are just drinking the cool-aid when it comes to the Crusades. The Crusades were purely defensive against Islam which was quickly attempting to take over Europe. They don't teach you this stuff in school. I'm sorry to say.

            Fun fact, the pineal gland and the pine cone come from the same root, because the pine cone is shaped similarly to the pineal gland. The pope staff has a pine cone on it.

            Ancient civilizations considered the pine cone to be traditionally associated with immortality and knowledge.

            The pineal gland is what allows the eye to process light and is considered by many to be the "third eye".

            You guys never consider the fact that Satanism and Kabal, rituals, sacrifices, ARE ACTUALLY WHAT THEY ARE NAMED : RITUALS, SACRIFICES TO DEMONS ? This guys are not stupid, this wouldn't exist for thousand of years as long as we can go back in time if there wasn't something consistent about it.
I mean there is so much content available to see that's what it is, I won't put it all here but if you are still not convinced i challenge you to watch this video to the end and still pretend the same thing :
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkZvYglefsU">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkZvYglefsU
            </a>
            , this one is long but absolutely complete and accomplished. Shorter ones are to find on XENDRIUS channel.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have all the cases of demonic possessions that were documented like the one of Maurice Theriault, just look for it you'll find the Truth.
Hope you guys will.

            Wait a second.  Is this why they were shipping in the frozen pineal glands of penguins?

            "FROZEN PENGUIN PINEAL GLANDS WILL BE SHIPPED PA 204 ETD BUENOS AIRES AUGUST 3 TO NEW YORK, AND NATIONAL 62 ARRIVING BOSTON AUGUST 4 AT 1330 P.M. AWB NO. 02651794035. FREIGHT COLLECT."

            Is this why John Kerry &amp; the elites are often going to Antarctica?
           </p>
           <p>
            If they do smoke them/eat them they have been doing this a long time because this email is dated August 1973.  Maybe they start people out on penguins then graduate them to people's pineal gland?  So many questions.

             I recently saw a youtube anon video talking about a base in Antarctica where these kids are held. Wouldn't that be a perfect location for MK. he says this is why kerry was there. Probably not credible but if you think about it it's a very secure location

              It would be a perfect location, very secluded.  I hadn't heard about MK Ultra going on there, but if true, the recent evacuation of Buzz Aldrin would mean that he is possibly MK Ultra/under mind control.  I'm not sure I want to know the implications of that :-/

            Yeah, I think that may be true. Plus the calcification of the pineal gland in adults would make them less potent--hence the vampires' obsession with infants and children.

            It's so simple, right?! CARE is the generative principle, which brings--and preserves--life. When we lose care, we lose our children. Evil is literally the absence of care. And fear is what drives people away from care. This is why evil injects fear into society--so they can feed on our corpses. David Icke's work now makes absolutely perfect sense to me--finally.

            Good points. I personally believe that there are no shortcuts to enlightenment. However there are many false paths or dead ends that have the appearance of enlightenment. Vampirism is definitely a false path (literal dead end) to enlightenment. These are cowards that cannot become enlightened. They are pathetic creatures with no heart. They lack care, and the non-aggression principle, or the sacred feminine pillar of enlightenment. That pillar is literally on the lower tracing boards of freemasonry. They are doomed, stuck in base consciousness and carnism, and they know it—pathetic non-human creatures they are.

            Too late. I am going to get buried. Let me help you out here. I've been doing this a long time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the even bigger picture :)
           </p>
           <p>
            I have studied the elite for 20 years. Pizzagate isn't holly new to me, but the scale took me aback. The elite sacrifice children for a reason. It is modern day worship of Saturn/Isis.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is the whole story of Pizzagate for anyone interested. The truth is stranger than fiction. The Scottish Masonic Order and their affiliates rule our planet. They are a direct continuation of the Brotherhood of Amon Ra that existed in Egypt 3500 years ago. Knights Templar, Medici's, Pheonicians were just a couple of the links in between. Our leaders are obsessed with Egyptian symbolism, specifically the story of Isis and Osiris. It's basically pretty cool math/geometry, but they have perverted it and made it into an esoteric movement. These people literally invented creationism and our religions (Islam, Non-Gnostic Christianity, Judaism). The Star of David is, at its heart, a mathematical symbol.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here you go (explore the Egyptian/mathematical symbolism through art and architecture of the past 2 thousand years):

            I know it is 4 hours long, but you won't be the same after you watch it. I promise. It made a lifelong atheist and scientist question his assumption that the mysterious was cornered off to quantum mechanics and neuroscience.

            Please refrain from calling me a shill because that sounds so fucking crazy. I know what it sounds like.
            <strong>
             Downvote me if you think it is a coincidence the the latitude of the King's Chamber at the pyramids at Giza is the speed of light (in m/s), accurate to at least 6 digits. You would have to think Pizzagate is a coincidence too.
            </strong>
            Meter was defined in 1800, but it was merely rediscovered. It is a length ingrained into the architecture of our solar system, as any student of Masonry would learn. Here is the King's chamber when measured in meters:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/wp-content/uploads/KingsChamber555.jpg">
             http://www.secretsinplainsight.com/wp-content/uploads/KingsChamber555.jpg
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe the meter isn't so arbitrary after all, if it is being used to encode the golden ratio in Egypt, thousands of years before the System International. By the way, the perimeter of the chamber's base is 10 pi meters. They squared the circle at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            Numerology and mythology seem pretty fucking retarded, and they are, but our leaders fucking love it. You have to understand it, in order to understand our current situation, and them. It goes back thousands of years. If there is anything that you guys should be learning through Pizzagate, it is that many of the men and the women with the tin foil hats on, were preaching reality in your face (to a limit- I think that limit is aliens, but I am open minded). I think that it can be easy to try to explain this Egyptian symbolism as artistic influence, but major historic figures have gone out of their fucking way to make a point of it (as you will see in the first video).
           </p>
           <p>
            Last thing, FUCK THE BROTHERHOOD OF AMON RA. They sacrifice children like sheep.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just remember that at heart, humans are good. These videos will make you question reality, but we have each others' backs.
           </p>
           <p>
            You guy's have found the tippy tip of the iceberg. Dive down and see the entirety of it in its horror.
           </p>
           <p>
            You have been hit HARD with the truth from pizzagate. Don't suddenly just stop. Go all the way. Watch the videos. I promise I am not fucking with you.

            Addictive or not, DMT is used for enlightenment. Hence the idea of the perfect drug in the glands of a tortured and murdered child. The bartering would be to feed the addiction (Edit: for the opiates) and possibly for further enlightenment (edit: for the DMT) (in their case, to use as a power differential over the slave classes). A bunch of things finally came together for me in this thread..thanks to all!

            Awesome points! My guess is that DMT is not addictive, whereas the endogenous opiates are addictive (both occur in my theory). Vampires are not addicted to the enlightenment, they are addicted to the opiates with lesser side effects.

            You have to keep in mind that ingesting DMT won't have an effect unless it is combined with MAO inhibitor. Our digestive system has enzymes that break down the DMT before it reaches our blood flow. MAOI's prevent those enzymes from breaking down the DMT. That's why ayahuasca shamans make a brew of a DMT containing plant and a MAOI containing plant. Unless brain matter contains MAOI's as well, eating a pineal gland won't do you anything.

            Hunter S Thompson was a pedo piece of shit. He was fully implicated in the Franklin Papers and supposedly took a considerable amount of child/snuff porn. He commited suicide shortly after that information tying him to another photographer who was also known to be working for the elites (also dead).   They probed him and for a minute Hunter looked like he would talk if the price was right..  (suicided).

            My first thought is that Hunter tried to normalize cannibalism by telling all the kids that you get high from it. Look at spez, he clearly fell for it.

            But this is nowhere near the origins of this, you should google 'Blood libel', and then read about Talmuddic practice. This shit goes back thousands of years. This is the reason we started burning witches back in the day, the Christians realized what was going on and freaked out.

            I think your onto something big, I did a bit more reading on the pineal gland it appears that, it's a very important part of the brain.  "Research also reports fluoride hardening accelerates sexual development in children, particularly in girls."

            Isn't eating nervous tissue one of the things that can trigger Kuru, something that some people think that Hillary has contracted ( and not Parkinson's)?. This might go some way to explaining why Hillary is like she is nowadays, her habits have created her condition.

            edit: i mean, it may be more than just spiritual, or just a concept... the concept of the third eye might by physically based in reality inasmuchas the pineal is/has nonvisual photoreceptors... photoreceptors like what the eyes has, and photoreceptors in the same gland that some fish have been found to have partially visual photoreceptors....  and thus the concept of it being linked to vision may be based in reality....

            the pineal gland is or has um.. well...

               The dark occultists don't want society to know the intimate relationship between physical and spiritual nature. That's one major power differential they wish to keep. The masses need to get their asses off the checkered floor of the house.

            I just had a dark thought. What if the purpose of snuff is to consume the pineal of the deceased when the pineal and other glands such as the adrenal have released all their hormones and neurotransmitters--which occurs right at the time of death, to prepare the dying for the afterlife. In other words, what if the torture and dying of the victim prepares their glands for vampire consumption?

             You have to keep in mind that ingesting DMT won't have an effect unless it is combined with MAO inhibitor. Our digestive system has enzymes that break down the DMT before it reaches our blood flow. MAOI's prevent those enzymes from breaking down the DMT. That's why ayahuasca shamans make a brew of a DMT containing plant and a MAOI containing plant. Unless brain matter contains MAOI's as well, eating a pineal gland won't do you anything.

             I don't know about preparing their glands, but I've heard enough about eating dog that if you 'prepare the meat' while it's still alive all of the adrenaline will seep into the muscles.  It's suppose to taste better.  Probably the same idea.  Release of chemicals into the blood stream.

             In a SRA survivors story he says JUST THAT.  The Pineal gland has been looked at for centuries as the doorway to the unknown, the veil that needs to be crossed.

             Torturing the victims, agonizing pain and stress are all additives to make this DMT elixir.  This is why they love to draw it out.  They also love to give the victim hallucinogens and torture them while tripping.  It's disgusting.  Dismemberment is another favorite, as it is a physical representation of the spiritual dismembering of your conscious/subconscious mind.

              The thing that confuses me though, if you can get DMT from pretty much every single living organism, be it plants or animals, iirc. So why would you need to harvest humans if you could just get it from grass? I used to spend tons of time on Erowid reading about peoples experiences on different drugs as well as articles that studied said drugs.
             </p>
             <p>
              Seriously, for further information, refer to Erowid. It is a great site.

                ill preface this by saying it could be pure bullshit and that i am not a chemist, but i digress, ive smoked regular dmt twice now and 5-meo dmt once, i never asked the person i got it from where it was extracted from as he was a reputable dealer, anyway to my point, each time it felt the same but also different, each had its own particular flavor,if you will, and im not talking about taste lol, its hard to put into words but my theory on the subject is this, different sources from which the dmt was extracted leads to slightly different experiences and feelings, one of the times the dmt crystals were a very intimidating red color and the feelings with it were notably more sinister and less whimsical, again this is pure speculation from my personal experiences and not scientifically proven, but it could provide a reasonable theory to your question of why they dont just extract dmt from plants

                I'll sing the praises of Erowid too. Even if I'm not interested in taking the chemicals they're talking about, it's highly interesting to read their reports.

               <p>
                I do believe that when this is open, and we can take a step back on this, I'll be looking for some nice mushies. It supposedly resets the mind, and I think I need that. I might need it a couple few times. I'd never tried them without Erowid reports, and they work well.

              I've been obsessed with understanding the pineal gland for close to a year now. I knew enlightenment had to do with balancing the hemispheres of the brain and likewise activating the heart chakra (and a bunch of different ways of saying the same thing under different spiritual disciplines), but this is a shocker and makes perfect sense: we are born in harmony with nature, but culture destroys that harmony. The dark occultists rob children of their natural-born rites of being in harmony with nature, and the neurochemical life-forces within. It is the highest form of theft: torture and murder of the innocent for their life-force. This is their holy grail—this may be at the very core of satanism..I am still processing this discovery

               The colomoba iris defect is related to a mutation in a protein complex called pax2. Soros has it it,  the photos in Alefantis's instagram of  kids possess it.  Madeliene McCann had it and she was reportedly born under strange circumstances and john tony and weiner match suspect sketches tied to her disappearance.  Theyre up to something diabolical.

              New age encourages the opening of the "Third Eye".  Basically the pineal gland that is represented in the middle of the forehead.  Anal sex is used by occultists to open the third eye.  There are supposedly nerve endings that get activated then activate certain physiological events in the mind.

              And why celebs like Jay Z, Beyonce, many of the newer upcomers do that so to please their handlers...they cover one eye in pics, and once you've had it pointed out, you see it SO much..it can look natural, or not. But definitely noticeable! There's more, but that's "the story of the eye" alright. Never realized what the eye meant. TIL, I learned more than I thought I ever would.

            </p>
            <p>
             Here is the even bigger picture :)
            </p>
            <p>
             I have studied the elite for 20 years. Pizzagate isn't holly new to me, but the scale took me aback. The elite sacrifice children for a reason. It is modern day worship of Saturn/Isis.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here is the whole story of Pizzagate for anyone interested. The truth is stranger than fiction. The Scottish Masonic Order and their affiliates rule our planet. They are a direct continuation of the Brotherhood of Amon Ra that existed in Egypt 3500 years ago. Knights Templar, Medici's, Pheonicians were just a couple of the links in between. Our leaders are obsessed with Egyptian symbolism, specifically the story of Isis and Osiris. It's basically pretty cool math/geometry, but they have perverted it and made it into an esoteric movement. These people literally invented creationism and our religions (Islam, Non-Gnostic Christianity, Judaism). The Star of David is, at its heart, a mathematical symbol.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here you go (explore the Egyptian/mathematical symbolism through art and architecture of the past 2 thousand years):

             I know it is 4 hours long, but you won't be the same after you watch it. I promise. It made a lifelong atheist and scientist question his assumption that the mysterious was cornered off to quantum mechanics and neuroscience.

              Downvote me if you think it is a coincidence the the latitude of the King's Chamber at the pyramids at Giza is the speed of light (in m/s), accurate to at least 6 digits. You would have to think Pizzagate is a coincidence too.

             Meter was defined in 1800, but it was merely rediscovered. It is a length ingrained into the architecture of our solar system, as any student of Masonry would learn. Here is the King's chamber when measured in meters:

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe the meter isn't so arbitrary after all, if it is being used to encode the golden ratio in Egypt, thousands of years before the System International. By the way, the perimeter of the chamber's base is 10 pi meters. They squared the circle at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Numerology and mythology seem pretty fucking retarded, and they are, but our leaders fucking love it. You have to understand it, in order to understand our current situation, and them. It goes back thousands of years. If there is anything that you guys should be learning through Pizzagate, it is that many of the men and the women with the tin foil hats on, were preaching reality in your face (to a limit- I think that limit is aliens, but I am open minded). I think that it can be easy to try to explain this Egyptian symbolism as artistic influence, but major historic figures have gone out of their fucking way to make a point of it (as you will see in the first video).
            </p>
            <p>
             Last thing, FUCK THE BROTHERHOOD OF AMON RA. They sacrifice children like sheep.
            </p>
            <p>
             Just remember that at heart, humans are good. These videos will make you question reality, but we have each others' backs.
            </p>
            <p>
             You guy's have found the tippy tip of the iceberg. Dive down and see the entirety of it in its horror.
            </p>
            <p>
             You have been hit HARD with the truth from pizzagate. Don't suddenly just stop. Go all the way. Watch the videos. I promise I am not fucking with you.

                I'm appreciating your posts. I've made time to watch the 4 hr one in the morning when my brain is fresh so to speak. I've been wracked with some god awful dreams at night. Makes one wonder how these people can even sleep at night. It must take LOADS of benzos, lord knows I've had to take more than one a few nights to sleep well. My thanks to you as well!

                I've studied mathematics in depth and never made the mystical connections the people who discovered them (never much liked history, probably because it felt like everything taught while in school was a lie).  I'm repeatedly seeing the themes.  M C Escher is a total mind trip now.

                And, thank you for the second step down this path of discovery.

              Well, for example, people who have near-death experiences often recall feelings of euphoria. Neuroscience research suggests that the main cause of these feelings is that when we are about to die, the glands release a rush of hormones and neurotransmitters, which may be the source of these feelings of euphoria. Some of these chemicals are called endogenous opiates, meaning neurochemicals that have the same effects as (or act similar to) opium. Only, they are natural and made by the human body. So what does this imply? Amazing drugs with no side effects! I think we have a motive pretty much locked down at this point.

               This is just highly interesting to me. I'm gonna run outta upvoats on you here man. Thanks for the info, it explains a lot that I did wonder about. Like what they got out of consuming parts of humans, besides the blood.

            I also recently read an account of woman [hunters wife or gf?] about his last days and that he kept listening to an audio tape of an 'animal' screeching in a trap and I'd only just heard the snuff film thing. It made me think maybe the audio wasn't of an animal as such but maybe the horrific screams of a human... just conjecture and to be fair I was/am a yuge fan of Hunter... but I've got to follow the same advice I keep giving others and put my cognitive dissonance aside.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember the interview of Hunter when he's asked if he knows bush and he say's he's been to hillbilly [referencing the bohemian grove camp the bushes belong too]. Makes you re think his death/suicide...

             I believe he was killed because he was planning to write a book about the Twin Towers' demolition by explosive. As early as 2005, from a known writer... It couldn't happen.

              No, he was killed days after it was found out that Jeff Gannon (whitehouse shill) was kidnapped boy Johnny Gosch. Paul Bonacci fingered him as the snuff film producer.
             </p>
             <p>
              He said he 'liked to kill' on David Letterman. Letterman was clearly taken aback and wanted assurance it was a joke and Hunter issued a half-hearted retraction (1:15)

               it gets a lot creepier when you learn who owned the ranch DIRECTLY adjacent/next door to Hunter's up through 2005: Prince Bandar (Bush" bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz. His wife literally got caught wiring money to two of the 9/11 hijackers.
