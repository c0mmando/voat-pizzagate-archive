             total bullshit news. The large Media networks are colluding and need to have their licenses revoked. New York Times = Clinton Foundation; the majority ownership is by a man who is on the board of Clinton Foundation according to research by #MonicaPeterson. And yes, they kill people as a last resort if they can't counter the info coming out.

            Yeah I'm pretty sure that unless you are vegan we have all eaten some pizzagate victims (very unfortunately). Pretty much no more ground beef, pork or canned soups for me.

            What's creepy about this ? I live approx. 1/2 block from Roberta's Pizza. I have have posting evidence about my neighborhood and about #Pizzagate. This just showed up around the corner from me. Unsure what it is Advertising? There's obviously a woman being placed in a can of soup. i.e. there is a reference to cannibalism . And to death because she is disappeared inside the can. There is a reference to detective work.. i.e. Gumshoe is slang for a detective.
