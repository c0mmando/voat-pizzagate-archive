<p>Rumors surrounding this conspiracy say Freemasons were involved in DC\'s urban planning, and that one of the organizations associated with Freemasonry, the Order of the Eastern Star, uses a pentagram as their logo. Their version of the symbol is constructed from five lines of equal length, creating five isosceles triangles with a pentagon in its center. In the Masonic view, a pentagram is represents the Golden Ratio, a mathematical idea found in architecture, finance, and in nature.<br />
