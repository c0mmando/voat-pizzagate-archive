<p>Regarding my other <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1491968">research,</a> here are some more articles… Well, more of what I have found.
Also, something just occurred to me. ISIS is a product of the CIA, right? What else was the CIA known for? The Finder’s Cult. 
That cult trafficked children. 
ISIS was created and funded by Clinton and Obama(Soros, etc.) which also seem to be connected to the trafficking of children. Well, Kosovo, after the Clinton’s involvement(i.e NATO, which apparently greatly benefited Mexico, where the finder’s were trafficking and such. Mexico still a hotbed for human trafficking) also became a hotbed of human trafficking whether in organs, sex or labor.
Kosovo now trains <a href="http://archive.is/Yr0YO">ISIS on it’s land.</a> </p>
<p><strong>NATO INVOLVEMENT</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/05c4Y">The Kosovo War</a> lasted from February 28th, 1998 to June 11th, 1999. It was in which ethnic Albanians opposed ethnic Serbs and the government of Yugoslavia. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Yugoslav and Serbian forces responded with a ruthless counteroffensive and engaged in a program of ethnic cleansing. The United Nations (UN) Security Council condemned this excessive use of force and imposed an arms embargo, but the violence continued.
Which would be known as the Albanian genocide(much human trafficking came from this too). 
Then President Bill Clinton was <a href="http://archive.is/Kq04L">urged</a> by the first lady to bomb the Serbian’s in order to help the Albanian population.</p>
<p>The NATO bombing campaign lasted 11 weeks and eventually expanded to Belgrade, where significant damage to the Serbian infrastructure occurred. In June NATO and Yugoslavia signed a peace accord outlining troop withdrawal and the return of nearly one million ethnic Albanians as well as another 500,000 displaced within the province. Most Serbs left the region, and there were occasional reprisals against those who remained. UN peacekeeping forces were deployed in Kosovo, which came under UN administration.
Tensions between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo continued into the 21st century. Sporadic violence occurred, as when anti-Serb riots broke out in March 2004 in numerous cities and towns in the Kosovo region. The riots claimed some 30 lives and resulted in the displacement of more than 4,000 Serbs and other minorities. In February 2008 Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia (Yugoslavia had ceased to exist in 2003, giving way to the federation of Serbia and Montenegro, which itself dissolved in 2006). Although the United States and several influential members of the European Union chose to recognize Kosovo’s independence, Serbia did not.
Given what we recently uncovered about UN peacekeepers in Africa…</p>

<p><strong>HILLARY, THACI AND THE VIOLENT OVERTHROW OF KOSOVO</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/XfRXG">http://archive.is/XfRXG</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last December Hashim Thaci, the Prime Minister of Kosovo, was alleged to be &quot;the head of a \'mafia-like\' Albanian group responsible for smuggling weapons, drugs and human organs through eastern Europe, according to a Council of Europe inquiry report on organized crime&quot; as then reported by Paul Lewis for the Guardian.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited him in Kosovo as recently as the fall. &quot;I want you to know, prime minister,&quot; Clinton said to Thaci, during her visit to Pristina on Oct. 13 last year, &quot;that just as we have been with you on the hard road to independence, we will stay with you. We are your partners and we are your friends and we are very committed to your future.&quot;</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton helped <a href="http://archive.is/CVh0k">overthrow Kosovo!</a>  George Soros helped her I read. </p>
<p><strong>HIGH RANKING OFFICIALS AND HASHIM</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/xkqlg">In this article you can see Hashim pictured with a few prominent people, such as; Hillary Clinton, Madeline Albright and Condolezza Rice</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright publicly embraced Thaci. Former President George W. Bush hosted him in the Oval Office. Vice President Joseph Biden also welcomed him to the White House, in July. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited him in Kosovo as recently as the fall.
“I want you to know, prime minister,” Clinton said to Thaci, during her visit to Pristina on Oct. 13 last year, “that just as we have been with you on the hard road to independence, we will stay with you. We are your partners and we are your friends and we are very committed to your future.”
Serwer said that Clinton has “certainly heard the allegations against them … . We all heard them.”
When asked for an interview on Hashim or what all the allegations against him were, etc… many declined to comment. Including then former secretary Albright and secretary Clinton.</p>

<p><strong>HUMAN AND ORGAN TRAFFICKING</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/5hjMS">Report on the trafficking in Kosovo</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/ZKU4">http://archive.is/ZKU4</a>   AND  <a href="http://archive.is/frp2W">http://archive.is/frp2W</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the aftermath of the U.S.-led war in Kosovo in 1999, this nascent democracy, born of an international effort to protect human rights, has become a hub of the global trade in human beings, according to human rights investigators who monitor human trafficking.
This industry, which operates in a shadowy underworld where former members of armed militias have turned into murderous enforcers in a criminal enterprise, nets an estimated $32 billion globally every year and is widely considered by international human rights’ investigators to be the fastest growing criminal activity in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting, right? Human trafficking coming from the aftermath of a Clinton waged war. Another quote from the two:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) commanders and their ties to the United States and other Western countries, interviewed three men involved in sex trafficking in Kosovo, two Albanians and Luan, a Kosovar Albanian. All three men insisted that some senior political figures, specifically former KLA commanders, were indeed involved in the trafficking of women and girls. Furthermore, GlobalPost has obtained several intelligence reports from NATO military and intelligence services that also claim senior former KLA commanders have been involved in the sex-slavery business. Further bolstering the claims, various well-informed people, including a former NATO intelligence official who worked in Kosovo and a Western diplomat with experience in the region, all say that it has been common knowledge in American, NATO and U.N. circles for years that the former guerrilla commanders — many of them now in positions of great power in Kosovo — are believed to be linked to sex-trafficking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Luan said that officials in the parties of two former KLA commanders are closely tied up in the trade. The parties are: the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), whose leader is the current prime minister of Kosovo, Hashim Thaci; and the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), whose leader is Ramush Haradinaj, a former prime minister”
<a href="http://archive.is/96C6w">In this lovely biography of Hashim Thaci,</a> we can see that he indeed is from the PDK. It also states that he was in the KLA. In fact this is the quote; “Hashim Thaçi is one of the founders of the political-military organization, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).”
It also states that he graduated from the University of Prishtina… which is a <a href="http://archive.is/I7y4g">lie</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honoured Biden family, </p>
<p>Allow me to say a few words in the end:</p>
<p>Beau, a few years before his premature death, said “It is not always good to focus on the goal, without taking into account the means used to get there”. </p>
<p>At times, one must rise above momentary emotions and the noise of daily news. </p>
<p>We must look ahead. </p>
<p>Just as the road on which we are today, which is a new connection of Kosovo to the world, in the same way we should be part of regional and international solutions. </p>
<p>We, as Kosovo, must now provide solutions </p>
<p>We must give our friendship to neighbours, and close the chapters of the past. </p>
<p>Giving our hand to a Kosovo Serbian parent, still searching for his missing child, does not make us weaker, but rather that makes us bigger.   
</p>
<p>Supporting equal rights for love of the LGBT community, does not make us with fewer morals, but rather gives us superior moral power. </p>
<p>Asking equal rights for a mother or a sister affected by domestic violence makes us stronger.  
</p>
<p>Insisting on the dignity of war veterans and children of war veterans makes us prouder. </p>
<p>Moreover, strengthening strategic partnership with Montenegro, without any dilemma regarding the border between our countries, does not make us historical losers, but rather common winners with a secured NATO future. </p>
<p>If we fully normalized relations with Serbia, we will give meaning to peace – reconciliation between our two nations and countries. </p>
<p>All of us will be winners. </p>
<p>Vice President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden, </p>
<p>I assure you, in this place, under the name of your late son Beau Biden, that Kosovo is a success story, a phenomenal story of the miracle done by the USA. </p>
<p>But above all, allow me to tell you that in this country, due to your work, the work of your family, and the work of late Beau, we are building a country equal to everyone. </p>
<p>I am sure that together we will succeed </p>
<p>Thank you. </p>

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Honoured Biden family,
           </p>
           <p>
            Allow me to say a few words in the end:
           </p>
           <p>
            Beau, a few years before his premature death, said “It is not always good to focus on the goal, without taking into account the means used to get there”.
           </p>
           <p>
            At times, one must rise above momentary emotions and the noise of daily news.
           </p>
           <p>
            We must look ahead.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just as the road on which we are today, which is a new connection of Kosovo to the world, in the same way we should be part of regional and international solutions.
           </p>
           <p>
            We, as Kosovo, must now provide solutions
           </p>
           <p>
            We must give our friendship to neighbours, and close the chapters of the past.
           </p>
           <p>
            Giving our hand to a Kosovo Serbian parent, still searching for his missing child, does not make us weaker, but rather that makes us bigger.
           </p>
           <p>
            Supporting equal rights for love of the LGBT community, does not make us with fewer morals, but rather gives us superior moral power.
           </p>
           <p>
            Asking equal rights for a mother or a sister affected by domestic violence makes us stronger.
           </p>
           <p>
            Insisting on the dignity of war veterans and children of war veterans makes us prouder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Moreover, strengthening strategic partnership with Montenegro, without any dilemma regarding the border between our countries, does not make us historical losers, but rather common winners with a secured NATO future.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we fully normalized relations with Serbia, we will give meaning to peace – reconciliation between our two nations and countries.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of us will be winners.
           </p>
           <p>
            Vice President Biden and Dr. Jill Biden,
           </p>
           <p>
            I assure you, in this place, under the name of your late son Beau Biden, that Kosovo is a success story, a phenomenal story of the miracle done by the USA.
           </p>
           <p>
            But above all, allow me to tell you that in this country, due to your work, the work of your family, and the work of late Beau, we are building a country equal to everyone.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am sure that together we will succeed
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you.
           </p>

             Cindy McCain Visits Serbian Kosovo

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Cindy McCain, whose husband courted her while he was still married (they were married one month after his divorce from his first wife in 1980), who stole drugs from her own charity, is visiting mafia friends in the Serbian province of Kosovo, thereby attempting to lend legitimacy to the illegitimate mafia in control of the province, thanks to NATO aggression.
...
            </p>
            <p>
             The KLA, led by Thaci, also viciously attacked 300 defenseless Serb civilians in Prizren, including 10 Orthodox priests and Bishop Artemije at the Monastery, urinated on religious effigies, smashed statues, raped several nuns, destroyed the Statue of Emperor Dusan and slaughtered those who resisted. This massacre is one of countless others perpetrated by these Albanian terrorists against Serbs – at Grace, at Pec, at Racak and as recently as August 2003, when Serbian children were massacred at Gorazdevac.
The goal of Snake Thaci’s terrorist group was to "inflict organized and coordinated acts of violence throughout the southern Serbian province, inspired by the political goal of severing this region from Serbia and forming a separate state on its territory." Thanks to NATO benefactors, Thaci sits at the head of a terrorist drug and people trafficking artificial, illegitimate and mostly unrecognized state.
The war against Yugoslavia was erroneously portrayed by the corporate media as a "humanitarian" intervention. Not new for US administrations, it was waged on the basis of the Clinton Administration’s lies of a "genocide" being waged against Albanian Muslims in Serbian Kosovo. The Clinton Administration's war against Yugoslavia killed more people than the Serbian anti-terrorist campaign in Kosovo.

             Image captionKosovan Albanians swear they will never forget the role of the “Klintons” in the Nato bombing campaign which brought an end to conflict in 1999
A smattering of Albanian comes in handy when deciphering certain Pristina street signs. Otherwise it may not immediately be apparent that “Bulevardi Xhorxh Bush” refers to the former US president who insisted that Kosovo should become independent.
But only consonant pedants would demand a translation of the name of the busy thoroughfare which runs perpendicular to George Bush Boulevard. “Bulevardi Bill Klinton” is a tribute to the man Kosovan Albanians hold in the highest possible esteem.
Pristina has not just named a street in his honour. It also erected a larger-than-life-size statue of a beaming Bill Clinton, his arm outstretched in welcome. The man himself unveiled this monument when he visited Pristina to a rapturous reception in 2009.
This adoration also extends to Mr Clinton’s family. Just a few yards from the statue, a women’s clothes shop called Hillary adds a fashion element to the affair.
“We rate the Clinton family so highly,” says Elda Morina, a member of the family which owns both Hillary and a second outlet, Hillary 2.
“They made the whole world know our problems. For the first time everyone knew who are Kosovans. Bill Clinton is the person who revealed our suffering – and from that point we all had big sympathy for the Clinton family.”
