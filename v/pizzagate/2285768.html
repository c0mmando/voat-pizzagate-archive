            Honest question: I believe that there is a cabal of sinister people operating in a network in politics, hollywood and business. But what I don't understand is how an organization like Belizean Grove can just be created out of thin air? There are, what, 60 women on that list? What if one of them go to a meeting and say, "hey, this is pretty messed up sh*t, I'm reporting this"? I understand from organizations which have been operating in the shadows for years, but this one is new. Sometimes the connecting link between a conspiracy and fact are simple logistics, and I'm wondering how they work on this?

             When it comes to cabals and "I'm reporting", think in terms of an organized crime group as to how leakers are dealt with. Add in how cabal types are typically psychopaths and you get a clear picture. Blackmail activities are also used to ensure secrecy.
            </p>
            <p>
             As to why this group seems new, its because they are new. Less than 20 years old.

             I didn't even know they existed until 2 weeks ago. Literately discovered them BY ACCIDENT when looking at other leads. Kept notes because I had a hunch this lead was important.

            In that area of town, a 7th floor "office" isn't an office. It's a residential apartment with someone working on their laptop in the living/dining room. It's the same address that's listed for the HQ of the Belizean Grove organization. So that tells me that even though their list of staff and associates is very long, they are not working out of a real office with a support staff. This makes me wonder how much money is actually coming into the organization. If members pay something, how much is it and where is it going?

              Certainly a lesson in keeping my pent up rage in check (and I have A LOT of it from all the shit from both what we're finding AND from past shit in my life). Can't give in to it lest I become just as bad as those I oppose. Guess I know what kind of Jungian "shadow" I have to work with.

               You bet.  I feel your pain. I've been dealing with them since 2015, they behave as they are: a criminal organization.
They'll meet justice in the end and they won't like it.

                Trying to understand that.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, if Persona is based off Jungian Psychology, a "shadow" isn't inherently evil, everyone has one, therefore the correct way to deal with a shadow is not to run from it, deny it, or rebuke it, but to accept it and learn from it?
               </p>
               <p>
                By transmutation, you mean using that "shadow" (pent up rage) and use it to achieve positive change? Such as stuff like "Anger, rage, hatred, and desire for vengence being changed/matured into righteous fury to elect the positive change of bringing true justice"?

                 Yes, and I recommend reading The Power of Now. Instead of shunning or shaming or ignoring or repressing our pain, the key is to embrace it and flood it with light and love, and there it transmutates. Its very powerful

                 The only thing that makes a shadow "evil" is the dangerous fruits of any repression of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The shadow is dangerous because it is by definition stuff you aren't aware of because you've jettisoned it from your sense of "self" unconsciously. Like priding yourself in being a nice person for example when you really have a very deep repressed rage about something. You refuse to be a violent person and go out of your way to be nice, abhor violence in others...but you're denying a real part of yourself that may erupt suddenly when you're not in full control.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you're aware of your inner asshole, or inner child, or inner tramp or whatever "shadow" side you've locked in the basement, it is no longer a shadow, in Jungian terms, just an unsavory part of your character that you don't let have the upper hand.
