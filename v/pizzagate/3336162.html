<blockquote>
<p>Google paid a reported $151 million to acquire their Zagat Survey in 2011. But when the Zagats first hatched their ultimately iconic venture back in 1979, no publisher would put out the guide. “They all turned it down,” Nina told the crowd, including Hilary Geary Ross, celebrity chef Michael Ferraro, Mary L. Pulido and Fox News’ Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. “They thought it was a terrible idea … they said [diners] did not want to hear from other people — they wanted to hear from experts.”</p>
<p>So the Zagats put it out the publication themselves, and soon wound up earning more from the food guide than their salaries as attorneys at the time.</p>
<p>The inspiring gala raised over $700,000 to support the NYSPCC’s Trauma Recovery Program, which offers a specialized therapeutic program for children. Wines at the foodie bash were donated by House of Burgundy, Frederick Wildman, Cognac One, M.S. Walker, Opici Family Distributing and Surly Penguin.</p>

            They knew the SV40 cancer causing monkey virus was in 98 million shots of the Salk Polio vaccine. Got the cancer industry nicely kicked off. They followed that success up with HIV (developed by Litton Bionetics) being placed in the experimental Hep B vaccine and given to gay men in NY &amp; SF in 78.

              Its in the book - Emerging viruses AIDS and Ebola by Leonard Horowitz. 
He was the insurance companies lead investigator in the dental patients claim that they were infected by their gay dentist - if you remember that story? Also it was reported in the Church Committee that the government had funded development of the "Special Virus Program" to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. I have the flow chart for its development its based on a Lenti virus and the spec required that no natural immunity and no vaccine could be developed - so its held true to its original design.

            Not really.  Salk for example is notorious for being the literal face (on CIA magazines like Time no less) of a large vaccine project team to
            <strong>
             bolster the myth that Jews are simply natural high-achievers and even in useful areas like science where they aren't
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            They also do this by awarding Jews Nobel Prizes so often as to create a citable "fact" to justify this continued Frankfurt School practice of inserting kikes at the top of fields like Jared Diamond or Pinker, who is likewise promoted as part of the new atheist movement.

            And you ended with, shocker, an Armenian, who as any Turk knows are no better than Jews and dogs.
