<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE | Thursday, October 19, 2017</p>
<h1 id="md-new-jersey-corrections-officer-charged-with-receipt-of-child-pornography">New Jersey Corrections Officer Charged with Receipt of Child Pornography</h1>
<p>NEWARK, N.J. – A corrections officer with the N.J. Department of Corrections was arrested and charged today with receiving images of child sexual abuse, Acting U.S. Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick announced.</p>
<p>Stephen Salamak, 37, of Lodi, New Jersey, was arrested at his home by special agents of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and charged by complaint with one count of receiving child pornography. Salamak made his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph A. Dickson. He was released on $125,000 unsecured bond, with home confinement and electronic location monitoring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:</p>
<p>Salamak used email to seek and obtain images of child sexual abuse, including images of prepubescent children.</p>
<p>The charge of receiving child pornography carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison, a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison, and a $250,000 fine. </p>
<p>Acting U.S. Attorney Fitzpatrick credited special agents of ICE HSI, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Debra Parker; and the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office, under the direction of Prosecutor Gurbir S. Grewal, with the investigation leading to today’s charge and arrest.</p>
<p>The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Alfonzo Walsman of the U.S. Attorney’s Office Criminal Division in Newark.</p>
<p><sup>The charge and allegations contained in the complaint are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.</sup></p>

<p>10. During and after search of the residence, and after being advised of his Miranda rights, defendant SALAMAK admitted to law enforcement officers, among other things, in substance and in part, that: (1) he placed a the Craigslist advertisement referenced in paragraph 2 above and that &quot;Cheese Pizza&quot; was a reference to child pornography, (2) he engaged in the communications with the UC referenced in paragraph 3 above; (3) he has knowingly received emails containing child pornography; and (4) he has knowingly communicated with various individuals online regarding child pornography and pedophilia.</p>

             The takedown of consumers of CP who are blackmailable Corrections employees are intrinsicly pizzagate related. I would think that would be obvious. A bureaucracy riddled with such individuals, especially in the justice system, is a perfect way to make things like the silencing of Jeffery Epstein possible.

             left out a key bit of info, probably to avoid provoking the Q haters.
             <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/iy9nwg.png">
              Q just posted this link on Feb. 8 and highlighted "Cheese Pizza"
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             We've always wondered who dropped the pedo food code post on 4chan that caused everyone to scour the Podesta and DNC emails for "cheese" and "pizza" in September 2016, sparking the "pizzagate" investigation, the creation and banhammering of this subverse, and the organized media attempt to delegitimize it by
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2253052">
              coining the term "Fake News,"
             </a>
             a dagger which Trump grabbed by the blade, flipped in his hand and has been stabbing them with ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2984913/16267548">
              Trump coined the term Pizzagate
             </a>
             and Q has proven he is working intimately with Trump, it's notable that Q's first crumb on 4chan -- the launching of the publicly acknowledged backchannel communication campaign from the Trump Whitehouse -- occurred eight days after the arrest of this Corrections officer using the key term "Cheese Pizza" to solicit child porn on Craigslist. It supports the idea that the Q Team has been leaking this stuff all along, and doing so most explicitly when anons fail to note key evidence in the news like this arrest. Q frequently says "You have more than you know" and urges people to reread the drops in light of news events.

             , before Q showed up. We did not, however, do a good job of spreading this news on Twitter at the time, though. That was prior to formation of the Q Army alternative news distribution network, so it only got 1700+ views.

               Then what's the point of (anyone) researching anything then?  Everyone should go home and live their lives as best they can.  Why redpill anyone with that blackpill waiting to drop?  'Oh sorry, no can ever do anything about anyone or anything ever.  Joke's on you!  We just want people to be miserable knowing about how bad things really are and then rub it in their faces that spending one minute thinking there's any hope that something good could happen.'  So we're all just sorry saps.  Got it.  But yet you worry about following the rules to a T on this sub?

                Hey k9, sorry this makes you so angry. I said none of this, ever. Getting the evidence documented, saved and distributed is most important to me. The negative impact of the cult-like nature of Q, pisses me off. Wasting time on the disinfo, pisses me off. I don't think you are a sorry sap, and I am filled with hope for the masses to finally awaken. I don't think I care too much about the rules of this sub anymore. But since fagos insists on running around throwing shade on submitters who have fewer secretarial skills than he does, behind their backs, I do think his submissions should be held to the same standard he insists for others. There is/was no explanation as to how this is PG related. I'm sure he is grateful for your defense.

                 I was responding to the logical conclusion of your black pill ethos.  I don't know if Argos' post meets the rules, and like you, at this point I also don't care.  But since you think I'm only responding in order to defend him, I will say that he has more integrity on a bad day than DanglingTurdBall will ever have over his entire lifetime.

                   Given that DingleGoatTurd was bragging about chasing off Q supporting PG researchers, and given that the two of you come across as PG gatekeepers who don't do research, I'll admit that I was perturbed by what I called your "Blackpill Ethos".  I wouldn't call what I said an attack, but apparently it felt that way to you.  I saw Vindi's thread earlier before DraggingGoatScat and Argos started commenting.  I checked back in to begin to do some searches in regards to research.   Q supporters didn't/don't shit up this sub, "

                    The only thing ES and I have in common is our belief that Q and PG are two separate things, and therefore should be kept separate.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I  never learned how to do secretarial stuff on the internet. You let me loose in a library or an archive building and I'll show you research, none of that stuff is on the web (without paying fees).
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I can't help you being disturbed by your misunderstanding of a long-continuing conversation that vin and i have been having, on and off, for years, mostly in DM.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I stopped actively participating in PG sub months ago, I mostly don't read posts under 5 days old, so I'm not current with what the problem is with ES and fagos. I hope they both drown in their own vomit.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I think Qturds do shit up the PG sub, I also think that all the anti Q submitters have been systematically driven away.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    ALL the victims of MK and other gov ops that were here and could have helped, driven off by pro-gov retards, aka Qturds.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Qtards refuse to address any of the concerns of serious debunkers, choosing to scream out in pain as they strike  those of us who refuse to be fooled by the gov, AGAIN.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    How come the only people who really believe in free speech and a right to debate thoughts and ideas are anti Q?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Qturds need to stay in their safe spaces if they want everyone to agree with them.

             To refresh everyone's memory that "cheese pizza" is a code for pedophilia (child porn).  This is likely to come up in the news over the next few days.  Maybe Skippy?

             Good question. But one way or the other, it's clearly pissing off the usual suspects – evidenced in the update at the bottom of my main post here.
