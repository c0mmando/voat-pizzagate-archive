<p>The symbolism that is in this picture is seen at the Corporate center to Bank Of America. Kinda creepy honestly. 
John Podesta currently had dirty money in Russia and had gotten called out by Trump from a tweet can\'t find!!!
The symbolism in this link is important because it goes to show you that these occult groups show things hidden in plain sight. For Example, Pedophilia Symbols that are hidden out in plain sight as well: <a href="https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols">https://wikileaks.org/wiki/FBI_pedophile_symbols</a></p>
<p>My two question\'s are is WHY would these occult groups simply go out and leave symbolism of there existence in different areas of our nation. Secondly, Why would they want there occult or secret society to be able to be recognized?
These pedophilia occults or groups as you would call them might have a big role in WELL KNOWN BANKS ACROSS THE WORLD. FOLLOW THE MONEY!!!!</p>
<p>These occult groups are playing a huge role in our society that only demonstrate the deviant acts that are horrifying. I believe pizzagate is only one part of the puzzle. and we need to start looking into the elite classes all over the world to see if we can find any other connections to pizzagate as well as these secret occult groups. </p>
<p>P.S. If I need to make changes let me know I am new to this type of stuff so go easy on me. Mods please let me know what I can change on how to improve my little bit of research.</p>',

            My statement was correct.  They had BOTH knowledge and "wisdom."

           <p>
            The Pythagorean theorem was at the core of one of the earliest secret societies.  That is KNOWLEDGE, not wisdom.

            Have many times. You as well with your consistent support of Hitler &amp; the Nazi's as fighting the good fight against Satanists.You are very misinformed or lying.

            Sources been supplied repeatedly and also include the Bible that you like to quote.

           <p>
            Also have direct testimony from eye witness to the Occult practices &amp; Luceferian worship by Hitler and his inner circle. The occult is so dark and taboo it has yet to grace this investigation.

            Any hints leading there are shut down. So research for yourself or don't. Matters not am well aware of the truth.

             From my research, the scholarly community seems to be divided on the relationship between Nazism and the Occult, not to mention Christianity.
            </p>
            <p>
             Other issues like Hitler and the Rothchilds relationshipd is expoused by some but repudiated by others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even the Holocaust narrative increasing divides people.  And I am seeing this from people who are definitely not Nazis.
            </p>
            <p>
             And while the Outer Dark Channel has some good videos and information, he also promotes people like former Catholic priest Malachi Martin.  A person who was outed by both James Perloff and Michael Collins Piper as a double-agent/infiltrator of B'Nail Brith.  So he does not have the entire truth either.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then again, as one of my former teachers once said, NOBODY has the entire truth on anything.

            To see a very good presentation and thorough understanding of occult iconography in the Bank of America murals and Denver Airport murals.

           <p>
            The truth is very unnerving but if we are not aware we cannot be prepared or help others see these signs.

           <p>
            It has very specific details about the occult and these murals as well as architecture inside the Popes audience hall.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you want to have a deeper understanding of the occult (Satanic) worship occurring inside the Nazi party and the worship of the Black Sun watch this channel. He has studied this for years and has interviews with ex-CIA officers, Satanists, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            The videos are easy to follow and shocking when you discover the same iconography that was placed inside the castle used in sacrifices by Hitler is also in murals in the US.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those that still do not believe Hitler and his inner circle were Satanists I challenge you to look deeper. Have eye witness testimony that has yet to be released.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hitler was also personally chosen and then initiated by a notorious dark occult leader who proclaimed Hitler was the Messiah of Germany on his deathbed.
           </p>
           <p>
            You can also research Adolph Hitler's history. His mother became pregnant with him when she was a maid kept inside B. Rothschild home. What we have always thought might not be true.

            Listening to Operation Gladio (audio book) right now and at times want to throw up. NOTHING is as it seems. I fully agree, OP - and this is good work. The Illuminati bloodlines are preparing themselves,  and preparing us. I believe that this is the epitome of good versus evil, so I'm going to start spreading more love in all aspects of my life. In that vein, you all should know that I appreciate the work everyone is doing here and I love it...none of us will rest until something breaks here. People are sacrificing personal time every day to save these children...and for that, I love you!!! Thank you doesn't fully describe my appreciation for everyone's efforts.

            The Vatican was not just infiltrated it was created by the Roman Empire after the crucifiction. The Jewish priests had turned Jesus over to them for claiming to be the Son of God.
           </p>
           <p>
            Many people (the sick, &amp; poor &amp; burdened &amp; children) flocked to him during the three years he was walking amongst the people and believed he was the Christ.
           </p>
           <p>
            After his crucifiction on "no charges" &amp; his ressurection on the third day many more people came to believe he was the Christ.
           </p>
           <p>
            This was sweeping through the land and the Romans needed to get hold of it to control the people. Roman Catholicism was part of that with new texts &amp; new rules including once again having people submit to church authority to gain access to God &amp; forgiveness. Rules were created that were the antithesis of what Jesus had preached.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is not "Jews" and it seems to fall into the category mentioned by Jesus in the Bible "beware of the Jew who is not really a Jew"
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't know what is true anymore but the historical facts tell a different story than most of us were led to believe. The hunch is the Rothschilds are "the Jews who are not really Jews" Genectically this was found to be true. Soros also falls into this category. These are the khazarian they are not Jewish. They are fake Jews who actually practice Satanism it seems.

              Edit: First I would like to focus that the sender of the email was Sid (Blumenthal) who actually was not supposed to be involved with HRC at the State Dept. on orders of Obama so once again as in Benghazi we see him intricably involved in HRC state department.
Sid Blumenthal works for his own self interest as disgusting as they are. 
I think studying B.N. history can be very helpful. The story of his brother Yoni is remarkable and heroic from what is in public. Bibi spent a lot of time in New York and the US. Most of his time actually. That is why he speaks with Americanized English. 
Will look into his father more. Thank you. 
There is a lot of misinformation about Zionism and the greater Israel project.  Will study this more it is not easy to parse through. For those that claim all Jewish people are evil are wrong. I am not Jewish and do not know any Jewish people. Am an historian and study scripture and other ancient texts.
             </p>
             <p>
              I understand the Jewish people are blinded to Jesus Christ being the Christ or Messiah. This is spoken about in scripture. The Romans were also blinded and therefore took Jesus from the Jews and completed the crucifiction.
             </p>
             <p>
              All these things are spoken about in ancient and biblical texts. Including prophesies of what is to come.
             </p>
             <p>
              Will be researching thanks for the info.

             YES! Exactly correct. They are fake Jews but hide under the umbrella of never to speak bad about a Jew or your a Nazi, anti-semantic. They are Zionists/Satanists.

              Yes exactly right. In fact they are genectically linked to Ashekenazi "Jews" who are from khazar. These tribes were never Jewish they were/are zionists/Satanists. If everyone can work to seperate these facts huge progress will be made. Zionists are not Jewish they are as written in scripture the Jews who are not really Jews" They practiced mysticism and Satanic occult rituals and They want to take over the world. This is the illuminati which is a take on "the enlightened or illuminated" this is the same name and description of Lucifer the fallen angel cast to earth by God. This is who they worship in the highest levels. This is who they sacrifice babies to.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Ashekenazi or khazar SS became the Nazi party. Their intent was to erase all real bloodlines and genectic history of real Jews. This is still their intent and to have everyone else under the power of their god Lucifer.

               If people do not wake up to these facts you just put out there, we will always be controlled, manipulated, abused and wiped out from them. The Zionist are a sect like Radical Jihadist (shit, they are probably the same group for all I know) and I for one will not be silenced nor take being called a Nazi or racist anymore for calling it what it is.
              </p>
              <p>
               We all know history keeps getting "re-written" to cover all this.  But as long as there are some of us out there to keep speaking the truth, we can only hope to redpill some of the youth that still have some morals and brains.

            Awesome research and you are 100% correct. To find corruption, you have to follow the money. It's hard because they hide it well. Panama Papers proved this with off shore accounts, fake companies and so forth. If anyone knows about how this stuff works, please try and dig into the Panama Papers

            Offshore leaks portion and just punch in any keywords like WJC or Clinton or Soros..it shows trails but unfortunately, not a ton of info unless someone knows how to connect dots better than I have. Don't search by country like USA because nothing really shows up. It seems like ALL info wasn't leaked which is bullshit.
           </p>

            I traced some Clinton stuff to what appears a lot of "Asian/Taiwan" connections. Kind of strange since HRC seems to love to wear those Asian looking painsuits things.

             That reads like something that you would hear from fundamentalist/Evangelicals regarding their "Jesuits rule the world" conspiracies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Interestingly, they do not mention anything about Zionism or the corruption and pedo scandals within the Protestant Churches as well (especially those evil and corrupt televangelists)...

            Project Paperclip brought thousands of nazis into secret projects and took over. Because president has no knowledge of what, where, when, how and who, I am unsure on how he plans to stop it.

            Everything these occult groups have power over to fund projects like MKUltra, weather control, etc. CIA was created to fund these black ops so control drugs, human and organ trafficking etc to carry on funding.

            At least $6 TRILLION disappeared from Pentagon before 911 .. my guess is it went on the same thing.

             I don't think zero energy machines exist. Tesla just figured out that you can cathoidize a wire sitting in the open air and ground it with the neutral Earth. All you have to do is put a wire in the air and ground it with the ocean. The air is naturally lacking electrons because many of them get ejected into space by gamma rays in the upper atmosphere. You just use the energy associated with the charges evening out to drive a generator.

            Just another piece of the power structure... the only thing left would be if they really are interdimensional Lizard creatures, which at this point would be more believable considering the atrocities they have committed.

            Good point! I did write a book report in College about 777 and Other Qabalistic Writings of Aleister Crowley. Very interesting book to read. My personal opinion we still cannot let corrupted secret societies have immense Power, Prestige, and embed into our functioning government. This will only favor them in the end. They could careless about human-beings in our world.

               It isn't really even about the Vatican though. It's just the idea that there is this group that goes back at least 10k years.

                The idea is that before that date, they (the illuminati, or whatever you wanna call them) did not ENTIRELY control the world or the RCC. That's the point I was trying to make. My first comment was that it was "infiltrated" at some point. That it was not founded by Jews.

                 I think that it's a tossup. It's too hard to tell for certain either way in my opinion. It's somewhere between very VERY close to ENTIRELY, and not at all at its founding.

                  If the RCC was founded by "crypto Jews", then the would've accepted the Zionist's plans from Theodore Herzl in the earlier part of the century; instead the Zionists had to go to the Protestant/fundamentalist churches to get their support.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Although the changes since "Vatican II" have largely put the Church under lukewarm Zionist support unfortunately.

             Yeah my whole understanding of history is radically changed.  The Satanic Cults that hide under the Masons or the Jews or the Rothschilds or the Royal Families of Europe.....they have been at this for at least one thousand years.   I cant pass a military grave yard without thinking......they all died for a fucking LIE!

                 It was INFILTRATED in 1541. It was not founded by crypto Jews. This obelisk was created after the infiltration. An ex-Jesuit priest called Alberto Rivera, became a whistleblower and explained how the Vatican and Roman Catholic Church was infiltrated by members of the illuminati, AKA, freemasons, knight's templar, knights of malta, skull &amp; bones, et al and created the New Word Order agenda. The CIA AKA Jesuits finally got hold of Rivera and silenced "poisoned" him in 1997.

                  NO, the obelisk was moved from Egypt and dates back to ~37 B.C. From the link I already provided -
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  "Sadly, little is known of its origins or which Pharaoh ordered its construction, but
                  <strong>
                   <strong>
                    it was certainly quarried in Egypt and intended to be erected in Heliopolis. Sometime between 30 and 28 BC the red granite obelisk shows up in Alexandria
                   </strong>
                  </strong>
                  under Augustus’s instructions to have it erected in the Julian Forum there.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It was Gaius Caligula who had the obelisk bought to Rome in 37 AD. It was the largest non-inscribed obelisk to leave Egypt, at 25.5 m high and weighing an estimated 326 tonnes. The obelisk was originally erected in gardens Caligula had inherited from his mother, and then on the central Spina of Caligula’s circus. Much of the circus is under under the basilica and square, the original spot for the obelisk is near the present-day sacristy, south of the basilica.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Because of the solid pedestal on which the obelisk was placed, it remained standing for 1,500 until it was moved to where it stands today in Saint Peter’s Square. It took thirteen months, between 1585 and 1586 to move and re-erect the obelisk. The idea to move it was that of Pope Sixtus V, as part of his desire to recover and re-erect all the obelisks lying then in the ruins of Rome."

                  The "infiltration" story is BS disseminated to the sheeple to throw them off track.  Obviously it worked with you.

                  No. The Vatican was infiltrated long before then. Pope Sixtus moved a bunch of fucking Egyptian Obelisks up to Rome in the 1400's to make astral alignments which nod to Egypt. You're at least off by 100 years. I'd venture to guess that the Catholic Church was founded by the Crypto "Jews". They conducted the Crusades to get all of the Egyptian knowledge. That takes us back to the 1100's. Before then, they were killing all of the people with "pagan" knowledge which was pretty much leftover symbolic knowledge from long long time ago. We are looking at an institution founded by "Jews". I say "Jews" because it isn't really Jews. It's a group that I still don't understand. It's one group.

                    Zionists. The whole anti Semitic thing needs to end. Anytime anyone calls out Zionists it is like a taboo to speaking badly about Jews. The thing is, even Jews (real) protest at the WH against Zionists.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And search Wiki re: Holocaust. You will see where it is taught in all countries/schools and through media. It's like a brainwashing to never question Jews (truly Zionists) and to stand strong with Israel. But even Jews do not stand with Israel. Pics of protests NOT covered by MSM. This was right after Trump took office and Netanyahu came to US. Caught my attention on Twitter, started to read the tweets and saw the real Jews are totally against Israel.
