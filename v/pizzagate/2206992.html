<p>Under a clever masquerade of critiquing “political correctness”, Furedi has authored propaganda pieces dealing with child-adult relations. He couches his dialogue as if it were against a PC big-brother paternalism from the state and what he calls “paranoid parenting” (ie – parents concerned to protect their children). The true purpose of the dialectic is an absolutely deft critical theory defence of pedophiles, centered around the Centre for Parenting Culture Studies at Kent University. The mask has on occasion slipped, notably in 2010 when a representative of the group Helen Reece issued a pamphlet telling the government to allow convicted sex offenders, including pedophiles and rapists to adopt children.[6]</p>

<p>Later on Furedi became associated with Living Marxism and its entryist front group web-journal Spiked.
During his RCP days, Furedi attempted to hide his identity behind the name Frank Richards.</p>
