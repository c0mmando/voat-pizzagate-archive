            All of this is to push the "Chip" think about it. There is always something lurking in the background. Would you chip your kid if you thought it would keep them safe? National register of children?

            Not that we can trust figures provided by the government or the media, but they're the ones who provided the 800,000 figure and its explanation. Apparently, these statistics are based on a 2002 US Department of Justice study that looked at data from sources throughout the country a few years earlier. According to the co-author of the study, David Finkelhor, 99% of those 800,000 children reported missing soon turned up. Many just weren't where their parents expected them to be, some ran away, some were taken by the non-custodial parent or other relatives, and eventually returned or accounted for. Stranger abductions are reportedly very unusual. "Just 115 of the 797,500 children were subject to what Finkelhor and his co-authors define as a "stereotypical" kidnapping - that is, they were abducted by a stranger and detained overnight, perhaps permanently, or taken at least 50 miles away." (

            )
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't believe permanently disappearing children outnumber cancer deaths or anything close to it. I know a large number of people who have died of cancer or who have told me they had friends or family who have died of cancer. I don't know personally know anyone who has had a child kidnapped and I don't know of anyone who's ever told me their friends or family have had a child go missing and never return. If it were as common as cancer deaths, most of us would personally know or know of dozens of people in our lifetimes who'd had their children kidnapped. In my experience, this isn't the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            Keep in mind that many of the children abused in Pizzagate aren't missing or aren't reported missing if they go missing. They're abused by their parents or other family members in Satanic ritual abuse, which they are then brought up to perpetrate on others within the cult. Victims have reported being forced to bear children to be sacrificed or given abortions, after which they have been forced to partake in eating the fetus. These babies aren't reported born, nevermind missing. They have reported being forced to kill homeless adults. Children abused in foster care, daycare, schools, camps, or churches aren't reported missing. A lot of horrific abuse can go on without children going missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, there have been allegations that children have been kidnapped from war-torn or impoverished countries or countries without good birth registration systems. These children could be abused or murdered and wouldn't be counted as missing US children.

            You know when they say "50% more cleaning power" with the little asterisk that goes on to explain it's 50% more than xyz brand or whatever caveat.  That's the deal.  Use it if you want people to pay attention to a factual stat. Just like the ad agencies do with just about everything they do. Arguers are either obtuse or trying to keep the lid on PG.

            So you've just outed yourself.  Thanks, you'll be added to the list.

            Btw, not that slate can be trusted as honest or reliable (I'd say search voat for that info but the search bar is still gone), but even using your source: "But in other ways, the NCIC may understate the figures. Many missing persons aren't reported at all—a 1997 study estimated that only 5 percent of nonfamily abductions (in which a nonfamily member detains a child using force for more than an hour) get reported to police. Some police departments may not even bother filing a report when a kid runs away from home for a few days. It's also easy to lose track of abduction cases, since some of them get filed away under associated crimes, like homicide or sexual assault." But thanks for trying to detract.

             I think the other thing people aren't understanding is we are having children trafficked INTO this country, never to be seen again. We don't have any idea what kind of numbers we are talking about wrt that. But when other nations are opening stating that the U.S. steals their children, you'd have to guess that it's significant. Both Haiti and Mexico have had officials say exactly that. I know for a fact more nations have been utilized to get children from. Just a scary thought what that number could be..

            Just out of curiosity, does this number include kids who wander off and their parents panic and call the police, only for them to be found a few hours later? Not that it makes it any less of a grave number.... just thinking for clarity's sake.

             Your question illustrates the need for a standardized national reporting model for data. The variance between local reporting categories can often disguise the true numbers.

             is right. We are stating the "official" publicly available stats. That's all we have access to.
            </p>
            <p>
             A good line of research would be for people to explore their local districts policy on how missing children are reported, and what happens to the missing status once found. And other general reporting data and processes too. Then report back.

              Actually, for the sake of the cause,  I wouldn't bother wasting valuable research time with all that.  It's unnecessary.  The point is to get attention.  If people who see that stat want to dig deeper,  let them.  Actually,  that's exactly what we want.  Bc once they dig,  the truth becomes more and more clear.

                Agreed.  But for the point of capturing public attending, more kids missing than cancer deaths is surprising enough for a start. I just want people to tweet this/Fb it, etc! And tying it to cancer is a good way to go bc it gets everyone's attention.

             Doesn't matter.  It's a real, true number and that's all that's needed to get attention. As I'm sure you're aware,  it happens in advertising and marketing all. the. time. It's about time we employ the same techniques that work for everyone else rather than letting ourselves get bogged down in arguments that the opposition would use to throw at us.

              Of course it matters if we go around saying there are 800,000 children who go missing each year if 99% of them are found shortly after being reported missing. It allows people to say, "These people are lying alarmists pointing to obviously false data. We can't believe a word that comes out of their mouths." discrediting anything else we say.

               No one is intentionally misleading.  We are using the stats the "experts" have provided. And to say that only 115 kids go missing in this country a year is ludicrous.

               Exactly. If you go around intentionally misleading people, you're shooting yourself in the foot. Even if it's for a good cause.

              Fair point! I just like to be able to understand all sides of statistics. Definitely good ammunition though.
