<p>Diana Guinness And Hitler</p>
<p>1929, socialite Diana Mitford married Arthur’s distant descendant, Bryan Guinness. They had two children, Desmond and Jonathan, who would go on to inherit the Guinness empire. Their mother’s story, however, is a pretty baffling one. In the early 1930s, she began an affair with the leader of the British Union of Fascists, Oswald Mosley. Mosley, who was also married, refused to divorce his wife for her but married Diana once she had died—after Diana left her husband.They were married in the drawing room of Joseph Goebbels, with Adolf Hitler himself in attendance. Diana and her sister Unity had a close friendship with Hitler, which Diana would defend until the day she died, once declaring: “The man I knew could not have done all that. Perhaps he went a little mad.” Along with her sons by Bryan Guinness, Diana lived in Germany throughout the 1930s, although they would eventually move back after the war broke out. Her children with Mosley were forced to rely on private tutors, since no British school would accept them as since no British school would accept them as pupils.To make things even more complicated, Diana was also related to Winston Churchill—his wife was her father’s cousin. During the war, Diana and Oswald were briefly imprisoned under a law that allowed the wartime government to jail anyone that they deemed a threat to national security—they were accused of helping to establish pro-Nazi radio stations in Germany. Thanks to their ties with Churchill, the Mosleys didn’t suffer too much—they were allowed a small house, private gardens, and could even recruit other prisoners to be their personal servants.After the war, they lived mostly in France, near their good friends the Duke of Windsor and Wallace Simpson, although they frequently returned to England—especially to help the campaign to prevent non-white immigration into the country.</p>

            Do You Really Need an Office Furniture Installer?
           </p>
           <p>
            If you are moving your business office or have purchased new office furniture, your company may be tempted to save money by having just anyone who says they are qualified to install office furniture do it.  But trust us when we say that not just anyone can be an office furniture installer. It is truly a task to take on, especially if you have never done it before.  It is in your best interest to hire an office furniture installer in order to avoid issues.
           </p>
           <p>
            Office furniture installers are able to help with a variety of projects.  They can easily put together cubicles, any new furniture, modular workstations, and more.  Many of them have not only worked in offices, but in libraries, hospitals, hotels, schools and colleges, daycares, military bases, and much more

            Great research.. I'm not sure if this was addressed.  Why is Racheal listed as male on marriage registry?  Also why does Tom Guinness' sister Aster comes up as male in some places?

            I've been bothered by Mark Ronson for some reason that I havent figured out yet.  But I started looking into his family background and I'd like to leave some things here seeing as we're talking about Guinness...

            Guinness Affair :

            Ernest Saunders :
           </p>
           <p>
            The Guinness share trading fraud was one of the most famous British business scandals of the 1980s. Guinness shares were to be inflated in order to assist its takeover by the Scottish drinks company Distillers. Ernest Saunders, Gerald Ronson, Jack Lyons and Anthony Parnes were the perpetrators of this crime. They planned to raise the share price of the Guinness in order to win the bid of takeover of Distillers. They paid out indemnities to the companies who were part of the scheme and other awards were paid to the companies that supported them in the scheme. All four were convicted of dishonest conduct of share support in the Guinness Affair.

            Guinness directors showed 'contempt for truth'
Friday, November 28, 1997
            <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/34910.stm">
             http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/34910.stm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "Mr Saunders was convicted of false accounting, theft and conspiracy, in 1990.
But his five-year sentence was halved on appeal. He was released from open prison after serving only 10 months when doctors said he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a permanent condition.
At the time of his appeal, a psychiatrist said he was unable to recall three numbers backwards and did not know who was President of the United States.
Mr Saunders health subsequently improved but his advisers denied he had made a "miraculous recovery" from Alzheimer's disease, suggesting instead his illness while in prison was stress-related.
Mr Saunders has since carved out a lucrative consultancy career while at the same time negotiating his £75,000 annual pension from Guinness. "
Also jailed were stockbroker Anthony Parnes and tycoon Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron empire, who had agreed to buy Guinness shares as part of the illegal share-support operation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr Saunders was supported by the cream of the City establishment during the Distillers bid.
Guinness's lawyers were Freshfields, merchant bankers Morgan Grenfell and Henry Ansbacher were also on hand, and the brokers were Cazenove, the most blue-blooded of City firms.
Lord Spens was forced to resign as Chief Executive of Henry Ansbacher - but was later acquitted of fraud.
           </p>

            ********************************  (Seeing the relations going to HItler and the Rothschilds, the blue blooded support seems easier to understand now...)

             Gerald Ronson :  Gerald Maurice Ronson, CBE (born 27 May 1939) is a Jewish business tycoon and philanthropist.
He is the Founding Chairman of the Jewish Community Security Trust, Vice-President of the NSPCC and President of JCoSS
Ronson was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for charitable services, notwithstanding his convictions

             </a>
             Ronson is one of British construction’s most important clients, and one of British business’ most notorious figures. His company, Heron International, started as a furniture business run by his father. Ronson joined in 1954 aged 14 and became a partner in 1957. Then, by bringing the first self-service petrol stations to the UK in March 1966 and steering the business towards property development, he built it up to be one of Britain’s largest companies by the eighties.
But the success was short-lived. In August 1990, Ronson was convicted of conspiracy, false accounting and theft for his part in the Guinness share-trading fraud. He was fined £5m and spent six months in prison. Not long after, Heron collapsed with debts of £1.6bn owed to 82 banks and 15,000 bondholders. 
Ronson says that to this day he doesn’t quite know how he pulled his life back together. Certainly, he was helped by friends in high places. He borrowed money from Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch, communications billionaire Craig McCaw and other wealthy acquaintances to accumulate enough capital to get back into the game.

             With a mutual interest in musical endeavours, Lyons became acquainted with the Conservative Party Prime Minister Edward Heath, and remained close to his successor as Conservative leader, Margaret Thatcher.
Lyons was accused of having used his personal friendship with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to ensure the Guinness brewing group's offer for Distillers in 1986 was approved by the Office of Fair Trading. Thatcher replied to a letter from Lyons saying the matter would be passed to the minister then responsible, Paul Channon. The bid was subsequently unblocked.

They said Mr Yakovlev also allegedly secretly solicited a bribe from Societe Generale de Surveillance SA, a company seeking an oil inspection contract under Oil for Food.

              Back to Mark Ronson.  this can go a little all over the place.. Basically.. Music stars = Witchcraft and Occultism.  Which leads onto child trafficking for sacrifice and sexual abuse as rewards between perverts.
I'd have to complie a lot more research into showing how where why and who.. but it may be thousands of pages and I havent finished it yet..
(LOOK AT BIANCA JAGGAR) Why would someone who's so involved with fighting against Human Trafficking (check her CV and bio) be going to a Scissor Sister concert with James Alefantis..of course, everyone is free to hang out with anyone they want..

              A lot.. A LOT  (how do I make that go bigger??)  A FUCK LOAD OF A LOT of people confuse EVERYTHING with EVERYTHING usually shouting about Moloch, 
Baphomet the devil..(as if they were even the same religion..)  When its mostly just uninterested bored (stupid) people playing at Thelema without knowing what they're doing.

              "He and his partner, David Furnish, have a civil union and they are a high-profile same-sex couple. When they inquired about adopting a young boy in the Ukraine, they were denied this opportunity because of Elton John’s age (over 60) and his single status; civil unions are not recognized in Ukrainian adoptions and, as such, he could not apply as a married individual"
(Most of the white children involved in international trafficking come from Ukraine.. then United Kingdom (who fetch higher price because they speak english)

              Elton John's music is mostly written by Bernie Taupin who's a self confessed satanist and satanic references litter his songs.
Elton John also bought pedo-friendly 'artwork' from Elite Pedo mo-Fos Saatchi and Saatchi..(I could write books about those two..) (dont worry.. the genitals are fuzzed out)

            Before the comments start rolling in....you might want to self-delete and repost due to the spelling of Hanna Liden's name in the headline - no biggie, but unfortunately, we won't be able to find the post in the future when the spelling isn't correct.
