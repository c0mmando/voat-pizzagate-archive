<p>Part I: Background of the Trust
To start, the charity EveryChild has had three separate names over the decades: The Romanian Orphanage Trust (1990-1997), The European Children’s Trust (1997-2001), and EveryChild (2001-Present). </p>
<p>There’s also a company that runs in parallel to the Trust: “The Object for Which the Company is established is to carry on any trade or business…that can be carried on in connection with or ancillary to the charitable work of the Romanian Orphanage Trust.” In the articles of incorporation it claims this is for investment activities but I think the company name itself is more indicative of its actual purpose: “EveryChild Trading Ltd.” For fun, look at the creepy street art outside the London office building, filled with the huddled naked kid with a single eye on her shoulder, kids with cubes placed over their heads... good stuff. </p>
<p>Anyway, so let’s start this story with a guy named Donald McCready: he began the Trust’s company. It’s nearly impossible to find out who this guy is (trust me, I’ve looked), but he is a member of the European-Atlantic Group.

<p>If you’ve never heard of this group, as most people haven’t, these are the people who run the world--no joke. </p>
<p>The EA-G exists so that all of these power brokers can get together, share info among each other, collaborate with the politicians, and then profit mightily (at everyone else’s expense). If this sounds like an exaggeration, it’s not. From its Wikipedia page: </p>
<p>The European-Atlantic Group was founded in London in 1954 by Michael John Layton, 2nd Baron Layton (1912–1989) (then a Vice-President of the Council of Europe), together with other members of both Houses of Parliament, Industrialists, Bankers, Economists, and Journalists and Elma Dangerfield. Its main object was to promote closer relations between the European and Atlantic countries by providing a regular forum in Britain for informed discussion of their problems and possibilities for better economic and political co-operation.</p>
<p>The Founders stated that their purpose was to disseminate authoritative information concerning the work of International Organizations such as the Council of Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Western European Union, the European Coal and Steel Community, Euratom, the European Economic Community, as well as the European Free Trade Association, the Association for General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, and the Economic Commission for Europe.</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/jdjMx">http://archive.is/jdjMx</a></p>
<p>Each of these committees have  their own sub-committees that, in total, affect citizens at the local and global level.</p>
<p>So yeah. The founder of this organization, McCready, is buddies with all of these guys. </p>
<p>In the early 90s, he attended a few meetings that gave important briefings about the state of Europe. In 98, he attended one called “Overseas Development Aid.” It was filled with ambassadors, public policy advisors, law makers, judges, journalists, marketers, and transportation execs (think on that one for a sec). </p>
<p>In 99, he went to another gathering called “US Policy and International Security.” It’s curious he attended this meeting when he went under the banner head of being from a Children’s Trust, but this makes sense in Part IV.</p>
<p>In 2000, he went to another event called “Security Problems of Central and Eastern Europe.” </p>
<p>I point out McCready’s connections so y’all can keep in mind that this guy knows exactly what’s coming down the pipeline, how to exploit it, and who to work with to make it happen.</p>
<p>The other people on the board of the Trust circa 1990-2000  are also major powerhouses, who I\'ll be referencing later as well. Here\'s an overview

<p>Now that we\'re briefly acquainted with the people of the organization, I\'ll go over the origin of the Trust, the regions in which they work, and the economic conditions at the time. I don\'t care how boring you find this section, you gotta read it anyway to understand exactly how this went down. Also notice the parallels between the shit that\'s happening in this country, with the student protests, immigration push, etc. </p>
<p>Romania
The advent of the Romanian Orphanage Children’s Trust coincided with the fall of the Berlin Wall. By 1990, the country’s communist government was given the boot thanks to a violent civil uprising. This bloody overthrow--ending in the execution of the president--was very likely due to George Soros using his many think tanks, media connections and “pro-democracy” organization to foment dissent… all coupled with funding from USAID. It’s also likely the US was supplying the arms and acting as the covert military wing of the operation (as it so often does). </p>
<p>Having studied lots of uprisings at this point, what I\'ve noticed is that &quot;pro Democracy&quot; think tanks  funded by Soros (such as Podesta\'s) shape the political climate to foment dissent, the US provides the brute force, and Europe provides the rebuilding aid. US/EU share in intelligence and arms. Everyone splits in the proceeds, but the US generally gets the drugs…and Europe? They get the humans, if the conflict happens in their borders. </p>

<p>Once the communist supporters were ousted from Romania and its president was executed in public, the International Monetary Fund (a subsidiary of the UN) then played its usual role of thwacking the economy in the knees. The IMF’s prescribed “shock therapy” crippled the economy and made for a desperate, weakened population… and this in turn made for golden opportunities among multinationals to swoop in and loot the country for its valuable goods and services. The country then had to sign off on these privatization measures in order to receive bailout packages from the same consortium of institutions that authorized the hit job in the first place. </p>
<p>(Side note: if you want to learn more about this pattern, then read “Shock Doctrine” or “Confessions of an Economic Hitman”). </p>
<p>This was the European-Atlantic Group\'s way of telling Romania to bend over and pull down their pants. From the book, “Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery:”</p>
<p>First, the IMF mandated fiscal austerity measures [in Romania], such as cutting government expenditures on health care, education, unemployment benefits, and other social services. The logic was to promote efficiency, though the net result was to worsen the destitution of those who depended on such government programs. Second, the IMF advocated that the prices of products, services, and commodities should be dictated by market forces rather than a central authority, as had occurred under socialism... third, the IMF pushed for rapid market liberalization, opening local markets to foreign commercial and financial interests.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.academia.edu/23597105/Sex_Trafficking_Inside_the_Business_of_Modern_Slavery">https://www.academia.edu/23597105/Sex_Trafficking_Inside_the_Business_of_Modern_Slavery</a></p>
<p>This “remove from the government, privatize, and give to foreign commercial and financial interests” model was also applied to another lucrative industry: the baby market. </p>
<p>There’s the running joke that the difference between communism and capitalism is that in communism, humans are seen as the producer. In capitalism, the human is the consumer. This phrase, I’ve found, it literal. The same is true with the person who posted the Harvard lecturer who said, &quot;we sacrifice our children on the altar of capitalism.&quot; </p>
<p>In Romania’s former communist government, women who didn’t want their babies did one of two things: they dropped them off in government-run institutions, or they sold them to people directly. The number of babies available for foreign adoptions was quite small: in 1990, for example, just 63 foreign parents finally received their babies that were otherwise caught up in red tape (Denechere, Scutaru 2010). Nicolae Ceausecu wanted to increase the population by 20 million--a threat to EU/NATO--so he banned contraceptives and abortions. He kept a very tight rein on adoptions. Bureaucrats also had job security if institutions were full. All in all, this led to a lot of unwanted, state-controlled babies that in a better planned economy, could lead to a decent military. </p>
<p>But hey, NATO/EU just overthrew the leader, so that problem went out the window. Even now, any materials related to child welfare and Romania will claim that Ceausescu was the devil incarnate. The asset of the country’s population was also theirs for the take now, too. Indeed, the open economy led to a renovated, new market… in babies. The thinking was this: take the taxpayer money that was going to the government to run the institutions (because hey, “foreign companies can do it better and cheaper”), and become the new middleman by being the one to sell the babies instead of the mothers.</p>',

           But hey, NATO/EU just overthrew the leader, so that problem went out the window. Even now, any materials related to child welfare and Romania will claim that Ceausescu was the devil incarnate. The asset of the country’s population was also theirs for the take now, too. Indeed, the open economy led to a renovated, new market… in babies. The thinking was this: take the taxpayer money that was going to the government to run the institutions (because hey, “foreign companies can do it better and cheaper”), and become the new middleman by being the one to sell the babies instead of the mothers.

            please do, I'm more than intrigued...I skimmed what i could and read a few passages about NATO soldiers and the KLA. Fascinating work, you must have spent weeks researching this. I'd love to read it in depth.

            I guess the 19 parts were removed as spam.
How can we read more....is there a link to an archive or blog to see the rest?
