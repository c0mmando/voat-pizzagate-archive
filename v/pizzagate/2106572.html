<p>I also knew a friend of a friend that worked an extra job for money around Christmas, 2 yrs ago, at a FedEx hub at an airport. He worked the late night/morning shifts. He saw multiple FedEx planes that didn\'t have merchandise but people on them, all males, and buses near the terminal that they would load them on to and drive off.  So, the fake news that we are helping &quot;refugees&quot; yet, the women and children are missing (more than likely trafficked) and we bring hostile men here, unvetted, with diseases, many which do not want to even be here. </p>
<p>This vid shows how the &quot;refugees&quot; only recognize Sharia law and at 3:45 want to live in Muslim countries. They don\'t want to be here. </p>

            They are doing this on purpose to destabilize countries and also reduce population. They want to seperate men from women of child bearing age, the transgender push is also a part of this. Depopulation. It is in their own writing Agenda 21.

            They want civil wars actually wars if any kind to kill off most of us then create a one world government, one world religion. We are pawns in the game and when we are fighting they will be watching and laughing from protective bunkers.

             New World Order at its finest. Let's not forget big pharmas pushing vaccines with birth control. I still think of the artwork in Denver airport with the gestapo wearing a gas mask and bodies lying everywhere.  That is depicting the killing off of mass populations and then the new dawn where a new world is put in place. A preferred bloodline is moved forward.  Everything has its purpose. People now being pushed off their lands to urban areas through climate control issues, water wells are now being registered so the water supply is known.  Monsanto is proud of the fact that seeds sold to farmers no longer re-germinate, thereby, controlling the food source. It all has its purpose. Remove properly educating the children, remove religion, people's culture through statutes, flags, customs, etc. With everything taken away, govt controls healthcare as to who lives and who dies, where they live and what they eat. People do not realize what is slowly being taken away. This is why we need to wake everyone. Races don't hate each other, look at Texas. People extend a hand in need. The Deep State want to divide us so we are weaker divided. We are slaves being groomed to work for the Globalists.

              Are you aware of all the many tiny homes currently being built in Los Angeles? Barely big enough for a child size bed with shared bathrooms on each floor. Not even room for a cat. Yes they were considerate enough to add a Starbucks every 1/2 mile or so, as there's no cooking facilities either.
             </p>

              No room for garages, but then low-income workers won't be able to afford cars or hardly any possessions beyond the bare minimum. At least public transportation is being designed to run frequently due to the expected high demand. Doubt it will be free or cheap.

               I have watched the tiny homes phenomenon and am very interested. I have this need inside to give everything away but the basics and live a simple life surrounded by like minded individuals who respect each other and are kind. If only we had some property to go forth I would find a way to build a tiny home,

              Yes that is what is exactly what is happening. The Denver Airport mural epitomizes the occult worship of the Black Sun which is the underlying ideology of Nazi's. Many people do not realize this and falsely believe Hitler was not an occultist. He was worse he was a dark occultist straight up Luceferian along with Himmler. Many people get lost in his seeming attempts to create blonde hair blue eyed children, but do not realize this was before genetics were so easily studied. He was not a racist as much as a purist wanting only a pure bloodline to exist and be royalty. Any other survivors are allowed to live only to work for their masters. That is the New World Order. They have been gathering strength and purifying their bloodline since WW11 when they infiltrated the US through Operation Paperclip. There are only two presidents since then that did not hold that line and both were shot. JFK died, but Regan lived. Find out where his VP was on both occasions you will find many answers.

             The elite will still have their private planes to be flown into cult events like "Burning Men." Obviously business meetings took place in heavily guarded, segregated camps to allow tax write-offs for vacation time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Is this the kind of super organized and controlled "stress release" that will be allowed in the future? Note the existence of 24/7 orgy tents during the entire art festival. Soros has always advocated that all drugs and alcohol should be available all the time without age restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Volunteers got to skip the high fees by coming early and being put to work. Were they then seen as "party favors" and did they have to know someone to attend with those arrangements?
            </p>
            <p>
             Slightly off the subject but relevant. Another online site has asked me for additional verification somehow that live people were intentionally sacrificed at "Burning Man."
            </p>
            <p>
             Also an online friend and psychiatric nurse said she enjoyed going in part to share with those still in mourning for loved ones tragically killed.That's the purpose of the temple with meditation rooms and quiet spaces.One of the benefits of going to Burning Man she said is that people like her who don't normally discuss emotional pain can wail for hours, leave messages of emotional healing on the temple's walls, and then a few days later "see the universe accepting the burned messages along with the temple." In other words terrible grief due to losing a loved one has a definite end where one must go back to living and working normally.

            They bring them here to get cheap slave labor.  They have been doing this since they came over from England on the Mfayflower.  That was their intention.  To keep the same rules and laws that they said they were fleeing.  Some of those at the head of our country had slaves and it has continued ever since.  They have used all of our ancestors from different countries, Germans, Italians, Irish, and now Mexicans and those from the Middle East.  Each time they have found ways to make us hate them.  We must work very hard to remember they were brought here against their will.  I believe that possibly there will be a false flag this month and one or some of them will be blamed.  This will bring out those that are haters and there will be many innocent people killed.  I hope to God that I am wrong.  Please let me be wrong.

             I'd love to believe that angle regarding the mass influx of immigrants, particularly male immigrants, but I believe that the motive is to purposefully destabilize countries - to bring countries to their knees - so they can play the good guys and 'build them up again', only they'll be doing that how they want, which means a one world government. My reasons for thinking that? Well, these people
             <strong>
              know
             </strong>
             immigration, they know that above a certain percentage of the existing population things go to shit because there isn't time for integration. The levels of immigrants are so much higher than those levels that it absolutely HAS to be a deliberate act, knowing that society will fall apart. There will be many by-products of that of course, and some slave labour may well be one of those, I just don't see it as a main reason, there's not enough motive or reward long-term.

              Traffickers make $$$ bringing immigrants to Italy and elsewhere. Extortion is the norm. That means the criminal gangs that run them get major pay-offs. So do the sellers of any relevant supplies. Believe me those that created the mass migration situation immediately profit. That's before the drug trade, porno film producers, and pimps get into the game.

              In America refugees were being flown in at midnight by USPS airplanes, transported by private vehicles to their destination. Their charities and universities got $$$ for finding any Section 8, low-income housing. That also created local community anger as the seriously ill, disabled and very elderly spend years on waiting lists trying to compete for such apartments.

              It's been said the voting alliances are purposely being altered around the US as a result of all the newbies arriving.

              Those families with any $$ resources, education, real job skills like the creative arts, tech, the trades, which aren't solely dependent on knowing a 2nd language, quickly leave potential war zones. Their offspring have studied in the West and understand the culture so are sometimes able to adapt.
             </p>
             <p>
              While writing about it equals arrest, the truth is that the waves of immigrants we've seen especially from Africa are illiterate in even their native languages and completely unschooled. Germany's ER gave everyone health checks. The majority had at least 1 form of untreated VD. Many were carriers of tropical diseases previously unheard of in the West.
             </p>
             <p>
              Very, very few will ever be able to find even part-time or temporary work. Employers prefer to hire those from Viet Nam, China, or even Poland and the Ukraine who've made their way to the West. That's the real reason the Gulf States refused to take in any refugees. Sad to say hardly any are employable.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then again Saudi Arabia has plenty of subservient slaves from India and the Philippines who are viewed as being "better" than darker skinned Muslims as well as being more sexually desirable. Yes almost all slaves are regularly, violently beaten and raped.
             </p>
             <p>
              Their culture encourages them to have multiple wives and girlfriends, meaning lots of babies. Worst of all cousin marriage is the norm. While true in Saudi Arabia as well, genetic testing is required before the couple can marry. The rest of the non-Western world does not test for the very serious physical and mental disabilities and genetic disorders resulting from close relatives procreating.
             </p>
             <p>
              The free health services in England, grammar schools for the disabled and mentally challenged in Canada, and housing in Scandinavia which cab accommodate large families were almost immediately overwhelmed and financially stretched.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again a very high per cent of babies born to very young girls who are not getting sufficient nutrition, and who have married their cousins, but may not have older females around 24/7 to assist as they would in their native countries, will have babies requiring 24/7 care for life. In many countries necessity means even mildly disabled will be left to die. That's not true if their born in a Western hospital.
             </p>
             <p>
              A few wealthy Muslim business owners have started small companies in the US and elsewhere employing the new refugees. $$ has to be sent to the home country to support relatives. Therefore even if they work full-time large families guarantee a life-long welfare check.
             </p>
             <p>
              Yes this post is very long. However I wanted to thoroughly explain why it's really the very best choice for men to leave women and children of both sexes with relatives, friends, or even casually known members of their same sect or religion back home.
             </p>
             <p>
              Better for a child to be sold to 1 old man than to arrive in Italy and be kidnapped by gangs of immigrants frustrated with the total lack of opportunities. Drug mules live a little bit longer.
             </p>
             <p>
              In one Scandinavian country even older teen boys were rarely hired. Their suicide rate was/is astronomical as the alternative was the sex trade. In Sweden large number of women and girls have been raped. Sexual assault is a crime of anger and frustration. So WHO raises the mixed race babies when there is still so much suspicion and prejudice? Any wonder so many from the host country are attacked in revenge? Records are not kept in England of those reporting rape no matter how young.
             </p>
             <p>
              Expect more violence in the future, realistically. That means kids whose parents cannot afford to care for them leaving them very vulnerable to child traffickers of all kinds. I haven't even brought up the many who run away while still very young from physically, mentally and emotionally abusive homes where they are regularly raped by relatives and borders. Or beaten for becoming Westernized. Or for being gay. Or for not wanting to marry an old, abusive man.

              I agree with what you say, I think their plan is  both of these.  They can do their trafficking and force us to get on our knees at the same time.  They never miss an opportunity to double up on their evil.

               The thing that really gets in the way of thinking of 'slave labour' is the impending influx of AI. A lot of jobs will go when that really takes hold over the next couple of decades, which will create a lot of unrest in itself, let alone adding in to the mix the multitude of immigrants. It's not a good time to be alive I tell you. I'm genuinely fearful for our future, meanwhile most of the West has their backs turned and their eyes focused on Trump instead. Not good.

                Yes, I am not sure about Trump.  I have been willing to give him a chance, but know not to put too much hope in any one of them for I as some others fell for the Hopium.  I guess I am waiting to see what he will do but will not be shocked if he turns on us.  I have a feeling he may be doing things just to keep us guessing.  Incremental stuff. Like they all have been.  I of course hope that I am so very wrong.  It is just that so many have lost my trust.  Yes, jobs will be a huge problem and our children will be very untrained.  Their children will be able to afford college and ours won't.  That is the plan.  Generations ago, high school was not free, you had to pay so only the affluent could attend.  Many people do not know that.  Social Democrats gave us high school and good public schools but unfortunately they were infiltrated as was everything else.  The pedo elites did not like us having what they had.  They want to take it all away from us again.  We must keep an eye on Trump.  We cannot let them win.

             Exactly. Except they aren't all brought here. Many are left behind for the same purpose. If they separate the men from their family, it's easier to abuse all family members. It's so vile and disgusting.

             The UN needs investigating and disbanded. So do all these foundations/NGOs like AmeriCares.  All of them are fronts.

              When I think about which foundations and rescue orgs. are helping in Tex. it makes my blood boil.  Red Cross Fema, etc.  They are all involved in the whole mess and mire.  I remember Trump saying he was going to pull out of the UN.  What happened to that?  Did he make a deal or was threatened like some said Bernie did out of fear?  I hear nothing about it, I hope I am wrong and just missed it. The UN needs to go and so does Unicef.

                Only about 10% of all $$$ collected by the Red Cross goes to the charity. Countless have offered goods &amp; services only to be told "cash is king." Actual homeless/refugees do not agree. Worse head gets $300,000 per year plus perks &amp; benefits.

                Those in the know are aware Trump does not want any family members killed. That's why he has to "play ball" to a certain extent even if he disagrees with the process and the outcome. Pence as POTUS would be far, far worse. Exactly how many little kids has Trump killed? Exactly.That's why a sector of the FBI pushed hard for Trump as the better alternative.

                UN security forces are regularly accused of forced pedo behavior. They claim the underage desperately need their $$$. Therefore it's allowed. Cholera was spread in Haiti due to masses of UN employees  being paid to help on projects.

                Stories on the internet claim FEMA took forever to allow families to return to their homes because the elaborate underground primo "city" and "bug out" for the elites had not yet been finished. The ground was still too wet for safe underground tunnels. Yes there are video examples online.

                YES.  The donating of blood.  Do you suppose they are taking what is donated for themselves?  The blood that is needed for the elites, but is donated for disasters and other reasons.  It sounds disgusting but then so are they.

                 I don't really know.  I suppose anything is possible these days. I have donated over 4 gallons of blood in my lifetime and wanted to achieve my grandmother's lifetime donation of 10gal.  I just can no longer support them without knowing who really is receiving my blood; and, given their poor percentage of actual dollars going to those in need. There is a local blood bank in my area so I will check into them for future donations.

                 Case in point regarding RC spending: while watching the recent videos of President Trump passing out to go boxes of food at the shelter.
                 <strong>
                  <strong>
                   Red Cross
                  </strong>
                 </strong>
                 was prominently displayed on the top of the white to go boxes. I'm not sure those in need really cared who was providing the meal they needed. My thought was, how many donated dollars were wasted in printing and affixing those stickers so RC could be advertised.
                </p>

                 I believe in humility in doing acts of charity and long ago stopped donating to BIG charities. We can do more for each other as neighbors and towns and Texas shows that we do. Yes a disaster such as Harvey is going to require large organizational efforts; however, we witnessed everyday Americans come out in droves to help one another in a time of need. That is true charity, imho.

                  No worry, my mind wanders as well and sometimes that is when we make our most valuable statements.  YES, I believe that the charities are doing way too much advertising.  They are on TV all the time.  I have my thoughts about the ones begging for Vet money and for the Children's Hospitals.  I believe they are very suspect.  Yes, the most valuable help and aid we can give is to leave our homes and get out there and pitch in when our neighbors and those not so near need our help.  I believe that is what will solve the suspicious hatred and racism we have.  People of all ages, religions sexes and colors helping whomsoever needs it.  That is what will bring us together and that is what TPTB hate.
