<p>&quot;The Child Exchange- Reuters investigates- Americans use the Internet to abandon children adopted from overseas&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1">http://www.reuters.com/investigates/adoption/#article/part1</a></p>
<p>A few snippets-</p>
<p>&quot;The Puchallas had rescued Quita from an orphanage in Liberia, brought her to America and then signed her over to a couple they barely knew. Days later, they had no idea what had become of her.&quot;
...</p>
<p>&quot;Through Yahoo and Facebook groups, parents and others advertise the unwanted children and then pass them to strangers with little or no government scrutiny, sometimes illegally, a Reuters investigation has found. It is a largely lawless marketplace. Often, the children are treated as chattel, and the needs of parents are put ahead of the welfare of the orphans they brought to America.&quot;</p>
<p>...
&quot;Reuters analyzed 5,029 posts from a five-year period on one Internet message board, a Yahoo group. On average, a child was advertised for re-homing there once a week. Most of the children ranged in age from 6 to 14 and had been adopted from abroad – from countries such as Russia and China, Ethiopia and Ukraine. The youngest was 10 months old.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a multi part investigation Reuters did and I have only read part 1 so far and feel sick.</p>
<p>So it\'s bad enough that 800,000 kids are snatched yearly, and that you have sick fucks like Luzzato advertising &quot;raw and uncut&quot; live streaming of their infants, but people treat these orphans like a crappy gift they can regift off to someone else without fucking vetting?</p>
<p>And people wonder why Putin stopped allowing international adoptions from Russia.</p>
<p>I can bet there are tons of FB groups etc... run by pedos that gather up these kids like clothes at the Goodwill 49 cent days. They then in turn surely sell them to be abused by the very people we are investigating, after they are done with them or for a premium price.</p>
<p>Pizzagate related due to a source of kids for trafficking and abuse of kids.</p>',
