            Thanks. Needed this, but I'm getting mighty low. Even though I know things take time, damn, this is frustrating! Especially reading that the shill Feldman says, God told him to out the pedophiles! Really? Is he talking the GOD?!!!! I would think if the Almighty God told him that that he might name WHO THE HELL WAS REALLY RESPONSIBLE AND NOT A COUPLE OF NUTHING BURGERS!!!!

            Then there's Pelosi defending Conyers, and TIME magazine playing games with the POTUS ... probably.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fingers crossed and maybe we will have to wait until the official Christmas before indictments start raining down on the pervs!!!

            The LAPD doesn't handle these things. The FBI does.  There used to be some great FBI agents back in the day in LA.  I don't know if that's still the case but LAPD won't do shit. If they were it'd be going down right now.

            It would be great if the people of LA could somehow get together and demand/petition that the LAPD remove the pedophile logo off their badge. This would raise a lot of awareness about the true nature of this organisation.

            I'll believe it when I see it. Constant stream of revelations but little happening. Those in power are protected by the 'law'. The 'law' is only to stop poor folks from bothering the rich.

            What does this have to dow with pizzagate? Sex crimes investigations?  You guys keep acting like that has anything to do with the DC/CIA satanic child rape torture murder ring. It does not.

             I'm sorry to burst the  bubble you live in in this fantasy land you have created for yourself but I cannot let you dissuade and influence this audience with incorrect information.  This has EVERYTHING to do with pizzagate and always has.  I don't know if your lack of knowledge is a disinformational technique or simple ignorance but the weinstein /geffen circle and much of Hollywood is intimately connected to everything Hollywood does. Why do you think so many compromised dirt bags were able to stay there so long in those high ranking positions just like Congress?  These people who are doing all this abusing are doing it not only because it is a way of life and religion for them they are doing it so that it all observes a particular flow,  compromised at the top so information flow is controlled...  In that manner you can see all the subsequent modes of control underneath.  I shouldn't even be having to explain this.

              It's no stretch to understand that most of these people being taken down are part of a much larger scheme in promoting their own agenda through what they thought was going to be a win on the Clinton side based on such large donations by those involved.  Come on do you think we are stupid?

             It doesn't BUT I believe that the hope is these people will talk and rat out those who do have something to do with pizzagate--in other words, our elected representatives and perhaps even those who run the brownstone ops. If only the world would wake up and see that  YES INDEED--as ASolo states"The networks we have discovered that run like a virus through almost every one of our most trusted institutions, entertainment, government, education, science and religion"

            No pedos will be busted by LAPD they are part of the cover-up network. They get paid big bucks to cover it all up. They know who killed Ronni Chasen but they framed some idiot patsy from Mexico as the killer said he rode his bike into Beverly Hills and shot her for no reason. Yes more women will come forward and hire Gloria Allred to file lawsuits against agents and producers but no parents will demand prosecution for their kids nor will any other former child stars speak up like Corey Feldman did.

            Even if the Justice system is corrupt, and fails these children, at the very least there is more awareness. For good or bad, those who are named are humiliated, lose their spouses and career opportunities. In general, I don't think people accuse innocent people often.

             Like I said on a different thread, I got a letter from SAG -AFTRA advising all actors "too see something, say something."  Absolutely no other info was provided. If you knew how very difficult it was to get anything but a voicemail when the union is actually open, 9 - 5 weekdays, you would also see this as ineffective.

            Unless you expect this to lead to an overhaul of the entire Hollywood entertainment control system I don't see any reason for celebration.

            As a Jewish Harvard professor said, to eliminate racism we must eliminate racists (whites) -- you'll find pedophile blackmail networks any place or industry that has many Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            CRIME is a subculture that reflects the PEOPLES who do it e.g. headless corpse usually = Mexican cartel.  Jews are characterized throughout history CHIEFLY by their ability to rise to leadership in foreign organizations, through money and blackmail.
           </p>

            That's why Chinatown is considered the best screenplay of all time: it describes intergenerational pedophilic Jewish oligarchs' complete impunity in California, the crown jewel of their empire, richer than most countries but with higher poverty rates.
           </p>
           <p>
            Chinatowns Oscar winning screenplay was by Jew Robert Towne (originally Schwartz) whose actress daughter is among this public batch of victims of sexual harrassment, and she's both pizza related and a white hater:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            You're a cuck if it doesn't piss you off to see JEW HEADLINES about white male misogynist culture referring to JEW ENTERTAINERS who spread filth wherever they go by their own admission.

             I do not hesitate to avow that although the women of the United States are confined within the narrow circle of domestic life, and their situation is in some respects one of extreme dependence, I have nowhere seen woman occupying a loftier position; and if I were asked, now that I am drawing to the close of this work, in which I have spoken of so many important things done by the Americans,
             <strong>

            All I know is that anyone who gets trotted out and arrested will be more or less a media spectacle. It will be a way for the Pedo Mafia to sacrifice some of "their own" in order to save the more internal core members. This will be all controlled.

            I hope this is true, but will believe it when I see it.  Given LAPD's history of protecting Hollywood's elite, I doubt any heavy hitters will be brought forth.

             Can I recommend the original Disney movies? (Yes, I am aware Disney has been corrupted now, but think the OG Snow White, watched it last night for the first time in probably 20 years and I enjoyed it immensely!)

and in "The Devil's Disciple" re Allen Dulles/CIA it is revealed that
Dulles worked with Walt Disney, including giving advice/suggestions
on his movies.

              Yes, I wonder sometimes if those LEOs get free trips to their fun at Disney for offering their protection.  It makes me sick and I can't wait for Disney to be brought down.

             There is a different dynamic now. People didn’t want to hear about pedo stuff before...to sick and crazy. Now, more are awoke to the elite sickness, more and more every day, approaching a critical mass. Soon it will be at the torches and pitchfork stage. If a public official actually has the guts and the support backups to get out in front of this and start busting elites, they could really grab the brass ring. People wanna see a hero like that right now. That’s the game changer. All eyes are on any big names that can get free of their handlers and surf the wave of growing public outrage. The elite power structure has never had to face so many awakened, but now... the situation could change if we can get a sheriff with some guts.

              If there is such a Sheriff, he will realize he is putting his Life on the Line.  The news is coming out, but there are still powerful people in place.  Something big has to happen and fast.  They are hoping the Holidays will distract from what has come out and it will be forgotten.  If the speed of accusations keeps up I have faith that it will be possible to kill their business.  They are doing this because they are sick in the head and beyond evil, but the real reason is to make a huge amount of money.  Charlie Sheen has been on my radar for a while now.  He is really a sicko and I believe his father is too.  Don't think his brother is involved, but I could be wrong.  He kept the Estevez name to differentiate himself from the sickos, I believe. Set me straight someone, if I am wrong.

               Think about the fact that CIA targeted liberals in all walks of society --
via entertainment, music, political -- whatever.
              </p>
              <p>
               One of the ways of harming a liberal is to endanger, threaten and/or
do harm to their children.
              </p>
              <p>
               What we really have to think about is whether Hillary and Bill 
Clinton were in CIA programs as children.
              </p>
              <p>
               And whether or not children of liberal celebrities were in CIA
programs such as MKULTRA.

                I am sure there were and are many signs of some these people's children being victims of the CIA.  Would not be surprised that there was much turmoil in the Rodham home being that her Father and Brother both went to Penn State.  Being there, they must have crossed the paths of Sandusky and Paterno.  Her Father has been rumored to have connections to Al Capone as well. She was a Republican thus working for Nixon while starting out her Law Career.  Both Clintons have a sordid past.

                 carmencita -- Glad to see you reply because so many here just absolutely
resent any such thinking about the Clintons -- and I can understand that due
to the immense damage they have done to the nation ....
as they seem to see it as a plea for mercy for them or some way to absolve
them of guilt .... but rather I think the more we can unravel the history of 
CIA/MKULTRA the more understanding we will have of the length, width, depth
of these operations and who they effected.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's not out of sympathy ... it's to hope for more understanding of what actually happened
to people.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also it's rumored in both families -- Bill and Hillary -- that there were MAFIA connections.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And because Cathy O'Brien gave us such immense insights into how a good bit of the
Operations were handled ... where CIA was able to contact network of pedophile fathers,
evidently .... those children then had a good chance of being turned over to CIA ... and
the fathers were well rewarded.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Something that a girlfriend of Bill Clinton said about seeing Hillary at one time ...
as unkempt and in very bad shape, actually smelling ... made me begin to think
about this likelihood.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Right also ... Hillary, as I recall, was said to have been involved in one of the
Committees .... and didn't want to see Nixon impeached ...???
                </p>
                <p>
                 Think that's right ...
                </p>
                <p>
                 Hope you had a happy holiday, Carmencita... 
Peace seems so much more distant than ever before, however ....

              Exactly, anyone believing the LAPD about anything is being scammed. LAPD has been in bed with and protecting one of the largest pedophile operations in the U.S., Scientology. There's a reason why nothing ever happens to a clam in LA.

              I am sure there are some good cops there, but those above them are  the problem. Yes,  Usually it is the top people that have been infiltrated with protectors of the elite.

               Stop blaming those terrible "white heterosexual Christians" for things they did not do. In our last conversation you lamented the plight of the poor black slaves and the torment they suffered from us terrible white heterosexual Christians. When I pointed out that the black slave trade was run out of Newport and was a Jewish operation you called me racist and anti-semitic. Please say that you condemn the Jewish slave traders for black slavery in America. And please admit that holding white people in bondage as "indentured servants" up unto death is the same as slavery.

               <p>
                The date of the above letter was November 27,1773. We have not yet concluded, because of lack of space, the excerpts and grateful compilations made available by the “Carnegie Institute.”
               </p>
               <p>
                On November 29,1767, the Jew Abraham Pereira Mendez—who had been cheated by one of his kind— from Charleston, where he had journeyed to better control his Black cargo, wrote Aaron Lopez at Newport:
               </p>
               <p>
                “These Negroes, which Captain Abraham All delivered to me, were in such poor condition due to the poor transportation, that I was forced to sell 8 boys and girls for a mere 27 (pounds), 2 other for 45 (pounds) and two women each for 35 (pounds).” (No doubt, English money)
               </p>
               <p>
                Abraham Pereia Mendez was very angry and accused Aaron Lopez of “cheating” him. This letter delineates to us that this generous and fine citizen of Newport was insatiable in his greed for money. This is what caused the Rabbi Morris A. Gutstein to present this nobleman, Aaron Lopez, to pursue his objectionable methods. Negroes presented to him but a commodity.
               </p>
               <p>
                In all of the letters which the “Carnegie Institute” published, it stresses the lack of human sympathy for the poor Negro slaves. This lack of feeling and compassion for the
                <strong>
                 abused and pitiful Blacks at the hands of their Jewish dealers
                </strong>
                , can be read out of the diary of a captain who manned a ship owned by Aaron Lopez. The entrees concern a trip from the African Coast to Charleston. Moreover, they are authentic documents, published by the “Carnegie Institute” in Washington, D.C., calling attention to an organization which had heretofore known little or nothing about; neither had they encountered further publicity in books or newspapers.

                 Everything you say is an obvious attack on the principles of Jesus because he called you the Synagogue Of Satan and you hate him because he did not condone money changer slavery, not to mention what I just posted about your history of being slave traders. Admit that your Jewish Zionists are responsible for black slavery.

                  Jesus is a favorite of liberals because he was a liberal and humanist ... for liberty, freedom,
emancipation and against the very concept of capitalism and money-lenders.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So -- despite your continuing derangement, Jesus was a liberal.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Additionally, Jesus was a JEW, a RABBI ....
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Nothing is nuttier than Biblical myths than perhaps ... Revelations --
where I presume you're making clear that you're a Bible Thumper whacko.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Actually, if there was a Jesus he'd be telling you to "Get help."

                   <p>
                    However, who ever said that Zionists were anything but evil?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So is corruption of Israeli government which has buried the nation's liberal
desire for peace ... using violence of assassinations.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Netanyahu's right wing government is obviously responsible for at least
the assassination of Rabin.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And Genocide versus Palestinians/Gaza ...

                   <p>
                    So is AIPAC evil ....

                   <p>
                    but that in no way supports your obsessions with all JEWS as evil ...
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We have the same kind of fascist control of our own government by the right wing ...
and the right wing MIC.

                   As usual Jews pretending to be Christians. Why does the Pope wear a yarmulke/kippa? Because he is a Zionist acting like a Christian.

                      Women were obviously the spiritual leaders of societies at one time ...
these were female-centered societies based in an understanding of 
the responsibilities of females in bearing children and the confidence
placed in them by Nature.

                      Also for women's knowledge/plants -- which are our medicines/drugs -- those plants and that knowledge were often destroyed by patriarchy.  They are the model for our medicines today -- also related to CHOICE ... the power to control procreation.
That knowledge and those plants were destroyed by patriarchy in Witch Hunts -- i.e.,
the actual burning of women they labelled as "witches" at the stake.

                       The Zionist goal is to destroy all religions and especially obliterate the memory of Jesus because his teachings leave no room for Zionist slave masters. The Zionist intend a one world religion they can control hence the joke of "Judeo-Christianity" which is like oil and water. Jesuits and Zionists infiltrated Christianity and when we root you out we can live by Jesus's principles which will not leave room for you at the table.

                       Stop blaming those terrible "white heterosexual Christians" for things they did not do. In our last conversation you lamented the plight of the poor black slaves and the torment they suffered from us terrible white heterosexual Christians. When I pointed out that the black slave trade was run out of Newport and Charleston and was a Jewish operation you called me racist and anti-semitic. Please say that you condemn the Jewish slave traders for black slavery in America. And please admit that holding white people in bondage as "indentured servants" up unto death is the same as slavery.

                        The date of the above letter was November 27,1773. We have not yet concluded, because of lack of space, the excerpts and grateful compilations made available by the “Carnegie Institute.”

                       <p>
                        On November 29,1767, the Jew Abraham Pereira Mendez—who had been cheated by one of his kind— from Charleston, where he had journeyed to better control his Black cargo, wrote Aaron Lopez at Newport:
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        “These Negroes, which Captain Abraham All delivered to me, were in such poor condition due to the poor transportation, that I was forced to sell 8 boys and girls for a mere 27 (pounds), 2 other for 45 (pounds) and two women each for 35 (pounds).” (No doubt, English money)
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Abraham Pereia Mendez was very angry and accused Aaron Lopez of “cheating” him. This letter delineates to us that this generous and fine citizen of Newport was insatiable in his greed for money. This is what caused the Rabbi Morris A. Gutstein to present this nobleman, Aaron Lopez, to pursue his objectionable methods. Negroes presented to him but a commodity.

                       <p>
                        In all of the letters which the “Carnegie Institute” published, it stresses the lack of human sympathy for the poor Negro slaves. This lack of feeling and compassion for the

                         abused and pitiful Blacks at the hands of their Jewish dealers

                        , can be read out of the diary of a captain who manned a ship owned by Aaron Lopez. The entrees concern a trip from the African Coast to Charleston. Moreover, they are authentic documents, published by the “Carnegie Institute” in Washington, D.C., calling attention to an organization which had heretofore known little or nothing about; neither had they encountered further publicity in books or newspapers.

                        We have talked about the small ship “Abigail” which could accommodate only 56 people and yet the profits per trip were enormous, with little or no investment. There were many other ships but we will concentrate here on only a few, such as the “La Fortuna,” “Hannah,” “Sally” or the “Venue” which made very great profits. The “La Fortuna,” by the way, transported approximately 217 slaves on each trip. The owner cleared not less than $41,438.00 from such a trip. These were dollars which the slave dealers ‘could keep’. And these were dollars of value which would buy a great deal in return.

                        Many people were involved in the Slave trade --
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        But do you really imagine that Our Founders saved and supported the system of Slavery
for JEWS???????????????????
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Or that they began the Civil War to save the Slave trade for JEWS ... ??????????????????
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Or that they made sure that Segregation in the South was carried on for another 100 years after
Emancipation ... because Our Founders did it for the JEWS ..?????????????????????
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        . . .

                       <p>
                        Jesus stood again the Old Testament's effort to create a patriarchy ... 
in that sense he was a feminist or an egalitarian standing against male gender bias.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And, again, Jesus was a Rabbi and it would have been highly unlikely as in NEVER
if he had not been married.  Likely Mary Magdalene and Jesus were married and 
had children.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Mary, by all reports and complaints of the 12 Apostles -- was Jesus' "Disciple to the Disciples."
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And, yes, Jesus stood against the "Money-changers' ... that is he stood against
the concept of INTEREST payments and what capitalism stands for today.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Jesus recognized that Capitalism is an evil ... just as most of us recognize that today.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Additionally ...
                       </p>
                       <blockquote>
                        <p>
                         Because it has been almost unreported in the Western media that the US government  AIPAC ZIONISTS shipped, and continues to ship, millions of Islamist textbooks into Afghanistan. &gt;
                        </p>

                       <p>
                        If you want to suggest that Zionists are working with and affiliated with the CIA ... OK with me.
If you want to say that US government is under influence of AIPAC -- including Hillary, etal -- 
OK with me ....

                       <p>
                        but that has nothing to do with what the people of Israel may want -- those who
have long been denied the peace they seek because they've been living under right wing
governments like Netanyahu's.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Again, there were many people engaged in bringing Slaves to the US ...
it was a business which Our Founders kept going ....
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And it was under Papal Edicts which demanded the "enslavement of or killing of" ...
Africans here and Native people here that the "Inquisition/Crusade" type violence
was carried out here.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Columbus ... again ... saw it as his highest duty to spread CHRISTIANITY on this land.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        That is, AFTER stealing the land and murdering the native people here -- 112 million of them.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        NOR  was any of that murderous activity against Slaves nor against Native people here ever
stopped by Our Founders.

                         Most of that is so much BS I won't bother with it. Pure capitalism is what we need back in this country. Marxist Zionist Communist killed capitalism and replaced it with corporatism which is not capitalism. We need mom and pop businesses. Bob's hardware on the corner, etc...That is called capitalism and Zionist killed it dead as a doornail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Do you know why Zionists have trained you to speak ill of capitalism? Its because as Rockefeller said "competition is a sin." They want their coproratism to completely swallow what is left of Capitalism. For good.

                         Israel is a colony of Great Britain like so many others and is ultimately controlled by the largest financial power house in the world which is London. Israel is under the yoke of the international banking system like everybody else. They just happened to have sent some of the nastiest racist on the planet to inhabit it and kill the Palestenians who are the true semites. These Ashkenazis are not semites.

                         Columbus was what is known as a Marrano Jew of Italian/Greek descent or what a lot of people call a crypto jew. He fled from country to country everytime he caused so much trouble he had to run. He converted from being a jew, to a christian, and then back to a jew. Whatever suited his sorry ass at the time. He was not a Christian but only acted like one for convenience. He was scum and his "discovery" of the "New World" that was not "new" was funded by jewish bankers in London.

                          Capitalism is pure evil --
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Capitalism is a system invented by Christianity intended to move the wealth and natural resources of nations from the many to the few.
                          <br/>
                          And Capitalist/Elites have succeeded in doing that all over the world.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          And you're correct about small businesses ... but it is corporations which own both of our national parties and our government.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          And capitalism dictates that everything be judged by the yardstick of a dollar bill.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Our Founders actually created an Elite patriarchy, endowed them with land grants, gave them immense influence and control over our people's government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.
                          <br/>
                          That was the FIRST re-distribution of the commonwealth to Elites.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Capitalism isn't about competition ... it's about killing the competition.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Citizens create economies which are then manipulated by Banks and Financial Institutions for the benefit of Elites.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          If you're talking about the Federal Reserve Bank ... yes, it should be overturned.

                        IMO -- and someone else should really look at this video and what
PM Aloni was saying at that time ... as it seems to me she is saying
THEY use "anti-Semitism" as a trick to curb dissent.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And it was true probably at that time that when anyone criticized Israel's 
policies in regard to Palestinians that they were called "anti-Semitic."
It is an old tactic.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        <strong>
                         But here's her history ...
                        </strong>
                       </p>
                       <blockquote>
                        <p>
                         Throughout the 1970s
                         <strong>
                          Aloni attempted to create a dialogue with Palestinians in hopes of achieving a lasting peace settlement.
                         </strong>
                         During the 1982 Lebanon War she established the International Center for Peace in the Middle East. In the run-up to the 1984 elections, Ratz aligned with Peace Now and the Left Camp of Israel to increase its size in the Knesset to five seats. In 1992, she led Ratz into an alliance with Shinui and Mapam to form the new Meretz party, which won 12 seats under her leadership in the elections that year.
                         <strong>
                          Aloni became Minister of Education under Yitzhak Rabin but was forced to resign after a year due to her outspoken statements on matters of religion. As Education Minister, she also criticized organized tours by Israeli high school pupils to Holocaust concentration camps on grounds that such visits were turning Israeli youth into aggressive, nationalistic xenophobes, claiming that students "march with unfurled flags, as if they've come to conquer Poland".[5] She was reappointed Minister of Communications and Science and Culture and served until 1996 when she retired from party politics.

                         Political activism[edit]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Aloni was a board member of Yesh Din, an organisation
                         <strong>
                          focusing on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories
                         </strong>
                         <strong>
                          She defended U.S. President Jimmy Carter's use of the word "apartheid" in the title of his book

                         , Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid.[6] 
Later, Aloni said, "I hate to cover up things that should be open to the sun."

                        It seems to me that Aloni was referring to the right wingers in Israel ... like Netanyahu
who practice Genocide vs the Palestinians/Gaza.
That's who she means when she says "we" ... and that it's "used as a trick."
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        If you hung in long enough on the video you would also hear her say ...in imitation
of the right wing in Israel ... "My country right or wrong" .... and she repeats further
that the "trick" is used to "justify everything done to Palestinians."
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        And used to criticize dissent in the US of Israel government policies re Palestinians.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Aloni was AGAINST the genocidal policies of the Israel government towards Palestinians.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Aloni supported Rabin and his policies for peace ... which was why he was assassinated 
and the hope of Israel citizens for peace were also buried by that assassination/
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I can see the conflict in regard to her understanding that the high school trips to Holocaust
concentration camps were creating aggressive nationalist xenophobia in those students ...
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        While it is necessary, of course, for the studies to have a full and true understanding of what
happened in the Germany Holocaust, they still must keep open the possibilities of peace and 
diplomacy.  Xenophobia is hatred of people you don't even know -- while in reality it isn't 
citizens of other nations who set these policies ... Hitler/Nazis were imposed on Germany by 
Elites in the US and Internationally.  Once the trap was set and fascism was in place, it would
have only been on pain of imprisonment or death to criticize Hitler's government or to try to 
defend any Jewish person against the murderous policies of Hitler/Nazis.

                          You have a tendency to confuse people with their governments and leaders ....
No one wants war, no one wants poverty -- nor does anyone want to live in
peace while others are homeless, hungry ...

                          White slavery, bondage -- even citizen enslavement to debt as Banks are 
doing to Puerto Rico right now and to citizens all over the world -- is wrong -- 
and they will eventually do the same to us here.
                          <br/>
                          Our criminal and corrupt Congress continues to enslave us further to debt
for wars, for tax cuts for the rich.
If you have the money for war ... you have money to help the sick.

                         <p>
                          and also make clear distinctions between identifying love of country, yet understanding
that we are all on this planet with many other human beings and that xenophobia is hatred
and prejudice against people you don't know.

                          Oddly enough, there is strong suspicion that Hitler didn't quite measure up to
the demands of his all "Aryan" society  -- nor many of those who higher up's 
in the Germany military -- like Goebbels, etal.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          HOWEVER, Hitler made clear that he was imitating the Catholic Church and
their persecution of Jews over more than 1,000 years.

                          I'll just bring to your attention that your final response below makes no sense 
in regard to the comment I made which points to the parallels between our
                          <br/>
                          own nation right now and early days of Hitler/Nazis .... as we approach full 
blown fascism here.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Once the trap was set and fascism was in place, it would have only been on pain of imprisonment or death to criticize Hitler's government or to try to defend any Jewish person against the murderous policies of Hitler/Nazis.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Germany tried to get rid of the plague of Marxism and your best scholars agree on that.

                           These people have names and should be held responsible for their actions, arrested for treason for both promoting and allowing a system of blackmail by pedophilia not only to exist but to flourish. I say lets start with these since they run the show. The reason nobody can arrest them is because of those stars and they adopted those themselves.

                           As it did every country involved because Rothschild loaned them all money, along with Brown Brothers Harriman. So all countries were in debt to the same Jews/Nazis. No difference in a Rothschild and a Harriman except the labels they hide under.

                           That statement looks like it was made by a third grader. Capitalism, free enterprise, keeps money not only in the country but all the way down to individual neighborhoods because mom and pop stores can operate. CORPORATISM which is what we have now is the problem.
