<p>&quot; Archbishop Viganò adds: “As far as the Roman Curia is concerned, for the moment I will stop here, even if the names of other prelates in the Vatican are well known, even some very close to Pope Francis, such as Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio and Archbishop Vincenzo PAGLIA, who belong to the homosexual current in favor of subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality, a current already denounced in 1986 by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then-Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in the Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons. Cardinals Edwin Frederick O’Brien and Renato Raffaele Martino also belong to the same current, albeit with a different ideology.” &quot;  Archbishop Viganò’s Terrible Testimony on Cardinal McCarrick and His Collaborators  <a href="https://fsspx.news/en/news-events/news/archbishop-viganò">https://fsspx.news/en/news-events/news/archbishop-viganò</a>’s-terrible-testimony-cardinal-mccarrick-and-his-collaborators</p>',

            VACCINE DEMON Senator Pan gets his forced vaccine bill out of committee in California:

            "Opponents call it a ‘crime against humanity,’ but vaccine bill moves forward"

            "A contentious bill to tighten California’s school immunization law passed its first hurdle in the Legislature on Wednesday, after hundreds of parents lined the corridors of the state Capitol, alternately pleading and demanding that lawmakers reject it.
The emotional testimony on the bill comes as a measles outbreak has put public health officials on high alert. More than 100 doctors and medical students spoke in favor of Senate Bill 276, which would empower the state health department to vet medical exemptions sought by physicians.
Sen. Richard Pan, a Sacramento physician and Democrat, introduced the legislation, which passed 6 to 2 on Wednesday in the Senate Health Committee. The Capitol hallways were hot and humid amid the mass turnout of mostly opponents, many of whom said their children were injured by vaccines.
One opponent called Pan a “tyrant,” another labeled his bill a “crime against humanity,” while a third urged the senator to abandon the proposal to “save your soul.” "

             "Winnipeg café owners staged anti-Semitic attack, police say"
            </p>
            <p>
             "What looked like an anti-Semitic attack at a Winnipeg café that drew public concern and political condemnation was not a hate crime but an alleged sham staged by owners of the business, police said Wednesday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Officers responded last Thursday to a report that a woman who worked at the BerMax Caffé and Bistro was assaulted and that the business was vandalized and spray-painted with hate-related graffiti. It was the night before Passover."

            A Washington-based conservative think tank has released a study that untangles the knot of secrecy behind the funding of some pro-abortion groups. The Capital Research Center's "Big Money in Dark Shadows: Arabella Advisors' Half-billion-dollar 'Dark Money' Network" tracks the significant sums of money collected from donors specifically for allocation to leftist causes, including several initiatives aimed at lifting legal barriers to publicly funded abortions.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The line between philanthropy and political advocacy at Arabella is blurry indeed," reads the report's executive summary, referring to the Arabella's stated mission of "philanthropy and impact investing."
           </p>
           <p>
            Described by Hayden R. Ludwig, the report's author, as a "left-wing leviathan in Washington, D.C.," the for-profit Arabella Advisors, LLC channeled an estimated $600 million into four nonprofit funds created by Arabella, including the New Venture Fund and "dozens of 'pop-up' groups and 'astroturf' initiatives."
           </p>
           <p>
            One so-called "pop-up group" in the New Venture Fund network is All Above All, a nonprofit group established in 2017 with the express purpose "to build support for lifting bans that deny abortion coverage. Our vision is to restore public insurance coverage so that every woman, however much she makes, can get affordable, safe abortion care when she needs it."
           </p>

            They are on the march and the push is on.  They need those fetuses to sell the vaccines that will poison Our Children.

              I agree.  I feel your anger and pain.  You know how I feel about vaccines.  But this now goes beyond the pale.  Down and outright murder imo. These people will have blood on their hands for they know why they need those fetuses. Lambs of God.

            The eventual tone of the later emails is one of complicity between PPAC and DMHC to force religious groups and churches into violating their deeply held religious convictions. According to ADF:
           </p>
           <p>
            Planned Parenthood asked agency officials to "fix" the "issue" of religious organizations receiving exemptions from the abortion mandate. Planned Parenthood also threatened to promote a legislative "solution" if the administrative agency didn't act. The abortion giant demanded that the DMHC:
           </p>
           <p>
            Refuse to approve any further exemptions. 
Rescind the approval of healthcare plans that offer an exemption to the elective abortion mandate.
"Find a solution to fix the already approved plans" that offer exemptions for religious organizations.

            This is really bad. Now lawmakers, schools and "public health" bureacrates will be able to
            <em>
             force
            </em>
            Catholic parents to inject aborted fetal DNA into their kids. They will no longer be able to claim a moral exemption.

             With faith in God, there is always a way out. God called His Son out of Egypt. JESUS ESCAPED BEING THE PRODUCT OF A LIVE BIRTH ABORTION. God is still in control. He is now allowing the Church to be persecuted to purify her. Even the satanist/atheist Dr. Stanley Plotkin saw the hypocrisy in the Catholic Church's stand. Because of it, the abortionist FELT MORALLY SUPERIOR..

              Wonder why all the pro life people have little interest in babies and children after they are born? But not with all the money spent on so called defense industry? Or education of teen agers as to how easy it is to get pregnant? Vatican is really into lots of babies and ignorance.......it fits their agenda....

              6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
             </p>
             <p>
              7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

              8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
             </p>
             <p>
              9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
             </p>
             <p>
              11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

             Agreed. However, we must fight this with all legal and moral means available to us. At this point, the only way to win is in court or by a massive revolt by citizens.
