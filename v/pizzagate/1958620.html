            4chan is still better than anywhere else, including Voat and this subverse.  Not sure if those bagging out 4chan in this thread are shills.  The recent EWO threads are still available to view on 4plebs.

            you guys gotta be shitting me. the whole idea that pizzagate was even on 4chan other than to laugh at it and post pics of the kids was 4chan being compromised. hate to break it to you, but 4chan was the bad guys. anonymous wasn't about truth and justice, it was about lolz and cheeze pizza.

            Of course it’s compromised. It was compromised when Cuck A Duck (moot) got cucked. It was compromised when he sold it to the fucking jewish shill or whoever runs it now. It has been compromised in FULL since at LEAST 2014. That’s why the surge to 8chan happened. Then Hotwheels got killed and fed to pigs and now the faggot Jim has destroyed 8chan and populated it with paid shill moderators.
           </p>
           <p>
            Voat, shockingly enough, is actually more of a bastion of free speech than EITHER of the two major English imageboards. That’s how terrifying this situation has become.

            Okay for people who are not too familiar with 4chan, it was fucked even when moot was in charge. moot had a deal with the Feds that said that if they requested info about a 4chan user, he'd give it over without question. This was during the Scientology raids. Recently, moot has sold the company to some gook who is running it into the ground, and probably is even more compliant with law enforcement than moot was. I believe moot was threatened into it, whereas this new guy just willingly gives up user info. And he hires mods who delete threads like crazy. /b/ used to be the most moderated board, but now you're seeing it on /pol/ as well.
           </p>
           <p>

Fuck gook-moot.

             this is my take on some of it here and elsewhere (not 4chan tho, thanks for the background) - it was a response to a question about why aren't mods here replaced etc
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              There is absolutely no transparency so your questions can't really be answered definitively. That is in part because whatever is told to us by our "handlers" (mods) is often contradicted by others at the same level, and is generally a tissue of lies anyway.
             </p>
             <p>
              Think about it - have you ever heard of a tech wiz entrepreneur who can code and build a forum website, who wants to supposedly take on Reddit, but can't maintain a simple search engine? And doesn't even have one contact in his milleau who can? of course not. The humble search bar is on the most basic of websites, and every complicated website as well. It is like saying you can build a skyscraper but don't know how to screw in any light bulbs, it is that simple. It is all a lie starting from the top down. What's the motive? To gather the information while crippling the access - to maim and humiliate the effort without totally killing it because it is the best easy source of finding out where the bugs and loose ends are in your system. We act like street informants here, bringing all of our interesting finds directly to those who believe they are the social controllers - much higher than mods. We get the small payoff of talking to a few like minded souls, and of hope that incremental awareness spreads. We get a small social payoff in "points" whoopee. For me, I like dosing them with their own medicine, putting my message into their essentially frail systems.
             </p>
             <p>
              The handler mods are on a need to know basis, which means they don't know much of anything, except they are conditioned to view us as silly scum conspiracy nuts they are superior to by one caste, and get some experience in their field and maybe some lifeline $ or payoff thrown at them if they keep it quiet - especialy from one another. As it is down here an atmosphere of fear and distrust, so it is above among the peon mods who are themselves handled- they mostly don't trust each other and will be careful about comparing notes. Some of the naive ones get pumped with fake free speech ideology which motivates and blinds them for a bit, while a caste or two above their heads their .com cult leader and the rest of Silicon Valley is having dirty butt sex on the down-low regularly with the big eye spy government on a bed of knives and money.
             </p>
             <p>
              Your question suggests you still think this place operates fairly or even normally somewhere above you because it is supposed to be for a good purpose. Stop giving your trust away for free srayzie, it is valuable and should be protected like a mother.

            Definitely agree that 8chan is the place to go for better content and more reliable, non-shill anonymous stuff.

             Do you remember the Infinity debacle? For MONTHS on end, the simple act of posting was an absolute nightmare. It was perhaps the most frustrating Internet experience since the early ‘90s. But not only did people push through it, the population GREW. That summer was the summer of chimpouts and tensions (of all kinds) were coming to the head that finally burst with Trump’s announcement that he was running for president. Not even Infinity could destroy people’s interest in the site, simply because of what 8chan stood for.

             But ever since imkampfy took over, the population has declined massively and the new website owner is complicit. Subversion

             , goyim. That’s why you can’t out them diplomatically. You have to use guns.

            Those behind both 4chan.org, and 8chan.net are fishy. Way more evidence out there, but both seem to be honeypots.

            Please understand how imageboards like 4chan work before posting nonsense like this.
            <em>
             All
            </em>
            threads get deleted off 4chan sooner or later. If a thread has no activity for a certain period of time it will get deleted. That's why you'll see anons commenting 'bump' in some threads - they're bumping up the activity rate. It's why board 'slides' work - shills flood the board with artificially popular posts so that other ones get deleted. The old rules (not sure if they're still active) used to automatically delete threads after a certain number of pages of replies were reached.
           </p>
           <p>
            You've linked to a
            <em>
             community run
            </em>
            archiving service that isn't owned or run by 4chan. 4plebs aims to preserve important 4chan posts including the EWO ones. Yes, they were deleted off 4chan. No this isn't something sinister.

              Yes there is actual censorship and yes it's compromised to a certain extent. But linking to the 4plebs archive of EWO threads that have been normally pruned isn't any kind of proof. There needs to be specific evidence that PG threads have been deleted by the mods.
