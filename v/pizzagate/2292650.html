            Wow.. I didn't know this site was for " Concervative  Americans " only ? I thought it was a site for all to come together and find out the TRUTH no matter where it may lead .. I'm not saying that I believe all that has been said about the POTUS  but is he really a Freemason ? Also why wouldn't we believe his xwifes story on how he raped her ?

             Either that or he was born with a genetic condition that causes him to use 3 Masonic hand signals a minute. I have never seen a politician, at least that I can remember, that can throw as many masonic hands signs as Trump can in a speech as fluidly as he does it.

            Henry wears glasses that have a Star of David on one lens and a Compass/Square on the other. Everything in the world looks like a Jewish Masonic conspiracy to him.
Yes Trump is a Freemason and all his kids married into the Jewish tribe. But it appears there is a civil war within both camps and Trump's side is striking back against the dark side. I think he has been trolling the pedos and positioning himself as this amoral playboy but is nothing of the sort.
In fact I think the whole Grab 'Em episode was a test of Billy to see how he would react - he failed. Further the while black book story is unverifiable but may be evidence that Epstein was also running a blackmail ring for someone. This may explain why he was given a slap on the wrist and the current Labor Secretary was the one who let E plead down to a fraction of the charges he faced.

            I would suspect that any man who is playing up in the big league with the big boys,  who is not able to be blackmailed with pedophilia, has a nine pound hammer in his pocket that he can swing at any time against people that can be pedo blackmailed.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The guy with nine pound hammer could be a lot more blunt and direct toward his opponents that are able to be pedo blackmailed. He could do outrageous things like drag a previous rape victim of Clinton's to a public debate. Trump did that.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Trump also quipped that "Hillary had taken a couple of villages" at a dinner speech.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Trump pulls no punches like no other politician I ever saw. Those things he did publicly toward the Clinton's were probably threats. If they want to try to out Trump on some dirty business deals, mafia ties, and lord knows Trump has a closet full of those, they always know that if they start a dirt smear war that Trump can pull out the nine pound pedo hammer and pound away.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            That is a lot of leverage. It also keeps people from outing the dirt he does have like mafia ties and shady business deals. If Trump cannot be blackmailed with pedophilia I don't think they can beat in a dirt smear war.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Trump had a modeling agency and there were a lot of teen girls around. Rumors abound that there was trafficking going on. Even if that is true, and nobody has pictures of Trump to prove it, he is still more powerful than they are, unless some witnesses came forward and testified that Trump had a trafficking operation.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Blackmail power is currency in their world. It is as valuable as gold because with blackmail power you can get tons of gold by forcing people to do your bidding. Blackmail is a highly sought after commodity and it sometimes trades like currency. Blackmail power is traded, bought, and sold, in the form of information, pictures, and video.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            This is one of the reasons the pedo blackmail rings are so hard to tear down. Nobody in D.C. really wants the system to end. Those that can be blackmailed do not want to end because they would be in jail as it falls.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Those that can get enough information to bust up the ring and take it down do not want the system to end either. They would rather use the blackmail information as currency. Those that they can blackmail are their slaves. The man with info is a king. He does not want to squander his blackmail wealth by busting up the rings.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            There is no incentive to destroy the pedophilia rings. In my opinion the only thing that will destroy the rings is overwhelming pressure from the public. If it ever gets to that point both sides, Dems and Republicans, would both want to false flag us to prevent it.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I predict that we are getting ready to get hit with the D.C. Ass Grab Distraction in a MASSIVE way. Sexual impropriety allegations like a Ass Grab Blizzard to drown out the pedophilia subject. Also to get rid of some of Trump's political enemies.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Trump has an ego like a 300 pound Gorilla. His ego is whacking the hell out of Hollywood, News Media, political opponents at a blistering pace right now and I expect more of it.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            CNN and Wapo are preparing ammunition for return fire. They are working on between 20 and 40 stories to fire back at the Republicans.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The next few months will reveal a lot. If it does not dip down into pedophilia it is only a a political enemy whack fest and a distraction. If it starts to dip into pedophilia all hell may break loose. I think both sides want to stay away from pedophilia.

            He was there and according to the testimony given by house staff, he took one look around then made a beeline to the kitchen where he sat with house staff until his plane arrived. We need to wait and see what connection Lisa Bloom has with this "Katie Johnson" has had her house paid off or whether she was "compensated" by one of Bloom's "Wealthy Donors"

             Hey, I voted for Trump but you can't be blinded by partisanship:
            </p>
            <p>
             1.Trump himself has said that Epstein is “a lot of fun to be with,” adding that he admired the sex offender's affinity for beautiful women “on the younger side.”
            </p>
            <p>
             "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump once said about the convicted sex offender. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               Trump was named in Epstein’s “little black book.” 
Epstein’s “little black book” was stolen by a former employee in 2004. The book, nicknamed "The Holy Grail" by the employee, revealed the name of Donald Trump and listed “14 phone numbers including emergency numbers, car numbers, and numbers to Trump's security guard and houseman.”
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Trump has allegedly flown on Epstein’s private plane — a hot spot for under-age sex orgies. 
“Mark Epstein, Jeffrey's brother, testified in 2009 that Trump flew on Jeffrey's private jet at least once,” reports VICE News. “Meanwhile, message pads [see below] from Epstein's Palm Beach mansion that were seized by investigators and obtained by VICE News indicate that Trump called Epstein twice in November of 2004.”
              </p>
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             Epstein’s private Boeing 727, according to one of his alleged victims, Virginia Roberts, was nicknamed the “Lolita Express.” Roberts recalled “unsavoury” sex orgies on the private plane when she was just 15 years of age with Epstein and his friends.
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              <p>
               Both Trump and Epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an under-aged girl.
Radar Online reports that a woman in California, “identified” as Katie Johnson, filed a $100 million lawsuit against Trump on April 26, accusing the real estate mogul of raping her when she was just 13 years old.
Johnson “claims Trump raped her when she was 13-years-old and forced her to engage in sex acts by threatening to harm her and her family,” notes The Independent UK. “She claims the alleged abuse took place over a four-month period at underage sex parties held in New York City in 1994.” Epstein was also named for alleged sexual misconduct and threats.
Trump’s team adamantly denies the accusation, suspecting the claim is possibly a hoax since there is allegedly “no evidence” the plaintiff “actually exists.”
              </p>
             </li>
             <li>
              <p>
               Epstein admitted to knowing Trump under oath, and curiously pled the fifth to Trump attending sex parties with underage girls.
Back in 2010, Epstein admitted to “socializing” with Trump, but when a lawyer representing an under-aged victim of Epstein’s asked if he has “ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18,” Epstein curiously pled the Fifth.

              I got no dog in this, am the dog, but one interesting element not mentioned much is trump eating with the help, the butler, at epstein dinner parties.  This has been spun both ways, so not sure what to think.

              You conveniently forgot that Trump went way out of his way in the press to point out the Epstein, "Likes them very young." Add to this that Trump was invited to Epstein's island, was flown out there, and within 6 hours had his private plane pick him up, despite the fact he was meant to stay for 3 days. His public comments about the young directly followed this trip.

              I am so sick of hearing the "Trump said that Epstein was a lot of fun to be with" narrative. And liked young beautiful women. What heterosexual male doesn't like younger beautiful women?!?!? "Younger" does
              <strong>
               not
              </strong>
              mean under 18.

             <p>
             </p>
             <p>
              My guess? Trump knew Epstein's criminal &amp; immoral actions would catch up to him someday, and went about his merry business only knowing him as a "fun guy". Epstein probably pleaded the fifth because he didn't want to admit that he did not socialize with Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18.

               [Clinton’s presence aboard Jeffrey Epstein’s Boeing 727 on 11 occasions has been reported, but flight logs show the number is more than double that, and trips between 2001 and 2003 included extended junkets around the world with Epstein and fellow passengers identified on manifests by their initials or first names, including “Tatiana.” The tricked-out jet earned its Nabakov-inspired nickname because it was reportedly outfitted with a bed where passengers had group sex with young girls.

               “Bill Clinton … associated with a man like Jeffrey Epstein, who everyone in New York, certainly within his inner circles, knew was a pedophile,” said Conchita Sarnoff, of the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking, and author of a book on the Epstein case called "TrafficKing." “Why would a former president associate with a man like that?”]

                Now that you got the critiques, any chance of another post? Personally amazed it's not possible to talk about T on this one. I've seen every topic down to the truly nuthing burger x10 searching faces in french fry type stuff, as well as a lot of quality,  but T, his relationship with Cohn, Casablancas, him being practically a Gambino crime familty member with his associations as a developer, that is son in law owns, and overpaid astronomically for 666 5th ave, which I believe is still home to Lucis Trust. I mean, even with the recent Jerusalem news, he's somehow antizionist.
