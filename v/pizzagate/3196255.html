<p>As I\'d just posted about the Middletons and British Airways and the pedo ring, I thought I\'d go back and look at the Santa Fe Relocation company which is owned by one of the Christ Church school trustees ... to summarise from previous posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the pedo British Airways pilot Simon Wood had his company address just 2 minutes away from one of the relocation and moving companies of Christ Church school trustee Paul Evans (See: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3159829">Moving company Momentous Relocation of the Hampstead case changed its name from Baxter International after a court case with the Ministry of Defence. Some coincidences..</a> )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul Evans has another relocation company called Santa Fe Relocation (See:  <a href="https://voat.co/v/PizzagateAcademics/2396301">Hampstead investigators: anyone checked out Santa Fe Relocations Services, London? They work with Homeland Security, witness protection, visas. relevance in the description</a> )</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As Momentous relocation had taken over contracts from Baxters International in <strong>2014</strong>, I thought I\'d see if there was any British Airways involvement with any of these companies:</p>
<p>Googling &quot;Baxters International&quot; and British Airways brought up a new company which was started in <strong>2015</strong> in Singapore <a href="http://baxters-international.com/posts/">http://baxters-international.com/posts/</a>  Was the name just a coincidence?</p>
<blockquote>

             I write in the aftermath glow of the Official Opening of Lawson High School on 2nd August by Rt. Hon. Jeremy Hunt, Secretary of State UK, in the presence of the British High Commissioner, H.E. Rob Macaire, Members of our Kenyan Board of Directors and the Bishop of Kitui's representative....
            </p>
            <p>
             ..Some days previously, Alison Stedman COGRI Nyumbani (Scotland) Trust presented me with a cheque of GBP 12,000, a donation for Lawson High School Library and computer laboratory which had been facilitated by a matching grant through Rotary Karen. Alison, her companion Trustee, Frances and group then came up to the Village to view what their donation had realized. They also presented each pupil in Class 7 in Hot-courses Primary with a personal dictionary, a gift also given to standard 7 in Nyumbani Home. This will become an annual event.

             Lea Toto had their special event on 26th July when a Government delegation from Viet Nam led by the Deputy Prime Minister, H.E. T. Vinh Trong, visited our Kibera Centre to see how we operate a NGO HIV community-based service...
            </p>
            <p>
             The special moment recently for the Nyumbani Home children was a visit from USA Congressmen Donald Payne and
             <strong>
              Keith Ellison
             </strong>
             together with staff, including our USA Board Member, Karen Robb. The highlights of the visit for our guests were meeting the children en famille and the Lea Toto children in the Respite Centre. For our children, hearing Donald Payne sing one of the songs they had just sung and listening to Keith Ellison tell the story of Jesus multiplying the loaves and fishes with the unique moral 'There is enough for all' caught their amazed attention.

              Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading George McGovern's effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office.

             <p>
              Chester was born in 1976, John podesta's political career started in 1972, '76 was an election year and his wiki states that he worked on George McGovern's unsuccessful campaign, so he likely would have been campaigning around the US the prior year. We know how these politicians are, it's not improbable that he may have had a tryst with Chester's mother, she may have been a McGovern supporter.

            Wow they really run a tight ship.  All the Governance is run by Annenbergs!
           </p>
           <p>
            From its founding in 1989 through 2002, the Annenberg Foundation was led by the late Ambassador Walter H. Annenberg. The Honorable Leonore Annenberg served as Chairman of the Board from 2002 until her passing in 2009. Today, the Foundation is governed by a Board of Directors comprised exclusively of Annenberg family members. The Board of Directors consists of  Wallis Annenberg, Chairman, President &amp; CEO, and three of her adult children: Lauren Bon, Gregory Annenberg Weingarten and Charles Annenberg Weingarten – all of whom serve as Co-Directors and Vice Presidents.
