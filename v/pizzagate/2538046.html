<p>&quot;Under cross examination, prosecutors asked multiple questions about Bowen\'s trips out of town with young men... The questioning of his father continued despite two objections from defense...The older Bowen testified under questioning his son\'s trips never included women and that he could not remember a single time another adult joined him on the trips.</p>
<p>Bowen had worked as a youth minister nearly a decade ago at the CrossPoint Community Church before it closed. There he worked closely with students from Coosa Christian School where he also graduated. In an exclusive interview with ABC 33/40 News, Bowen said his son spent much of his adult life mentoring young children.</p>
<p>&quot;Parents encourage their children to be in Acton\'s presence and Acton\'s guidance and Acton\'s ministry because Acton has a passion for what he does and it\'s a God-given gift.&quot;</p>
<p>Prosecutors on Tuesday asked Bowen if he was aware his son had left CrossPoint due to allegations regarding pornography. He said he was unaware of the claims. &quot;</p>
