            . Great idea! If you put a megathread together that clearly states how Paddock might be directly related to Pizzagate, I will sticky it. It's got to not have an inflammatory click-bait title, though. Has to be a serious research post with links supporting every claim. Would gladly sticky that!

            Paddock worked at Morton-Thiokol from 1985 to 1988 as an auditor. Prior to that, he had been both a letter carrier and later an IRS agent. The Postal Service and the IRS are where very many CIA operatives are recruited from - State is so well-known a cover story its practically a joke, but the Postal Service &amp; IRS produce great recruits because of their highly compartmentalized and secret routines and work culture. So as a former employee of both, Paddock would've been in demand. Employees of the Postal Service &amp; IRS who discuss even the most trivial &amp; abstract personal information of others can be put in federal prison for a decade. So they're natural fits at the CIA; in fact, CIA operatives moving towards a cushy retirement are often made postmasters of slow, scenic rural post offices. Second point: notice how far the media seems to go to avoid mentioning his former employer by name. One could be forgiven for thinking they were being spared the typically confusing tangle of Beltway Bandit whitepaper grift, but Thiokol Chemical has an interesting history; founded in 1929, in Maryland, about a half hour's drive from the home of the US Army's chemical &amp; biological programs. Some of you clever readers out there may be familiar with the nature of some of the Army/CIA's better-known programs originating there during the cold war. Paddock didn't leave gov't for Thiokol : he was a gov't auditor stationed inside a military contractor overseeing secret research projects.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Morton-Thiokol link is not being adequately explored, imo. More on Thiokol you won't find on the web if we get a good archive going. ;-)
