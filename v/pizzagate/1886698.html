            In any case hes not a hero -- he didnt even know about PG.  If he realized he was risking his life it would have been because of prior knowledge of their criminality that he failed to disclose.  Hero.

            He was butthurt that DNC didnt like the prospects of Woody Allen against Dolph Lundgren because Americans aren't stupid.  Not that we arent all ruled by jews anyway.

             About the family: No, in my current understanding, the family wants the case solved honestly, whatever the truth is, but they don't want it to be solved in papers. They hope that the media would push demanding investigation, instead of writing accusations (like what Fox did) before they were confirmed (by officials). In my opinion, the family should be respected on this, and the media should focus on the possibly corrupted officials instead of the murder victim. A reliable press backgrounder would help on this too.
            </p>
            <p>
             About Panda: Nicknames are difficult sources re press backgrounder, but if the connection can be reliably made via the content, it's part of the press backgrounder for sure. Just takes some extra work.
            </p>
            <p>
             About the rest: You present a lot of claims without sources there :) I take those as your opinion. I also have opinions, like that the cops have killed him in the hospital, but I won't push with my opinions. I just want this scenario to be checked, among others.

              none of those are claims.  Its a fact he did it to for bernie not pg victims. Ergo hes not a hero or even an ally. Panda is an unlikely nickname and is also one of a handful of codewords.
