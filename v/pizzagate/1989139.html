            The last District Attorney was much worse and refused to investigate racketeering and criminal corruption among his friends and fellow officials. He was a known alcoholic and eventually was caught by witnesses who recognized him after he sped drunk down Main Street after partying with other corrupt officials and crashed into a street light. He tried to drive away but his car would not start, so he ran to the City Attorney's home asking for an alibi and cover-up, then tried to get his wife to lie and report the car being stolen, then when the police were forced to show up at his house, he lied and said he had been taking a nap but was covered in the remnants from the air bag. He tried washing it off and only after they said there were multiple witnesses who recognized him did he confess to the accident but still denied being drunk and refused a breath test. He was given extra time to sober up, and after refusing the test again, he asked to be taken to the hospital for a blood test. Then once there after delaying further, he refused the blood test. He was given a local citation, without any obstruction charges, and was not even taken to jail. He was given a ride back home to his wife. The corrupt police chief and other corrupt attorneys quickly covered it all up, and he was eventually was pressured to resign only to have two more corrupt people campaign for his position. They were all quick to claim that he was given no special treatment and that all officers and those involved acted properly.

            The District Attorney and his friends, including the Wisconsin Attorney General all gave him hugs and praise, and they are all in the Freemasons, the Marquette Mafia, and other secret societies that rule Wisconsin alongside the mafia and corrupt corporations. There is no justice in a broken and corrupt community where the head attorneys and judges are involved in the same corrupt circles. This is why the RICO case and other cases in Racine were eventually escalated up to the FBI and DOJ where Comey, McCabe, Kadzik and Lynch stonewalled the investigations once they found out who was connected, including the Clinton Foundation.

            That corrupt city attorney has since resigned, and now the corrupt criminal mayor and city administrator have resigned as well, with the corrupt mayor being rewarded with a position on the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Cities Initiative to control the fresh water supply that Racine sits on. This is all being orchestrated behind the scenes by those who are connected with the Pilgrims Society and Council of 13.

            There is corruption everywhere, but there only one birthplace of Sustainable Development and Community Policing, both of which are central to the bigger picture, and that is Racine, Wisconsin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Would anyone like to dispute any of these facts above? You can't. It is all true.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is a main root and model community for Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
