             "museum goers" at 2:12. Saving folks from listening to her sycophantic, whiny Abramovic worship-drivel. FFS how many times can one person say "limitless" in 5 minutes? NOTABLE to Pizzagate, this video was uploaded on YouTube six years ago, in May 2010. Top comments in the last two months, lots of them, and in my short glance, 100% negative. Much talk about satanism, and including mentions of Podesta, Alefantis, Comet Ping Pong, Wikileaks... with 735,641 views.

              Yeah, but it sounds like a strange museum she's talking about, where someone lays on a table.  Then if you look at the interior pics of the Pegasus "museum", there's just a big table.  Was little James boy trying to hit the big, big leagues and have his own Museum for that kind of cool "limitless" art?  He sure seemed to go into a tailspin when that building came up, deleting the info on Google about it and allegedly threatening somebody.  All that talk about "limitless" falls right into the kind of depravity that's being suspected.  A person would have to have "no limits" to do the kind of things that are being suspected, or lie like some in the news are doing.

            Maybe an another angle to look into is if Pegasus is registered as a non-profit or sheltered under another entity as one?  Has he applied for/is he receiving grants for Pegasus?  Anyone donated significant sums of money towards Pegasus?  Apologies if any/all of this has been covered already (haven't been able to keep up as much as I would like) but if it really is a museum and it isn't open and accessible to the public there would be a conflict with any tax/grant benefits.  Is it possible that's why he freaked out about this discovery?  Perhaps this a mechanism for money laundering as well?
