<h2>Global D.I.R.T. Non-Profit Organization</h2>
<p>Love City Community Network <a href="http://archive.is/hIMnv">works hand-in-hand with the non-profit Global D.I.R.T.,</a> or Global Disaster Immediate Response Team.  D.I.R.T.’s official name is <a href="http://archive.is/9KBO9">Help.NGO.</a> </p>
<p>Global D.I.R.T. is said to be the brain-child of two U.S. Marines, <a href="http://archive.is/01QEy">Adam Marlatt and Robert Sullivan.</a> </p>
<p>Adam Marlatt is/was a <a href="http://archive.is/6YxfL">United Nations Development Programme Senior Technical Advisor,</a> and worked with or for <a href="http://archive.is/6Gmz0">the State Department.</a></p>
<p>D.I.R.T.  performs multiple humanitarian operations, including coordinating with the disreputable UN to <a href="http://archive.is/XvhKe">pick up trafficked persons in the Mediterranean.</a>  <strong>Hopefully all is legit,</strong> but it is ripe for trafficking.</p>
<p>D.I.R.T.  and Love City Community Network in September 2017 after hurricanes Irma and Maria:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clayton Covel of Help.NGO’s Global Disaster Immediate Response Team said Gyuraki and his team [soon after named Love City Community Network] were now officially on the payroll, thanks to a consortium of donors including the Bloomberg Group, Kenny Cheney’s [Chesney’s] Consultants, David Mugar (owner of the Marketplace,) and <strong>Donald Sussman.</strong>  <a href="http://archive.is/HxqqY#selection-3197.0-3197.281">Source</a></p>

<h2>Donald Sussman -- A Funder of D.I.R.T.</h2>
<p>Donald Sussman owns a <a href="http://archive.is/iq7hG">$500 million yacht named Alice\'s Restaurant;</a> &quot;Alice&quot; is reportedly a code-word for pedophilia.   
</p>
<p>Noted in <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1605675">this thread</a> by <a href="https://voat.co/user/tookittothelimit">@tookittothelimit</a>, Sussman gave <strong>$21 million to support Hillary Clinton,</strong> and attended an intimate dinner with John Podesta, George Soros, and Lynn Forester de Rothschild <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/58548">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/58548</a> . After the Haiti earthquake in 2010, one of Sussman’s pilots gave a questionable story that “official” asked the crew to <a href="http://archive.is/bfx5d">take a baby away from Haiti with them.</a></p>

            I live in Manhattan and pretty much the only reason I come to St. John is for the pizza at Ronnie's. I don't care much for the beaches or nature. Hey Ronnie, any chance you can get bacon pizza?

            I'm getting the same exact creepy vibe from this comment as you are. No matter how many times I read it there is no way that statement isn't loaded with innuendo. Obviously someone with money from manhattan can afford to go all the way to the carribean just for pizza, just so perplexing. And not can you "make" bacon pizza but "get" it... how hard is is to get bacon on the islands, not hard I'm sure, expensive, but not hard.

             I actually absorbed the full meaning of the comment only as I was falling asleep last night: "get" bacon pizza, not "make" bacon pizza.  And it was posted six years before we knew pizza is a pedophile code word, or that some actual pizza restaurants, and some of their customers, allude to CSA around the word pizza.  I'm sure it's true that bacon is very easy to obtain on St. John, just pricey like many foods.  I keep thinking about that comment, this feels very serious.  And maybe there's more meaning to it, I have wondered whether bacon is a code word for human flesh (just based on a music video where it seemed like it was.)

              Yep, you'll see that  the 'puritan' families of the 'new' world were actually the real 'witches' because they burned all the ones that said they weren't and SPARED the ones that said they WERE if they 'repented'. Some of these 'puritans' were the converso's and Baal occultists that were trying to flee religious 'persecution' in England and carried their ways into the new world.

              The entire Northeast and all that 'kitchy' New England feel is just a front for the fact that some of the richest and most involved personalities in this world panopticon own and utilize property in that area as a matter of HERITAGE and PEDIGREE and connections to the "Old World" of American politics and government and is of course where all of the more prominent Ivy League schools reside that recruit our Intelligence apparatus.

              You'll also find some interesting leads researching the Turner Farm on North Haven in Maine. The island has a rich history and a tumultuous existence.  The farms current owners are the Pingree family and former fiance of Donald Sussman congresswoman Chellie Pingree. It is rumored that the spooky spanish chef Jose' Andres' held a Summer Dinner Series at their Nebo Lodge (Andres' rumored to be one of THOSE kinds of chefs).

            Impressive. Great work. Alot to unpack there and will pour over it in the next couple of days but I'll tell you what, great observation and you certainly have a superb eye for detail.

            I've had conversations with good people that have the unfortunate circumstance of intermingling with these vampires in their carribean locals like the Kravitzs and Israeli Grand Lodge masons like Seligman on eleuthera and are adamant, with the bashing the entire area took with this winters storms,  that it was a direct sign from God their time is coming. Keep up the great work.

             In 2004, ID Models boss Zampolli was exposed as a former business associate/partner of the infamous convicted Pedophile Island financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In 2004, Zampolli and Epstein unsuccessfully tried to buy Elite Model Management at auction. Now, very few if any tie these two figures together in the inner circle of Donald Trump, who's daughter Ivanka modeled for ID, Bill and Hilary Clinton.

             Paolo Zampolli has a Dominican diplomatic passport and is officially the Ambassador of the Commonwealth of Dominica for Oceans and Seas- an absolute joke. According to the UN’s Blue Book, Zampolli is Dominica’s (lone) Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN. There is great concern that Zampolli is using his stable of MK ULTRA Sex Kittens at the UN to compromise and bribe foreign heads of state, officials, diplomats and ambassadors.

             ZAMPOLLI is an old world BLOODLINE of the Italian AGNELLI/FIAT family. The Agnelli family intermarried with one of the leading ruling families of old Europe that goes back to ancient Etruscans. They are part of the ancient HOUSE OF BOURBON.

             The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian Dynasty. Bourbon kings first ruled France in the 16th century. By the 18th century, members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma, Spain and Luxembourg currently have Bourbon monarchs,

             Thank you.  I also think it's a sign their time is coming, glad to hear people down there believe that.  Parts of the cabal's supply chain were surely wiped out, and I hope more eyes will be on them if they attempt to restore operations.  Eyes as in people down there, including employees, etc.   The good people living, working, and/or sailing or visiting in the Caribbean can't count on law enforcement or the FBI, on the whole, to do anything if they see and report something, but they can post what they have on the internet.  If they're led to and are careful.
