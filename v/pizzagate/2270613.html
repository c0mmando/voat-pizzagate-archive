            I've had the exact same thoughts about the Flynn plea.  This could fit in quite well with The Calm Before the Storm narrative.  Let's not forget that when all is said and done, Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution says:
           </p>
           <p>
            The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment
           </p>
           <p>
            In other words, plans latest drama could be part of the larger picture and, when all is said and done, the president will grant a pardon to General Flynn. In the meanwhile, the shocking information can be revealed at a rate that won't overwhelm those who do not come to this forum.  I remain hopeful.

            This timeline gets some parts correct, but misses a few crucial things.  The FBI did got back and look at the Michael Flynn call.    And there was a reason they did so.   Obama just announced sanctions and expelled Russian diplomats and Putin angrily vowed to retaliate.  Then just two days a much more mellow Putin said he would let it slide.  So the US Intel community wondered what the hell happened and started looking at what they had for those two days.  That's when they found out what Flynn said.
           </p>
           <p>
            And it is not Flynn's job to negotiate sanctions with Russia.  In fact, Flynn was not in that job in December and thus it would be illegal, a violation of the Logan Act.

            You're engaging in wishful thinking.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a gigantic difference between Flynn trying to get immunity in March and this deal.  Basically he was turned down for immunity because he was not going to speak to everything.  What he offered they already knew, so his testimony didn't help them as they could already prove those things.   This deal is quite different, for one, Mueller knew about many more crimes that Flynn was guilty of, so he is in greater legal jeopardy and it was reported he used his son in some of these, meaning his son could be indicted as well.  So he now needs to come fully clean or else all these other charges come back against him.   He was trying to play cute and get a get out of jail free card in March.....other folks said that the was playing hardball with Trump back then and wanted a pardon.   Trump has been in contact with Flynn since he was fired and has been saying good things about him.

            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            UM.  He plead guilty to a crime.  That is an action he took.  The wishful thinking you are engaging in is that Mueller is incompetent and Flynn has hoodwinked him.   Let me assure you that Mueller showed Flynn all the other charges that Flynn could be facing and maybe even what evidence there is on those charges.  The infomation we got in court is just what Mueller is making public right now.  It's not everything Mueller knows.

             I dunno man, I don't tend to have scales in my eyes.  The President just tweeted
            </p>
            <p>
             "I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!"
            </p>
            <p>
             And if there was nothing to hide during the transition, that means the lie refers to the Obama administration.  These are all carefully chosen words.

              My twitter time is lit up with folks saying that Trump just admitted obstruction of justice.  If he knew that Flynn lied to the FBI when he fired him and he just said he did  AND if he leaned James Comey to stop the investigation into Flynn, then that is obstruction of justice.  Trump has admitted he fired Comey because of the investigation.
             </p>
             <p>
              You should compare what Trump is saying now about Flynn and what he said back then.  They both can't be true.

               </p>
               <p>
                Trump claimed he had no business dealings with Russia.  The truth is that he was pursuing Trump Tower Russia for year and that his lawyer reached out to Putin's spokesperson trying to get the financing approved even working with a bank under US sanctions
               </p>
               <p>
                He claimed his people didn't meet with Russian about campaign matters.  Then we found out his son and his son in law met in Trump Tower with the Kremlin's favorite sanctions lawyer because she promised she had dirt on Clinton.

                Flynn claimed there was nothing wrong when he met with the Russian ambassador, now we know he discussed sanctions and lied to the FBI about it.

               <p>
                The Trump team claimed yesterday "Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn."  They claimed Flynn lied to them about what he said to Kislyak.  Another lie

                McFarland,

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 While Mr. Trump has disparaged as a Democratic “hoax” any claims that he or his aides had unusual interactions with Russian officials, the records suggest that the Trump transition team was intensely focused on improving relations with Moscow and was willing to intervene to pursue that goal despite a request from the Obama administration that it not sow confusion about official American policy before Mr. Trump took office.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On Dec. 29, a transition adviser to Mr. Trump, K. T. McFarland, wrote in an email to a colleague that sanctions announced hours before by the Obama administration in retaliation for Russian election meddling were aimed at discrediting Mr. Trump’s victory. The sanctions could also make it much harder for Mr. Trump to ease tensions with Russia, “which has just thrown the U.S.A. election to him,” she wrote in the emails obtained by The Times.

                It's not his job to be right. It's his job to saturate the internet with the official story lies. This faggot has ties to media or government. Nobody has this kind of time to devote to arguing something they believe is total bullshit.

           <p>
            I've spent a bit of time poking around on this and I came to this conclusion, c&amp;p'ed from where I posted it in /politics this morning.
           </p>
           <p>
            Flynn had offered to testify about the "russian collusion" back in March, as long as he was granted immunity, and the answer was no. NOW he's essentially been granted immunity with this plea deal with Mueller, and it only required him to plead guilty to this sham of a charge. The crux is that the immunity covers the time period when he worked for the Obama Administration and everything that was covered in the Mueller investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now read this part of Flynn's statement very carefully:
           </p>
           <p>
            "But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. "
           </p>
           <p>
            He does not say the wrong actions were his actions! He very carefully used the passive voice for that sentence. What he's saying is that he's admitting he knows about some seriously bad stuff, and he agreed to the plea to expose that, which he can now do with a safety net. Indeed he's now COMPELLED to do it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The clue is all in how he worded the phrase "I recognize that
            <strong>
             the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong.
            </strong>
            **" Combine this with the time frame covered by the immunity and he isn't talking about two phone calls re: Trump in December that everyone already knows about, and the FBI already investigated and cleared back in January. He's talking about the timeframe that covers the Obama administration.
           </p>
           <p>
            Combine this with Obama's panicked ousting of 35 Russian diplomats from two long-established Russian Embassies - one in Maryland and one on Long Island - which also happened in December, which were supposedly punishment for the now-debunked "Russian hacking" narrative.  Obama was pissing his pants, it was obvious then and it's even more obvious now - the difference being is that Flynn can now talk about it.

             Best explanation I've heard, thank you. I couldn't wrap my head around why Flynn couldn't just go to Mueller on his own without having to be charged first and agree to a plea deal. Are you sure that it's a sort of double jeopardy so Flynn basically has immunity?

              I'm not certain of anything except that the double jeopardy clause is a Fifth Amendment right, and it should apply here as it would in any other court.

            She makes a good point. Time will tell. If the FBI is truly on the side of justice (per FBIanon), then this might be a red herring for the media to circlejerk over, thus assuring the deep state that everything is going to work out in their favor, thus allowing the FBI to continue gathering information while their guard is down. I truly hope justice and truth will prevail.

             Trump is in complete control....the weird sounds of booms are the Russian and American commandos going into the Jew/Masons bunker complexes around the world and blowing them the fuck up.....
Everything else is theater.....just watch the daily retirements.....daily stories coming out of people leaving office....watch for major players to sell their shares in companies....

            So to get around an oath of secrecy about some illegal activity the Obama admin was engaged in (there are quite a few, creating ISIS comes to mind) he needed this plea to compel him to speak. Interesting but seems like wishful thinking.
