            I don't have time to research this now, but I know we have talked about there being money laundering in the fashion industry.  If Alexis hob nobs and sells to the Kardashians, and Beyonce, there has to be some connection here to something nefarious.  The family seems to be involved in doing some nasty things with babies and I bet kids too, so hey, no respect for Our Children, right?  Just like the art museums are being used for hiding what is going on behind the scenes so is this industry.

            I wrote a pizzagate article about baby body parts that sourced another article about the Isaias family but I hadn't taken the time to look farther into them. This is awesome research, thank you so much for doing this! I'm going to share this on Twitter.

             "In ten Planned Parenthood clinics, Live Action videos depict investigators posing as underage girls, as young as 13-years-old, saying they were impregnated by men over twice their age. Planned Parenthood’s typical response? “Whatever you tell us stays within these walls” (Alabama). Or, “I didn’t hear the age, I don’t want to know the age” (Indiana). Or, “You don’t have to say anything” (Arizona). Or, “Just say he’s 15” (Tennessee)."
