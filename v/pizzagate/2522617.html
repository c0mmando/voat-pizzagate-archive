            "Why would Podesta do this?"
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe because he sees this guy as a threat, and approaches him like this so that other people in our community will start to suspect that Wilcock is a collaborator with Podesta.

            It's a strategy that was used to bring down a big drug cartel once. They were "untouchable", but the FBI figured that the leader must be paranoid  in order to sustain his power, so they made sure that some of their own agents – who were known to be secret agents by the drug cartels – approached the mafia boss' closest accomplices at night and such. As was predicted, the mafia boss observed this, and had them killed, thus crumbling his empire.

            They don't want us to know that ancient civilizations were more advanced than our current one and people had more wisdom and  were in touch with God / a higher intelligence.

            It's also possible they are building the alien mystery in Antarctica. It's possible they will try to fake an alien attack. There have been countless movies about this for a reason.

            David Wilcock is a disinfo agent - he sucked up to David Seeman so that he could be tarred with the same "Alien BS" brush. The pairing should have been obvious to Seeman at the time, but he was susceptible to the flattery...

            Anybody watch the actual program he was referring to? - I love that show, but always take it with a grain of salt. - No way that information can be  verified, and you've gotta remember it's made by a company owned by a company that pays to have their shit played on a service owned by a company that's owned by - probably a lot of fucking horrible people. - so there's that - .... Anyway, curious about the contents. - Podesta will pay.

            Is that a Comet Ping Pong show or a MUFON/LSD rally? It seems like he’s parlayed his UFO hobby into attracting a gang of UFO believer trolls, some of whom are coming to his defense on twitter (but not effectively).

              For sure? It’s a strong resemblance despite the hippie face paint. Looks like Ronald McDonald on acid.

               I wish I could say it was. Just to add to the long list of creepy things tied to Pedoesta. The ear is slightly different. Also no way scraggly Pedoesta looks like that under those ill fitting suits.

                  I simply can’t say that your wrong definitively. Neither of us has access to facial recognition software. The picture has no investigative value... I just thought it was interesting.

            I gave up most television years ago, but I watch Ancient Aliens now and again.  One of their main underlying motives is to undermine belief in God -- to make God and the Bible just another ancient belief -- to offer an alternative explanation for the existence of everything besides a creator God, and especially to explain man's origins and accumulation of intelligence and knowledge. They don't do a very convincing job, the way they draw all these wild conclusions and make incredible leaps of logic. It's fun to watch, knowing it's fake ... like world wide wrestling, or whatever...

            The aliens ARE demons. This is detailed  in the greatest conspiracy book ever written,  by anti semite Michael Hoffman. Secret societies and psychological warfare.
           </p>
           <p>
            He particularly points to Arthur c Clarke's book,  childhoods end. Where an alien comes to earth and it's basically hinted that he's actually the devil

             There are no aliens, so how can the aliens be demons? On top of that, there are no demons. So you are double screwed with your theory. Boy it's shilly in here.

            Podesta was one of the featured commentators during the latest episode. My hubby was watching the show, when I walked in and saw molesta commenting on something that had to do with a rock band. I was like wtf are you watching why is John P on my Tv!?!

            This really upset me to see. I love Ancient Aliens. I tried posting about some documentaries I watched (I think it was originally posted on here that I found them). By a guy called Dr Steven Greer.
            <a href="https://youtu.be/CfIetGulZhE">
             Expose Of The National State
            </a>
            and
            <a href="https://youtu.be/VL0Rpy0Dhhs">
             The Cosmic False Flag
            </a>
            . But we all know what MFag was like! They explain perfectly how this whole Pizzagate thing has been covered up and funded. He mentioned disclosing proof of UFOs to Podesta 3 times. He even says something about using a pizza shop as a front. They are very lengthy but well worth it.

            There is a theory that aliens are actually demons.  If we were to pretend this were true, with what we know about Podesta and his ties to Satanism and child sacrifice, what if he is trying to trick people into welcoming with open arms actual demons... not aliens.

                Add the dangerous DNA altering cosmic rays, which are more powerful outside our heliosphere, and what conclusion can you come up with concerning interstellar space? Movies are cool, but hardly plausible.

            That Greene faggot from the disclosure project said he handed Podesta all of his evidence.  I forget which documentary of his it was in but it was in one of them.

            I'm like 95% sure they're going to use bluebeam to fake an alien invasion.  I've seen one of their flying triangles up close and they're amazing.  They look man made but so high tech that it would be impossible to believe it was made with modern technology.  I've also seen online those spiral beam things haarp is responsible for creating that look like a portal is being made and a few other things that make me believe that they're going to try to unify the human race in defense of an alien invasion.
           </p>
           <p>
            It'd be brilliant for the jews to go down that path as they're all about getting complete control of the Earth's resources and using the rest of us like slaves.  If they can convince us of an alien threat not only do they accomplish that but they can then push themselves out into the universe while the Earth inevitably turns to shit after being destroyed, multicultied and raped of it's resources.

            anyone else still saying that pizzagate and q is just larp and conspiracy theory? look at what david wilcock and corey goode were saying on cosmic disclosure, i think we are lied about humanity history and pretty much everything this must be changed within this generation and were on good track to go there

             See what you did there? PG and Q together? Nice try. PG is real, Q is spook disinfo. Anonymous invisible info drops where bread crumbs are left for months on end, nothing pans out, everybody follows where he leads them. Nowhere. Another George Webb. Q psyop is smart enough not to give you an actual human to scrutinize. You are born followers and can't think for yourselves, that is why they chose the people to lead your opposition.

            Podesta and lots of modern alien proponents are all supported by the Rockefeller institute, these guys are all linked and so is Hillary through the Rockefeller initiative.
           </p>
           <p>
            Steven Greer, Bill Clinton, the national press club countless, army personal ... They pushed for disclosure about 23 years ago I presume as part of project bluebeam. Lots to dig here but few solid answers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: to conclude Podesta' s loyalty lies there first and covering his own ass second.

              Aliens are more likely than demons, though I believe both exist and are separate entities. Aliens are more like us (with different physical and spiritual features), demons are astral entities i.e. not corpreal.

              I agree with this more than aliens. Nephilim are the constant reoccurring name. I lean more flat earth nowadays so I don't believe a single thing from the establishment anymore.

              Jumping in here to say that I think the latter. If it comes out with proof that there are other beings, based on the story of the Nephilim in Noah's time and knowing that the future will be like the times of Noah --- IF such evidence came out, then I'd have to say they must be demons masquerading as beings of light. It may seem to push the world toward unity, but the world will only grow more violent.

            David Wilcock has not appeared on that episode.  He was posting stuff the last two months on his website Gaia that there are many controlled opposition in the Alien Disclosure movement.  Many of the famous faces we all know are compromised.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally I think David is legit.  I dont know if everything he puts on his show is legit.  But he was talking to Q types years before Q or FBI anon came around.  I think the Q rebels have used David to clear some real stuff in the past.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Podesta stuff is interesting.  But just because they were planning a project Blue Beam and a fake alien invasion does not actually mean the aliens are fake.
           </p>
           <p>
            As they said 70% of Congress was blackmailed or bribed by the Jews/Mossad/CIA I would imagine 70% of the Ancient Alien crowd is compromised.

             Wilcock is a different cat.  I actually think Q and his band of Patriots have used Wilcock to get out some wild shit before.  You must understand there is value in saying some very outlandish shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Imagine it like this.  If you name names the Jew will kill you.  So you use a wild alien guy to put out real information.  You put on the grapevine to all your allies to listen to David this next week.  David puts out legit stuff.  The Jew does not have to kill anyone because the normies wont believe anything David says anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
             You understand the value of this?  The Q guys could talk in the open and the people who matter could listen and conspire.  The normies just can go fuck off.  And the Jew isnt scared of the weird shit because it is surrounded by enough cover stuff that no normies pay attention.

            I watched the show, it was mostly highlighting that our entire current public understanding of the gov't and UFOs comes from Bill and Hillary Clinton, Podesta, and Chelsea Clinton's dad Webster Hubble. These are the people responsible for our current outlook on government and UFOs.

            That show is hilarious, if you haven't seen it it's totally worth a look just for Giorgio's personality. That being said, They raise some crazy and interesting facts throughout. But I have a feeling a lot of it is just more disinformation to confuse world history even more than it already has been confused...

               Yes they are pushing it NOW for distraction.  But when they talked amongst each other in private they still mentioned Alien stuff.  They believe some of it.

               Honestly I do also.  What is true is unknowable in a time of universal lies....but I feel there is something VERY important in the alien stuff.

                They don't likely believe a word of it. They know what bluebeam is. We are supposed to bond together and clamor for world government as a united defense against aliens. They won't go with this lame scheme during my lifetime. My god, wish they would, I would bust a gut at any such attempt.

                 Bluebeam doesn't mean that aliens don't exist. Where did they get the technology to carry out Bluebeam? The Nazis were already dealing with aliens through their secret occult societies. Funnily enough, most of these societies infiltrated the US after WW2.

              John Podesta is an alien and i know this because he told me in 2008 that they were preparing for disclosure.  This is the year which the LHC at CERN was switched on and it snowed in Las Vegas.

             <p>
              His name isn't really even John Podesta, that's just a character he plays.

              David has also recently said that they have stopped spraying the skies with highly toxic heavy metals.  Not true, it's worse than ever.  He is a bit out of the loop on that one and I guess he doesn't look up much as he's too busy looking down at his "device".
I used to trust him, but not anymore, even though he was early into pizzagate.

             Here is the link to the Podesta email published by Wikileaks which mentions David Wilcock and his book, “The Source Fields Investigation.”

             The email is from Jack Brown to John Podesta (dated 6/14/2015). Jack Brown asks for Podesta’s help in pardoning Don Siegelman, former governor of Alabama and convicted felon.
