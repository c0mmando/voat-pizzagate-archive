            See my most upvoted post on my profile. It involves ELFIA.COM's Rothchild's mansion child sex party kingpin raping little boys and he's involved with Furries too. Where there is smoke there is fire. You are looking at something real.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you can't find the pics of him and furries get back to me and I'll reply.

            From looking at that twitters follows and followers, I have some advice for this thread.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Furries seem to be very active in the LBGT community. This might get some new leads.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              This is related to a concept called "Otherkin". Otherkin is likely an offshoot of the trans movement.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              I would definately suggest finding out info about that's child's parents. If a name for the child can be found, we might be able to do a reverse search to find the names of the parents. Something stinks. They might be possible acomplices in these crimes against their son.

             Exactly.  How was that uncle allowed to take him out so many times for so many years.  Definitely very fishy. Did parents profit from this letting their son attend?  Yes, these people are sick. Perverted Acts and Minds.  Then Greed to top it all off.

             Yeah thee was a thread on this and the shills were down voating trying to change the narrative.  I am still convinced that there was more to that story.  It was cut and dry and over way too quick.  Crime committed, arrest, arraignment, and jail. Zip.

              Just like the mansion murders in DC 2 years ago.  That was even more bizarre.  And the 2 gay black men murdered in a car still running about a mile from the house that Awan used to own - "drug deal gone bad" - they even arrested some local dealer.  And when I mean gay, I mean flaming.  Look at the GoFundMe page for them.  Google "lorton double homicide gofundme"

               I will check it out.  I agree that there are so many more unexplained murders and crimes that we don't know the real truth about.  Explosions, Drownings, Accidents. Rapes, Suicides, etc. Small town news is more reliable to me than the MSM.  They ask and answer the real questions.

            Wow!  Good work!  Which self proclaimed insider anon told us they used other  "critters" for pedo code?  I started a thread on this a long time ago asking everyone to search Wikileaks's emails for other animals.  We found one weird one talking about squirrels.  I'll try to find my thread to add to to this furry friends angle.  I know I have whatever the anon said in that submission.

             Fury communities are safe spaces for youths?   This is purposely phrased to make kids think they can find a warm and fuzzy place when they are homeless, unloved and this is what they find.  This is just absolutely horrible.  One thing that has entered my mind is that maybe they are getting desperate.  Always inventing new ways because LE has been upping their investigating and arresting.  Seems they are hiding more. Or maybe I am just hopeful.

             Interesting how at the bottom there's a pedo who says he knew him
- " Aw shit.  lupine_fox used to be a friend of mine. I haven't seen him in years. I seem to remember him liking twinks when I saw him at a con. " 
, and another said he knew somebody who worked at his IT company 'Fensys, Ltd.' - 
" I only met the guy once so don't know much of anything about him past that encounter. I also know he'd employed at least one friend of mine for awhile through his business. "
 AND........
He said  HE DID HAVE FB ACCOUNT!!!! 
" I managed to get a quick look at Lupine's FA and FB accounts"

            This is horrid.  Why was that boy the only child at the party?  Were his parents there?  I can't believe this. He was abused for 7 or 8 years.  Why was this allowed to go on?  There is something missing from this story.  Someone was making money off of bringing this boy to these parties.  HORRID

             I wanted to reply last night when I read this but something stopped me. What if this boy is a kidnap victim? Where is this boy now and who has custody and is he really who his "relatives" say he is? Might just be me but I can not see parents willfully doing this to their own child. Are the parents also victims? I don't know. We do need to follow this story and find out who he is and how his family is involved or not involved.

              Sadly those that are on here for quite a while, we know that there are parents that have sold their children into a life of rape and sex for profit from the abusers.  There are many reasons for this, blackmail, poverty and just plain greed.  You are smart to question, for yes we do not know what the real situation is for that boy. If his parents were there as it says in the article, then they are not to be trusted.

Fenske (born January 25, 1960)[2] of Milford Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. He is known in the furry fandom as LupineFox. Jeffrey Alan Harvey, of West Wyoming, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.

Paige Wren Tasker (born born July 13, 1989)[4] of Mechanicsburg, Cumberland County. She is known in the furry fandom as LunaWildWolf. Stephen M. Taylor, also of Henrico, Virginia. Chronology[edit]
            </p>
            <p>
             2001[edit] The victim was born in this year.[5] Newspaper reports would describe one of the offenders as "a relative of the boy, who had been living with a grandmother",[6] and described a tiger costume he wore to furry events,[6] leading to members of the furry community identifying him as Skarr, the son of David Parker/RebelWolf.[7] 2003-2004[edit] Parker would later tell authorities that he tried to perform sexual acts on Skarr when he was 2 or 3 years old, and engaged in sexual acts with males in front of him.[5] 2009[edit] Beginning in 2009, Parker would transport Skarr to a house, where, as the victim described, men donned full-body animal costumes.[6] One of the men was Kenneth Fenske, whose fox costume consisted of "full long sleeves and pants, a zipper in the back, paw gloves, and a fox head with pointy ears".[6] Skarr, in the meanwhile, was made to dress in a Tony the Tiger outfit.[6] According to the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office, Fenske would abuse Skarr at these furry parties. It is alleged that Fenske took the boy upstairs from the party, undressed him, and forced him to have sex.[6] This occurred on possibly three or four occasions.[6] 2010[edit] Investigators allege that in this year, Parker and Skarr went to a house on Butler Street, Pittston, Pennsylvania, to visit the home’s resident, Craig Knox.[8] According to Knox's later testimony, he met Parker in 2009 or 2010, and the men discussed their mutual attraction to young boys and dogs.[8] Knox also stated that Parker offered to let him have sexual relations with Skarr, and both men engaged in sex acts with the boy that day.[8] 2015[edit] Prosecutors allege that Paige Tasker had a brief relationship with Parker, and over Christmas 2015,[9] went to Saylorsburg to visit him in his trailer.[10][9] It is further alleged that, during the visit, she slept in Skarr's bed and assaulted him.[10] Authorities allege Tasker on more than one occasion performed a sex act on the teen victim.[10] She is accused of having sex with him three times and performing oral sex on him while the pair shared a bed in Parker's trailer.[9] 2016[edit] May[edit] On Tuesday May 31, 2016, Jeffrey Harvey posted an advertisement on Craigslist, soliciting sex:[11] 2016/2017 child abuse arrests any boys wanna play — m4m.	2016/2017 child abuse arrests Special Agent Daniel Block, of the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General, responded to Harvey (then only known as a string of numbers attached to a Craigslist address), saying that he was 13, and asked if that was too young.[11] Harvey responded, "I’d love to meet but not at the risk of jail," but continued the conversation, which gradually became more graphically sexual. June[edit] On June 6, Harvey wrote: "If we meet we can never unmeet".[11] By the next day, he replied to a message using a personal Yahoo email address. Special Agent Block sent Yahoo Inc. a subpoena for more information about the address, and had Harvey’s phone number and name by June 13. On June 14, Harvey messaged: "Still wish u wud let me come and knock on yur door n u answer in ur briefs".[11] Harvey and the fictitious boy made plans to meet at 1 p.m. on Tuesday June 28, on the 500 block of Moosic Street. Harvey arrived five minutes late and was arrested, charged with unlawful contact with a minor, criminal use of communication facility, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a person less than 16 years old and statutory sexual assault.[11] Harvey was confined to the Lackawanna County Prison after failing to post $100,000 bail.[12] During an interview with agents, Harvey stated he had met a number of individuals, through online advertisements, who were interested in sexual contact with minors,[12] and the investigation showed that Parker was in contact with Harvey trying to procure a child for both men to sexually assault.[13] The information Harvey provided led agents with the Office of Attorney General’s Child Predator Section to execute a search warrant at the home of Parker. The warrant was executed in the early morning hours of Wednesday June 29.[12] A preliminary review of Parker’s cellular telephone by the Office of Attorney General’s Computer Forensics Unit revealed numerous images of "apparent child pornography".[12] He was placed under arrest and charged with 10 counts of possession of child pornography and one count of criminal use of a communication facility.[12] After failing to post $50,000 bail, Parker was confined to the Monroe County Prison. November[edit] On Tuesday November 1, Knox was located at his residence in Virginia.[8] He had moved from his home in Pittston (where he had lived from approximately 2005 to 2012)[8] "to get away from all that negativity that surrounded me out there."[6] Knox’s roommate in Virginia, Stephen M. Taylor, was also arrested during the raid.[6] Debra Kendall, one of Knox’s neighbors, described the raid: "I came to the door and I saw a mass of police and other vehicles with blue lights ... I heard them break the door in and I heard the young man [Stephen Taylor] yell at his roommate, ‘What have you done?’ That was Craig."[6] Knox was taken into custody and agreed to be interviewed.[8] Taylor was charged with bestiality and animal abuse.[6] A warrant for his arrest indicated that he had sexual contact with a dog. 2017[edit] On Friday January 27, 2017, Fenske was arrested and charged with child rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and unlawful contact with a minor.[14] He was arraigned and was held on $750,000 bail.[14] On Sunday January 29, Fenske made a posting on his Fur Affinity page:[7][15] 2016/2017 child abuse arrests I have been accused of something horrible but my lawyer says I can't talk about it. You will hear about it. At this point I can only say that I did not do what I am accused of and will defend myself to the best of my abilities. If you are wondering if you believe me and you know me then you should have your answer.	2016/2017 child abuse arrests Shortly thereafter, Fenske disabled access to his Fur Affinity account and deleted his Twitter account. Around February 5, the Fur Affinity account was reopened with the administrators reminding people of the principle of "innocent until proven guilty", and warning people not to post malicious shouts on the page. By February 9, the page was again disabled. In late January, 2017, investigators in the case searched the house of Phillip Stallsworth, and found photos on a digital storage device that showed he had engaged in sexual acts with several dogs.[16] Upon noticing police cars parked outside his home, Stallworth performed a "factory reset" on his phone, wiping its memory.[16] Stallsworth said the device contained about 20 videos and images depicting him having sexual contact with dogs,[16] and admitted during a January 27 interview that he had sex with four dogs, doing so most recently with a dog in Doylestown some three months before his arrest in February. Although arrested as part of the wider child-abuse investigation, defense attorney John Fioravanti, representing Stallsworth, said his client has no involvement with those events.[16] Stallsworth was not charged in connection with that case, and was instead charged with sexual intercourse with an animal and tampering with evidence.[16] He was freed on $25,000 unsecured bail and prohibited from contact with animals as the case proceeds.[16] May[edit] On the morning of May 8, 2017, Kenneth Fenske underwent a preliminary hearing before District Judge Charles Baum in Perkasie, and was ordered held for trial.[17][18] On Sunday May 14, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office announced charges against Paige Tasker.[10] She was arraigned on $250,000 cash bail and ordered to Monroe County Prison, on charges of statutory sexual assault, corruption of minors, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and indecent assault.[10][19] A preliminary hearing was tentatively scheduled for May 22.[10] July[edit] After being identified by David R. Parker, Anna Lynn Durbin, 25, is charged with statutory sexual assault, corrupting a minor and indecently assaulting a person under age 16.[20] Durbin was placed in Monroe County Correctional Facility in lieu of $250,000 bail and, as of mid-July, 2017, is awaiting a district court hearing.
