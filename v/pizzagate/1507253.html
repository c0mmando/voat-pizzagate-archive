             original interview

            . Maybe looking into who was involved with the Coreys' success when they were young would be helpful? The music video definitely struck a chord, same kinda weird as Macaulay Culkin's music

               I'm having trouble buying his whole story now. His mom says he's lying, his dad "seems" like an alright dude who prolly wouldn't let his son get molested and why does he say Cory Haim was straight up raped at 11 but he never was? Why'd they spare his ass, literally?

                He said he didn't tell his dad what was going on. He also said at the parties they weren't really molested, just "groomed" in a sense. He thought the man who raped Cory Haim was "tied to something bigger", he wasn't necessarily part of the "something bigger" himself (even Haim may not have been). Could be someone dangerous took a special interest in Haim for one reason or another. I mean, could all be fake (or he could be crazy) but there could also conceivably be explanations for those questions.
