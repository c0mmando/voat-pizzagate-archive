<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-Happy Days: </p>
<ul>
<li>Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler. </li>
</ul>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Chris Colombus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the false flag.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           A thread regarding the “Poltergeist Curse.” Heather O’Rourke and Dominique Dunne both died at Cedars Sinai Medical Center (a hospital with known ties to Spielberg and Geffen). and were both buried at Westwood Memorial Park. Lou Perryman was hacked to pieces by an axe. The killer wandered aimlessly for 3 miles before picking Lou’s house seemingly at random. Screams of an “MK”. I’m starting to wonder if some of the people killed in the “Poltergeist Curse” were murdered to keep what happened to Heather quiet.

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <p>
             Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Since the Giardia infection happened in January 1987, we can assume that whoever raped her infected her during pre production, NOT while filming Rocky Road. Based on average incubation times for giardia, we can apply “microbial foresnics” via epidemiology to determine the approximate time of the pre-production rape. The timing was most likely in January 1987, meaning the crime that caused the infection most likely happened in Hollywood. The culprit was most likely asymptomatic.

            Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            <p>
             Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annechario, Chris Colombus.
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. I suspect due to his ties that he knows something about what happened to Heather. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the false flag.
            </p>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.
