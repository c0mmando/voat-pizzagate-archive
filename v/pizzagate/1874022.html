I have included pics and set it out better with bullets and bold etc but cant copy over yet because technology confuses me!

            I would like to begin by explaining why I have written this leaflet. I am a Mum to 3 children 6, 4 &amp; 1. They are my whole world. The thought of someone taking them from me and harming them is unthinkable. Through online news and my own research I have discovered that this is a reality for many.
           </p>
           <p>
            A child is reported missing every 2 minutes in the UK and every 30 seconds in USA. 
2 million children are reported missing every year in the EU.
Human trafficking is a world wide problem worth $32 billion per year.
5.5 million children are victims of trafficking annually.

            What Started This Investigation?
           </p>
           <p>
            Stumbling across a seemingly innocent word. Pizzagate
           </p>
           <p>
            Isn’t That Fake News?
           </p>
           <p>
            According to Main Stream News, The Pope and Wikipedia, YES.
           </p>
           <p>
            The original source of Pizzagate being debunked comes from New York Times, a newspaper ran by a man called Mark Thompson. Previously he was General Director of the BBC, starting out as a production runner in 1979 working his way up, helped cover up the Jimmy Savile scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            To date, that we know of, there has been no investigation or explanation for the evidence we have found.
           </p>
           <p>
            What Is Pizzagate?
           </p>
           <h1>
            Pizzagate or sometimes known as #Pedogate has become a world wide online investigation regarding organ trafficking, human trafficking and the common practice of ritual sexual abuse and murder of children.
           </h1>
           <p>
            The investigation originated from Clinton Foundation emails leaked to Wikileaks. Another source then posted on a website commonly used by Anonymous, advising to look for codewords such as Pizza and Hotdogs, suggesting the real wording meant little girl and little boy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The word Pizza can be found 149 times and Hot Dog appears 73. 
Below are exact quotes from the emails:
           </p>
           <p>
            “We only have one slice of pizza to go around and we are wondering how thinly to slice it?”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Do you think it'll be better playing dominoes on cheese or pizza?”
           </p>
           <p>
            “The realtor found a handkerchief I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yours?”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Would love to get a pizza for an hour?”
           </p>
           <p>
            “I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in
pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago, assume we are using the same channels?”
           </p>
           <p>
            “Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto (11, 9, and almost 7) so you’ll have some further entertainment, and they will be in that pool for sure.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Who Is Involved?
           </p>
           <p>
            Hillary Clinton personally followed the arrest of Laura Silsby who was caught trafficking 33 children out of Haiti and into US. Both Hillary and Bill were involved in Haitian Children Foundations that have since been discovered as.
           </p>
           <p>
            Laura Silsby was not charged. Her lawyer turned out to be wanted in 4 different countries for sex trafficking of minors and held no qualifications. She currently works for Amber Alert at the U.S. Department of Justiceused to broadcast information on missing children..

           <p>
            John Podesta has worked in The White House since 1991. Was the Head of Staff for the Clinton foundation, Counselor to Barack Obama and Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton.
           </p>

            Wait, This All Sounds Very Familiar?

            What Are The FBI Declassified Paedophile symbols And What Do They Mean?
           </p>
           <p>
            These symbols can be found on the Official FBI website. These symbols have since been found in TV shows, music videos, Hollywood movies, toys, company logos, US Police badges, Child Protection Services logos and more.
           </p>
           <p>
            If This Is True, Why Isn't MSM (Main Stream Media) Covering It?
           </p>
           <p>
            You may have heard the term “FAKE NEWS” being used a lot in recent months. The rise in Google search results for Pizzagate coincide with the search results for Fake News and we believe this phrase was purposefully used to discredit the investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The main stream media includes; Newspapers, Magazines, TV and radio. Combined, all are owned by only 4 different companies. From what we know so far these companies seem to have vested interest in keeping this quiet due to links to those we already know are involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            Articles previously posted by MSM that prove involvement of elite paedophilia and the Belgian Royal Family and the overthrowing of the South Korean president have been deleted from the internet. Websites used to archive these articles are also being deleted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why Won't Googling Pizzagate Work?
           </p>
           <p>
            Google, YouTube, Instagram and Whatsapp are owned by Eric Schmidt. He was responsible for the marketing and media for The Clinton Foundation in Hillary's run for presidency. Google and Twitter (also Facebook) have recently changed the algorithm of search results. This means any evidence, information and investigations of Pizzagate are being pushed to the bottom search results and MSM articles sighting Pizzagate as fake news are pushed to the top.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why Haven't I Seen This On Twitter?
           </p>
           <p>
            Twitter have been banning and deleting users who are discussing Piagate. Some tweets re also being “shadow banned” which means although you can see your posted comment, no one else can.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where Is This Online Investigation Taking Place?
           </p>
           <p>
            The original investigation and evidence was gathered on reddit.com/r/pizzagate, the entire thing was deleted only months later. Efforts have now been continued on Voat.co/v/pizzagate. However, Voat is currently threatening closure of their website.

An email found on Wikileaks from John Podesta on discusses “making an example of any leakers”. The media claim Mr Rich was robbed, however his watch, wallet and other expensive items were still on his persons when taken to hospital where he later died. Further suspicion around his death comes from reports that he was stable in hospital and staff were told “not to check in on the VIP”. His family have since
 hired a private investigator to try and get answers.

                That does not sound too bad  Just not any thing graphic. Touching on the large no. of missing kids is extremely important imo.

             What Is Pizzgate?
            </p>
            <h1>
             Pizzagate or sometimes known as #Pedogate has become a world wide online investigation regarding organ trafficking, human trafficking and the common practice of sexual abuse and murder of children.
            </h1>
            <p>
             The investigation originated from the Clinton Foundation emails leaked to Wikileaks. A source named FBIAnon posted on a website commonly by Anonymous advising them to search the emails for codewords such as Pizza and Hotdogs. The word Pizza can be found  times. Below are exact uotes from the emails.
            </p>
            <p>
             We only have one slice of pizza to go around and we are wondering how thinly to slice it
The realtor found a handkerchief (I think it has a map that seems pizza-related. Is it yorus? They can send it if you want.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some relevant an important evidence found included:
            </p>
            <p>
             Hillary Clinton personally followed the arrest of Laura Silsy who was caught trafficking 100 children out of Haiti and into USA. Laura Silsby, now Laura works fr Amber Alert – a US company 
Comet Ping Pong And Pizza is owned by James Alefantis who was named as Washington DC's 49th most powerful man was  His personal Instagram contained LOTS of inappropriate pictures of children with eually worrying comments. Alefantis dated David Brock

             What Are The FBI Declassified Paedophile symbols?
            </p>
            <p>
             These symbols can be found on the Official FBI website.
            </p>
            <p>
             Where Is This Online Investigation Taking Place?
            </p>
            <p>
             The original investigation and evidence was gathered on a website called “Reddit” who deleted everything months later.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hasn't Pizzagate Been Debunked As Fake News?
            </p>
            <p>
             You may have heard a lot about “FAKE NEWS” in the news lately. The rise in Google search results for Pizzagate coincide with the search results for “Fake News” and we believe this phrase was purposefully used to discredit the investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             If This Is True, Why Is The MSM (Main Stream Media) Not Covering This?
The main stream media includes Newspapers, Magazines, TV and radio. Combined they are all owned by only 4 different companies. These companies seem to have vested interest in keeping this quiet due to links to those we already know are involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why Won't Googling Pizzagate Work?
            </p>
            <p>
             Google, YouTube, Instagram and Whatsapp are owned by Eric Schmidt. He was responsible for the marketing and media for The Clinton Foundation in Hillary's run for presidency. Google and Twitter (also Facebook) have changed the algorithm of search results. This means any evidence, information and investigations of Pizzagate are being pushed to the bottom search results and MSM articles sighting Pizzagate as fake news are pushed to the top.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why Haven't I Seen This On Twitter?
            </p>
            <p>
             Twitter have been banning and deleting users who are discussing Piagate. Some tweets re also being “shadow banned” which means although you can see your posted comment, no one else can.
            </p>
            <p>
             How Many Deaths Surround “Pizzagate”?
            </p>
            <p>
             There has long been a rumour surrounding the #ClintonDeathCount including coroners, judges, staff and claimed victims. Below are just some deaths that seem relevant to this investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Andrew Breitbart – A journalist and creator of alternative media outlet Breitbart died of a heart attack in the street aged 44. On 4th February 2011 he tweeted from his verified Twitter account “How prog-guru John Podesta isn't household name as world class underage sex slave op cover-upperer defending unspeakable dregs escapes me.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Michael – The assistant of Breitbarts autopsy died on aged. Cause of death was arsenic poisoning over 8 days.
            </p>
            <p>
             Seth Rich – Worked for the DNC died aged 27, was shot in the back twice near his home at 4am on July 10th 2016. Julian Assange has hinted he is the leaker of the 40,000 emails. An email found on Wikileaks from John Podesta on discusses “making an example of any leakers”. The media claim MR Rich was robbed, however his watch, wallet and other expensive items were still on his persons when taken to hospital where he later died. Further suspicion around his death come from reports that he was stable in hospital and staff were told not to check in on the VIP.
            </p>
            <p>
             Why Are They Doing This?
            </p>
            <p>
             This is where the investigation gets a little dark and hard to believe. But with the knowledge of the above information I can assure you that you will start to see this already being filtered into every day life. Music videos for one example.

                I'm not at home at the moment and still gathering info for a very detailed post.  Suffice to say, start with this hint of a link

                also mentions his associations with Tishman Speyer.  Then look into any connections that the Tishman Speyer group has with London (Westminster)..it links in with the Hampstead case.  It's a complex web which I'll flesh out when I have more time.

              <p>
               It looks like a FAQ, which should work as a simple form for any newcomers looking for answers. Maybe try to shorten the beginning into just two most important sentences and move everything else from there under the "FAQ" subtopics. In overall the length seems good too (read time ok) so when adding more, shorten others. I'd add images only. I like the list of names and organizations you've picked, they keep it simple. Having some more names or organizations could add too much to the length, so they could be left to "Part 2". Leave the royalty there as well, but hint about it. How about Alefantis / CPP false flag?

                Thanks! Your opinion mean a lot. I think it's the beginning I am struggling with - I want to mention Hillary, Silsby, Weiner, Podestas, Alefantis, Abrokovich and spirit cooking using blood semen and breaastmilk. I feel even the sticky on here doesn't do any justice in explaining it either. There's just so much evidence it's overwhelming.

                <ul>
                 <li>
                  It should include something which emotionally connects the reader into the article. If possible, via a personal experience.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  It should hint about the beef included in the article, pushing the interest to read further
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  It should not be neutral (people don't use their emotions in those)
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  It should be no longer than 300 characters. The shorter the better, above goals reached.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  It can include an advice / guidance to act (for example to share the post, to join a march, to find out more etc.)

                   That start sounds very good, at least I'd get a strong emotion (and wanted to read further already by that). About the finish, if you're talking about the finish of the beginning, don't ask but tell/suggest (But good if you're talking about the finish in the whole article.)

             Thanks. I just can't begin to explain this to people anymore - too many avenues to get lost in when trying to explain to someone who has never heard of this. So I'm hoping I can be like .. here read over this.
