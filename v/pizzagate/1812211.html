            Trump has to be sacrificed he won't do a damn thing neither will Sessions and Trump flew on Epstein's jet many times to orgy island Trump and Epstein had sex with 13 year old girls in New York and on the island. There has to be video of Trump doing this along with Bill Clinton and that is why Trump won't ever order any high-level arrests on this only low-level nitwits will get nailed. Trump must be sacrificed.

            A nice job has been done of discrediting pizzagate, but it would be much harder to deny that there are/ have been pedos in positions of power generally. Which is where pedogate comes in.

            I am guessing you already followed the "conspiracy world" pre Pizzagate? I believe this is the way for most here and why it is an easier pill to swallow for us. To work long hard hours, consume, watch TV and not much more .. to look up from the set and be told the WORLD is run by peadophiles stealing, raping and torturing our children, I may have looked back down. It's too much for the human mind to comprehend. This is why the elite know this shit has had to be veerrryyyy slowly filtered into their TV sets.

            I believe you are right. They still think it's a battle of who they voted and are too selfish to see all we want is for people to stop abusing children. They are also probably "good consumers" who believe it was the Russians.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had an idea a while back, but so bad with technology I didn't bother. There has been lots over the years and more so lately of celebrities talking about this on their shows, Oprah and Dr Phil come to mind. Make a 10 minute video of all the celebrities they know and trust and let them tell them what Pizzagate is about.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe also something that proves they always run back to the Russian narrative when all else fails?

            I hear you, but they don't know about the Franklin Scandal either. Nor about Hampstead. Maybe Jimmy Saville. We are dealing with a low low looooowwwwwww info population. The people who would be swept up in something like the March for Science (eye roll) are people who still watch MSNBC and consider it news.

            I redpilled a couple of older folks today at a township day. Their daughter and grandson were killed by the husband/father, after years of physical and emotional abuse. I had just gone over to talk, but when they opened up, I felt compelled to tell them about PizzaGate and made them promise to look it up and remember what I said about the media trying to debunk. They said their daughter tried to speak out, but no one wanted to listen.
           </p>
           <p>
            The older people are internet-savvy these days; redpill them. They need to know. Call it PizzaGate. They're smart enough to see through Alefantis' bullshit. We need as many allies as we can get.

            Yes, well my two family members who are staunch Dems are not even up to admitting that there are no longer two parties anymore.  They think we still have Democrats and Republicans.  Ha Ha Ha.  I could fall over laughing right now.  Imagine their shock if I brought up Pizzagate.  I actually did to one and she would have none of it. They are in their 40's.  We cut the cord a yr ago.  No more MSM for me.

            I don't know if this is the exact way to go, but we can all discuss it.  I am open to suggestions as I think many others may be.  We certainly need some publicity advice.  I am sure that we have marketers on here?  I have thought that we must keep things low key and not talk about the shocking parts of our cause.   Yes, we can connect it to the Franklin Scandal that has gotten  out of control. And that would be partly true as well. I think this observation may be correct for some people, feeling angry because of Hillary and Soros, but I think the feelings run the gamut.  I just heard from my friend in Canada, whom I had mentioned the Pizzaate pedo problem to, he of course was having none of it.  He said it is a product of the Russians aiming at Hillary in order for Trump to win, mind you this is a Conservative that watches CNN. But, yes I think we need a new plan, and the Franklin one might just work.  I will wait for the thoughts of others.

            pizza parlors are arguably the most notorious front businesses of the 20th century due to Sicilian mafias. The longest criminal trial in history 1985-87 was about laundering money through pizza, presumably because Italians would not be out of place there and the popularity of pizza as a fast food makes the profits appear plausible.

            <p>
             We need to include everyone and only focusing on Hillary and Obama to start with will make us isolated.
            </p>
            <p>
             We need to be PERSUASIVE and INCLUSIVE of everyone who is not a criminal elite sociopath. And to do that we need to start by at least attempting to find some common ground.
