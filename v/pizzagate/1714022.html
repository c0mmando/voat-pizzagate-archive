<p>Gerry McCann backs Miliband and Clegg press plan

<hr />
<p>Foreign Secretary David Miliband admits to having a number of telephone conversations with the Doctors McCann - but won\'t say how many</p>
<p>During 1997, Mr Clarence Mitchell, full-time PR spokesman for the Doctors McCann, claimed that after the McCanns were made \'arguidos\' [formal suspects], they had not recieved any help from, or even been in contact with, any senior Ministers of the British government.</p>
<p>However, an enterprising member of the public decided to ask a question about Mr Mitchell\'s claim under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Here are extracts from the reply from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office:</p>
<p>&quot;I can confirm that the Foreign Secretary has communicated with the McCann family on a number of occasions. However any further details relating to this have been withheld under Section 36(2)(c) of the Freedom of Information Act which, if disclosed, would or would be likely to, prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs...we had to apply a \'public interest test\' to determine whether or not the information should be released. We recognise that there is a public interest in transparent and open government...but we have to balance this with the need to reassure British nationals in need of Consular assistance that we will protect details relating to their situation. In this instance there is clearly an expectation that the details of all communications were confidential and would not be [made] public...For this reason, we consider that the public interest in maintaining this exemption outweighs the public interest in release.</p>
<p>&quot;The Foreign Secretary has not communicated with either Clarence Mitchell or the [private company Helping to Find Madeleine]: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd&quot;.
It should be noted, however, that from May to September 2007 Mr Clarence Mitchell was seconded to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, for which Mr Miliband was the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>&quot;As Ed Milliband was classed as Gordon Browns pet project and David was Bliars it could explain a lot&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;The McCanns spoke to Miliband a month ago, and family sources said he had been \'very supportive\'. Now, they are hoping he might help head off any decision to lay charges against the McCanns on the basis of what one relative branded as \'repulsive\' suggestions they were involved in their daughter\'s disappearance&quot;.

<hr />
<p>&quot;Which leads me on to the question of why they received such exceptional treatment from British authorities, directed straight from No. 10, to the extent that Blair and Brown eventually gave them a PR representative? I used at one stage to be Resident Clerk in the FCO, a now abolished post effectively of night duty officer. I can tell you from horrible personal experience that the FCO deals with gut-wrenching cases of lost or dead children abroad frequently. I spent one of the most terrible three hours of my life, through to a cold dawn, on the phone with a hysterical bereaved mother desperate to explore any avenue that might give a possibility that the boy who had just drowned in Brazil was misidentified as her son. On average, I am afraid such tragedies get substantially less than 1% of the public resources that were devoted to the McCanns.&quot;

<p><strong>In addition, Barroso has held several paid and unpaid positions, including:</strong>
International Commission on Financing Global Education Opportunity (led by Gordon Brown<em>), Member (since 2015)[33]

European Business Summit (EBS), Honorary Chairman of the Honorary Committee (since 2014)

Madeleine McCann LATEST: European trafficking gang snatched missing Maddie - Portugal cops
<a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/740014/Madeleine-McCann-search-European-traffickers-snatched-tot-Portuguese-police-believe">http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/740014/Madeleine-McCann-search-European-traffickers-snatched-tot-Portuguese-police-believe</a></p>
<hr />
<p>So I recently asked the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Freedom of Information Section:</p>
<p>Please supply the following information during the period 1 August to 20 September 2007, together with:</p>
<p>a) Actual Dates</p>
<p>b) Names of countries and cities/towns visited</p>
<p>c) Express purpose of the visit.</p>
<p>I have received this reply, dated today (2 July):</p>
<p>I confirm that the FCO does hold information relevant to your request and the details are as listed below:</p>
<p>10 August, visiting Florence, Italy: purpose: ‘Bilateral visit’</p>
<p>4-7 September, visiting Bucharest, Romania – Istanbul, Turkey – Rome, Italy – Madrid, Spain: purpose: ‘Bilateral visits’</p>
<p>7-8 September, visiting Viana do Castelo, Portugal: purpose: ‘GYMNICH (informal gathering of EU Foreign Ministers)’.</p>
<p>So it seems he was in Portugal talking to the press on the morning of 8 September just by the fortuitous chance of being at an informal meeting in Portugal of some other EU Foreign Ministers.

            I don't think Madeleine is dead. With all the publicity, she'd be a valuable commodity in the SRA sex slave industry. Your question "Why Madeleine McCann?" - I could ask the same question about Natalee Holloway. Why all the attention for one missing child unless there are very prominent people involved. Right now I question both where the McCanns and the Holloways are now? All are conspicuous by their absence - nothing on the Daily Mirror who used to be so concerned about "Our Maddie" and Beth Holloway's Facebook has been gutted... strange for a woman who is allegedly desperate to find her allegedly still missing daughter.  Personally, I expect Pizzagate will out many parents who sold their own children for fame and fortune.

            I would suggest since the child was born via IVF, she may of been a clone.  It's interesting George Town University, where Amanda Kleinman works, who features coloboma in her "music videos" (marxist brainwashing), was one of the first to publicly clone, way back in the 90s.  What a coinkedink that McCann should share the Coloboma.  Gerry, like Alefantis, appears to yield unusual power for a GP.  Spooks.

            Here is my working theory. The Doctors McCanns was either recruited or already with the sickos with George Soros. The doctors, either wanted to or was paid to use in vetro. The doctors was deceived or knew that George Soros's was the sperm donor. Once, Soros was made aware that Madeleine had the same eye condition plans was set into motion to retrieve Soros's offspring. I think like Caris James, Madeleine was chosen to reproduce. 
The kidnapping plan went wrong. The Podesta Pedos and Weiner,  was sloppy and was seen. So, now everyone has to stick to the story. They purposely are avoiding the police sketches that id  the Evil Pedo threesome!

            Don't really know what more can be said about this case.  You can bet that they are doing everything in their power  to keep this covered up.  Somewhere there is a clue or a person that is sitting on something.  I remember someone writing on here that someone from UK LE was a friend of Gerry and he scrubbed Gerry's computer clean of CP.  I think the answer lies with the McCanns. Then the UK Govt.  and  the Podestas and maybe even Sandusky and Hastert, being that they may be involved with a global ring that this is all linked to.  When we find that small thread and pull it, it will start to unravel.  But until then, we can keep up supposing all sorts of things.

               Walsh had massive drug debts. He was hired by Rupert Murdoch and has made millions. I have no idea what really happened to Adam. The official story is a total fabrication. Two serial killers at a mall simultaneously? Really? The official story is a joke. The head 'identified' by his boss... really? Dentists have said no way did that head belong to Adam. By 'solving' the alleged murder, Walsh was able to get the head out of evidence and get it disposed of. There are so many things wrong with the official story, I don't even know where to start. With all that is going on now with Pizzagate and the corruption in agencies that are supposed to be helping to find missing children/people including the NCMEC which John Walsh is heavily involved with, IMO any research done is time better spent starting there first.

            Seems half the world was in Portugal at that time.  The McCanns know more than they are saying. It's written all over their faces.  Ask them.  I'm sick to death of this case.

             The McCanns have said nothing since it became apparent that Madeleine was sold, not abducted.
Where are the McCanns now? In hiding or locked up at Scotland Yard?
