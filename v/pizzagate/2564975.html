            This is a BS "Saul Alinsky" tactic. Accuse Trump of what you have IGNORED in HRC's &amp; BO's administrations. Kids &amp; lives don't matter to this political group. Their own advancement and self glory is all that does. Shame on you &amp; the Lord rebuke you Apryl Ryan! Your own career &amp; advancement is your IDOL. You ignore the evil you've seen and slander the President/WH Administration that you get to report on AS A PRIVILEGE. Woe unto you if you don't repent.

            Actually, this is the best thing that could have happened. This, beyond anything else, proves that ''they'' are ''losing the message.''
           </p>
           <p>
            The Cannibal Elite has tried every other tactic since Pizzagate began. They're ridiculed it, tried to align pizzagaters with nutcases by staging false flags, tried to normalize JA's horrendous Instagram pics, tried to censure the Wikileaks email drop by having CNN warn us that viewing the emails was ILLEGAL?!!!!, tried to create a narrative that would explain the bizarre events and Haiti child grabs by sickos freed by SKANKLES, and had their PedoWood flunkies come out in droves [swarms?] and barrage our POTUS and us with inflammatory insults. Guess what? NONE OF IT WORKED!
           </p>
           <p>
            Isn't that wonderful? We won! They were pushed to attempting the last resort which was throwing our credible accusations at our POTUS -- and the plan went down in flames! They 2014 pics didn't help! It means they're coming up with this shit on the fly!
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm proud of you, pizzagaters. I remember the disinfo crap started by perhaps JA or known associates of this cabal to change the name of our movement! That was part of the ridicule and disperse strategy. I vehemently defended the name and just as vigorously denied the assertion that no one would take us seriously with a name like #PIZZAGATE!
           </p>
           <p>
            HA! DOUBLE HA!
           </p>
           <p>
            They did, they will, and we won! Well, at least this battle we did! So congrats on you all! Love being a part of fighting for our kids!

            Obama is fucked. He allowed more unaccompanied children to enter the country than Trump ever has, and Obama's administration arrested a very low number of pedos, while the Trump administration has an incredible amount of pedo arrests. Yeah, they're definitely going to out themselves with this one. Red pill time for sure!

            Immigration experts are warning that California could see a spike in arrivals of unaccompanied children crossing the border this year, following a quiet year in 2015.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The numbers are well above this point in 2015 and they’re even higher than this point from 2014, which was a significant surge year,” Hunter said.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, he added, once children are released from federal shelters, many of them are released to sponsors — often family members or other connections living in the U.S. — all around the country
           </p>
           <p>
            So far in this fiscal year, Los Angeles County has taken in the highest number of unaccompanied children of any county nationwide, nearly 1,500. Those children could wait years to resolve their immigration cases.

             Been seeing replies akin to "where are the pizzagaters on this? don't they care about these kids?"
Well, shit. We mentioned it 2 years ago and got told we're conspiracy theorists. It's about damn time they caught up (and still aren't nearly caught up enough) with us.

            WHERE ARE OBAMA'S IMPORTED CHILDREN???????
"Almost one-third of 214 U.S.-based MS-13 gang members arrested in an international sweep were invited into the United States by President Barack Obama’s “Unaccompanied Alien Children” policy."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Sixty-four of the 193 illegals – nearly one in three – are would-be “dreamers” because they illegally crossed the border while claiming to be minors. Their unscreened claims to be children — not adults — won them the legal status of “Unaccompanied Alien Children,” which allowed them to claim federal aid and be released into the United States."
            <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/11/16/one-third-of-214-arrested-ms-13-gangsters-were-unaccompanied-alien-children/">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Were these missing “Unaccompanied Alien Children” let in under Obama, and the truth of their disappearance is just now coming out?
I think the unprecedented wave of “Unaccompanied Alien Children” let in by Obama served two purposes: to allow MS-13 gangs in for political use and to use truely underaged children to restock the child trafficking supply. As usual, accuse your opponent of what you yourself are doing.

            Unaccompanied Alien Children: An Overview:
           </p>
           <p>
            "In FY2014, the number of unaccompanied alien children (UAC, unaccompanied children) that were apprehended at the Southwest border while attempting to enter the United States without authorization reached a peak, straining the system put in place over the past decade to handle such cases. Prior to FY2014, UAC apprehensions were steadily increasing. For example, in FY2011, the U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) apprehended 16,067 unaccompanied children at the Southwest border, whereas in FY2014 more than 68,500 unaccompanied children were apprehended. In FY2015, UAC apprehensions declined 42% to 39,970. At the close of FY2016 they increased to 59,692, roughly 20,000 more than in FY2015, and 9,000 less than the peak of FY2014. During the first two months of FY2017 (October and November, 2016), USBP apprehended 14,128 unaccompanied children. Apprehensions in the first two months of FY2015 and FY2016 were 5,143 and 10,588, respectively.
UAC are defined in statute as children who lack lawful immigration status in the United States, who are under the age of 18, and who either are without a parent or legal guardian in the United States or without a parent or legal guardian in the United States who is available to provide care and physical custody. Two statutes and a legal settlement directly affect U.S. policy for the treatment and administrative processing of UAC: the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-457); the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296); and the Flores Settlement Agreement of 1997."

              Thanks for the encouragement. It is personal for me. A pedo tried to kidnap me when I was in third grade. A neighbor bravely rescued me. I would never want another child to experience that kind of fear and worse. I will do all I can to expose these sickos.

            to pull up any Craigslist in the world... they were told to remove all listing for “ dating” on their sites because of sex trafficking... I just discovered that the “ missed connections “ section, which is as the primary sex trafficking section was never removed... moved to the community section and is in full force... circumventing all laws.
I would have contacted her personally but because I am targeted I have burned several identities here for my own safety.  Don’t have enough time on the board to contact as I would like.
Every one of you can pull up Craigslist... go to community section and you will see “ missed connections “
which is the primary trafficking section.  Told to remove it and there it is... in your face!
I sent the info to President Trump 15 minutes before posting this... this is major!
No intent of bumping the thread but I had no option... Craigslist is obviously in the pizzagate/ perophile business
and we are here to kill off this sick shit.  Check your local Craigslist yourself... shut these tickets down forevermore !!!!

              Thank you... and if that Hogg freak was doing his “ death in” in a store where I shopped I would have declared “ Oh my bladder is erupting and I am being blocked from the toilet!  And proceeded to drop my pants an piss on all of them.... blocking my body function is a crime!  Bet they would scream and run out the door... and the store managers would give me a medal!! 
Use what you got on these fuckers!!!!  I’m over 60 and who could blame me for lack of bladder control...
that I don’t suffer from because I have a healthy body, mind and spirit!
