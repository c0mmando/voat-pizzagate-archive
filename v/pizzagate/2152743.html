            They are a bookseller.  They sell books.   This dude is just searching for topics he thinks are disgusting.
           </p>
           <p>
            Did you notice that most of the books he looks up are not in the store?

            Meaning if you want a book, they can get it for you from the publisher/book distributors.   Books that are in stock say On Our Shelves Now at: Politics and Prose - 5015 Connecticut Avenue NW
           </p>
           <p>
            When you go to their website, you are hooking into the ecommerce engine of whatever book distributors they use.  You can pretty much find any book you that is in print this way.   In fact, when I went to the website of my local bookstore, I got the exact same results.   Books they didn't have shipped in 1 to 5 days.  This is like the local bookstore's way of fighting Amazon.

            Description
           </p>
           <p>
            Shhhh Don't tell anyone about this mouth-watering book from the New York Times bestselling creators of Dragons Love Tacos and Robo-Sauce
How does Racoon love pizza? Oh, let him count the ways. He loves the gooey cheesy-ness, salty pepperoni-ness, sweet sweet tomato-ness, and of course the crispity crunchity crust. But someone is always chasing poor Raccoon away from his favorite food with a broom What's a hungry raccoon to do? Plan an elaborate secret pizza party, of course 
But shhh It's a secret In fact, you should probably just forget I told you. Nope, no secret pizza party happening here.You didn't already tell all your friends, did you? Uh oh . . .
Fans of Jon Klassen and Mo Willems's humor will gobble up this quirky ode to the lengths we will go to for our heart's desire.
Praise for Dragons Love Tacos 
New York Times bestseller
A New York Times Notable Children's Book of 2012
"Rubin and Salmieri are two of the weirdest, funniest guys working in kids' lit today. The team lets its geek flag fly in an obsessive how-to guide for would-be dragon taco party hosts. Why a taco party? As Rubin explains, 'The only things dragons love more than parties or tacos, is taco parties.' If further proof is required, Salmieri--whose poker-faced watercolor, gouache, and color pencil drawings set a benchmark for oddball observational humor--shows one odd, scaly creature with a carryout bag from 'Taco Cave' and another beaming with anticipation as it eagerly circles the date for a taco party on its taco-themed calendar. But beware: even if all the tips and rules are followed to the letter (on quantity: 'The best way to judge is to get a boat and fill the boat with tacos'), all will be for naught if spicy salsa makes its way into the taco filling. In fact, the dragons will bring a whole new meaning to 'housewarming.' Off-kilter fun for those who like their picture books (and salsa) zesty and fresh."-Publishers Weekly, starred review
"Dragons Love Tacos is a heaping helping of silly. Little kids will relate to the anti-spicy bias and chuckle over Salmieri's watercolor and gouache cartoon illustrations showing literally boatloads of tacos and all sizes of dragons enjoying their favorite food at pool parties, costume parties and, well, taco parties." -San Francisco Chronicle
"The perfect book for kids who love dragons and mild tacos." -Kirkus Reviews
"The watercolor, gouache, and colored pencil cartoon illustrations are the real stars here. Regardless of, or perhaps because of, the absurdity of the story, this tale should be a big hit with anyone with an affinity for dragons." -School Library Journal

            Praise for Secret Pizza Party
“The skillful gouache-and-ink compositions are full of sly details and visual humor. It’s hard not to giggle at scenes like the lanky pizza man with angry eyebrows and a handlebar mustache rolling out dough while glaring at a “Wanted” poster featuring the raccoon. With a casually diverse cast of characters, Secret Pizza Party is a sure hit for primary-grade kids, who will appreciate the subtle humor and absurdity.” –School Library Journal starred review
           </p>
           <p>
            "From the madcap creators of Dragons Love Tacos (2012), another animal foodie shows just how far he will go to get his favorite meal. This screwball of a story will leave readers hankering for a slice." --Kirkus Reviews

              It's a completely messed up book and the author reads it to children at schools, how crazy is that. Promoting secrecy and alluding to secret hand shakes and passageways... . This book is what convinced me there is a pedosadist agenda at work to try and subvert children.

               for sure.  and all the pics of cheese pizza in the book. and the masks everyone is wearing at the secret pizza party.  and the image on the wall in the gallery definitely resembles the boylover logo.  his other books are very odd too.   dragons love tacos???  creepy.
