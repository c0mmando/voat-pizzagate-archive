            Why would you post that here? I think low IQ people's problems are due to the way they are raised, if we taught critical thinking, interpersonal and personal financial management skills in school a lot of problems would be solved and whatever kind of progress your thinking could be made without the need for weird intelligence segregation or manipulation. Tax and finance legislation is purposely not taught to ensure enough of people are uninformed and in debt so don't rise up.

             It's mostly genetic.
            </p>
            <p>
             My point was the elites are a group of people with an average IQ of like 120.  They're smart.
            </p>
            <p>
             The masses have an average IQ of like 90.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 120s will always dominate the 90s.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can't help people that don't know how to help themselves.

              Yes people with a genetic advantage will always have an advantage, that's like saying the sky is blue. My point is that the problems low IQ people suffer are due to a financial and tax system that is deliberately obfuscated and not taught in schools and bad cultures that do the whole crabs in a bucket thing to individuals who want to rise up the social ladder. Personal financial responsibility is hard to come by in low IQ people because they do not search for knowledge they don't have because they don't realise they don't know it till it's too late, people simply assume if it's not known to them it's not important. If critical thinking and financial management was taught in schools poor people wouldn't take out 10%+ interest loans to pay back other loans because they would know that just makes a problem worse. IQ is genetic but it only takes one generation to break out of generational poverty, and all that requires is motivation, the right knoledge, responsibility and critical thought. Sure you can't teach motivation but the rest you can teach, but we don't, because the 120+ IQ people your so hopeful for keep up a system that benefits off perpetuating debt and welfare dependace trapping other 120+ people who aren't sociopathic. If the 90s knew they were being dominated and knew how to help themselves no one would need to help them.
