            The best emeralds come from South America. They are very deep, vivid green. From what I've been reading the last few days, slavery (ie trafficking) is very commonplace in Brazil, especially in mining towns like Minas Gerais, and is almost culturally accepted because it's so imbedded in their history.

            Okay so what is interesting somewhat here is that there are numerous companies and the same people are listed as employees for several different companies.  So like one person maybe listed on say 50 something companies as an employee. Not sure what that means but it is a webb.

             Omega Institute for Holistic Studies is a non-profit educational retreat center located in Rhinebeck, New York. Founded in 1977 by Elizabeth Lesser and Stephan Rechtschaffen, inspired by Sufi mystic, Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan and his ecumenical spirituality, today it offers classes to over 25,000 people a year, at the 190-acre (0.77 km2) campus
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1977, co-founders Stephan Rechtschaffen, author of Timeshifting, and Elizabeth Lesser, author of The Seeker’s Guide and New York Times best-selling Broken Open, say they were inspired to create the Omega Institute by scholar and Eastern meditation teacher, Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan.[8][9][10][11] The name “Omega” came from the teachings of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a 20th-century French philosopher and Jesuit priest who used the term “Omega Point” to describe the peak of unity and integration toward which all life is evolving.
            </p>
            <p>
             New York City events have included speakers such as Al Gore, Christopher Reeve, and Eckhart Tolle. ... Other Omega speakers and teachers have included Adyashanti, Maya Angelou, Deepak Chopra, Pema Chödrön, Jeanne Fleming, Jane Goodall, Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan, Ram Dass, Thich Nhat Hanh, Allen Ginsberg, Gloria Steinem, Pete Seeger, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Philip Glass, Betty Williams, Lon Milo DuQuette, and many others.

             Bogota Journal; Emeralds' Luster Hides a Darker Side
            </p>
            <p>
             "When Medellin drug lords wanted to expand their money laundering, they turned to emeralds.
A decade ago, they approached Colombia's top gem traders for a marriage of convenience, hoping to gain access to the Magdalena River for drug shipping."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Once at the top, Mr. Carranza became the most powerful proponent of cleaning up the country's sizable emerald trade, by creating a commodities market to regulate quality, pricing and payment."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Mr. Carranza's initial plan for a commodities market included a steep membership fee that would essentially have kept smaller players out. Though a commodities market would make emeralds taxable, thereby lessening profits, it would also mean creating an objective standard to for quality and value."

             "Why We Must Combat Money Laundering
            </p>
            <p>
             People who commit crimes need to disguise the origin of their criminal money so that they can use it more easily. This fact is the basis for all money laundering, whether that of the drug trafficker, organized criminal, terrorist, arms trafficker, blackmailer, or credit card swindler. Money laundering generally involves a series of multiple transactions used to disguise the source of financial assets so that those assets may be used without compromising the criminals who are seeking to use the funds. Through money laundering, the criminal tries to transform the monetary proceeds derived from illicit activities into funds with an apparently legal source.
            </p>
            <p>
             Money laundering has devastating social consequences and is a threat to national security because it provides the fuel for drug dealers, terrorists, illegal arms dealers, corrupt public officials and other criminals to operate and expand their criminal enterprises. In doing so, criminals manipulate financial systems in the United States and abroad. Unchecked, money laundering can erode the integrity of a nation's financial institutions. Due to the high integration of capital markets, money laundering can also negatively affect national and global interest rates as launderers reinvest funds where their schemes are less likely to be detected, rather than where rates of return are higher because of sound economic principles. Organized financial crime is assuming an increasingly significant role in money laundering that threatens the safety and security of peoples, states and democratic institutions. Moreover, our ability to conduct foreign policy and to promote our economic security and prosperity is hindered by these threats to our democratic and free-market partners."

             CASH AND EMERALDS FOUND IN SECRET BASEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!

            <p>
             "RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - Brazil’s state police say they have found a suitcase full of cash and emeralds hidden in the home of a faith healer accused of sexual abuse by hundreds of women.
The suitcase was discovered at the home of Joao Teixeira de Faria on Friday in a basement accessed by a trap door in a closet. Police in the central state of Goias said they also found about $300,000 worth of Brazilian reals. They had yet to appraise the emeralds."

             The raid on John of God turned up emeralds. Bogota, Columbia area has most of the world's emeralds and Bogota is a big center for emerald sales. Were these emerald mines? Diamonds (and potentially emeralds) are used instead of cash for international money moving.

Setting is the emerald mines near Bogota.

                 Zemeckis later stated that the success of Romancing the Stone allowed him to make Back to the Future, which was an even larger success.

                 Yes. A "romantic comedy."  It did have some great lines. $5 on iTunes
Someone I know who grew up in South America said it was actually filmed in Mexico. Lots of references to the drug cartels operating in Colombia at the time. The purpose was to make Colombia look bad and keep tourists away from there. I wonder if they were flying to Mena, Ark. back then?
                </p>

                 "It all started in 1984 when Congress cut off funding for the Nicaraguan resistance. CIA station chief in Costa Rica, Joe Fernandez, sent a confidential message to the FDN (Nicaraguan Democratic Force), authorizing them to seek "alternative funds". They were told that they would have no interference from authorities if they tried to enter the U.S. by air or sea. The alternative funds would be in the form of drugs for weapons.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Key operatives in Iran-Contra were George Bush, Oliver North, Dewey Clarridge, John Pointdexter and Caspar Weinberger. The entire operation however, would have to have bi-partisan efforts. This would require the cooperation of former CIA operative and then Governor, Bill Clinton.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Cocaine was obtained from Colombia and moved to Panama where it was protected by Panamanian defense forces. Next, drugs were moved through Costa Rica, where the shipments were personally guarded by the Minister of Public Security. The final destination was U.S. territory. The flights were handled by the FBI and CIA and met no resistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The major traffic point was Mena, Arkansas, where the weapons production and training of Contras took place, and where shipment of guns and trained Contras originated. Planes returning from Central America would be carrying cocaine. It was easy to load drugs on the planes that returned to the U.S. after delivering weapons to the Contras. The distribution within the United States was handled by the Mafia."
