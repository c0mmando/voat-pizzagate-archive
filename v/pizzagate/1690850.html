<p>In 1993 Shepard Smith divorced his wife of six years, Virginia Donald, and moved to Miami. The couple had no children. The divorce records from the state of Florida were sealed. While working as a reporter in Miami for WSVN, he first met a man named Jeffery Epstein.</p>
<p>In 1993, he was sent by his station on assignment to Haiti to cover the political turmoil in the nation. Being held at gun point wasn’t the only thing he got involved in down there. Epstein, through his connections with the Clinton Administration, introduced him officials in Haiti who could help him obtain young men. He can be placed in Haiti during the time by news footage.</p>

<p>In 2011, shortly after Giovanni Graziano joined Fox News as a production assistant, the 50+ year old Shepard Smith became romantically involved with his then 24 year old direct subordinate. This was reported in tabloids.</p>
<p>In 2012, Graziano was promoted to associate producer at Fox Business. He has not been promoted since. Other associate producers at Fox News had more experience when they were promoted to Associate Producer. Matt Schiavone had two years as a production assistant and a year as an editor before being promoted. Jennings Grant was a production assistant for two years and a booker for a year before her promotion. Lauren Hans held a variety of positions for seven years before her promotion. Christina Marazza was an anchor and executive producer at a regional before her promotion. You can confirm these facts on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>In 2013, Smith physically assaulted a waitress named Katya Minskova. This was covered in tabloid publications.</p>

            Ever since I read this I have been looking at him in a different light. Thank you for posting. Yesterday, he went off on the new healthcare plan presented by the GOP and renamed it Trumpcare. He seems to be getting more unhinged everyday. The only time I ever did watch him was when there was a live car chase because for some reason he gets all excited and worked up about it, lol. Thank you for opening my eyes to him, and I will keep watching the meltdown since I can't stand him.

            Shepard Smith is so clearly NOT a normal heterosexual man. And even months back when I would watch Fox news some to see what was going on with the election...I could never watch more than a minute of his show because he was always spinning things AGAINST Trump.

            Okay, what about that kid who tried to scale Trump Tower last summer?  I remember sitting in the lobby of a hotel, not really paying attention to the circus on the tv, not caring about the election nor politics in the least at the time.  How long ago that seems!  Anyway, I do remember being struck by Shepherd Smith's bitchy attitude toward Trump for some reason.  Can't remember exactly what he said but at the time it seemed way irrational, like he was talking to Trump directly. (This was before I heard that Trump supposedly usually watches Fox.) But I figured Shep was just a Never Trumper.  Then, months later, listening to George Webb one day, he made an inference to that climber kid possibly being a survivor of a brownstone operation in Bethesda!  What ever happened to that kid?  I have lots of contacts at the hospital where he was taken for a psych evaluation but I'm afraid to ask about him.  I know it's a huge stretch to link Sheppy with that kid but he was terribly agitated during that whole drama for the approximately hour and a half I watched it.  (Or is he always that pissy re: live Trump "events"?) Then all mention of the kid went "poof" afterwards.  At the very least I need to look into that climber kid...

             This is terribly suspicious, no?  Not even talking about Sheperd Smith any more.  Why has this apparently just been dropped?  Vexing, to say the least.

             Wow.  Third story to come up for "man climbs trump tower" is actually a treasure trove despite being CIA News Network:
             <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/11/us/trump-tower-climber-what-we-know/">
              http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/11/us/trump-tower-climber-what-we-know/
             </a>
             Oh look, he went to: Where?  LANGLEY High School, VA.  Hmm.  Interesting. 
Sorry mods if this has all been posted before:  Will look it up so I don't regurgitate.  But I felt I should leave this here before I completely forget about the possible connection between Sheperd Smith and Climber Boy, if only in my imagination.  Who knows?

            Yep.....all the top anchors and reporters of all the major media are dirty.  Or they wouldnt be ¨trusted¨.  This is how they are doing it.  Like Megan Kelly smooth talking pretty woman but her heart is black with ambition.....they use this lust for fame and fortune to turn them all to the dark side.

             4 or 5 years back I read a very creepy self published book by a man who's name I wish I could recall. His story was clearly of delusional thinking and unsupported persecution. It was super wild fun to read of his adventures though! But what I remember most was his insistence that all local, female news anchors were former junkies or prostitutes. He did have some stories to back it up too. I now wonder how right he may have been.

             He is TOTALLY creepy. For me...it's his eyes. The obvious eye-liner and he has long/pretty eyelashes. Kind of like Ray Liotta. Although Ray Liotta manages to pull it off.

             I MAGA agree... I couldn't quite figure what was off but It got to if he was on I switched to the other FOX.. Now I know my (sic) senses are not off after all!  Maybe repressed, roid-raged closet freak with a slice of mom's apple pie queen psycho.  Just didn't fit with the other norms that the station. Coudn't stand to watch self consumed Kelly either!  I know mean, just saying!
