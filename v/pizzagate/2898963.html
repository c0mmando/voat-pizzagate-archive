<p>29 priests and deacons have been &quot;credibly accused of sexual misconduct with a child since 1950. That\'s according to two lists released Thursday
 by the Archdiocese of Mobile.  11 of the men were directly assigned to the archdiocese. The others did work within the archdiocese</p>
<p>Archbishop Thomas Rodi says they went through files the past few weeks to search for allegations… The last time they did this was 2003, &quot;I\'ve been hearing and I\'ve been sensing among the people in the church a real desire to be assured, once again, that no one with credible accusations of misconduct are serving in the archdiocese of mobile and just this desire to please tell us the facts.&quot;</p>
<p>congregation denial</p>
<p>&quot; 
Fifty years ago, the political landscape was seen publicly as a gentlemen’s game: politicians who acted and looked the part, little rhetoric or personal attacks in the media, few publicly leaked scandals, toned-down presentations of any political affairs on tv. The 1950s and ‘60s were a quieter time in politics for the American public.&quot;</p>
<p>The other 17 priests and deacons belong to religious orders and served in the archdiocese, but weren\'t assigned to the area. Some of the accused are dead. The other 13 are listed as &quot;Prohibited from Ministry Withing Archdiocese.&quot; A press release from the archdiocese however does not say if they are allowed to ministry elsewhere, or what other punishment such as criminal charges they may have faced.  Also, some of the accusations happened within the diocese while others were outside. This is a developing story.

            A not-surprising fact: the most expensive college in Alabama is Spring Hill College, right here in Mobile. It is Jesuit Catholic.

            Born &amp; raised here in Mobile... This sickening "news" is sadly, not surprising. My father was raised Catholic, attending private Catholic schools here. I've more than once asked him if he ever heard or saw anything in that creepy or perverse vein. He did not, but recalls a priest/teacher once becoming infuriated at his classmate's attitude in class. The priest flipped the student over in his desk. My dad always gives a nervous laugh when recalling memories of a few quick-tempered priests or nuns.
Living here, you get the vibe there is still an unspoken cover-up &amp; that exposing even now-deceased perps would "tarnish" their legacies. Sick, evil, &amp; beyond dysfunctional.... I pray for love, peace, &amp; solace for all the many victims. ❤️

            The names include those of a one-time Air Force chaplain; a former director of youth ministry; men who worked at Catholic schools; and one who worked at a boys home. The church statements did not include key information, such as exactly when or where alleged misconduct happened, nor did they describe what had occurred.

            Nor did they describe what had occurred        Nope, that's always the part that riles people up and turns their stomachs
