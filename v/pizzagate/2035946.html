            Don't let the low points get you too down, or the high points carry your expectations too high. Even if it doesn't seem so, what's happening here is important, and it DOES make a difference.

            , and I'm sick and tired of it, too.  I cannot go in the near future (but I'll go this year), so I wish you the best.  I especially want to encourage you to please be very careful, even if people PM you on here.  You're one of the good guys.  I just want you to stay safe.  Please take care.

            I salute your courage and determination! 
But I'm not sure that this is a wise move. It's too early for that.
 It will accomplish little, while it will expose you to mockery, dismissal, indifference or worse.
The masses are still unaware and hostile. D.C. politicians are complicit, corrupt, dumb or blackmailed into submission.
Our stealth work investigating, organizing the resistance and spreading the word is much more important and is not finished yet. 
Don't fall for the Hollywood trope of the lonely hero overcoming myriads of obstacles, enemies and misfortunes in order to triumph over evil at the end.  It's a trap. Lonely heroes get crushed mercilessly. Our force is in numbers. 
Investigate, network and spread the word instead. To the fullest extent possible.
If you chose to expose yourself, make sure the result is worthwhile. 
Upvote for the courage nevertheless.

             Not saying would do it alone. Need everyone that can to go. I just know the system of where to go and how to present evidence in a professional way. Just suggesting the lawyers, ex-cops, ex-military, level-headed citizens could present the facts in an organized presentation. I have called all the senators and congressman involved personally and put them in notice about the Awan brothers, pedogate, etc. This was before the Awan brothers story broke. They were terrified on  the phone you could here the panic in their voice. The next step is to go in a professional well organizes way with dicuments to back it up to let them know we are serious.

              I know that if you say you are going, that it will happen.  You are a person of conviction and honor.  I have no doubt that you will achieve what you set out to do and present our case to those that represent us. Keep us informed of your plans for I am sure that if we all could we would jump in a car or on a train or bus and join you.  Thank you.
