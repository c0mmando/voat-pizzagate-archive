<p>Here we go! Our POTUS correct when he stated Skankles just doesn\'t stop. She\'s relentless and has no shame. It\'s why I have no problem believing this allegation made by Wikileaks. I mean, I would give politicians a pass on certain things, but stealing biometric information? WHY ON EARTH WOULD SKANKLES WANT BIOMETRIC INFORMATION ON ANYONE LET ALONE UN LEADERSHIP? ESPECIALLY IN 2010? Think of what is happening now? Everyone is trying to steal our biometric information. It\'s the grand plan FB was caught doing in reaching out to hospitals. So this acknowledges she\'s the forerunner in collecting and surreptitiously gathering/collecting it! Is anyone in the justice department listening? And if you believe this is exaggeration on my part, the story was reported by THE GUARDIAN, a once very legitimate media outlet that used to print actual news when they had actual reporters instead of clowns:</p>

<p>US diplomats spied on UN leadership
• Diplomats ordered to gather intelligence on Ban Ki-moon
• Secret directives sent to more than 30 US embassies
• Call for DNA data, computer passwords and terrorist links</p>
<p>Washington is running a secret intelligence campaign targeted at the leadership of the United Nations, including the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon and the permanent security council representatives from China, Russia, France and the UK.</p>
<p>A classified directive which appears to blur the line between diplomacy and spying was issued to US diplomats under Hillary Clinton\'s name in July 2009, demanding forensic technical details about the communications systems used by top UN officials, including passwords and personal encryption keys used in private and commercial networks for official communications.</p>
<p>It called for detailed biometric information &quot;on key UN officials, to include undersecretaries, heads of specialised agencies and their chief advisers, top SYG [secretary general] aides, heads of peace operations and political field missions, including force commanders&quot; as well as intelligence on Ban\'s &quot;management and decision-making style and his influence on the secretariat&quot;. A parallel intelligence directive sent to diplomats in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi said biometric data included DNA, fingerprints and iris scans.</p>
<p>Washington also wanted credit card numbers, email addresses, phone, fax and pager numbers and even frequent-flyer account numbers for UN figures and &quot;biographic and biometric information on UN Security Council permanent representatives&quot;.</p>
<p>The secret &quot;national human intelligence collection directive&quot; was sent to US missions at the UN in New York, Vienna and Rome; 33 embassies and consulates, including those in London, Paris and Moscow.</p>
<p>The operation targeted at the UN appears to have involved all of Washington\'s main intelligence agencies. The CIA\'s clandestine service, the US Secret Service and the FBI were included in the &quot;reporting and collection needs&quot; cable alongside the state department under the heading &quot;collection requirements and tasking&quot;.</p>
<p>The leak of the directive is likely to spark questions about the legality of the operation and about whether state department diplomats are expected to spy. </p>

<p>Again, for people who skim over things: </p>

<p>Seriously, this raises such disturbing questions and confirms so many things. The Kenyan\'s edicts, the obsession with wiretapping, Debbie Wasserman\'s actions, the Awan\'s crazed antics, Skankles using that private server ... everything begins to make sense when we understand the origins of this policy and AGENDA. </p>
<p>THIS is the agenda. THIS. </p>
<p>They wanted control ... control of everything and everybody! Think back to the post on Patti Paule-Carres: </p>

<p>The scary thing is that they handle medical records AND adoptions. </p>

<p>Exactly! They also all lead to the point of a concerted agenda and the question of why a then Secretary of State would need biometric information on anyone. And why a sitting president would allow this to take place without his express approval.

            Congratulations.  You've discovered that the US engages in Intelligence gathering.  And that intelligence gathering can involve bio-metric information.  Is anyone surprised by this?
           </p>
           <p>
            This has nothing to do with pizzagate and it certainly does not prove your theories true.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is from CABLEGATE, the stuff that then Bradley Manning leaked.  He leaked a quarter million documents, over a quarter billion words.  One of the things that that we learned during cablegate is that all diplomatic cables are sent with the Secretary of State's name attached.  This doesn't mean the Secretary of State knows about the cable at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            In this case the cable is referenced a document that spans the entire Intelligence Community, the National HUMINT Collection Directive, which was based in the authority of a National Security Presidential Directive from 2003.  A directive like this is usually debated in the National Security Council and released under the Authority of the President.    It's way beyond the State Department.   The state department has an intelligence agency within it, INR Bureau of INtelligence and Research of the U.S. State Department.  They are considered pretty good, they got the Iraq War Intelligence correct.
           </p>
           <p>
            The cable is coming from the head of INR explaining the intelligence directives set forth by the director of national intelligence.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It's not coming from Hillary Clinton and I can think of several obvious reasons why the intelligence community would biometric info.  The most obvious is to prove someone's identity.   Let's a say an Iranian walks into our embassy in Rome and claims to have valuable secret information on a new nuclear program.   How do we know if this is true.   Well let's say that 10 years earlier we biometric information that could prove he is who he says he is.   That's pretty valuable.

            Why would the Justice Department prosecute the American Intelligence community when they are following an executive order issued by the President.....an executive order that is still in Place today?

           <p>
            You have moved passed exaggeration into fabrication.   First you didn't understand the context of the document being reported on. You then claimed it proved your claims without showing how in any way.  Thridly you claimed it was in some way related to pizzagate.
           </p>

            You can read the whole document here.  How does this prove any of the fabrications?

             Whether it's pizzagate related or not, the implications are pretty frightening to say the least. But hey, enjoy your Animal Farm. It'll be here soon enough, sheep.

               Yes, they've been floating various narratives in trying to make the idea of being tracked appealing. And even how the tracking microchip is scary. They experimented with our pets. I'm sure they'd steal pets and work up this whole paranoia about nutcases stealing dogs or cats. The panicked owners would agree for a microchip device. The media played along with planting ''feel good'' stories about pets were recovered, but we don't know the real circumstances. This gave the cabal full license to implant Fluffy with the device they hadn't yet perfected. If you read the trials, the original chips caused cancer/tumors to develop. It was their little bodies trying to form a barrier between living tissue and this foreign object ''thing'' we pet owners put in there.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the end of several years and thousands of dead pets, we now have a viable prototype that is safe for humans.

            THE ROUTINE EYE-screening of school children has been discontinued by the HSE, prompting optometrists to call for major reform for youth eye-care.
           </p>
           <p>
            Is This A Good Thing?  Could possibly someone have figured out what was behind this testing?  Idk, but for now maybe it is good.

              OOPS!  Sorry.  My eyes are still blurry eyed.  I was so hopeful too.  While they surely are all trying to reach privatization, I don't trust them one bit.  We saw the other day how they are looking for certain kids, a kind of made to order victim.  Sick.  Sick. Sick. They are already microchiping for free at schools.  What is next on the horizon?  I

                  Thanks for noticing that.  It is very confusing indeed when they call it mochip.  They do take a tooth impression of the child with saliva which is somewhat scary to me.

                 <p>
                  image-toothprintsThe dental bite impression provides an impression of the biting surface of the child’s teeth, which like fingerprints, are unique to each individual. The dental impression collects enough saliva to provide a DNA sample and a source for a scent for trained canine search and recovery teams. Together, these five measures provide a powerful and recovery tool.

                  I know they say they don't collect anything, but being that it is the Freemasons, I find it hard to believe.

                   It stands for Missouri Child Identification Program. And I didn't notice the damned freemasons were involved. Still, I don't find this to be that scary. There are too many other ways they can get our biometrics now, and I don't want us all to be afraid of shadows. Focusing on the real threats is important. Fear of everything is as bad as fear of nothing

                      This is scary.  Have you noticed all the advertising on TV about Organ Donor Registry?   It is on the news, on public announcements and on daytime talk shows.  It's getting pretty obvious what they are trying to do.  I am not a college grad and yet so many do not realize.  Just not woke.

                     Any time you go to a hospital and you give a blood or saliva or xyz sample, your dna is in that. We are often asked for fingerprints for certain jobs. I had to give them for mine. Don't forget hair sample drug testing. Hospitals aren't supposed to be collecting our dna for some kind of gov't database, but they probably are. Hell, it's just not that hard to get dna from someone. We shed hair and skin cells constantly. The key is having the tools to read the encoding and having a large database from which to search. I'd be very surprised if someone wasn't working on that database as we speak.

                      Your mind works like mine.  I don't trust them one bit.  Yes, I agree they are working on this right now.  I just saw a post that said Schneiderman held up the NXIVM investigation and also that the are doing human testing in NY.  They have been doing this garbage since Hitler and maybe before.  It Must Be Stopped.  I think it will blow up soon.  It was written up in the NY Post.

                     Carm, you should look into the PKU screenings they are now doing on all infants! It seems like a good thing on the surface, but it has made me uncomfortable not knowing what they ultimately do with the blood sample they take. Low and behold, there have been lawsuits by parents because of the way those samples were used and kept. Pretty scary when you think about what info on every new human they have access to!

             Well, one reason would be that it's the coming trend in accessing high-level information. So iris scans, blood typing, etc. may be important in the future since they are supposed to be unique. The other reasons are sketchier to prove and raise serious consideration as to what the hell is going on with this push to get everyone DNA/tissue-typed. Companies helping pave the way was even mentioned by Q in one of his posts. I believe one was 23 and me. Notice how they get sheep to turn over private and intimately personal info with the suggestion that ''you'll discover your history!'' Wow, won't that be fun! Meanwhile, you're giving up what other Americans have fought to keep private.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here are some guesses:
            </p>
            <ol>
             <li>
              Gaining a politician's DNA might help in future blackmail scenarios in a few ways. If they had a private databank that the police didn't have, they could prove charges like rape,etc., that they could then threaten to turn over to authorities.
             </li>
             <li>
              It could set up blackmail/extortion in the future for purely health reason. Say that high-ranking member of the UN were to fall ill to heart disease or kidney disease. Since the info was there, they could match up a perfect match for a transplant. One of the other allegations that's been running through pizzagate, is an organ harvesting operation so this would be in line with what has been speculated.
             </li>
             <li>
              It could be that they're looking for their ''brethren'' and ''enemies of their brethren''. If there is something to the cabal originating or having a common ancestry, it might be traced in genetics.
             </li>
             <li>
              There's another reason that I've sort of kept hidden because it's ''out there''. No, nothing about space aliens, but a reason found in history. I'd need to collect my thoughts and have some kind of evidence of when an extermination of one very important bloodline was ordered and carried out. Yes, it is historical and don't know if the purge is back on or that it ever went out of style.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             But I'll stick with the rational approach. I believe the genetic information was a way of separating and categorizing the sheep. They could divvy us up into worker bees, unwilling organ donors, sacrifices, human trafficking candidates, etc. Maybe we'd even be put in multiple categories. Remember that other post where that cartel was sacrificing and organ harvesting children with special characteristics? This would make it easy.
            </p>
            <p>
             And think about it. The trainwreck called Obamacare was all about making our biometric info accessible to politicians. Now why the hell would they need to know?

               Yes! I was thinking the same thing upon contemplation.

               Think of an epidemic that's pinpointed to eliminating a certain segment of the population. The herd needs to be culled, but this will make sure the targeted segment is done away with. Conversely, they could ensure a segment was immune to a man-made epidemic. Only the elites and a willing slave population would survive.

              Another possibility it that they identified the pedo gene, or propensity to be a pedophile (making it a physical vs psychological condition).  Finding a diplomat who has that propensity, makes hem much more susceptible to target an individual.  Compromise and control.

               There might be genetic markers for all sorts of things.If there are, they could also induce behavior -- or eradicate it. Mind control might not be enough for them. Just one injection might be able to make you different.

               And we're leaving out cloning. What if these people want to replicate a certain type for specific purposes. I believe Kanye West hinted at that in his new video. I haven't seen it, but I saw some tweets speculating on its meaning.

                Podesta and Bennington.  Rosenstein and Himmler.  HItler's mother and Merkel.  Where do you think the idea for
                <em>
                 The Boys From Brazil
                </em>
                came from?  The Nazis did a lot of groundbreaking research which could only be done to humans.  I don't agree with it, but their knowledge advanced science and medicine significantly.  I think cloning is for the elite of the elite.

                 No doubt. The technology is theirs for a reason. And, yes, we don't really know what they had. Or what they'll do with it. Maybe it's an elite ''toy''. Everyone could have their own Marilyn Monroe or Sharon Tate or whoever to ritually abuse and keep in a dungeon on an island somewhere ... hmmmm ...

                  And speaking of technology, if you'd like a smile, think of this:  The Cabal knows intimately what our technical signals intelligence (SIGINT) capabilities are.  They used them to target enemies of the state.  Now those collection platforms - plus new ones going into orbit since Trump took office - are turned on them.  They have no way to communicate easily.  They know everything is being sniffed.  They are paranoid as hell by now and know what is about to come.  OR may already be happening behind the scenes. It all depends on who holds the keys to the Machine.

                   Yes, they wouldn't have any idea that the emails would be released and that the emails would contain the channels they went through. They did have hidden accounts, but those are slowly being leaked ... perhaps purposely slow? So in case they were used, oopsy-doopsy Gitmo!

                   Yup, they'd have to set up a whole new network. Maybe cutting off Assange is them acting out and showing him what it's like not being able to communicate.

                  I'd like to think that the world will know about these crimes.  I don't think it would surprise anyone.  Even the sheep.  I still wonder if Pizzagate will ever be disclosed.  Ironic, considering we were the ones ahead of the curve which ultimately led to the exposure of staggering corruption.  The level of treason alone is enough to convict and execute.  The Rosenburgs were executed for 1/1000th of what the last administration is guilty of.  Yes, guilty.  My dog could try the case and win based on the mountain of evidence.  Quick trial. Swift justice.

                   I would pay to see that. And I trust your dog.

                   I'm still waiting for The Kenyan pics and Skankles 5:5 video. Have my barf bag ready because I know I'm gonna need it.

                   Don't know if you're on Twitter, but if you do have an account, take a peek at John Cusack's account. I had to laugh when I saw what they're posting. Seems they're using the same accusations against Giuliani, our POTUS to counter what The Kenyan, Skankles, and the rest of the fun cabal have done. So Giiuliani they're calling a racist vampire that eats children's organs. And they're alleging our POTUS conspired with an Israeli intelligence group to get incriminating evidence on the individuals involved in the Iran deal. They're saying that's the EXACT SAME THING -- IDENTICAL -- to the fake dossier Killary paid for to trash Trump, create a false narrative, that was used as a basis for The Kenyan to wiretap Trump Towers, and that has launched a witch hunt headed by an hysterical, out-of-control Mueller. So their logic is that you'd have to arrest both of them or excuse both because they're IDENTICAL -- not --- well, maybe in a snowflake's head.

                    Cusack is a nutjob.  He's also way more vocal than most.  Vociferously anti-Trump.  It's a shame, one of my favorite movies is Gross Point Blank.  I wonder where the idea for that movie came from...
