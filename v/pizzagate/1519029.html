            One day I put who likes cheese pizza in my search engine just to see what would come up. First couple of pages were just articles or whatever about actual pizza. On the third page, I click on one. It didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary and up comes a page that has hard core cp. Very graphic, violent  titles. Thank god no images came up. You had to click the link. It scared me. I know my hands were shaking.  I've certainly read all the warnings here about being very careful, not looking at pics.  I couldn't get off of that page fast enough. I only read 1 title and was shocked.  It's definitely out there and it didn't take me long to run across something horrific from searching about cheese pizza...

            In the past couple of weeks I've read everything from 
1. pica (pronounced pees-a) are the female sex organs of a small child in another language (Italian slang? not sure)
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              Children love pizza, boys will always want to hang around anyone that offers them pizza, go to a pizza parlor, etc
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Pizza parlors are fronts for illegal activity like trafficking children
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Refers to sexuality combined with cannibalism - eating the "pizza" is consuming in every way the young victim.  Hard to write that, but apparently sexual cannibalism is increasingly found and identified these days.  Consuming blood or body parts of vicitims may be related to some satanic practices or sects that also practice pedophilia and blood sacrifice.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              It all probably started with the CP child porn appelation refered to as "cheese pizza"
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Subcultures use languages that flourish with necessity and use, mostly on the down-low.  you will probably not be able to find a definitive "Pedophile's Dictionary".  Hope not anyway.

            I think part of it is about shaming young girls about their sex organs. How demeaning can you get? It says something that these people supposedly hold up the vulva as the most holy of holy. No pun intended.

              Pizza comes in many flavors/themes with many variations in toppings(sometimes with cultural/national/country-of-origin references), these seemingly innocuous words, can be strung together into a complex sublminial message, indicating things like preference of gender/age/nationality/ethnicity/religion, quantity/quality of participants, etc.

             What I find strange is a pizza place taking about cheese pizza at all. I get made fun of liking plain cheese pizza, it's rarely on the menu and most places like comet ping pong specialize in pizza with toppings

              It's certainly not the most popular type of pizza, it's not abnormal or strange though...
             </p>
             <p>
              I mean, the association between "CP" and Child Porn/Cheese Pizza is loose at best when viewed by itself, but, in context with 'everything else', a pattern begins to emerge where pizza(among other foods) is used in conversation to conceal sensitive communications( it also seems apparent, beyond reasonable doubt, that the communications pertain to child and/or drug use/abuse/trafficking ).
             </p>
             <p>
              In the end, I would personally advise to not to get hung up on "pizza" or pizzerias, unless something undenibaly actionable comes about, which police et al, then refuse to act upon.

              There is more than enough being dug up and linked to pizzagate, as a result of the initial focus surrounding CPP, for us to now shift the focus to a picture that is bigger than just pizza and CPP - this doesn't mean we need to rebrand though, "pizzagate" is well recognized by investigators, deniers and the neutral/ambivalent alike - to change it now would essentially weaken our resolve, it comes across as if we have something to hide, as if we lack confidence in our underlying mission and it's supporting material.)

            The only claim I've heard referenced is Cheese Pizza = CP = Child Porn. I can look it up on urban dictionary and confirm to my satisfaction that it has been used as a code for that. I haven't been shown an email from Wikileaks where cheese pizza is referenced though. I've seen meanings attributed to other code-words from the emails, but I haven't seen a source where I can confirm their meaning.
           </p>

            It's fairly obvious in some cases that they aren't really talking about pizza, but for all I know they may be talking about drugs, money-laundering or something totally different.

            Yeah, we should come up with something else. After all, the controlled media have invested so much effort in defaming #Pizzagate - Yet, by simply using a better name we will slip the punch.

             All this big media effort invested in defaming "Pizzagate" is all-the-more reason the Pizzagate investigation should NOT rebrand. JUST today, I heard another "conservative" pundit (subbing for Glenn Beck today) spend a valuable 30-or-so $econds of sponsor buck$, outright slamming "Pizzagate," with the typical disinformation LIE that Pizzagate is all about HRC personally running a CP ring out of CPP's basement. Such bullshit coming from conservative talk radio... Megyn Kelly's epic fail JA interview... this fake news about "fake news" made my ears bleed. BUT, at the same time, at least millions of listeners are STILL hearing about "Pizzagate" today. That's good, and until the day comes (and it will) when daylight finally shines on these child-trading monsters, Pizzagate must stick to it's roots of the Wikileaks Podesta emails, and carry on. May God bless and keep you dedicated citizen researchers, and citizen marketers, working for the cause of saving infants, children, and young adults, from being used as commodities, by untouchable elitists in government, and in the movie, television, music, and art industry. So much has been learned and ARCHIVED here. You people are heroes. I see subscriptions at this website have finally surpassed 9500. That's better than a few days ago. Never give up this fight. #Pizzagate = hope for missing, abducted, and abused children all over the world. They finally have a chance, thanks to you Pizzagate relentless and pro researchers. Congratulations on your MSM fame/infamy, You've made the mainstream, pro journalists irrelevant.
