<p>This is the second time i upload this post so i will appreciate if you dont delete it. There are many posts in this forum which do not oblige your rules and are not being deleted. I ask for the same treatment. Thank you. This relates to Pizzagate because i believe they are using this technique for everything Pizzarelated feeding us with information we already have and is ready available to keep us going in circles without progressing or deepening our research.</p>

            How does the devil deceive?  He mixes truths in with his lies in order for you to believe him.  I don't buy the whole Mueller aspect from Anon Q.  He is somebody that knows the inside, but I don't know who's side he is on.  Until we see who's actually named in those sealed indictments, we aren't going to find out.

            Well the anons know that it's not just the patriotic public citizens that are going to read. It's many intelligence sources, many criminals, etc as well. They are using the public as political leverage, something that is rather new to modern times. Sort of "if you don't do as we say, we'll tell the truth to the public". It separates the bad guys from the really bad guys. The smart bad guys will comply and turn on their buddies.
           </p>
           <p>
            At least that's my (optimistic) view. It could also be they intend to do bad things with this leverage.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree we should be responsible and keep our emotions out of it. Getting excited over "Happening..." is not helpful, it can only blind us to the truth. I'll get excited when something good has "happened". Until then, keep researching diligently, be alert, and trust no one.

            I agree that we should be skeptical about anon info. Keep in mind scepticism is not cynicism. Scepticism keeps an open mind; a cynic has a closed mind.   I often wonder about little Caris and where she is. She was clearly being neglected and abused.

            i can say from personal experience in dealing with these assholes, that yes, Angela you are correct. this is how they operate, how they think: build up - then the let down, confuscation, smoke and mirrors, inducing confusion, deception, riddles without answers, creating uncertainty in the targets (us), leading you down the garden path &amp; ultimately wasting a whole lot of your very precious time. it's what they do. so if i'm proved wrong - so be it, i will stand corrected. but the Q posts triggered something in me -  ain't pickin' up what yer layin' down Qster!

            I respect your opinion OP, however I believe that all leads should be followed. Yes, throughout this year we may have been led down rabbit holes, however I believe we always revealed new information along the way. All our discoveries led to more and more, all building on each other.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is a larp, so be it, and it'll go down as the greatest larp in history. In the process however, we will have discovered a lot more connections, connecting many of the subjects we've all been researching here this past year. That's a great thing imo.
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems that you are basing your bias on one fact, that 'Alice in Wonderland' is mind control, and so we must assume that this is all mind control
            <em>
             against
            </em>
            us. What if, Q is alluding to the same thing, and he is attempting to let us know that all the Cabal have all been mind controlled, or it is how they control others?
           </p>
           <p>
            I really admire you, as I do all investigators and researchers. Everything we find helps someone else's research and helps the whole. I wouldn't tell anyone to stop investigating any subject, we are all free to choose.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just now, because of Q, we are looking at past PG threads and all that was discovered previously regards Saudi funding of the Cabal, the US gov, foundations, Media, human trafficking and slavery. All our PG subjects pulled together. This can only be a good thing imo.

            IF it is disinfo, then perhaps we should take a close look at what else is going on? perhaps the saudi arabia happenings are what this was meant to distract us from.

           <p>
            If it is disinfo, perhaps its goals were to demoralize us? IF so, then it is a dumb goal, that will fail. Anyone that is demoralized is a nigger faggot and should go back to their safe spaces.

            Chances are that this was a larper who just happened to be better attuned to the goings on and decided to fuck with us. It just happens that there WAS a major antifa event(the church), and there is a happening in Saudi Arabia. People are too caught up with the whole Kek chaos god nonsense that they will buy into anything.

             <p>
              The problem with you kids is that you are not looking at this properly. You assume that q annon is either a larper or a leaker.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, here is a possibility that none of you weak little beta spergs considered: what if q annon is setting up the stage so that the leaker can leak
              <em>
               safely
              </em>
              ? The bad parties say "larp" then the real information gets safely dropped in the thread.
             </p>
             <p>
              No one is considering this. They are too busy being obsessed with q annon, that they are not going over all the posts.

               here's a news flash for you - you don't have to be "invested in this bullshit" for it to be life or death! you think the people at the top of that shit heap don't know that you're here?? you are delusional. you need to step away from this issue because you seem painful unaware of the consequences of even just coming to this website. there are people here that know what i'm saying is true. i am NOT a "kid," i am an adult, and i am fully aware of the risks here. i don't know what a "beta" is, nor do i give a shit. nor am i obsessed with Q. all i know is those posts on 4chan triggered me. i would LOVE to believe that what he says is going down, IS going down, but as for now i am understandably skeptical.

                TL/DR: The Internet is so out of control, that TPB can no longer verify who is hacking who. They have lost complete control now. they just now figured it out, but it is wayyyyyyy to late, and new powers are dethroning them to take their place. Don't believe me? then read about peter thiel, the man who fucking created prism.

                 look, you're preaching to the choir here. i've had direct dealings with these people, so i've spent the last TEN years researching. so stop acting so superior, that just doesn't fly with me. i don't know everything - nobody does. but i'm a target, so i have a vested interest in finding out what's going on. i'm cynical, but i will tell you one thing i do know:  there's more than one power at work here. spiritual power. so i have to hold out hope, even when things look impossible. doubt if i'm alone.

            Did you stop to think that if an Insider came out and revealed everything they are doing and that is happening within the white-hat community then the cabal would also know that by reading the posts, then gain an upper hand on all that is occurring?? Why would you think that an insider must tell us every detail of the goings on? Do you want them to reveal the whole plan of the take down so the cabal can just read online what is happening then obstruct/change/fuck up their whole operation? Seriously, have a good think about it, we will NEVER be told the full details if ANY true details about the official take down that would just be plain stupid! They may as well send the Cabal a letter saying ok guys this is what our plan is and how we are going to take you down, please read it carefully so you can be well prepared and in comfortable clothing for your arrests!! Not hard to see...

            I agree with you very much. I also believe a lot of these people are not some kind of "opposition", rather they are either seeking attention, or they so sincerely
            <em>
             want
            </em>
            something to be true that they create some false scenario based on insufficient evidence to satisfy themselves in some way.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the truth is a lot of us want some of these things to be true, but we are wasting our time by reaching out for improbable conclusions with lack of evidence.

            For all we know, if any of this has even a shread of truth, it could just as easily be a hostile takeover of what is left of democracy.

            "Trust us, we are the good guys, follow our orders, we are on your side." as they merrily fuck everybody up and take their shit.

            If I planned to fuck you over what would I do? I would tell you that "I am the good guys, cooperate with the military and police, line up like sheep, do not resist."

            thank you for posting.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is important to understand what shadow government, or shadow—anything means;
because of the spell, conjured by the words within the common phrase, we all immediately have a different visual understanding of it.
and that makes it harder to grasp—
           </p>
           <p>
            lets shed light on what we mean
            <em>
             operationally
            </em>
            versus emotionally;
a literal shadow—
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              is controlled by the light source, not the object
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              the object defines the shadow, but does not control it
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              originates from an object being illuminated
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              does not control the illumination, or shadow-bearing object itself, but it does easily extend to other shadows, often overlapping, creating more shade in unnoticed areas
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              when illumination is overhead or directly above the object, the shadow disappears beneath the underside of the object
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              can not orient itself to a different object, but it may interact with the shadow of another object
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              every figure-head in a position of power, has multiple shadows, for many reasons, including safety
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              if something can not be illuminated with simple means, it's because it has been darkened through multiple overlaying shadows
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              if something is darkened from multiple overlaying shadows, we must look at the objects casting the shadows
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              if something is darkened from multiple overlaying shadows, we must look at the various light sources all looking at the same object
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              shadows are dependent on the time of the event and object is being illuminated
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              shadows can not exist indefinitely, and are dependent on their objects, and light sources
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              light can be adjusted to create multiple shadows
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              light can be adjusted to remove a shadow
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              distance from the light controls length of a shadow
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              object orientation determines the shape of the shadow
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              speed does not server the object, shadow, or light source
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              topography and surface determine complexity of the entire relationships of an object, shadow, and light

            Very good. Plus, this is one reason the spiral has dark occult meaning. The spiral is a symbol of confusion, which, as OP points out, is one of (((their))) methods of control. Much love and caring!

             When you play chess you know a few moves in advance if you are going to lose an important piece. He just feed us that to earn some authencity. 
The questions is, did we gain anything by knowing that? Then why did he told us?

              To give us a chance to connect the dots and bleed information out into the public regarding the "complete picture" so when the coup takes place, we have something legit to point to in an effort to calm people down. I don't want riots, I don't people going apeshit, and I don't people getting wracked with anxiety. If we can create memes and info and disperse that through the alt-right, we can quell a significant portion of that. And if victory is assured either way, why not take this measure?

                Have you read Trump's latest tweets? He didn't literally state "The storm is upon us...", but he uses some fairly choice wording, and evens hints at us to figure out what Q means.

                  That's pretty fucking fishy and fits the bill for a greenlight. Also references the "happening" meme, and uses "+++", something he's only used once before in a speech almost exactly one year ago

                  And earlier that day a known leaker mentioned this week was going to be nuts and used the same "+++". If I find the tweet again I'll link it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also the next tweet has "We will figure it all out!" Possible reference to Q's call to /pol/ to find the bigger picture.

              You can look up the CIA's KUBARK counterintelligence manuel. They use a confusion technique called "Alice In Wonderland" for interrogations.

              Interestingly, Scientology uses this technique for eliciting information.

            Seems to me that putting this information out in the form of questions and riddles is even more proof it's authentic, since a person with "real" information shouldn't be divulging classified information, but if he/she leads people through a series of deductions to the truth, that's an ingenious way around that problem.

            I can understand leaning toward it being a LARP, because it can be quite frustrating reading the threads, like WHY CAN'T HE JUST TELL US?!  Feels like being on a hook and getting pulled along.  But it's equally plausible that he is doing it this way out of necessity.  If he just straight-up tells us everything, it could be framed as RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA, and also simply releasing the info could cause a counter-reaction before they are ready to act.  Remember Sun Tzu's
            <em>
             Art of War
            </em>
            .  Trump doesn't want to broadcast his plans.  Furthermore, some facts indicate that at the very least, the person making these threads has a high security clearance.  The arrest of princes and the missile attack in Saudi Arabia is quite unusual and happens to coincide with Q-anon posts, and Saudi princes who were arrested have strong connections to the Deep State swamp (CIA, Clintons, Obama).  Q raised the issue of how Trump was treated by the new King (vs. how Obama was treated) THREE DAYS BEFORE the arrests.  The new King is a reformer and Trump has made an alliance with him.  They are taking down the Wahabbists that fund terror operations (e.g. ISIS) on behalf of CIA.  Q anon also gave coordinates yesterday that correspond to Manila, BEFORE it was announced that Air Force One will detour to Manila.  And of course he predicted the indictment of Tony Podesta, which we haven't really confirmed, but at least some potentially trustworthy sources are saying he is under a sealed indictment.  Q anon says Podesta used leverage to demand a media blackout concerning his arrest.

             trump always broadcasts his plans. the guy is the epitome of thought vomit. &amp; aren't the saudi arrests coincidental to the Q posts? as for manila, remember, "they" like to sprinkle in a little truth with their bullshit, they always do.

             Yes but most of that information would be ready available to the enemy as well. And he could just advance what he already knows to fake authencity and then flood you with mumbo jumbo to keep you busy. 
Compare his messages to the other FBI anons. He does not sound right.

             <p>
              There was only one FBI anon.  As for other "insider" anons, we don't know which ones are legit white-hats.  Also, no reason to think one insider is going to sound like another.  This is someone claiming to have the highest of the high security clearance.  They have given very plausible reasons for the semi-cryptic nature of the posts.  Again, not saying it is legit, but could be.  Probably best to keep following to some degree, but not get too carried away.  Q himself said it would all become clear, and that the point is for us to be ready to put the pieces together when info is released.

               Businesses and their CEOs are constantly worried about how to get their message out to the marketplace. That's Trump's background. Imagine having to attempt that with the entire media unanimously aligned against you, publishing outright lies?

               Maybe. Though i insist that his references to Alice &amp; Wonderland and cipher codes while at the same time talking directly to shillers is enough evidence to highly suspect this to be a LARP

            The Balfour Declaration signed after World War II was done to send the Khazars, who larp as God's chosen Jews, to their new base in Palestine/Israel. This was to be their base of operation to destabilize the middle east and strip it of its resources.
           </p>
           <p>
            This has been a multi decade operation. Saudia Arabia has been used as a proxy in this process and other false flags such as 911 and many others.
           </p>
           <p>
            People that understood this process have known that Saudia Arabia's toys would also be absorbed when the mission was completed. That time has come as the middle eastern oil fields are now under control of the western oligarchs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Saudi Aramco is the largest oil company in the world and also the largest private oil company in the world. Trump is in the process of bargaining to it's public offering to be done in the New York Stock Exchange. London wants it to enter the market at the London Stock Exchange.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just a 5% offering of the company would be worth 100 billion dollars to the stock exchange. Many multi billion dollar fortunes will be made on this deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            The wolves are fighting over slices of the pie. One faction of the Saudi family was just arrested for "corruption" and cut out of the deal. The remaining wolves will now get that share of the pie.
           </p>
           <p>
            I find it very convenient that the faction of the Saudi family that got cut out of the deal also owns floors at Mandala Bay Resort where the hoax shooting happened.
           </p>
           <p>
            My guess is that the hoax shooting at Mandalay Bay was staged so that it could be associated with this losing faction of the Saudi family as a justification to take their share of the pie. Time will tell.
           </p>
           <p>
            A couple of years ago the Saudi family was also threatened with exposure to 911 when the infamous "missing" 28 pages of 911 information were released. During this time legislation was being drafted to allow American citizens to sue Saudia Arabia. In my opinion this was extortion and blackmail against the Saudi patsies "do as we say or else."
           </p>
           <p>
            What is more likely?
           </p>
           <p>
            That D.C. decided to drain its own swamp, starting in uhhhhh, Saudia Arabia where a 2 Trillion dollar pie is being divided or that D.C. is participating in gobbling up its share of the 2 Trillion dollars?

               Balfour was ww1.  Jews are anyone who self identify as such and enjoy the privilege of citizenship rights in a Jewish ethnostate while denouncing the idea of America as a white ethnostate, which it explicitly was founded as.  You can't even identify the enemy, wtf good are you to anyone?

               There was never any way the IPO wouldn't be here!  Ever hear of the petrodollar system?? China wants to buy a direct stake and is a much better long term bet for SA, BUT JEWDI MONEY-TRICKS DONT WORK ON CHINKS!!

               Trump's in bed with everyone, check the guy who bought miramax and is bailing out Weinstein company.  "Close friend" of trump, also bought Neverland ranch.

               .
His partner in the Miramax deal (besides Qatar) ended up selling his yacht to the hotshot new prince Trump's supposedly doing this with, which is named Pegasus like all his yachts were.  This guy made his fortune through corrupt deals because his biggest investor is dianne feinsteins husband.  Now THOSE are breadcrumbs.

                 Meanwhile the only rational reason to establish obvious Ponzi schemes like social security and fractional reserve requirements on fiat money is because you don't anticipate your tribe needing to pay out in the end.

                 They hooked Europeans on welfare state and used the subsequent birthrate collapse (due to the tax hikes) to justify mass immigration.  When numbers inevitably to caused strife they knew they could drag it out a few more decades by shouting "Nazi" constantly, every Oscar night reminding us of the murderous evil of whites, every month a Trayvon...

                  Not new to me. Been on my radar for years. I simply refuse to give them the leverage they so desperately need to defend themselves with. Their larp as "jews that have a right to their beloved holy land" has been the lynch pin in their excuse for destroying the middle east. Its amazing how many people that I know who are intelligent people who hold our same values will shout me down for being antisemitic for talking badly about the "jews."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Judeo-Christianity is a mind fuck that is very potent and many good people have been brainwashed into protecting "god's chosen people who just want their holy land back."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Fuck that shit. These Khazar Mongols need to be outed as a criminal clique of savages that they truly are with claims to NOTHING.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Calling them "jewish" criminals sends them into fits of Oy Veying!!! and the goyim are sympathetically responding to it. Fuck that shit. The goyim will not win this debate on a battle waged on religious arguments which is exactly where those mongols want the battle waged.

                   Do you even understand that collective punishment has been the rule throughout history, precisely until the moment Jews began their brainwashing campaign so successful that now collective punishment is unthinkable EXCEPT for reparations from whites, 2% of whom owned slaves.  Germany's paid $80bn for a hoax massacre, directly to JEWISH individuals and orgs.  Youll notice TURKIC countries remain poor as shit: so other khazar mafia are coincidentally devoid of ethnic solidiarity likie whites now are? Damn I thot we were unique!

                    No shit sherlock. They have hidden under dozens, maybe hundreds of different names for thousands of years. For todays identification purposes I choose to strip them of their "chosen by god status" and call them what they are. Mongol Turk Khazarians.

                    Good luck getting them rounded up under one single group label in this environment of brainwashed goyim tools. Won't happen. Most of those 2% of slave owners were "jews" and they also owned the slave ships. The not so funny irony is that white people had very little to do with black slavery.

                    Of course. Those fuckers are loyal to nothing. Even though they have some turkish blood they would bomb the shit out of Turkey if they didn't want to run a pipeline from Quatar, through Turkey, and into Europe. If the turks try to fuck with that plan they will bomb them too.

                    Only reason they hate white people so much is because the white race has been the most prolific and successful nation builders in history. Consequently the white race has also been the most successful at kicking these blood suckers out their countries no less than about two hundred times over the last few centuries.

                    They chase white people all over the earth to feed on them like the parasites they are. White people are a threat because they are the only people in the country with enough resources to fight back successfully and the parasites want that threat gone.

                     Those are just Jewish fronts both explicitly and implicitly since Jews excel at nothing more than coopting other people's efforts. PG cult is all about Jews and Christian Kabbalists who support them for Jewish reasons (e.g. British Israelism followers building a Masonic lodge next to the Temple site.)

                     You're delusional, and a bitch apparently, scared of being called a Nazi even though Nazi Germany gives precisely the blueprint for success -- they were willing to buy Madgascar to lose sight of the Jews.  Yes, ALL JEWS BECAUSE OTHERWISE YOU UNNECESSARILY ALLOW A POTENTIAL FIFTH COLUMN TO OPERATE.   You claiming self policing won't work because the cabal has no Jewish solidarity but they sure donate vast amount to causes that exclusively help Jews!

                      "C" &lt; thats you. Remember when you said "the jesuits were just another religious organization diddling kids." I knew right then that you didn't have a large enough grasp of history to understand that the Jesuits/Jews/Bnai Brith created the Nazi situation. As usual you only have one thing stuck in your head because you have not learned history. You repeat exactly what they want you to repeat thus all your efforts are futile and even productive to the Talmud kid fuckers. You don't even care about the kid fucking, you just want to rant about "jews" and they love you for it.... What a good goyim.

                       Lmao.  What a fucking faggot trying to flip things 180 degrees.  Its a fact they don't want me repeating these truths and the proof is that I could be imprisoned in Europe and certainly banned here many times.

                       Hitler was the real deal, and any child could deduce that from the mere fact that his name became synonymous with evil only in the immediate aftermath based on Jewish/Soviet historiography using Hollywood Jew videographers at the camps.

                        Hitler may well have believed what he wrote in Mein Kampf because that seems like it would be hard to fake. In a game of Chess some pieces are sacrificed for the game itself. Hitler probably didn't realize that he was a Pawn in a game, but thats probably what he was. There were forces greater than him at work.

             Good to read the breadcrumbs , especially if you are correct. I believe that the powers that be have ALL their bases covered and they don't mind killing off useful idiots when they have performed their services. I agree that all the riddles are very distracting and goad researchers down the less likely path to the truth. Not good to put too much faith in anyone's word, I'm finding. This may be the goal--to confuse and demoralize ALL truth seekers

               That is why jews say "when a jew lies a jew is not really lying." The Kol Nidre is also like a promise to lie to the goyim. So if they promise to lie to the goyim, and then lie to the goyim, they didn't lie because they had already promised to lie to the goyim.

              trying to validate FBIAnnon's claims resulted in remarkable discoveries, after which it became PizzaGate and contributed in the MSM losing their credits, redpilling a lot of people and Hillary losing the presidencial election

              as someone said some days ago, they ("side Q") need us. The stark reality is so defiant with the world view of the general public that they need us to bridge that gap with hard to explain away circumstancial evidence and arguments that each of us will have to convince our friends and relatives. Critical mass is important for most people to change paradigmas.

              We as a crowd digging into any possible direction in search for more info can be very effective. A few hundred 4chan autists using their skills in OSINT yields verifiable results that can't be controlled via bureaucratic measures. Scary for the swamp! Same for spreading the word via soc. media, bypassing the MSM

              In intelligence operations, it is important to have plausible deniability. They are bound to secrecy laws, sources that have to be protected etc. Divulging more than the way it is done now might yeopardy the operation.

            You're right. Never understood why people drool over 'insider' info. These insiders knew about all this sick shit going on and didn't tell you about it. Why do you believe them now? Stop giving them power. Tell then they need to go jump off a bridge for being a part of it and then continuing to be a part of it by leaving cryptic breadcrumbs. Fuck their breadcrumbs! If they want redemption they will come clean with the truth! The truth isn't cryptic or coded!

             Exactly and if you want to really help you dont provide a riddle or a question. You give the info, plain and simple. They are also having shillers who just hype this things up like "WOW this is it!" Just like in the Shell Game scam (three cups and a ball). You have several persons (bystander) that hype it up.

              Yeah but what if asking things in the form of questions/riddles is helpful and/or necessary in some way, to help people connect the dots, and do the "digging" as you say? Leading to an answer via questioning is also a useful way to say more information with less words, because a complete answer often requires far more work, data, effort than simply asking a question. I don't truly know either way of course, am speculating.

               Neither podesta are indicted, so his hints were bollocks. This people can show a dick fucking a vagina and tell you its an allegory of truth and peace. 
Being indirect is their way, not ours. Dont overcomplicate, that is their doing.

                  Yeah, I know it's a mind control technique. It does not follow that Q is illegitimate just because you are saying this. Yeah Q could belong to NSA regarding the "highest level security clearance" thing, maybe it's a good guy. Or maybe not! Too early to say for sure that Q anon is a complete fraud. Couple more days at least til I call shenanigans. And today is 11/6, if no one is indicted, you're probably correct.

                  The argument that people like me will get "burnt out" in seeking the Truth is not a very good one imo. I never tire of seeking truth, and am sure most others here do not, either.
