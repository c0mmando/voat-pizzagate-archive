None of the facts below are new, but I\'m not aware of them being discussed in the context of Epstein potentially working for an intelligence agency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Epstein\'s house had hidden cameras. [1]</li>
<li>At least five different girls accused Epstein of sexually molesting them when they were minors, with at least one girl as young as 14. [1]</li>
<li>It\'s been said that a special prosecutor could &quot;charge a ham sandwich&quot; during a grand jury.</li>
<li>Yet Epstein\'s grand jury resulted only in a charge of pandering. [2]</li>
<li>This is despite sworn statements from 5 girls and 17 witnesses. [1]</li>
<li>This is despite voice mail evidence and evidence from trash pulls. [1]</li>
<li>This is despite sworn testimony by the girls\' &quot;handler&quot;, Haley Robson. [1]</li>
<li>This is despite confirmation from his butlers. [1]</li>
<li>And despite phone records. [1]</li>
<li>And corroborating flight records. [1]</li>
<li>Epstein was represented by Ken Starr (yes, that Ken Starr). [3]</li>
<li>Epstein got off ultimately serving only a 13 month sentence in county jail, and was allowed to leave the jail during the daytime. He took trips to New York / would regularly go into his office during this time. [4]</li>
<li>Epstein\'s history is reminiscent of Craig Spence (see: The Franklin Scandal).</li>
<li>Like Epstein, Spence was a playboy who would throw parties where powerbrokers would be in attendance. [5]</li>
<li>Spence provided his guests with young boys and girls. [5]</li>
<li>Spence\'s home was bugged and he claimed to work for the CIA. [5]</li>
<li>The above suggests that Epstein might also be intelligence agency asset.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epstein has since settled nearly 30 civil lawsuits related to sexual molestation of minors. [6][7]</li>
<li>Bill Clinton has been to Epstein\'s island over 20 times. Hillary at least 6 times. [8]</li>
<li>Donald Trump claimed never to have been to Epstein\'s home, and that he knew of Epstein only through his Mar-a-lago report. [9]</li>
<li>Trump\'s name and contact info is circled in epstein\'s &quot;little black book&quot;, indicating that Trump lied about his association with Epstein. [10]</li>
<li>Palm Beach PD felt they had probable cause to charge Epstein with 4 counts of Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor. Yet the issue ended up going before a federal grand jury. [1]</li>

            Epstein works for Israeli Mossad they always video every power player who has sex with kids it's how Mossad blackmails the power players to get what they want. Epstein was kept out of prison thanks to his Zionist attorney Alan Dershowitz and Roy Black the most powerful lawyer in Florida. They made it clear to the Justice Dept. that Epstein was way too rich and way too important to do hard time in prison. The Mossad controls every single politician in D.C. they probably have video of Trump having sex with young girls at Orgy Island or in Epstein's NYC condo. Trump used to party with Epstein in the 80's and 90's they are old friends. This is why Donald won't go after pizzagate the way we'd like him to.

            Joe Recarey is the officer who executed the affidavit. In 2013 he took a private sector position, following a 22 year career with Palm Beach PD.
            <a href="https://archive.is/awu5h">
             https://archive.is/awu5h
            </a>
            That's 8 years after the Epstein scandal so I assume his leaving is unrelated. It would be interesting to hear Recarey's take on pedogate / pizzagate. Chances are he would have been called to testify before the grand jury. He might know how to get any sealed evidence. He might also be able to clarify to what extent the special prosecutor was sandbagging the case. If Recarey felt like what happened was a miscarriage of justice he might be interested in setting the record straight.
           </p>
           <p>
            Additionally, the affidavit gives two other names that might be worth following up on by someone that isn't a total autist psychopath: Sarah Kellen, who was Epstein's assistant, and Haley Robson, who supplied Kellen with the pipeline of girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            The scary thing is that this all only pertains to Epstein's
            <em>
             personal
            </em>
            dealings in Florida! It has nothing to do with any of the activities that might go on at Orgy Island. If Epstein personally required two "massages" per day (as the affidavit says), imagine how many girls must get churned through on the island.

            Ken Starr again huh?....hmm. Not sure about connection but: early in the pizzagate stuff (ppl were still trying to figure out is james alefantis was a real name) i recall a pdf file showing a list of ppl who had written letters to a Judge in support of a convicted DC area pedophile named Christopher Klomen (google him -its messed up). This PDF listed Susan Alefantis (james' mother) as well as Ken Starr (yes, that Ken Starr). Ken Starr also investigated the Vince Foster "suicide" and as president of Baylor is catching a lot of heat for their own sexual scandal cover up....

            I think that moving a case to Federal court is a good sign it's there to finagle some kind of deal. Like Welch's case was handed over to Federal when it's a rather simple matter. If we think this was a false flag op, then it makes sense.

             Actually, I'm not sure whether it was moved to federal court or not. I don't have the legal knowledge to evaluate that. I wish also someone with the background could clarify when a grand jury gets held. In this case, we had a detective recommending charges be filed, which for most people would have been sufficient, I would think.

            Speaking of Spence.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was doing some research on the DC Call Boy RIng coverup and came across the name of Todd Blodgett. His Wiki doesn't mention him being caught in the Call Boy Scandal, but it does mention that he became an FBI informant and a hero of sorts for his informant work with the FBI.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you have a guy who purchased the services of a call boy (claims he didn't, that a friend borrowed his Amex.) and next thing you know, here he pops up working for the FBI.

             It's not uncommon for someone to be turned into an informant due to blackmail. I don't see the Spence connection though.
