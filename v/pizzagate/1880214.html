            I do but also just as a principle, until we have a true true true actual investigation we'll never know, like we can really make the case either way, like someone had it and recut it or used it or there's a full version or it's an art project using footage that was hacked and stolen, we just can't be sure but I get why you feel as you do i included it for that reason too on the post.

            Can you please show me the evidence? You keep sending me pointless links. I need actual evidence, someone showing a trail of thought or some other author for this video. Thus far, nothing you have sent has done that, so?

            I had a pic of his actual hands on the glass to, but I can not locate it again. Here is his voice. I believe you need to be familiar with Sound visualizer to crack it. I am not, I've tried. Press control U its on the bottom of the page.

                   You keep sending me links that do not relate to one another. For example:
                   <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:yxQqFFpOZ28J:textlab.io/doc/2542946/david-r.-witzling-lecturer--university-of-wisconsin">

                   </a>
                   That has no information.
THIS:
                   <a href="http://archive.is/ciNJN">
                    http://archive.is/ciNJN
                   </a>
                   is a webpage of LHOHQ, why are you showing me this? It has no name on it, or a blog and it's simply one of the known pages.
this is connected:
                   <a href="http://liberarium.appliedchaosdynamicscontrolassociation.net/author/immanuel_williams/">

                   </a>
                   but so what? this has nothing to do with discrediting the videos, it's just a blog connected to the site. why don't YOU investigate this instead of bothering me with it?

                    Because you keep "bothering" this forum with mind altering links to LHOHQ and SYNT with nothing to show for it and its already been shown that these sites are "web crawlers" which is why the worldcorp name shows up on the LHOHQ website.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Is this really to difficult to understand?

                   <p>
                    But I can understand if you are a Jew you are protecting your fellow Jew David Witzling which is behind these fucked up websites.

              I am consolidating everything I found. But here is one victim. She has clothes on but dancing provocatively.  Do you guys reconize this place or the pic of the man?

             Well you're somewhat correct. Silvergunner is an arg with real video mixed in to teach you what MK projects are about and how its affecting the youth. If you would've followed everything. This kid says he was raped in the desert. Then he splits into multiple personalities then turns into a tranny and a pediphile.
Some of the dark projects that maybe suspect are:
MKULTRA
MKNAOMI
MKCHIKWITIT
PROJECTBLUEBIRD
PROJECTMONARCH
            </p>
            <p>
             Go to youtube find the channel for Worldcorp Enterprises. They post videos there to. They have accounts spreadout on every social media network.

              If you could swap out the links to the videos with their youtube version, that would be appreciated. I won't go to Worldcorp site, and i'm not alone.

            Finally somebody here is talking about Skippy. I am obsessed about Skippy comma and I think about him all the time. I want others to talk about him also. I want people to talk about how he talks, what he says, his tone of voice, his language, why is he so mean? What do people think about his personality? Unfortunately, Skippy has many fans here on Voat.

             LHHQ has posts with the words, "World Corp Enterprises" as well as "Synt" information on it. The websites all connect together. If you click through every link you possibly can, as we have all have been trying, eventually each site links directly to the other sites.
