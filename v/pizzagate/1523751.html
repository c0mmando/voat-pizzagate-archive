            The people claiming this could have been plants trying to make the investigation look like paranoia, which seemed to be the narrative, coming out of the McMartin Pre-School Case.

            That sounds kind of out there to me....Diazinon was manafactured in Israel at that time and came in concentrated liquid form in 50 gallon barrels that were sold to pesticide manufacturing companies, who would then dilute and sell as liquid, or mixed with pecan hulls to make granules for yard distribution.
           </p>
           <p>
            The point is that I don't know how you could create fumes with the concentrated form and if it would denature due to the heat...and the amount of Diazinon in the diluted products would not be sufficient to cause poisoning leading to death in the short term.  They would have to be really playing the long game...
           </p>
           <p>
            There would have to be better ways to poison a group of people, I'm not a mass murderer so I don't know what that would be.  But I do have experience with pesticides.  Malathion would potentially be better, it is designed to be fogged and I have seen people get sick (kinda twitchy) with repeated exposure.
Brittany Murphy and her husband is a good example of how covert poisoning would look.

            Fun pesticide fact: The Pyrethrum family of pesticides is very safe because it is made from extract of Chrysanthemum flowers.

            It is far out, but then such a bizarre way of dealing with the task force would benefit those attacking it twofold. Firstly readers of the article would dismiss their claims as paranoid ramblings because how would run of the mill Satanists carry out such a manoeuvre? Well these ain't run of the mill satanists. Secondly if the task force were being poisoned, it would very likely have the effect that was intended.
