            I wouldn't take the accounts in "Cannibalism, Blood Drinking, and High-Adept Satanism" at face value.  There is a disclaimer in the book.  From Amazon review -

            " I believe it to be a fiction book, NOT real. The reason I believe it to be false is

            It left me hanging! What happened when he met with Sid?
           </p>
           <p>
            Still, very creepy. Honestly, doesn't it sound like a bizarre movie plot? (But I believe it. Truth is stranger than fiction.)

             Satanic Apotheosis apotheosis (a.poth.e.o.sis): from a Greek root word which means to make a god of, this refers to a human being attaining the status of a god Sid, a High-Adept Satanist, wanted to talk me about the possibility of working for him. He was looking for an assistant to help his practice of an ancient form of ceremonial ritual. I was a curious teenager. Assured that if I met with Sid, he would do me no harm and told that I would be paid three hundred dollars just to have a nice chat with him, the situation seemed intriguing – so I agreed. Following careful instructions, I was introduced to the driver who would take me to the meeting. I was impressed by the classic Jag he drove. Sid didn’t want me to know where he lived. As we drove to our appointment, the driver gave me a type of blindfold. It was a pair of wraparound sunglasses with the lenses painted black. Anyone in a car passing by would have thought that I was just wearing sunglasses. But once they were on, I couldn’t see a thing. The driver was very polite but not talkative. He did however offer to play music and I told him that I liked rock and roll. When the Rolling Stone’s Sympathy for the Devil began to play on the eight-track tape, I felt a chill in my spine. So I felt a little creeped out as we drove there. I wondered if I was making a mistake, but my curiosity had the best of me and I didn’t back down. I never saw the outside of the mansion because I was instructed to keep the glasses on until we were in the garage. There were several butlers there, and the garage was quite large and parked a number of luxury cars. The driver went off to wait in the kitchen, where he had been promised lunch and I was led into a hallway, where I met Sid. In spite of my apprehension, once I met him, Sid turned out to be a very non-threatening man. He apologized for the secrecy. He explained that he understood how much contempt some people have for Satanists, and that he just didn’t want to be publicly identified as one. His mansion was very beautiful and tasteful. I commented that one of his paintings was a wonderful reproduction of a Monet painting. He laughed and corrected me. None of his paintings were reproductions, of course. I noticed that all of the paintings were either landscapes or realistic portraits of him. Every room had at least several paintings of him. And there were a number of statues of him which were of different sizes and styles. There were several statues of the Buddha in the traditional meditation pose, but they all had Sid’s face. When I made that observation, he explained that his nickname Sid had come from Siddhartha, the name of the historical Buddha. As he showed me some of the rooms on the first floor of his mansion, two of his butlers followed at a respectful distance. They never spoke unless spoken to, and they never took their eyes off of Sid. When we sat down together in his spacious living room, the two butlers situated themselves at either side of the doorway and stood as still as statues. He took a cigarette from a silver box on the table, offered me one, which I took, and as we smoked, he explained to me why he wanted to have this nice little chat. He said that he had researched my bloodlines. According to him it turned out that one of my paternal ancestors was Jewish. He had converted from Judaism to Christianity primarily for business reasons. Apparently in the 1800s, if you were a horse trader in Georgia it was more profitable to be a Baptist than to be a Jew. But what had interested Sid was that this paternal ancestor of mine happened to be a verifiable descendent of a well-known Rabbi in Europe. And that Rabbi was widely believed to be a descendent of King Solomon. And Sid claimed that this genealogy was believable because of multiple ancestors of his with claims to Solomonic ancestry. So Sid explained to me, in very exacting terms, that King Solomon had lots of wives, lots of children, lots of descendants – and that I was one of them. I have to say that I could have cared less whether or not this was true, but Sid cared, and that was his interest in me. He had studied something called the Keys of Solomon. It’s a spiritual working in which you can supposedly command demons. It’s a form of ceremonial ritual involving sigils and incantations. A sigil is a type of curly cue symbol that can be drawn for the purpose of attuning one’s mind to the mind of a demon or some other spiritual entity. The Keys of Solomon is a ritual which is so exacting that one might consider it to be a form of psychic technology. However, virtually every book written about the Keys of Solomon contains at least some deliberate misinformation so that only an Adept would be able to correctly interpret the information. Sid was an expert on the Keys of Solomon. He claimed that his great wealth had largely been built on successes which came from his mastery of the Keys of Solomon. He could invoke demons, and they would psychically give him advice and perform other favors for him. At his bidding they would go forth and sabotage his business rivals. They would influence the minds of his business partners to his advantage. However, although he had tried, he had never been able to invoke Lucifer, the prince of demons, to do his bidding. Unlike some Satanists, he distinguished a difference between Lucifer and Satan. The latter being infinitely more powerful. The former being the source of enlightenment which brings you to Satan, just as Christ brings the faithful to God. I have to tell you that, as he explained all this to me, he didn’t sound like a crazy man. In fact, I found everything he said to be quite credible. And although he may have been manipulating my emotions through psychic methods, he wasn’t lying to me about anything. Sid went on to explain to me that his considerable research had indicated to him that only a descendent of King Solomon could invoke and control the demon prince, Lucifer. Although his own bloodlines were quite impressive, they didn’t include King Solomon. He said that he was looking to hire a “sorcerer’s apprentice”. He wanted someone with the proper bloodlines whom he could train to do the Keys of Solomon working, to invoke and command Lucifer. He said that he had other prospects with the proper bloodlines, but he had done an analysis of the astrological significance of my conception and birth dates and apparently my chart indicated that I was optimum for his purposes... something about my being conceived shortly before Christmas and being born under the sign of Virgo. So I was the first prospect to whom he had made this proposition. I felt flattered. He was a well-spoken and insightful man. I enjoyed talking with him. He spoke as if he knew my mind on many matters. He was aware of the fact that I had some relatives who were Satanists (although my parents were not Satanists and knew nothing about the Illuminati). Sid was aware of my childhood ritual abuse and my rejection of attempts to coerce me into joining a Satanic cult. He explained that his particular form of Satanism was not like that of my relatives and the others who had abused me as a child. He made it clear that he was opposed to any ritualistic or sexual abuse of children. He was emphatic that he personally did not believe in the use of blood rituals in his practices. He stated that he never had and never would ritualistically sacrifice an animal or a human being. He rejected the practices of cannibalism and blood drinking as being crude and beneath him. He described the sexmagick rituals which some Satanists indulge in as being ridiculous. He believed that those who included violence or sex in a Satanic ritual had an inferior understanding of Satanism. What he said put me at ease. I felt that the problems which I’d had with other Satanists were not going to crop up with him. He described Satanism being like a maze, in which there were many false paths which lead only to a dead-end, but that there was a single true path – which when taken would lead out of the maze of confusion. He was one of an elite few who knew of that true path which leads to the ultimate union with Satan. I felt at that point that he was speaking honestly and that his understanding of Satanism held great authority. I found myself hanging on his every word. He succinctly told me the story of his life. He said that as a child his Christian parents had forced him to go to Church every Sunday against his will. But while he sat there in silence, his mind would be busy. He would mentally curse God and think the most foul blasphemies. So that even at a young age, in his heart, he was already turning away from Christ and toward Satan.

                 this book is a must to understand the scope of pizzagate. The autor gives no names but gives the complete blueprint. Show full details of how they are. What they think and feel, what are their goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You should also read Trance Formation of America. There the autor gives a lot of names. There are youtube videos also.

                  Well, I want you to know that it is 3:30 a.m. and I've been up reading all night! This story is chilling! And from all I've read/researched about all this, it is "spot on" - so I know it is true. I know this story happened in the 1960s, but I find myself wanting to know what has happened to all these people now. I'm hoping that in the end he will tell the reader (me).
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Also, reading this makes me very angry and scared. Angry that no one has done anything about this whole Satanic Pedophile stuff going on! Also, scared because this story says that Satanists are upstanding people you would never suspect. Yikes!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Anyway, thanks for the story! Of course, I will hate you tomorrow when I'm dead tired from having stayed up so late reading!

                   Yes that book is disturbing but I cannot stop reading it, my gut tell me it is true. I am ending the second book right now. First book I enjoyed a lot easy to read. But the second is disturbing gross details but now I have a better insight. Now I go back when pizzagate explode and all is clear as water...I think Kerth Barker books are a must to read right now...

                   Pray to god. Ask for protection.

                    Yes, I believe every word that Kerth Barker has written! Oh, and don't worry about praying! I prayed last night for protection as I was reading! Still, I couldn't stop reading. It really is easy to read and extremely informative. Of course, today I'm dead tired (like I told you I would be). LOL! But I'm still reading.

                  Thank you! I already have done lots of research on pizza gate and realize this is not a new problem - that this has been going on for decades (probably longer). I'm on page 28 and it is riveting! Thank you for sharing it with me. I will definitely get the other book by this same author when I'm done.

                   In my opinion this comes from ancient Egypt. Pharaohs were cannibals, slavers, child abusers... They were worshipped as gods. Jews learnt from them all that wicked things and Jews expanded all this satanism everywhere. I am not saying that jews are all evil, no. But they have this evil influence in their own tradition (Talmud). Moses and then Christ fought that power. And Christ is coming again...

              From the moment I had entered his home, from an unseen stereo system, baroque music had softly played in the background. And his voice was very hypnotic. The cigarette I’d smoked seemed to have something else in it which relaxed me. From an incense burner near one of the Buddha statues, a pleasant smell flowed throughout the home. It complemented the pleasant aroma of the tobacco. As he told me this story of his personal conversion to Satanism, I felt as if I had fallen into a light trance state. He explained that by the time he had entered into college, he had come to identify himself as an atheist – although atheism never felt quite right to him. So he then took up the study of philosophy quite seriously. He had an uncle who was a high-degree Mason, and through him Sid was tutored in Freemasonry. He also studied Theosophy and the occult. He ravenously consumed everything written by the existentialists. But although his intellect was stimulated by all of this, his heart was unfulfilled. He found himself drawn to Buddhism when a believer described it as a non-theistic religion. The difference between atheism and non-theism may seem subtle, but he considered it to be important. The atheist has faith in the nonexistence of God. The non-theist considers that faith in God is irrelevant. This is because a faith in God is simply not a part of the path that leads to enlightenment. Sid was not a Buddhist, but the teachings of Buddhism came to in fluence his understanding of Satanism. Satanist though he was, Sid became drawn to the emphasis in Buddhism on compassion. He came to feel an affinity for the idea that one should feel compassion for the people in one’s life and to treat them kindly. However he felt that this desire to treat people kindly should not be motivated by a desire for reward in the afterlife, but simply to show kindness for its own sake. So Sid came to realize that non-theism and the expression of kindness in one’s personal dealings are two more steps in the true path which leads to Satan. I asked Sid if he wasn’t afraid of Hell in the afterlife because of his following of Satan. He chuckled and said that he was glad that I had brought up that issue because of the next realization which he had achieved in his studies. Then he explained to me the concept of Satanic Nirvana. To Buddhists, Nirvana is the end to the cycle of reincarnation and the final elimination of all hatred, attachment and delusion. Satanic Nirvana achieves this same goal but in a different way. For the Satanist, Nirvana is gained by achieving nonexistence. In the Book of Revelations, the concept of the second death is described. The first death is the death of the physical body. The second death takes place after God’s judgment when the Satanist’s soul is destroyed in the Lake of Fire. Sid explained that Satanic Nirvana is not eternal torture in Hell, but rather the achievement of nonbeing after death. By accepting that his eventual nonexistence in death was unavoidable, as a Satanist, Sid had come to live every day to its fullest measure. Once he had come to accept that he must enjoy his life to its fullest measure, he set about doing that. He found other people who shared a similar philosophy. For him he found this in the fellowship of Freemasonry. He was recruited by his uncle and became an enthusiastic member of a lodge. Next he dedicated his life to materialistic gain. He took the modest fortune that he had inherited from his parents, who had conveniently died in a boating accident, and used it wisely in business enterprises. His friends in his Masonic fellowship had been helpful to him in this regard. Finally, through wise investment and industrious work, he had gained a financial wealth vastly greater than other men. He waved his hand as if to indicate his extraordinary home as proof. He pointed to a nearby statue of the Buddha. He indicated the traditional long ears found on such statues. He explained that these represented a membership in the ancient caste of aristocracy which existed in India in the time of Siddhartha. Apparently all members of royalty in those days had their earlobes stretched to display their caste status. Sid explained that when peasants worship at the statue to the Buddha, they are being unconsciously programmed to worship aristocracy. Sid went on to reveal that to be an aristocrat one must have bloodlines, breeding, education, social connections and wealth. Sid had all of these. Sid pointed out that I too had the proper bloodlines, and the rest I could achieve if I sought it. So that instead of merely worshipping the Buddha, I might become one. Then he rang a small silver bell which was on the table. When his maid brought us tea and crumpets, she seemed almost reverent in her attitude toward him. She curtsied after setting down the tray, and I noticed that she expertly walked backwards out of the room, her eyes always on him. It amused him when I stood up and curtsied exactly as the maid had before sitting back down. He laughed at that in a cheerful way and spoke on in a warm voice. To explain why his servants held him in such reverence he talked about the concept of Luciferian apotheosis. The legend of Lucifer is that he rebelled against God because he desired to become as a god himself. The word apotheosis can be defined as the act of a man transcending his humanity by achieving personal godhood. This is the ultimate rejection of God’s authority. Sid explained that he considered apotheosis to be the essence of Satanism. When I seemed to struggle in comprehending this concept, he considered for a moment. Then he said that he wanted to show me something – a special room of his. He dismissed his butlers and we two went alone on an elevator, up to the top floor of his home. He led me to a wooden door with an elaborate design encompassing an inverted pentagram. From around his neck he produced a chain with a large brass key on it. He indicated that I should open the door. Inside, I found that we were in a small chapel. There were pews facing an odd type of altar. There was a wooden platform which looked like a lotus flower. Near this was a photograph of Sid dressed like the Buddha and sitting in the traditional full lotus meditation position, with his eyes closed. In the photo, the people in the pews could be seen with their hands pressed together in prayer and their heads bowed. I realized that this room in which we stood was actually a chapel where he was being worshipped as if he were a god. He explained how he had created a very small religion in which his followers worshipped him as the one true God. Through Freemasonry he had met a man who was an expert on hypnotism. This man had convinced him that certain persons were much more suggestible than others. One day Sid came up with a proposal for his Masonic brother. He wanted to know if it were possible to hypnotize people into believing that he, Sid, was actually God. The hypnotist replied that if you chose exactly the right persons, made the hypnotic commands in exactly the right ways, and then reinforced those commands on a regular basis – such a thing was possible. So Sid began to systematically create a small religion of people who were hypnotized to believe that he was God. This small religion consisted of Sid’s servants, accountants and his beautiful young trophy wife. These people actually believed that Sid had created the entire universe, and then came into the world as a man so that he could feel compassion for humanity. They understood that because of the great humility of God, this truth must be kept secret among those who were of the true faith. And so every Sunday they would gather at this private chapel. The hypnotist would place them into a trance state, giving them posthypnotic commands to believe and behave as if Sid were God. Sid would then sit on the altar, and they would worship him. I asked Sid if he believed that he was actually God. He laughed heartily at that question and replied that of course he did not. For Satanic apotheosis to take place it was not important that he believe that he was God, it was only important that other people falsely worship him as God. It was this act of rebellion against the true God which would guarantee that his soul would be destroyed in the Lake of Fire on the day of Judgment. That was the importance of apotheosis.

               But Sid went on to say that there was one final step in the path to unity with Satan. Sid believed that Satan has mastery over Lucifer and all other demons. Sid had learned to command all of the other demons – except Lucifer. With the help of someone with Solomonic bloodlines, he intended to achieve that as well. After this visit to his chapel, we began to return downstairs. As we rode the elevator down, I had to admit that I felt impressed with Sid. No matter how eccentric his beliefs were, he had more class than the other Satanists I’d met. He didn’t threaten me if I failed to keep his secrets. He didn’t demand an oath of secrecy from me. His disposition seemed authentically kind. Even his odd little religious cult didn’t seem to really hurt anyone. In those days, I wasn’t a Satanist, but I had not converted to Christianity yet. So the idea of Apotheosis didn’t offend me at that time. Before I left, he had the butlers bring my reward. They walked in carrying two silver trays. On one was the promised $ 300 in cash. I remember three pictures of ole Ben Franklin staring up at me from the tray. On the other tray were thirty silver coins, each of which Sid guaranteed had a value of morethan ten dollars. As a careless teenager, the symbolism of this was lost on me. Simple math suggested that I should take the silver coins. But I wanted to spend the money right away rather than go through the hassle of selling the coins – so I took the cash. Sid seemed disappointed in my choice. He made it clear that he didn’t want me to make any decision that day about working with him. He believed that the decision to dedicate one’s life to Solomonic magical workings had to be a well-thought-out choice, made soberly and with free will. But he told me that if I was interested in the work, I had three days to contact him through the friend of my friend. If I did not contact him, he would assume that I was not interested and he would go on to his next candidate. In such a case we would never meet again. But if I did choose to work with him, with his guidance, I could expect to easily achieve great wealth and power in the world. Our parting was amicable. As I road back with the same driver, I felt that I really might consider accepting what he offered. However, a Christian friend of mine named James made an intervention, and I never contacted Sid again.

                **James and his fight against The illuminati
**
               </p>
               <p>
                Let’s backtrack. Back in the 1970s and early 1980s, I had the opportunity to meet with some High-Adept Satanists and to learn something of their beliefs. At that time, I was naive about how dangerous and powerful they were. Eventually, a friend named James would awaken me to the threat that these High-Adept Satanists represent. When I was young, I knew a number of people who were involved in something that was known to me as the Society of Lucifer. I suppose to be accurate, I would have to say that the Society of Lucifer was not exactly the same thing as the Illuminati. The Bavarian Illuminati was created in 1776, and it is a secret society that lords over other secret societies. I don’t think that it’s all powerful and I don’t believe it has complete control over all other secret societies. But it is the most powerful of secret societies. And its name has come to be used to describe all secret societies. This is sort of how the word “Yakuza” is used to describe all organized crime in Japan. In fact the police and those who are actually in Japanese crime organizations don’t use the word Yakuza the way the public does. So somebody actually in Japanese organized crime would probably not describe himself as being in the Yakuza. The same phenomena applies to the word Illuminati. It has become common for persons who are not in a secret society to use the word Illuminati to describe all Luciferian secret societies. However, those who actually are in secret societies tend to only use the word Illuminati to describe a certain group or network of groups. So when I was young, the Satanists I knew preferred to use the phrase Society of Lucifer. The Society of Lucifer was the loose af filiation of Luciferian secret societies which existed before and after the founding of the Illuminati. The intention of the Bavarian Illuminati was to unify these secret societies into a single group with the goal of taking over the world. When I was very young, back in the 60s and 70s, not all of these secret societies had yet been absorbed into the Illuminati. And not all of these secret societies were Satanic, some were really more like a form of heretical Christianity. My friend James in the resistance grew up in such a Christian secret society. He was not Satanic at all. He was a Christian, but he was aware of the Bavarian Illuminati and considered himself to be its enemy. James was involved in helping victims of Satanic Ritual Abuse, such as myself. He also helped disillusioned Illuminati members safely leave the cult. The Illuminati doesn’t allow its members to quit, so James would help deserting Illuminati members create new identities and move to places where they wouldn’t be found. This was a kind of underground railroad for escaping Illuminati members. There was a type of resistance movement within the Illuminati back in those days, and it was more interested in reforming the Illuminati rather than in destroying it. However James believed that the Illuminati system needed to be completely deconstructed. I should make it clear what is meant by “deconstruction”. To deconstruct the Illuminati is not the same thing as destroying the institutions which make up the Illuminati, and it certainly doesn’t involve killing Illuminati members. The idea of deconstruction is to systematically and continually weaken the institutions which make up the Illuminati system. Some of these institutions are the Bilderberg Group, the Federal Reserve, the United Nations, the Trilateral Commission, NATO, the Financial District of London, Council on Foreign Relations, the IMF and other globalist groups. This would not be a violent revolution. This deconstruction would come about as the result of an information war. The public is to be so completely educated on the nature of how the Illuminati achieves its power, that it can’t be tricked or fooled anymore. So, for example, the United Nations might still exist as an institution but its powers would be greatly limited, it would have no right to a UN army and its leaders would no longer be allowed to perform child sacrifices in the Meditation Room. Deconstruction would also come about by providing appropriate therapy and deprogramming for Illuminati members, all of whom are so brainwashed that they are insane to varying degrees. Violent revolution sounds easy, but it rarely works. Deconstruction is a slow and difficult process, but it could avoid unnecessary violence. Therefore I am not a revolutionary, I am a deconstructionist. And the best way to deconstruct the global plutocracy of the Illuminati is to reconstruct democracy on a national level. The reason that some Illuminati members may cooperate with this is that in any process of deconstruction, amnesty will become possible. Those who assist in this deconstruction in important ways may be forgiven for the crimes they’ve committed. Of course, such an idea displeases those who want revenge. Those who want violent revolution often talk of revenge. But I believe that Christ was right when he spoke of the power of forgiveness. James believed that the foundation for effectively resisting the Illuminati is spiritual. He believed that this is a spiritual war first and foremost, and that it is an economic-political war secondarily. So James was always encouraging people to renounce Satan and to worship the one true God, creator of all things. Personally I don’t believe that you have to be a Christian in order to have a spiritual awakening. And in some cases, Christian indoctrination may inhibit spiritual awakening. A person may have a spiritual awakening through some type of non-religious experience. In my case, my spiritual awakening involved James who was a Christian. And Christianity is my personal path of awakening. So it was that years ago, on the day after I had met with the High-Adept Satanist named Sid, James contacted me. He had heard of my meeting with Sid through one of his many sources. James and I had known each other for a number of years before my meeting with Sid. And although at that time I didn’t really identify myself as a Christian, I did sometimes go to Christian Churches. So from time to time James had encouraged me to become more involved with Christianity. But on that particular day, James was especially concerned. James found me the day after my meeting with Sid, and we took a walk together in the woods. James asked me what I thought of Sid, and I replied that he seemed like a likable man and that although he was a Satanist, I wasn’t convinced that he was all that evil. I said that I had felt tempted by Sid’s offer to work with him. James glared at me with a shocked expression. He said that Sid was a Satanic High-Adept who had the ability to manipulate people’s minds with hypnosis and psychic influencing. James felt that Sid had psychically tampered with my mind. James asked me to pray with him. We prayed together and I felt as if a veil of delusion was lifted from me. I suddenly felt afraid. I realized that some part of me had instinctively felt afraid of Sid, but that I hadn’t consciously acknowledged this. James explained that although Sid was not the type of Satanist who used sex magick or blood rituals in his practice of ceremonial rituals, he could command demons, and these demons had the power to bring about violence in the world. James explained that Sid was known to have commanded demons to kill his Christian parents in an accident so that he could inherit their wealth. He was known to have used demonic influences and psychic manipulation to get his Masonic friends to assist in his career and business dealings. James explained how High-Adept Satanists take anything decent and twist it around to make it into something sick, and that’s what Sid had done with his twisted version of Buddhism. Although Sid was very polite and kindly in his personal dealings with people, he was actually filled with evil intentions. Not only did he let his demons do his dirty work, he was part of a group of wealthy investors who profited from the American military-industrial complex. They had used their political influence to create the war in Vietnam and to profit from it. So it turned out that Sid was not really the compassionate Buddha that he had pretended to be. James made it clear that I had been in the presence of the most dangerous and powerful Satanist I would ever be likely to meet. I had protested against the war in Vietnam. I knew that the political reasoning behind the war had been irrational. I felt badly that our nation had been torn apart by this needless war. I had known men who had served there, and heard their stories of the insane violence of the war and the corruption within the military. I also understood that many Vietnamese had needlessly suffered. That day, when I prayed to the Creator with James, I suddenly experienced a panoramic vision in which I saw the entire war in Vietnam as massive Satanic blood ritual. Bombs dropping, villages burning and bloodied children running in panic from the explosions – such images filled my mind’s eye. The blood rituals which I had seen as a child at the hands of abusive Satanists were small by comparison. Sid and his business partners were performing a Satanic blood ritual remotely and on a titanic scale. I couldn’t believe that I had ever felt kindly toward him or that I had even considered working for him.

            I read it. It offers a perspective from the satanist point of view. Pretty creepy I guess there is no way to know if it is true. What was podesta motto ? Something about better to eat than be eaten? It makes even more sense. From the perspective of the writer.

                Exactly! There is a wiki leaks email where podesta says he is wired up from being around children and he is vacationing at a location where some pioneers had been trapped and survived by eating each other. He wrote about the experience and how meaningful it was. I will try to find it. For the first time in my life I wonder is there something to these reptilian theories? What kind of people do this ? How are they in charge?? They are running the government worldwide? How ? They are schizophrenic pedo-  canibals that are controlling the world? It's like a bad dream!

                  who didn’t really understand the true nature of Satanism, but had gotten involved with it because of the financial gain it provided.

                 That means that not all satanist are pedophile cannibalistic murders, there are many societies, the most powerful but not the oldest is the illuminati. The Higher-Adept Satanist is not interested in child sacrifice. HE IS INTERESTED IN MASS MURDER, THEY CREATE WARS AS HUGE SATANIC RITUALS, that is explained in the next chapter after the quoted in pastebin. Also they are interested in psychic powers, In fact they have no real power, but they can summon demons to get the work done.

                 then cannibalism blood drinking &amp; high-adept satanism, sorry but cannot find a pdf for the second book, but you can get them both on kindle unlimited (works on pc and mac). Also a must read is Fritz Springmeier.

                  Thanks for the information. I was digging through wiki leaks and finding that email is a little difficult. I will follow up on this. And see what I can find. It might air me a little while.

            I just could not make my way through this.  The writing is too matter of fact for me.  Too blase.  Maybe some will comment and I will check later.
