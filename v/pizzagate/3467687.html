            Granted I have found NO evidence of children or cannibalism being involved, I wanted researchers to be aware of KINKY RABBIT CLUB, an offshoot of SNCTM Damon's once female partner, and perhaps madame.

              Hmmm Didnt think of that. I was thinking the member under alias Bunnyman who threatened to start his own club. But theres likely many meanings.

            I've had an eye on them because of their "Eyes Wide Shut" aura, private mansion venues, dark symbolism and obvious sexwork. They're definitely an elite Hollywood sex club, but have yet to find proof of minors being involved (besides story of  "member 'Bunnyman' booted out for his 'disgusting' behavior towards the founder's 12-year-old daughter"), or any direct connection to Jeffrey Epstein. Still definitely worth digging.

            Found this first announcement from Aleph, presumably of The Circle, quite interesting:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             AUGUST 13, 2019
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The Circle Ascends
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Esteemed Fellows,
            </p>
            <p>
             We would like to announce that SNCTM is entering a new, most indulgent stage. We, the participants in The Circle, are honored and humbled to follow in Damon Lawner’s footsteps and steward SNCTM onward. Some of you may know us. Many more we look forward to meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
             This society is something truly unique — this ethos of erotic freedom. We hold it dear, as Members ourselves. We believe exuberance is beauty and SNCTM is our sacred vehicle. We are the vessels these transcendent experiences flow through. Yet we are the guardians as well, and we
             <strong>
              pledge to protect our secrets with ferocity.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In the coming months we will be expanding to new cities, elevating the opulence of every Soirée, and introducing a series of mythical productions. Through our performances
             <strong>
              we will catalyze our sexuality and make the Soirées themselves works of art
             </strong>
             . Every Masquerade will be our canvas.
             <strong>
              Every pleasure-unbound our paint.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Please join us for the next stage of our journey.
             <strong>
              From Los Angeles to New York. From Moscow to Kiev. To Paris, Miami, London and beyond
             </strong>
             . We are the New Libertines.

             At the end of this particular path I step away with more than I could have dreamed when I started, more in experience....more in financial gain than I thought possible. Remember tickets to my first Sanctum events were $100, when the idea of selling a $425,000 membership was so far beyond anyone’s radar including mine it would have sounded completely absurd, but no longer. Snctm evolved into one of the world’s true luxury brands within its own genre, and still nothing comes close. Take a trip to Moscow for the Masquerade one day and you will understand the heights to which Snctm has ascended.

            Note that the article about Lawners bio, the club beginnings, as well as decriptions which are potentially advertisements for erotic parties, in the end it's all highly vetted adults talked about.  The Epstein types would likely feel out of place.  Doesn't mean that SNCTM wouldn't be a good venue to interconnect with opportunities made available via the club contacts or locations of parties.

Sitting beside him, in a matching wicker chair, a dark beauty sips Champagne. Call her Caroline. Tall and impossibly thin, with huge brown eyes, she has recently earned a degree from a college in Texas. She's visiting Lawner for a couple of weeks, seeing agencies, hoping to get into modeling.

             ! I can't quite figure out if the incident with the daughter was an indicator or not either. Fear for the life or wellbeing of his own child seems like a great reason for Damon to have a change of heart enough to give up his "utopia" SNCTM. I seem to remember reading Bunnyman claiming that Damon wasn't respecting privacy or running the operation to the standard as it should. Do you think Phuong Tran organized a hostile takeover with The Circle?

            <p>
             Is it this LA resident Phuong Tran?

              Regarding the privacy complaints, the fact that Damon exposed Phuong's membership and publicly announced he was banned for life may have been the reason for that complaint.  Or the fact that the club was having a TV series made about it and I think outsiders with cameras set up some shots etc., whatever it was, Mr. Tran didn't care for that either I don't think (standards).  Since it's a ban for life I would not be inclined to think there was a hostile take over and he claims he had left on his own, to start his own club.  However, I just found an article that tells Trans side about what the feud was and if true, it puts the whole thing in a different light I think.  Damon mentions an attempt at a hostile takeover.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Tran... told The Post he already left Snctm in November to start his own, more expensive sex club because standards had slipped so badly.
              </p>
              <p>
               “I’ve been working on my exit for at least a year out of boredom,” he said.
              </p>
              <p>
               Tran claims his feud with club founder Damon Lawner was over Snctm hiring an underage performer and one with a sexually transmitted disease — accusations Lawner strenuously denies.
              </p>
              <p>
               “The allegations that Phuong are making are so ridiculous that defending them is beneath me,” Lawner told The Post.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lawner says he was quietly trying to shoo Tran out because he’d become a “tyrant” who was trying to take over the business. But when the fetishist contacted his daughter, he decided to go with a public shaming instead.
              </p>
              <p>
               “He’s been an insane tyrant for months. When he direct messaged my 12 year old daughter trying to hurt me because he wasn’t able to, that was the final straw,” he said.
              </p>
              <p>
               Tran says his new club is more “elite” and more expensive than Snctm.
              </p>
              <p>
               “It’s what Snctm should’ve been,” he said. “Ninety percent of Snctm guests won’t make it, even if they applied.”

              Snctm has an inner circle of 3 people btw (I forget their special title), who pay a million dollars or something like that.  Maybe they are part of the new ownership.  Also the club involves erotic theater, with paid performers and elaborate SM themed performances.  On the Yelp page for Beverly Hills location there are some reviews and pics.  Maybe that's part of the standards going down in Phuong Tran's mind.

                These are the thoughts that came to me.
               </p>
               <p>
                So if the accusation is true and Damon Lawner denies it, Tran, in retaliation and to make a point, contacts Lawner's daughter (as in, "how would you like if your daughter..." type of thing).  Tran gets publicly shamed and a lifetime ban from the club.  Unfortunately, what he actually said or posted to Lawner's daughter is unknown.  Also, was it the idea of a minor getting in a bigger issue for him than the idea of a minor with an STD?  How would he know she had an STD if she was just a performer? (I read some of the performers 'simulate sex').
               </p>
               <p>
                If Lawner's side of the story is correct (the accusation is not true).  Perhaps Tran was instead intending  to sabotage for the purposes of starting his own business, the hostile takeover would be takeover of the market for such a club. By making accusations it would hurt the business and make people nervous about staying on as members if an investigation ever ensued.
               </p>
               <p>
                And this: if it's true that an underage performer was simulating sex (setting aside the STD issue for the moment), but not engaging in sex, that would be telling of certain members who would want to see that.  Maybe that's some of the more private and more expensive shows for the inner crowd.  What a creepfest. (thinking of the pictures on yelp with the guy in rubber boots with the rubber apron with a moloch style headdress).  Clubs like this explain the sudden appearance of gratuitous fetish BS on otherwise good TV shows.  Grooming the general public for potential business of some sort or another.

            This is an interesting event, more so if related to the Epstein fiasco. On this point I want to say something about Jeffery Epstein. Honestly, I don't hate the guy. He's definitely dislikeable for numerous reasons. But the evidence isn't that he raped, beat, killed or ate young children. He and Weinstein are in the same camp in that regard. Jimmy Saville and Marc Dutroux are the true monsters. And Saville would stay with the British royal family on Xmas eve. THAT'S a thread that needs continuing investigation.

              Oh, I get it. Clever! So the Jew who was a double agent and paid underage girls for sexy massages should get a stiffer sentence than the gentile who tortured and ate adolescent girls? Can you see what my point was?
