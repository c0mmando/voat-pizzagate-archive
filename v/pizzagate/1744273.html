            Something I think that gets overshadowed in this story: We're supposed to believe that this 'mad man' was so convinced about PG that he drove for hours to go to CPP, but when he couldn't immediately find any evidence he just completely changed his mind?

            This should be pretty difficult to accept for anyone with even a modest understanding of cognitive dissonance.
