<p>Not entirely sure if this ends up being good or bad for the investigation, being the whole actor part and everything... could be him taking one for the team by going to jail and later prison.

            Something I think that gets overshadowed in this story: We're supposed to believe that this 'mad man' was so convinced about PG that he drove for hours to go to CPP, but when he couldn't immediately find any evidence he just completely changed his mind?
