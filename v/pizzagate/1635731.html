<p>&quot;Dear Tony, How are you? it has been a long time since we we left Nose 49 years ago! Tonight I was invited to the dinner offered by UN Foundadtion in honor of John.  I met John for the first time and explained to him we enjoyed our camping in Nose, Osaka.  I wish you all the best and hope to see you in the near future.  I attach hereto some of my recent articles.&quot;</p>
<p>There are probably more connections but I am a dunce with tech and internet. Hope this helps make connections and identify more bad guys!</p>',

            not sure if this was addressed (where the fuck did the search bar go??) but Camp Nose is in Osaka, which just so happens to be the very same place they made the arrest of the pedo who worked at unnamed children's camps, according to

             No way!!!! Thank you for sharing that! This makes it even more exciting. Seems like trump is really breaking up their rings. I just posted a link to video another user shared regarding the deep state and how they are funded and it seems they really depend on drug trafficking to fund their operations. I bet that executive order that focuses on drug trafficking and human trafficking is cutting off their funds!!! Thank you for sharing this!

             The media are not just pedo protectors I have come to believe they are pedos and involved as well. It's just my opinion, i know, but their behavior is obvious. If you notice they Have avoided the discussion of  the facts or  dealt with our questions about photos or connections. From what I have seen, they seem desperate to discredit this investigation with their fake new label. It reminds me of when someone is caught cheating and they just deny it until they are blue in the face despite all the evidence to the contrary. I gave them the benefit of the doubt waiting until the new administration took over but now it is clear they are discrediting this.  This another interesting point, Private investigators advise people suspecting infidelity to Trust their  intuition because it's almost always right. Based on the medias behavior my intuitionn tells me something is deeply wrong. I think they too are directly involved and have a strong motivation to bury this investigation. They have not dealt with facts and responded to our questions, they just deny, deny, deny. They have been caught and  They are desperate to suppress this.

            This is a really great post OP.  Very interesting how you connected the dots between the bust in Japan and state visit to Trump of Japan PM.  The inference could be drawn, that the Japanese PM is saying to Trump "To show goodwill, we will show we are serious too about your human trafficking/pedo ring busting initiative."
           </p>
           <p>
            But the connection ot Podesta/Hastert with this boys camp, wow.   Turns out these pedos run in fairly small circles it seems.

             You pretty much summed it all up perfectly. I think if you watch The press conference that same sense of "goodwill" You refer to is evident. When I read the the executive order it is becoming clear that he is taking this global network down! It's very exciting. First paragraph: its obvious.

            I'ma jumping in a speculating like Trump for a sec. He got into office, even before Inauguration he was on the phone with these leaders, saying what? Do we know, I spy a glimmer into the calls - he's saying, to get this global financial meltdown under control we are going to have to get control of the banks. What have the banks been doing to control Congress, in order to get all our money from them, creating compromising scenarios in order to threaten them with exposure. So he's going in with a plan, tells these leaders what it is and asks them to join him to make it global. Because who does it ultimately threaten? It threatens the controllers who have been using it to control others. I don't know, it seems like that'd be a Trump style to smoke 'em out. Get them on the run. Expose themselves, pardon the pun. Look at the 9th Circuit Court. It's getting torched now that its outed. All the bad press, all the bad raps, just confirms for him who's the most scared, most hurt by the theme law and order. Now let me find a link to back this theory up. oh, there isn't one, he doesn't like to telegraph his strategy. But his style is to keep others off balance. Let's go with the I bet he's going to help the farmers of Afghanistan get back to growing food not poppies theory -

            . Theory, the people crucifying him in the press are pretty much using fiat currency, you know the fake money that we the people get to make real by paying it back. That's stupid. Trump knows it and if he can shut down the shadow governments resource of dark money. Let the light shine because the rats will flee. Thanks for letting me work through that. Great post.

            It's not really that big of a coincidence. You argue against yourself. If there are so many busts going down, which there have been, then the likelihood of the President being in a country where a bust happens at the same time goes up. That makes it more likely to be coincidental, not less.

             theswimswam link did not work :(. All of this is very interesting especially since international trafficking is a priority for trump administration. The press conference discussed security issues ( maybe cyber security too?), and business partnerships. It was definitely a must see.

              it should work. I have to say though, I have a headache from trying to decipher anything. The last video I actually caught anything from I thought it was trying to say that Bill was actually named William Berry. I wish they'd just release whatever the hell it is so the guessing can stop.

                 Unbeleivable, I could not find the video last night but will try again. I believe that I had read something along those lines, back when his alleged son Daney Williams  was getting some attention during the election.

            This is where I stand as well.  The fact that many people don't even know (or care) what the long results / consequences are is even more reason to scrap this shit system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edited to add:  they won't let global diplomatic immunity,  monarchy or CIA-corporate politico system dismantle so that's a problem right there.

            I could not agree more! If we can't exterminate these pedofile scumbags then time to scrap the whole system and start fresh. It's too evil and pervasive.

            Not sure if it's related or not but DJT will also be spending the weekend with the Japanese PM at Mar a Lago. That's a lot of time together. Same timeframe that Wikileaks is supposed to be dropping something. From what I can recall Japan doesn't show up in pay to play schemes we've heard about. So it's possible they're an unexpected ally in what's been going on.

             I'd be so surprised if they were an ally or just trying to find a way to appease pgate connections that might potentially lead to Japan via Camp Nose  hastert shit and potential podesta connections.... There's a difference.

             Japan is one of the most bizarre sexual buffets of all kinds of crap the sex imagination can think of.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not entirely sure they'd care about rescuing the little boys any more than the western government has cared...and more like it's timing for their meeting to appease pgaters.

              japan is more conservative and less degenerate than it looks to the outside. yeah sure theres billion and one fetishes to play through over there, but im inclined to think that that "freedom of perversion" is what keeps them sane. also if japs come clean on this and the chinks dont, its a yuge propaganda weapon for trump against china

               It is a different culture for sure.  I didn't think about freedom of sexuality keeping them sane, but it's a possibility, although  I haven't seen that work in a healthy way long range results for any nation..... and I've been around awhile.   I am viewing from the outside so there's that.

               That could be.   Maybe the Jap pedo bust was  accidental  timing.
               <br/>
               Or, maybe it was like a little notice to Trump saying, see we're not completely debauched, we clean-up a little  once in awhile.

                Think of it this way. If you asked a place like Haiti what their impression of the U.S. is and their only experience is of people doing harm, it would make the country seem bad. So our knowledge of what has gone on in Japan re: pedos means nothing if the PM is a "friendly", which I have no idea if he is. Just saying that just bc certain activities go on with a certain part of a nation doesn't mean they're all corrupt. I'd assume PG is a small part of the overall picture.

             may not be a that big of a coincidence considering Camp Nose is in Osaka, which just so happens to be the very same place they made the arrest of the pedo who worked at unnamed children's camps, according to

             Just looked it up, i disagree. I think it's important not to assume coincidence, the timing is interesting and should filed away. I don't lightly dismiss anything. This too should not be so easily dismissed. Unless you have a solid reason dismiss. Please share. The point is to drive down to the truth. It's always better to keep an open mind to drive down to the truth.
