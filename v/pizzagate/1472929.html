            Been thinking the same, propositioning for works outside of voat can be an easy honeypot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Be wary, those who would consider helping. If you are asking for help with something, assuming you are genuine, understand that privacy is paramount and try to think of ways to preserve it, even detail your approach to privacy in the post - if your proposition/request is one which might be compromising.
           </p>

            I myself have asked for help from others, but only to the extent of collaboration right here on
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            . There have been some threads seeking help to create video/documentary presentations, this could be compromising if it involves interviews or otherwise making contact outside of voat - this is not to denounce these ideas, just pointing out that caution should indeed be exercised.
