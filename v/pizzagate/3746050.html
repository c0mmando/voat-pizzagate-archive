            Keep digging into adrenochrome.  It has many uses. We can stay away from the sensational stories in pop culture which were probably injected by the whores of the psyop units to distract from the main story.  I'll give you an example:

             Declassified MKUltra documents indicate they
             <strong>
              studied hypnosis in the early 1950s
             </strong>
             . Experimental goals included the creation of "hypnotically induced anxieties," "hypnotically increasing ability to learn and recall complex written matter," studying hypnosis and polygraph examinations, "hypnotically increasing ability to observe and recall complex arrangements of physical objects" and studying "relationship of personality to susceptibility to hypnosis."[60] They conducted experiments with drug-induced hypnosis and with anterograde and retrograde amnesia while under the influence of such drugs.
            </p>
            <p>
             The CIA exported experiments to Canada when they recruited British psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the "psychic driving" concept, which the CIA found interesting. Cameron had been hoping to correct
             <strong>
              schizophrenia
             </strong>
             by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. ..

            <p>
             During this era, Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the
             <strong>
              World Psychiatric Association
             </strong>
             as well as president of the American and Canadian psychiatric associations. Cameron was also a member of the

             medical tribunal in 1946–47.

             What's interesting/curious with the 1946 Belgian rabbit ear experiment is at the very bottom it says :
            </p>
            <p>
             "translated by US Major F J Lewy US Army medical corps". Per ancestry.com Dr. Frederick J. Lewy b 1900 d 1969 was born in Berlin, came to the US in 1934, had a medical practice on 5th Ave, NYC, went into the Medical Corps and after the war was a health lecturer who made 4 trips to Switzerland. Why was the Army Medical Corp translating adenochrome studies?

             The wealthy have access to chemicals?treatments? something that enables them to live longer than the rest of us. Kissinger is 96 and still compos mentis. Jane Fonda at 82 looks better than she did at age 73. If the source of that fountain of youth is illegal/immoral I don't think they would think twice about using it irregardless of sourcing. Injections of black sheep fetuses/livers for Debbie Harry.?
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know about black sheep but you can't go out after dark in Dayton Ohio because kids get abducted way too often.

             Switzerland has very pricey longevity treatment spas for the wealthy. La Prairie has just franchised out to Thailand via Minor Hotel Corp owned by Billionaire BIll Heinecke, US citizen but longtime Thai resident as was his parents. He wants to cater to the yacht crowd because they leave a smaller carbon print than a jet load of tourists. His father just happened to be career Marine then foreign service involved with Voice of America and USAID. In 1981 family was kicked out of Malta accused of being CIA. Heinecke also runs Golden Triangle elephant rescue camp/resort 16 mi from jumping off point for Burmese heroin/amphetamine. He has the customary philanthropic gig of donating scholarships to needy Thai children who pose unsmilingly in the pr photos.

             Adenochrome has been like you say oversensationalized perhaps for a purpose. To discount it is to discount human behaviors that have persisted for centuries. Smithsonian has a good article on corpse medicine history over the centuries. Even today with spirit cooking coexisting with rational human beings, it seems to have resurfaced in the media as a fad for the wealthy. If there have been further studies on derivatives of adenochrome that are life enhancing, I don't think it would have been published for public consumption or we'd be overpopulated by now with nonagenarians.

             @HennyPenny
            </a>
            , I've been seeing this mass child rescue idea pushed very heavily on Twitter, with little to no evidence supporting it. Everything I've seen is confirmation bias gone nuts -- including the linking of a 3M patent for adrenochrome, which when you examine the actual patent, shows it expired in 1997. I've seen pictures of patients presented as "children" because nurses were smiling at them.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem with this narrative is that it jacks people up emotionally and when the thousands of rescued children never materialize, it's going to crush people, people whose economic well-being IRL has already been decimated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rather than removing this for lack of evidence, though, I am going to leave it up with a Disinfo flair. This is not because I think you personally are pushing disinfo. You presented it skeptically, which is admirable. I believe it is important that we analyze, discuss and help others understand the nature of disinformation and how it can be used against those trying to stop the exploitation of children. For this reason, I hope you don't self delete.

             Absolutely aspects of the adrenochrome story are pushed in order to deflect from the real history of its use within the pharmaceutical industry, psychiatry and by the CIA in MK Ultra programs.  It was interesting to see 3M had a patent for adrenochrome whether it had expired or not.  And that is still debatable. The history of the company 3M is also of interest to us.

             You can remove it if needed. I didn't think I was discussing rescued children here but more of the demand for adrenochrome which could explain missing children and unexplained longevity in people with agendas. Thanks

                 Adrenal extract is a chemical that is made from the adrenal glands of slaughtered cows, pigs, and sheep. Adrenal glands make certain hormones. People use the extract as a medicine. It can be taken by mouth, placed under the tongue (used sublingually) or injected into the veins (given intravenously).

             What's interesting/curious with the 1946 Belgian rabbit ear experiment is at the very bottom it says :
            </p>
            <p>
             "translated by US Major F J Lewy US Army medical corps". Per ancestry.com Dr. Frederick J. Lewy b 1900 d 1969 was born in Berlin,  came to the US in 1934, had a medical practice on 5th Ave, NYC, went into the Medical Corps and after the war was a health lecturer who made 4 trips to Switzerland. Why was the Army Medical Corp translating adenochrome studies?

             The wealthy have access to chemicals?treatments? something that enables them to live longer than the rest of us. Kissinger is 96 and still compos mentis. Jane Fonda at 82 looks better than she did at age 73. If the source of that fountain of youth is illegal/immoral I don't think they would think twice about using it irregardless of sourcing. Injections of black sheep fetuses/livers for Debbie Harry.?

            <p>
             I don't know about black sheep but you can't go out after dark in Dayton Ohio because kids get abducted way too often.

             Switzerland has very pricey longevity treatment spas for the wealthy. La Prairie has just franchised out to Thailand via Minor Hotel Corp owned by Billionaire BIll Heinecke, US citizen but longtime Thai resident as  was his parents. He wants to cater to the yacht crowd because they leave a smaller carbon print than a jet load of tourists.  His father just happened to be career Marine then foreign service involved with Voice of America and USAID. In 1981 family was kicked out of Malta accused of being CIA. Heinecke also runs Golden Triangle elephant rescue camp/resort 16 mi from jumping off point for Burmese heroin/amphetamine. He has the customary philanthropic gig of donating scholarships to needy Thai children who pose unsmilingly in the pr photos.

             Adenochrome has been like you say oversensationalized perhaps for a purpose. To discount it is to discount human behaviors that have persisted for centuries. Smithsonian has a good article on corpse medicine history over the centuries. Even today with spirit cooking coexisting with rational human beings, it seems to have resurfaced in the media as a fad for the wealthy. If there have been further studies on derivatives of adenochrome that are life enhancing, I don't think it would have been published for public consumption or we'd be overpopulated by now with nonagenarians.

            We visited a small city in the south of France called Draguignan because we had known very well a woman who was very messed up with D.I.D.and had worked as a call girl in Paris while maintaining a job as a receptionist at a very prestigious boutique hotel and many of her clients were guests at that hotel.Ambassadors, diplomats  and very wealthy businessmen from Middle Eastern countries often stayed there.Here is the rub,that hotel when asked about her KNEW what she was up to while working there.She was 'allowed; to do this when in fact, when we contacted their offices of the owners told us that a person doing this would be fired on the spot. She was, we believe, a brownstone operation.A random post a few years ago had said she  was french intelligence and a CIA asset. Having said all this, she was from Draguignan and out of curiosity we visited that city while touring France.To our amazement we saw US Military personal walking around and spoke to some at a video store. Begrudging they admitted they lived and worked at that city. There was an old base in the city but it had weeds growing through the Pavement and looked or appeared unused.Later still while taking a cab and being very 'generous' with him,he told us (when we pointed out how unused the base appeared) he whispered to us , with his broken english, that "they moved",they are in that mountain, inside it"or something to that effect as he pointed to a large mountain about 5 miles away. Funny we thought,when we returned and tried to look up any indication of a base inside that mountain. I am not a huge Q Anon fan but I must say,those bases that allegedly exist  around the world,well I believe it. That woman,the 'receptionist' as I said had severe D.I.D. or M.P.D. and was a Delta programmed assassin spy with sex kitten programming as well.She told me personally that the city she was  from was the largest military base for the U.S. in Europe during the 2nd World War. I wonder if they moved it to inside a mountain if it is not a ritual abuse center and has small children kept in there. The city was very creepy and we were happy to leave. Why the U,S military is there and were so obvious I have no clue. Food for thought anyway. If you do research that place, almost nothing comes up

             Evidence of American malfeasance in France : 1951 in Pont San Esprit, the CIA gave LSD laced bread to the village as an experiment. Pont San Esprit is 143 miles from Draguignan.

              did you sweat so bad like you had to use multiple towels on the bed at night and use a hair dryer several times. I was dripping and could feel the beads of sweat forming and running down. It was bad.

              Are your lungs back to normal, I would say mine are back at say 90% now.

               No I had really bad pain in chest and under my arms. Worst feeling I have had since swine flu. That was about 20 days ago and mostly fine but still not got back to running yet. What you had sounds awful though and definitely worst than what I got. Don't even test in uk unless you get hospitalised so may not have even got it.

                My doctor laughed and said "it might the chinese flu but we are not allowed to test you, so here are some antibiotics in case it is bacterial" after he listened to my chest and said I had pneumonia. That was before I got really sick and was just a sore throat and some coughing at that time.  Oh and my son was saying that he lost his sense of taste and that everything was bland or sour. I remember diet pepsi tasting super sweet and kinda weird while I was sick and not sure about food as I was not eating anything. Messing up your taste or smell is one of the things with the corona.
