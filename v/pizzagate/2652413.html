<p>Police raided his £780,000 flat in London Bridge, seizing 18 devices and finding movie clips and still images on an old laptop and two USB sticks. </p>
<h3>The 49-year-old is the observatory\'s official spokesman on astronomy and space science, having held senior research positions at UK universities and at NASA\'s Space Telescope Science Institute.</h3>
<p>At the Royal Observatory Greenwich he oversees science content and exhibitions and public programmes and is a spokesperson for the landmark institution.</p>
<p>He is also the author of \'The Intimate Universe\' and while a project manager and researcher in residence at the University of Edinburgh <strong>he managed a national scheme to train young researchers and match them with secondary schools.</strong></p>
<p>In court, Kukula blamed pressure on completing the writing of the book \'The Scientific Secrets of Doctor Who\'. </p>
<p>He pleaded guilty to making 34 Category A indecent images of a child; 107 Category B and 266 Category C indecent images on or before October 5, last year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'You are a man of exceptional intelligence and academic and professional success,\' Inner London Crown Court Judge Freya Newbery told him.\'</p>
<p>\'You have excelled in your own field and you must be more disappointed than anybody to find yourself in this situation, but you have taken steps to put this all behind you to tackle your demons.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>Prosecutor Rebecca Folks said officers armed with a search warrant told Kukula they suspected indecent images had been downloaded at the address.</p>
<p>\'He said: &quot;I\'m gay and I have been chatting to people online.&quot;\'</p>
<p>They found Kukula, who has a degree in Physics with Astrophysics, had downloaded and deleted the images between 2006 and 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Kukula admits he clicked on search terms including: \'man boy sex\' \'pre-teen boy\' and young boy sex.\'</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'He has been open and honest he used the internet as a stress-reliever from work at the time. He was changing career, he was under financial pressure and was writing two books,\' said Mr. Michael McAlinden, defending.</p>
<p>\'To escape he started to binge on the net. He became addicted to surfing the internet and became addicted to pornography and unfortunately that addiction was the type of pornography you see.</p>
<p>\'He is homosexual and looks at gay pornography. As he found to his cost searches revealed images that were not appropriate.</p>
<p>\'He was not purposefully searching for Category A images and when he saw images of this type they were deleted.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>Kukula was sentenced to twenty-one weeks imprisonment, <strong>suspended for twelve months</strong> [= He won\'t go to jail, if he doesn\'t commit another crime in this period], must complete a sixty-day rehabilitation activity requirement and pay £535 costs.</p>
<p>He must obey a seven-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order, which limits his internet use and sign the sex offenders register for the same period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>\'You used porn to deal with stress in the past during a difficult time for you,\' the judge told him. \'You were looking at a lot of adult pornography, you got bored and got drawn into the underage pornography sites.\'</p>

            I tried to research Kukula and see if he had kids.  When I typed in the last name I found a twitter with art by an artist of the same name.  Kukula.  Here is an example of her work.
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BQQhDDFB41b/?taken-by=dear_kukula">

            </a>
            YES it is perverted and some of the other art is as well.  She has received push back and has come out on her twitter as saying they will be blocked.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is her Twitter.

            It is filled with bunnies, baby baphomet, masks, and dark eyes on the girls and some animals.  Also pentagrams are featured.  Really Frightening.  So far I have found that it is a Polish name.  Still don't know if these two are connected.  If they are, wow.   I don't have to ask what any of you will think of this art.  I already know.

              I am just mortified.  This will be the total sexual-ization of our young girls.  Notice all of the drawings are girls but with perky women's breasts.  I saw so many things I can't name them all.  Yes what you say.  Also there are animals that have been fused together.  Yes there is mention of Alice and there are short films avail. in her shop and paintings avail. and t-shirts.  The iphone covers is what I think will just explode with young girls.  OH God.

              </a>
              There is so much in that print I don't know where to begin.  That is a greeting card set so you can spread the filth.  Look at the bunny baby that is also an octopus.  AND there is a baby bottle that is red which makes me think of drinking blood.  UGH.

                You may be right.  In Polish Bubula means doll I wonder if this is a variation.  But there are many Jews that live in and are from Poland.  I think this word is similar in Greek Kukla in Greek I believe also means doll.  These girls do look like those limp dolls and are also a cross between those paintings there were popular.  Girls with huge large eyes.  This needs it's own thread, imo.  I am not experienced enough to do it justice.  The tech part of it frazzles me.  This needs to be spread around and shared so that people are aware and can warn others.  Evil.

                Look at this and there is a reply that links to darlajackson  MORE EVIL  There is no end to this stuff.  One leads to another and that one leads to one more and then...  Oh my God.  And this pic in itself is beyond evil.  Small child wearing a black lace mask holding a bird.  It is titled The Hunting Party.  Really?

              Totally Bazaar-o.  This is how they normalize stuff with children.  Young girls will look at it, totally clueless, and it starts to permeate their brains.  Damage Done.

                Good God that is frightening.  She is really screwed up.   And is not only passing this on to her own child but others. What in the world is under the chin of this one?  Weird little body parts or what?  Barf time again.  It grossed me out.

              Yes, since he has five siblings she could be an extended family member.  There was one work that had a key in the back of the girl.  I took this as being controlled.  Possibly by MK Ultra. If that is true, then she is a tool.

             I used to love her art a couple years ago before I was officially forever changed with my eyes wide open now. It could be beautiful but no piece of work they do is without something with bad intentions in it sadly. There are so many artists that do this stuff too...

              two days ago, and added his Twitter handle - within 2 hours, he switched it to 'private'. LOL. I guess some goats told him what they think about pedos....

             Entirely possible. On the other hand, he seems to have looked for 'pre-teen boys', so it's more likely it was him who actively sought these kind of images.
