<li>
<p>In this video you can hear a guy on stage with Prince Rama also talk trough the effect 
(this can proof the difference from a male and female voice that goes trough the effect)
<a href="https://vimeo.com/179491231">https://vimeo.com/179491231</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the same video you have the original voice from possibly 3 but a least 2 persons with and without the effect 
(this can help to double verify your findings after you found the right pitch value)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you find the right value, and double confirmed it, you can than try to apply the same values on heavy breathing\'s voice effect</p>
<p>Free software with (pitch shifting) effects
<a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">http://www.audacityteam.org/</a></p>
<p>If the above cant solve it there is a other option:</p>
<p>Heavy Breathing video\'s mostly have bad light in there video material and not much pictures of the equipment and stage  etc, But Prince Rama with there (wicked) spiritual music have hundreds of pictures of them and the stage online, we just need one pic of the voice effect /  stage equipment..</p>
<p>It should be possible to find the specific piece of hardware they use (possible shaped like a guitar effect)
(keep in mind her sister on the drums sometimes uses the voice effect and Taraka lipsyncs her sister so the product  can also be near the drums)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it could help if we know what product they use.</p>
<p>It should be possible to find that simple pic.... because they careless share a lot </p>
<p>For example: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/omU35">https://imgur.com/a/omU35</a></p>

             I would very much bet, they are not using a phone voice shifter developed by a security company.  My guess is they are using one of many musical instrument devices that do pitch shifting.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's also software for doing this live, including Auto Tunes.

              Well, that device is a musical pitch shifter, rebranded and adapted for security. Boss is a guitar pedal company that branched into vocal and synth circuits. This particular one has been around long enough to be a go-to.

               Actually I do see it now in musical instrument shops, the first one I searched didn't have it.

               I thought Brick House Security was a manufacturer, and they are just a retailer.

               The reason it didn't show up in the music store search, is Boss doesn't make this anymore

                I believe there is a newer version, but may be re-branded as a Roland device.

              You can hear her real voice sometimes on video clips. She's definitely a female although some people think she's not. When the camera gets close to her you can hear her very feminine voice without the pitch shifting.
