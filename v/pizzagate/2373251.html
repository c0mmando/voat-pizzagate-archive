             You do realize the use of honey is one of the ways that pedos groom kids for oral sex, right?  They put honey on their penis and get the kids to lick it off.  So, yes, the use of honey and pizza (a known code word in the pedo world) covering the genitals of a naked man does indeed suggest pedophilia and grooming of kids.  Of course, I guess you could explain it away as just merely homosexual imagery -- but that kind of looks bad for the gay community if you need to post images like that to get them interested in your pizza restaurant.  Either way, sexual imagery that involves pizza to promote your restaurant makes it a NOT family-friendly restaurant.

              It is not.  That pizza code list was made up.  CP is internet slang for Child Pornography and CP evolved into cheese pizza.   Pizza by itself is not a code word.

               Oh, and just because something has one use (like honey for tea -- which is delicious, by the way), does not mean that it can't possibly have any other meaning, right?  Does the term "double entendre" mean anything to you?  Why Shakespeare's plays are filled with all kinds of things which can have more than one meaning.  Besides -- symbols are using one item to represent something else other than the literal item.  I feel like you are going to have to do some research on symbolism in art and literature before you really understand the concept.  Just look at the sexual symbolism in old paintings and you can see how subtly subversive art can be.  Especially paintings that were done in churches where the artist was able to sneak in some heresy or immorality right under the noses of the faithful (who didn't understand the symbolism because they didn't run around with those in the know and had no idea that the item in question had a secondary connotation).

               Are you kidding?  That image in no way promotes the restaurant?  Did you not read the comment by the employee who posted it?  It says "CUM VISIT" with drink, pizza and a double heart emoji.  What, is he serving pizza and drinks at his apartment after work?  Or, is it not possible that he is asking people to come get a drink and some pizza at COMET PING PONG where he works?

            I've never understood that.  1)  It tries to be a family friendly place, so this wouldn't be appropriate.  If it were my employee posting stuff like that with the restaurant name attached to it, they'd be fired.  Period.  2) Who wants to eat at a pizza place where an employee is taking photos like this and posting them?  I'd be worried that someone like this might think it amusing to add some "special sauce" to my pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if you think that Pizzagate is fake news (which I don't -- I believe it is true), why would you defend an obviously nasty place like this and act surprised that people might be suspicious?  Normal people don't have stuff like this -- or the artwork or bands with names like "Sex Stains" playing there -- for just a regular, run of the mill pizza place.  If it were a bar/pizza joint which was 21 and over, that is one thing.  Allowing kids into a place like this is creepy AF.  No, you aren't being "cool" or "hip" parents by taking your kids there -- you are grooming your kids.  You may not be the ones abusing them -- but you are sure as hell making it easier for someone else to abuse them because they won't know what normal behavior by adults is if you expose them to crap like this.  This stuff is okay for adults (though still gross and creepy).  It just isn't okay for kids.    This is how weird fetishes and abnormal sexuality gets established -- exposure to sexual situations before you are mentally and emotionally able to process what you are seeing.

              It isn't the same, but when an employee puts "Comet Ping Pong" in his description so that it shows up under his name in his posts, he is connecting Comet Ping Pong to what he posts.  If he posts stuff like this and doesn't get fired for it -- you can safely assume that Alefantis did not have a problem with it.  Since it is a small business, there is virtually no way (considering how proficient with social media Alefantis is) that he did not see the stuff that was posted by this guy or at least hear about it.  Even if it somehow slipped under the radar, someone else would have told him about it if they knew that Alefantis would be upset by having Comet Ping Pong associated with the image.  No business owner is going to allow an employee "freedom of speech" in a way that could directly affect their bottom line.  At the very least, he would have this employee remove the "Comet Ping Pong" from his account so he could distance the restaurant from what his employee posted.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, there is a HUGE difference between a family who visits Comet Ping Pong while on vacation from Indiana and those who are regulars to the place.  Any tourist could walk into the place not knowing much about it.  However, those in the neighborhood know about the live music nights with bands like "Sex Stains" and the weird art.  If they still keep bringing their kids there -- yes, they are suspect.  And let's be honest, any parents who like these kinds of posts -- are likely to be exposing their kids to much more than just a creepy pizza place.

               This is a reasonable interpretation.    Another one would be that no customer who didn't know the drag queen bartender who ran that account even saw his instagram.  Why would they? Do you look up instagrams of people who work at places you eat at?  Why?  I would use google or Yelp or things like that to look up restaurant information.

               Note that the tourists are playing ping pong in front of the "weird art."  And it's not disturbing them whatsoever.   Because the art is actually not disturbing unless you are connected pedophilia or satanism or something else in your head to that artwork.   Show that mural to most any five year old and they are not going to be scared or creeped out.  I post that example, to point that the COMET PING PONG people have in their bears no relation to the actual place that people experienced.

               Actually, I would think that the adults there know how to act around families, even adults who post pictures on their instagram with a man with pizza covering his naughty bits.   I assume that just based on the fact, it was actually popular with families.    I know lot of places that have a daytime vibe and a nighttime vibe that are different.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also would think it would be a terrible location for all the sinister stuff people who have never been there claimed was going on there, because it was open to so many people and you never knew who would stop by.

Those in the know would know how to ask for what they want. It would insane to actually operate anything out of Comet Ping Pong even if you were using it for a front, you wouldn't conduct that business on the premises.  And let's remember that people tried to claim children were held in cages there, that basements and tunnels existed underneath there, that the children eating dinner there or playing ping pong were merchandise on display.

              <p>
               There's never been an any indication that Comet Ping Pong was anything but a legitimate, even a serious restaurant, with weird arty rock bands at night.  They only ever heard of this place when they already made up their minds that child trafficking ring existed.  And the evidence?  Was from Instagram.   This is why pizzagate was immediately debunked the claims never even approached having any evidence.

                Alefantis doesn't need to get a complaint about that image because, as a business owner, it is his job to know if an employee is posting stuff like this with his restaurant name attached to it.  Sure, most people might not see it -- but if you own a business, you'd care about it possibly turning off customers.  And I'm sorry -- even without any connection to pedophilia whatsoever, I do NOT want to go to a pizza place where they think it is funny to have pictures like this.  I prefer to keep pubic hair as far away from my food as possible.  If there are employees who don't feel the same way, I'm not comfortable eating there.  That is also why I wouldn't feel comfortable at a nudist colony.  I don't want naked people (with the exception of my husband) cooking my food.  If that makes me uptight, so be it, but I think most people probably feel the way that I do.
               </p>
               <p>
                The fact that some family from Indiana isn't freaked out by the art means exactly squat.  Maybe they have bad taste in art themselves.  Maybe they are incredibly freaky themselves and actually like the idea that it is secretly subversive.  I know nothing about these people so just because some family in Indiana decided that because they went to Comet Ping Pong and their kids weren't molested that there is NO possible way that anyone connected with Comet Ping Pong could be a pedophile doesn't prove that the accusations are false.
               </p>
               <p>
                There has never been any indication?  Not true.  There is plenty to be suspicious about but since no one will actually do a real investigation and instead prefer to throw out the "fake news" narrative to dismiss it because apparently wealthy and powerful people like Alefantis aren't even capable of such things in the minds of people like you (even though Dennis Hastert, the Franklin Scandal, the BBC/Saville scandal, the Belgium/Detroux scandal, the Jeffrey Epstein/pedo island case, Michael Jackson's pedophilia, Woody Allen, Roman Polanski, Catholic Pedophilia scandal, and countless others are proof that many wealthy and famous people actually do engage in pedophilia and child trafficking).
               </p>
               <p>
                Plus, you also do not understand the concept that these codes that are used are designed to be signals to those in the know.  Until this story broke, I was not familiar with the codes that pedophiles use to advertise their particular interests to one another.  It would never have entered my mind had I seen someone wearing jewelry with that symbol.  And, I do know that -- because of the ignorance of those symbols -- sometimes people wear them without any idea that another, more sinister meaning is attached to them.  I don't think that just because  you see one symbol somewhere that it proves that anyone is a pedophile.  However, at some point, when you keep seeing suspicious things over and over again, you have to be an idiot not to consider the possibility.  Have the accusations been proven?  No, they haven't.  Nor would I ever claim that they have been.  But, I do think that there is enough suspicion to warrant an actual investigation.  However, since Alefantis is wealthy and powerful (he was named 49th most powerful person
                <strong>
                 in DC
                </strong>
                by GQ magazine), obviously, they aren't going to do a real investigation.  Whether that is because they can't believe a man like him would do such a thing or whether they are corrupt, I'll leave it up to you to decide.
               </p>
               <p>
                I get that some people would rather bury their head in the sand because the idea that pedophilia is rampant in the US -- and especially in the corridors of power and wealth -- is too difficult to face.  You might not want to think something like this could happen in America.  Or, maybe because Alefantis is Jewish, you don't want to think that someone coming from a community that endured the Holocaust, could be involved in something so horrible as child sex trafficking.  If it makes life easier to just accept the fake news narrative and keep your eyes closed, I get it.  Not everyone can handle the truth.  But, to act like there is no reason at all to question the possibility of child sex trafficking in DC or other places is either incredibly naive OR you have a motive for debunking the idea because you stand to lose something if it turns out to be true.

             The only people that would go to this place or take their children are sickos that are pedos or selling their children off.  OR they are Really Dumb.  Just by patronizing that place and giving them money you are promoting and allowing them to continue their disgusting habit of abusing children.  Who knows what else you are condoning.  Some people are so dumb that they think the whole thing is a joke and just don't get it.  As if that would even be funny.  The sens of humor nowadays is Just Plain Sick.
