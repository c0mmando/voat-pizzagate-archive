<p>She was previously a research intern at the Laboratory to Combat Human Trafficking (LCHT) and also was a Research Fellow and Assistant Director at the Human Trafficking Center (HTC). She also served on the Colorado Human Trafficking Council\'s Data &amp; Research Task Force.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear under what circumstances she died, and this remains so to this day. As of today, Nov. 22nd, the family has not received Monica\'s body. Although the family held a Memorial Service on Friday, Nov. 18th, <strong>there was no proper funeral/burial for Monica</strong>. The family is relying on information coming out Haiti and has not had the chance to conduct a proper autopsy in the US.</p>
<p>Friends of Monica have made mentions and suggestions that they are in the dark as far as finding out what happened, and some alluded to Monica\'s death being considered a suicide, while others say she was murdered:</p>

<p><strong>Monica goes to Haiti</strong></p>
<p>On August 15, 2015, Monica announced her plan to visit Haiti to conduct research on human trafficking:

<p>And she has lived there since:

<p><strong>After several weeks, Monica discovers corruption in Haiti involving the Clintons and people/entities related to them, and focuses her research on Hillary Clinton from that moment on:</strong></p>
<p>On January 3rd, 2016, Monica shared with her friend Bella some of her findings based on her field work in Haiti up to that point. By this time she had already become aware of corruption by the Clintons in Haiti (<em>&quot;starts to connect the dots on what I already suspected&quot;</em>). In fact, she was getting ready to dive full time: <strong>&quot;Ms. Clinton has corrupt &amp; dirty business to finish in Haiti ... This is the theory my master\'s thesis puts forth... this is modern structural slavery&quot;</strong>. Bella re-shared this post by Monica to a Facebook group she belonged to:

<p>The day after, on January 4th, 2016, Monica again shared with her friend Bella some more of her findings: <strong>&quot;But the real significance of this scandal for me, I know you feel me Bella, is the link to contemporary slavery and trafficking. I can\'t say to what extent, but there is human trafficking happening through the Clinton\'s Caraol Complex.&quot;</strong>:

<p><strong>Monica has been researching human trafficking for a long time.</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Prof. Claude d’Estree\'s comments</strong></p>
<p>Monica\'s memorial service was streamed live on Nov. 18th and covered live here: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dowzr/new_info_monica_petersen_died_mysteriously_in/">https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5dowzr/new_info_monica_petersen_died_mysteriously_in/</a></p>
<p>Her boss/professor Claude d\'Estree said (beginning 39:30 mark of the stream):</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;(She) decided to take on one of the demagogues in the field of human trafficking.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Produced a 110-page analysis of human trafficking in Haiti - 2 years of research.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;We were looking for someone who was smart enough and maybe brave enough to publish her work&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I will continue to seek out and publish it for her&quot;</li>
<li><strong>&quot;We are in a state of shock. We may never know what exactly happened to her&quot;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I am not suggesting anything, but for the sake of completeness, I should mention that Claude d\'Estree worked in the US Attorney\'s office on behalf of <strong>DynCorp</strong> between 1999-2002: <a href="http://archive.is/a88tT">http://archive.is/a88tT</a></p>
<p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p>
<p>I have been contacted by 3 different people all claiming to be good friends with Monica with the sole purpose of trying to discredit the link to the Clintons. They mostly did so by attacking Bella, while ignoring the fact that she simply shared these posts 10 MONTHS AGO with no agenda other than to spread the word to her friends in a small Facebook group. They claim now that Bella is seeking fame, yet the exact opposite is true - Bella is trying to distance herself as much as possible from all this.</p>
<p>Those 3 people seem very adamant in conveying the fact that they know for a fact Monica\'s death is not related to her research activity in Haiti. Yet, at the same time, admit that the family has NOT EVEN SEEN Monica\'s body.</p>

            By the time the Complete Guide was published, her full name was well known from other people and blogs doxxing her so I didn't bother.

            Monica Petersen died in Haiti

           <blockquote>

             Correction NOV 28

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The FB post about her death was dated Nov. 13th.  There's no way she could have died 15 days AFTER they posted about it.  Did you mean OCT 28?

             No, I guess I wasn't clear. I posted a correction on Nov 28th indicating that I have specific information that she was murdered rather than the suicide that was discussed early on.
            </p>
            <p>
             She was lured to come back to Haiti by a person she knew there after being in Colorado for the 2 weeks prior where she was spending time with family before returning to Haiti for another year.

            Having been on voat for a while, I would like to suggest you also "archive" any images from imgur to sli.mg or other image hosting site, it's only a matter of time before imgur deletes them.
