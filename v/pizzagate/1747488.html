            They had been living together the whole time she was "supposedly" broke up with the alleged pedophile.  She is just a twisted person like her mentor, HRC.  This marriage is a sham like the Clintons.

            Well, that goes to show you, you cannot believe everything you read on here.  I guess every once in a while I trust our posters a little too much.  But I do believe she is involved the Awan Bros. Spy Connection.  They are all involved in this up to their eyeballs.  Terry McAuliff donated over $600K to McCabe's wife.  DWS, Uma the are all guilty.

            Yes I was going to add. The law states spouses cannot be compelled to testify against each other. I don't want to get jumped on but gay marriage legalization is at timid used for these very purposes since Supreme Court amended the constitution. Know of one direct one linked to the Clinton Foundation.

            Yes it could be.  I have always thought the police raid that got the computer was contrived.  They knew where the computer was...they knew what was on it....they wanted what was on it to destroy the Clinton side of the Illuminati.  They went and got it.  Now if they will only leak it.....but they are scared it is too much on it.  It has enough to destroy governments around the world.  Its all some crazy power struggle.  And I am not sure the Steve Piezenik are on the free the kids side.  I hope they are but I am not sure.

             I did too. She was carrying Hillary's $2500 bag after she got a $600 haircut. It pisses me off that she lives like royalty using the corrupt money she got by selling our uranium, stealing from the Haitian people, the pay to play money and all of the human trafficking money she receives. Then she tries to act like she can connect and understand the middle class. Now they have her evil offspring being prepped for politics. On the news this morning, it said that she may run for office some day. I wonder if she was raped her whole childhood, or if they actually protected their own.

            Neither Abedin or Wiener are a real person.  Both are MKULTRA kids.  They go in for some treatment and come out smiling.
           </p>
           <p>
            Huma was born here to make her eligible to have dual citizenship....then she went back to Saudi.  Were Hillary in a sign of cementing their families picked Huma to be her sex slave.  After years of visiting her in Saudi when she could she took ownership finally of her slave when Huma was 18.  They quickly fast tracked Huma's security clearance and got on with the corruption.  Huma never had a choice.....and honestly I dont think Anthony did either.
           </p>
           <p>
            Their marriage is fake and arranged.  To make a good story in the USA.  Because Huma's mother is a mega Islamist.  Who runs a magazine for women pushing hard for every female to get their clits cut off as infants.   Islam says a muslim man can marry a christian woman but never a jew...and muslim women can NEVER marry outside of Islam.  But they let her get married to this trash?  NO it was negotiated by Clinton.  They thought the bullshit story of a Jewish man married to a muslim woman would go over well in heavily progagandised USA.  They were pushing this pervert to higher office.  He would of likely been in the Senate by now if his MKULTRA programming had not glitched and he started showing off his penis.  After killing  Breitbart they thought the coast was clear to push the pervert to NYC Mayor.  A job perfect for graft and corruption.  But the MKULTRA programming glitched again and he pulled his wang back out and sent it to a wonderful potential mate for him....a child.  A child is exactly what his programming is driving him to desire.   Huma had the one kid with him....probably the one time she let him enter her body.  Much like Hillary.......had a child for Web Hubble and they just said hell with it.....we will say it is Bill's kid.

              Yeah....i have been reading stuff on Pizzagate since Mid November....reading article after article and news nugget after nugget.  You have to sift and make up your own mind on the truth because the media....is all fake.  They tell us nothing of the truth.   After all the CIA head is quoted.

               I think she is a double agent.  One for Saudi and other the black hat CIA. You could not make this entire story line up because people would think you were lying. It just never stops with the bullshit this entire group is involved in.

             That is a very scary thought. That they plan everything that far ahead. But, after learning so much in the last few months, I wouldn't doubt it. It amazes me that someone can be born and raised for the purpose of doing people harm and furthering this agenda. For The New World Order. I've always thought that Huma was being used for the government tho because she has deep Muslim ties. She can find out secrets and basically be a spy for either side.

              They do plan that far ahead. They have decades and centuries planned out already because that's how long they've been doing this for and they want to continue doing it. That doesn't mean the people at the top are smart enough to execute these plans anymore, they aren't. We're seeing the watered down version and everyone is fucking up and getting caught.

              Yes, Uma Hari, if you will.  She was born in Saudi Arabia and was raised there for the most part I believe.  Her father started some business which her Mother now runs, after his death.  She is involved with the McCabe Awan Spy debacle. So is DWS, who arranged for their Visas.  Maybe I should write a novel, and change the names to protect the guilty.

                Whenever I get frustrated, impatient and ready to scream When will this all end, I remember how long this has been going on.  The reason we are wanting this to end right now is because of the disgusting things that are going on.  This is not just stealing mail out of mailboxes, or stealing lawn ornaments, these are grave and disgusting crimes against children AND adults.  The organ harvesting is done to adults AND children.  But the Missing Children from all over the globe is a good way to start red pilling people.  Bringing up the gory rituals (and they are that) will make people shut it out pronto.

             I'm more interested in the both of them both taking down Hitlery. The Clinton's, the Podesta's, and the Obamas are at the top of my priority list. Imagining them going to prison gives me warm fuzzy feelings.
