<p>This is related to Pizzagate because the word &quot;Domino&quot; was found in the Wikileaks John Podesta email dump in an email from Herb Sandler to John Podesta. This term has been heavily investigated and speculated about and what it could mean to the Pizzagate investigation. </p>

          <p>
           A domino mask (from Latin dominus, "lord", and Medieval Latin masca,
           <strong>
            specter

            There was someone else on voat who mentioned this earlier in another post. They didn't go into detail but definitely made a point of what a domino is.  I wish i could find her post. Anyway good work for going through with it and adding all this info.  What i will add is this- The book the SECRET PIZZA PARTY has a picture of a racoon with the DOMINO mask on its face and the people at the SECRET PIZZA PARTY all have DOMINO masks on. Thttp://i.vimeocdn.com/video/521165937_1280x720.jpg CHECK IT OUT. Some not all have DOMINO MASKS ON.

            Here's what I wrote last time about this email:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I would love to put together a real random survey because I have heard that view expressed often on here. That that sentence is so awkwardly worded that it
             <em>
              has
             </em>
             to be code. I would love to see what a survey of people who asked what the meaning of that sentence was. I can almost guarantee that a vast majority of the people will interpret that sentence to be a joke about what his chances of winning a game were if he were eating cheese or pasta (as in "do you think I'll do better playing football on gatorade than water?"). It's a joke about the "stakes" of the game. This sentence is so innocuous I'm confused how anyone could interpret it differently unless english wasn't their native language.
            </p>
            <p>
             Last time this email came up I did some investigation into it ( a concept that seems completely foreign to people on here). The email was sent by Hertbert Sandler, a quick google search shows that he is
             <strong>
              85 years old
             </strong>
             so you have to imagine the things your grandfather (depending how old you are) would do and say. In other words I think you would agree that the fact that he is elderly makes it at least
             <em>
              a little
             </em>
             more likely that he wasn't participating in a BDSM rape orgy (like the code words would have you believe) but that
             <em>
              maybe
             </em>
             he was actually playing dominoes and making corny jokes like every elderly grandfather
             <em>
              ever

             . He actually mentions dominoes a few times in the emails he also says " Susan whipped Sherry and me at Dominos. Using the Podesta method, she made up the rules as we played.". Man that really sounds like they're actually playing a game. That's actually about the entirety of that email to which John replies that he had fun too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also how would you interpret
             <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/51820">
              this email
             </a>
             ? Is it a coincidence that dominoes is a game that comes in sets ? Would you refer to bdsm as a 'game' and that you would like to 'get a set'?  Also this email was sent by a Susan from the Sandler center and a quick Google search shows that herb sandler has a daughter Susan. So isn't the most likely explanation that his daughter joined in the dominoes game one night and they all had a nice boring (mundane) evening?

            Are you flipping kidding me?   Of course, you are speculating.   You are completely ignoring the plainspoken and common meaning of playing the game of dominoes and developing some 100% batshit theory based on what?   A typo?   A misspelling?  So he's playing a mask or a cloak, now?
           </p>
           <p>
            You think men of high position and above average intellects don't have typos or misspellings in casual emails?  This is ludicrously tendentious and there's no way you can't be aware of how weak this argument is.

           <p>
            It's the same damn word.  Guess what?  "Dominoes" with the ES is also an acceptable plural of the secondary meaning of domino.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know that Herb Sandler was speaking about playing the game of dominoes.  This is backed up by Susan Sandler thanking John for teaching them the game and she was going to get a set of dominoes.

              Why would he say cheese pizza at all?  Pizza is not involved here whatsoever.
             </p>
             <p>
              Cheese pizza is a phrase used on 4chan.  It never appears once in the Podesta emails.
             </p>
             <p>
              The context of the email is clear.  Podesta used to give pasta as Christmas gifts and he now switched to giving cheese.     You clearly understand what he was saying (except for the pizza part) even if he phrased it awkwardly.  Thus there is no basis for batshit speculation.   Especially this example where the alternative meaning doesn't work in the original sentence .

            Either way it is a disgusting thought. This may be thought of as the person that dominates another. The Dominator of the cheese or pasta. Hmm. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah, could not mean anything sinister, right. Makes a lot of sense. We all say that. Right. Very Interesting and Well Written Post.  Upvoat4U

           </p>
           <p>
            That it has. And for what? Zero arrests. The Podesta emails have occupied us for 9 months and have lead to NOTHING.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wikileaks is a CIA limited hangout and the Podesta emails were released by Wikileaks one month before the election.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conclusion: the CIA released the Podesta emails.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            1) To shit can Her Thighness

           <p>
            2) Distract from far worse crimes evidence of which we'll never see because they don't want us to see it.

           <p>
            Wake Up People!
           </p>
           <p>
            The crimes are real but do you really think the CIA would release evidence that would lead to arrests?

             While I happen to agree with your point generally, it is important to remember that Wikileaks was not compromised until AFTER they released the emails. It is believed by many, of course, that CIA now runs the title shop. And on that I happen to also agree. But at the time the emails were released, we may be able to assume JA was still at the helm. They got him right after. In retaliation for the release most likely.

              Was 9/11 an inside job?
             </p>
             <p>
              That's all you need to decode Julian Assange and Edward Snowden. Both think 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab "terrorists" 10 of who are still alive bee tee dubs.

               An interesting idea, yes. And worth exploring. As part of that very narrative, might I propose that JA and ES actually agree with you. Here's the logic: If 9/11 was an inside job,
               <strong>
                it's still a job
               </strong>
               meaning you need to
               <strong>
                hire employees
               </strong>
               to perform services for you. Sure, the resumes of 19 Arab "terrorists" may have been hidden in Bush's bottom drawer and JA/ES may have known it, but that does not make Wikileaks, its supporters or it's source material questionable. The ideas are not mutually-exclusive.
              </p>
              <p>
               9/11
               <strong>
                was
               </strong>
               carried out by terrorists, just not the ones everyone thinks.

                That a distinction without a difference. The point is JA, Wikileaks and ES are CIA. Of course there's going to be juicy information they release. It's just not the real dirty dirt.

             bullshit.  there's absolutely no reason to bring any attention to it.  the CIA isn't taking risks as "just release this, it won't lead to any arrests".  Info can open so many pandora's boxes.

            I do think it's important to note that Herb Sandler is the one who made the dominos comment to the Podestas because the Sandlers really need to be looked into more intensely.  Remember that Susan Sandler is the one who wrote to Podesta saying she thought the handkerchief had a map that seemed pizza related:
