<p>A 1958 Western featuring a character by the name of Trump &quot;building a wall to save the sheep from the \'end times\'&quot; (Yes, a wall to save the sheep, you couldn\'t make this stuff up!) <a href="https://youtu.be/tycM8jq2xVU">https://youtu.be/tycM8jq2xVU</a></p>
<p>Published on Jan 14, 2017 by Zachary K Hubbard. In this video we decode the May 9, 1958 episode of the Western TV show \'Trackdown\', titled &quot;The End of the World&quot;, where a snake oil salesman named Trump is promoting building a wall to keep the people safe from the end times. This episode is further proof of the fact that we are living out a scripted agenda, where the news and events to come, are planned decades in advance, by the Freemasonic leadership that sits at the top of the world pyramid. In other words, the Donald Trump presidency was planned from at least 1958, when Donald Trump himself, was just 11-years old, about to turn 12 a little more than a month later, June 14, 1958.

<p>&quot;The Wall&quot; Featuring Donald Trump from 1990 Heavy Metal Comic Strip 27 years ago!

<p>Note: As if it wasn\'t already obvious -- the guy who did this Heavy Metal &quot;Trump Wall&quot; comic strip in 1990, Peter Kuper, is a Jew, and was EVEN BORN IN 1958, the same year this above TV show where &quot;a character named Trump tries to build a wall to save the sheep from the end-times&quot; was made and is now 58 years old in 2017! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kuper">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kuper</a>?</p>

<p>Here is some good quotes to ponder upon.</p>
<p>&quot;Better to shun the bait than struggle in the snare.&quot; – William Blake</p>
<p>“Hope is such a bait, it covers any hook.” --- Oliver Goldsmith</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who tries to make a distinction between education and entertainment doesn\'t know the first thing about either.&quot; ~ Marshall McLuhan</p>
<p>“Journalists are like dogs, whenever anything moves they begin to bark. Opinion is like a pendulum and obeys the same law. If it goes past the centre of gravity on one side, it must go a like distance on the other; and it is only after a certain time that it finds the true point at which it can remain at rest. Religion is the masterpiece of the art of animal training, for it trains people as to how they shall think.” ~ Arthur Schopenhauer</p>
<p>“We must all try to understand what is happening and in my humble opinion ideology is only going to get in your way. Nobody understands what is happening, not buddhists, not christians, not government scientists, no one. So, forget ideology. They betray, they limit, they lead astray. Just deal with the raw data and TRUST yourself. Nobody is smarter than you are, and what if they are? What good is their understanding doing you? Inform yourself. What does inform yourself mean? It means transcend and distrust ideology. Go for direct experience. What do you think when you face the waterfall? What do you think when you have sex? What do you think when you take psilocybin? Everything else is unconfirmable rumor, useless, probably lies. So, liberate yourself from the illusion of culture. Take responsibility for what you think and what you do.” – Terence McKenna</p>
<p>&quot;Only the small secrets need to be protected. The big ones are kept secret by public incredulity.&quot; -Marshall McLuhan</p>
