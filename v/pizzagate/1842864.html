It’s no secret that in the Gnostic Mass, this central rite, involves a (fully dressed) priest, a (usually naked) woman on the altar, a simulation of hetero sex initiated by the priest, and a simulation of fellatio performed by the priestess. There’s a lot more involved — more people, more symbolism, magick words, all that great stuff — but these two roles are fixed.

            This guy has a book about nearly every occultic topic under the sun:  He claims to have been:  a witch, a vampire, a 90-degree Freemason, a Catholic priest, a Mormon, a born-again Christian.... whew!
            <strong>
             <strong>
              He claims to have had sex with a fallen angel.

             <strong>
              He claims to have had a werewolf encounter in addition to encounters with ghosts.  More recently, he is into flat earthism and geocentrism.

            "Schnoebelen claims that he made a deal with Satan himself. After signing a deal in blood, Schnoebelen was given seven years' worth of funky superpowers on the condition that, at the end of the period, he would be killed and sent to party on forever in Hell. He claims to have considered this a win-win situation. His spirit guides then helped him to join the Illuminati, where he was able to speak with the spirits of people such as Jesus, Adolf Hitler, and Aleister Crowley. At around this time he also had sex with a fallen angel.

           <p>
            He later became a Catholic priest..."

             Thanks for that. I was going to use him for psych warfare against the OTO. What I have proven is that the OTO drink blood, and people were jailed in Australia for claiming they do. I go their own training videos on Gnostic Catholic mass from 95... Ooops because of AIDS we have to cut back our drinking blood in our cakes of light.
            </p>
            <p>
             The enemy is fucked :P - so that guy isn't good for court but he is good for pissing off the OTO. Why doesn't the OTO sue him, when they jail ozzies for exposing their links to a preschool and massive child abuse that occured there in OZ.

             that's in the OP. I've reached out to the author of that site Koering - who seems to be ex OTO himself. It turns out the guy who wrote leadbeater.org Dr Gregory John Tillett also founded the homosexual vilification laws that are being used to normalized pedophilia in Australia, and Gregory Tillett is OTO.
Koering and tillet have worked together:

              Wow that is very disturbing and blatant. The number 7 especially is a biblical number used by God as a sign of completion and wholeness and restoration.  It is hard to believe someone linked to Satanism would even come near that. It is like cryptonite to Superman. Quite shocking actually. Occultist will not use it even as a disguise they consider it "bad luck" for them.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's why you see 666 mentioned that is actually written in the Bible. Never heard of this Facebook group. Not on FB. Will look into it.

            I thought Peaches Geldof was killed by the OTO because she exposed names of the women who offered their babies to be sexually abused by another member, shortly thereafter she was killed and made to look like an overdose of heroin yet she was in the process of weaning off the drug and loved her child so much she never would have done that. Her father is a member, bob geldof and Peaches herself claimed she was a member at one time but it sounded like after the birth of her child she tried to get away. Sad.

             my 2IC investigator is an expert on this. I'll bring him in here. yeah as the OP exposed she gave up the names of OTO Witches supplying babies for rape, thats why peaches had to be killed off. She was stupid to join the OTO in the first place, and I don't pity her.

            I would love to chat for a few hours about all this but I dont think its the best idea yet. Is there a website like voat or reddit or some kind of an open forum that has discussions on the OTO in Australia?...because surely you cant be the only one fighting this evil. I hope more people in AU have heard of pizzagate and come to help us as I know people from here will be glad to help out on your front in the AU. This really is worldwide.

            Take a look at the Facebook accounts of Amanda Kleinman and James Alefantis and his Father;
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            Just like that woman in the video said many jewish families look freindly on the outside but many were doing satanic things and if Amanda and James were doing these satanic things their parents were to.

             seconds after posting this i got a downvote. You can guess who. Someone who believes a homosexual must never be vilified even when they are calling for a RAINBOW NEW WORLD ORDER or raping infants. She's in good company. My dad was found guilty of the crime of hating baby rape too. See comments:

                The "god" Baphomet they worship is also a Tranny.

                During the Weimar Republic in Germany the Jews were doing secret transgender operations in the 1920's - 1930's.  So they had a lot of time to perfect the operations to where the male/female features are barley noticeable.  So you really have no idea if the person you see on the TV was born a male or female.

                 Here's the dirt on Catherine Burns de-facto leader of the gay police who sent my gay stalker after me and my dad after we criticized the special gay police. Look for the pink-triangle on vid dot me slash ozzieslovepedos for more. They also have special jewish police in Australia, America and England. The Shoreim they are called. Gays and jews beleive normal police aren't good enough for them, because normal people can't be trusted to treat the elite gay, or elite jew, or elite gay jew equally - only a fellow gay jew is morally superior enough to do their bidding (institionalized bias and corruption)

            The OTO is a JEWISH PEDOPHILE CULT, Bill Cooper played these same clips before he was killed. A video proving that got recently censored after I linked to it, so this substitute will have to do.

            Thanks for posting this again. Have been writing &amp; posting about this since the investigation started no one wanted to hear. All I got was SHILL, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wrote awhile back that the OTO was the influential factor in NAZI Germany. I have eye witness testimony regarding this from someone who died at age 80 in 2010. Was inside Hitler's inner circle. Crowley was a British Foreign Intelligence Office agent (a spy) who also led the OTO. He also helped start the OTO in the US influencing Parsons who created rocket fuel &amp; initiated L. Ron Hubbard into Black Sex Majick.
           </p>
           <p>
            So in essence that means Crowley, Parsons, Hubbard all were members of OTO &amp; members of elite intel government agencies. Crowley was instrumental in Hitler's initiation as well. Hubbard went in to swindle all of Parsons money and started his fake blackmail religion of Scientology with CIA. Parsons was despondent had been cut out of his very inventions of rocket science by the US gov. and lost his security clearance. He died at age 37 in "allege" explosion that many believed was a gov. assasination.

             David Bottrill or Bottrell is keeing a close eye on Crowley's bloodline in Australia if you see the links and his immigration job is just a cover for him to go to embassies around the world (Turkey for example) as an ASIS Spymaster.
The legacy continues. That faggot sent the Australian embassy officers and Heidi Hendry to my job on my first day. I blew her cover before it started which is a long story and quit my job before he first day at it so she couldnt' plant stuff on my computer.  She never took the job once I quit the Sunday before her first day, and they tried to make a false allegation to the police I stole something from my work which ended with recorded telphone apologies. We have her resume and address claiming to have 3 citizenships when she was in the last Australian election as a GREENS candidate for Murray Darling breaking S44 of the Australian Constition and voiding her US citizenship. I am more than happy to dox that bitch working with the OTO/Australain Embassy in Hanoi in a failed plot to frame me up. Ask me for the details.

            Michael Borusiewicz responds to David Bottrill
Since David Bottrill first threatened me for legal action even though he or the OTO were nowhere to be seen on the site except for a short blog exposing an OTO member who was caught and convicted for having child porn on his computer, I have done a fair bit of research into the OTO and one of it's founders that they base their "religion" on, Alistair Crowley who was nothing more than a sexual deviant and a chronic drug addict. They all seem to be right into getting right out of it on drugs as apparantly this gets them in the right state of mind to do the things they need to do in secret.
Some questions for you David Bottrill
1. Seeing as you are the highly esteemed "treasurer" of the OTO in Australia, is it your job to supply OTO members with the drugs they need to be a part of your group? Let's face it, being high up in the immigration office in Australia would make you a likely candidate as how much easier could it be to organise immigrants to smuggle drugs into the country.
2. Not knowing what you do in secret I ask you, do you sacrifice babies? Are you in charge of bringing them into the country too, utilising your position as "Outreach officer" in the ministry of Australian immigration?
3. How does being in a cult that promotes drug use affect your work? Obviously they don't drug test the workers at the immigration office in Canberra, Do they?
4. Would you be willing to supply a sample of hair to undergo a hair folicle drug test to prove you have not taken any drugs in the last six months.
5. Can you get drugs for a friend of mine or is it only OTO members you supply, if that's what's happening?
6. Do OTO members get free drugs or do they have to pay? (My friend is thinking about joining).

             Dear Mr Borusiewicz
            </p>
            <p>
             Concerns Notice pursuant to the Civil Law (Wrongs) Act 2002 (ACT)and Defamation Act 2005 (QLD)

             Paedophile rings protected by police and politicians in Australia

             ...
            </p>
            <p>
             This provides the text of a document authored by Ms Reina Michaelson which purports to describe events in Victoria, including a conspiracy involving high profile Australian citizens, a major television network, police and authorities and the education department in a criminal network which commits cannibalism, murder and paedophilia and/or the organised ritual sexual abuse of children.  There are references in the document to the Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) and the document purports a link between the OTO and these criminal activities.
            </p>
            <p>
             These accusations defame the OTO and its members.  Legal action was previously initiated against the author and a publisher of this document.  As the then National Treasurer of the OTO I was a lead party in all proceedings.  Despite being given a legal venue in which to do so Ms Michaelson did not produce any evidence to support her claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             Your posting of this document repeats the defamation of the OTO, its members and me.
            </p>
            <p>
             I refer you to the Civil Law (Wrongs) Act 2002 (section 127) and demand that you:
            </p>
            <p>
             a) immediately remove the document and any references to it from your website,

             Can you show me the section of text you are referring to on the site? That is the largest link on the site so you will have to narrow it down for me. I am not responsible for all of the material posted on the site or that particular page as people are able to register and post their own content on the site. Therefore I am unable to say for certain who posted each separate comment on the site.

             The entire article authored by Reina Michaaelson should be removed as well as the text where, in the Comments section, you have posted (on Mon, 04/29/2013 - 17:02 — Lukes Dad) hyperlinks to federaljack.com/ebooks/ / Dr Reina Michaelson - Declarepeace.org.uk /

             So you believe the things which Reina Michaelson has exposed should be covered up. Are you some sort of paedophile too? What sort of sick person tries to stand over people to cover up for paedophiles? You are welcome to post a comment on the site to state your view, which is all that Reina has done as far as I can see.
