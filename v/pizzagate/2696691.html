            but for newbies i think its important to prepare the soil for them to be redpilled by making them appreciate the core motivation (how child rape gives them power through complicity / blackmail ) so cherrypick from this too   PRELUDE to PIZZAGATE (a red-piller's primer)

            Perhaps the most important thing you can talk about regarding this is the fact that it was 'debunked' according to the mainstream media, despite it never being investigated. There was some info posted way back where it shows the circle of deception clearly, with media outlets quoting police but police admitting no investigation etc.

            Maybe start with seeing if they’re aware of “ project mockingbird “ then they know how the media controls the narrative. Then introduce pizzagate ?

            When is your paper due? My husband wrote a couple of pizzagate papers for some of his classes also. I applaud you for your efforts!!

            I wrote a 3 part series and then stopped to focus on a different story for a while (Toy Freaks). I am writing this commment from my new account because my charger to my laptop died &amp; still waiting for the shipment of the replacement, but go look through some of my old posts if you want. I can't IM from this account yet due to not enough points. 
The executive summary linked on the sidebar is also great, but with all the new developments I think you should look through some of the old posts as well.

            There is also a Pizzagate Wiki on the sidebar. It's great.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just my two cents, for your professor's sake, beware of disinformation when you write and cite sources besides 8chan. Stick to either WikiLeaks or anything you can actually verify yourself through the sources cited on the articles you reference.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember what a beeeotch my journalism professor was. Good luck!!!

              Ha, yeah I don't hide I just get accused of being the enemy. I still remember the first time I got banned it was for posting about planned parenthood and baby body parts and I was accused of spam. Now I think I'm pissing off the mods because I'm out of practice adhering to the rules, or maybe it's because they don't like me anymore. Seems that some really lame and weak posts fly while most of mine need editing.

            I think you should begin with a brief explanation of code languages, giving perhaps a couple of non-pizzagate related examples. Then include the FBI code for paedophiles, before going on to the wikileaks examples of pedocode being used in the Podesta emails. Make the main body of work be about researchers finding examples of this code language being used before the wikileaks were published and how it snowballed into a global investigation into elite paedophile networks, and the push-back it has received from mainstream media and so-called "alt-media" with investigators being labelled "conspiracy theorists" while suspects bleached their online communications. Conclude with how you think this is going to affect future human relations between mainstream culture and a concerned public.

             This is a good example of going to primary sources.    There is no FBI code list.  The code list came from someone on 4chan not the FBI.  Later on people claimed this list came from the FBI.  It did not.

           <p>
            What I always feel important to point out is that the Pizzagate investigation has developed into an investigation of elite pedophilia crimes, and elite child trafficking, and that it is not only focused on the Dems, HRC, and the Podesta brothers, but that it is a non-partisan investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            And no, it's not about Hillary Clinton directing a child trafficking ring while sitting in a basement. ;-)

           </p>
           <p>
            First question:  What is pizzagate?  It's something that folks on here criticize reporters for when they try to define what it is, but it's actually pretty hard to explain what it is in a sentence or two.  It's not even easy to say when and why it started.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second question: how many words are you going for?  This is a pretty big chunk to cover.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             starting with all the emails that reference pizza and the sauces, the comet ping pong connections, the museum that overlooks the playground, etc.

             If I'm even allowed to write it. The meeting is this afternoon and I don't know how the environment is there or anything like that.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's what I'm worried about as well. From what I've seen the article length can be varied, so I'm going to have to work out the details if I do get the go ahead. And I want to focus on the eye popping stuff, not get too in depth but just enough so people will research it themselves and make their own judgement. After all that is what we were all about in the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm going to make references to the emails and the weird code (pizza, sauce, walnuts, etc.) comet ping pong and the musicians who play there, alefantis's instagram (get into details about the pictures), the pegasus museum. I am going to close it out somehow with the eight million children go missing in the world every year fact. I think that'll leave something of an impression hopefully.
            </p>
            <p>
             If there is something that anybody thinks I should get in, let me know.

               Got the go ahead! But not for this issue, apparently this one (that's due in by September 9th) already has two or three political articles. The next one, though, I have put my name to a slot!

              Just so you know, I'm a pizzagate skeptic.
             </p>
             <p>
              How are you going to deal with the issue of primary sources?  For example, how do you know there was code in the emails at all? What's the evidence for that?
             </p>
             <p>
              Also that Laura Silsby timeline is full of falsehoods.

             <p>
              I've debunked several issues with that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also is this a fact?

                 I do apologize - CNN stated that 800,000 children go missing every year not 8 million - here's the link for that. And they only seem to give an explanation for 1/4th of that number.

                OK.   Those are old numbers.  The numbers have been going down for about two decades.  The latest numbers are about 450-500K.
               </p>
               <p>
                But this big number does not mean 450,000 kids are kidnapped off the streets every year.  This is every time a child is reported as missing, even if it's just for a few hours and the kid is found safe.  The number of abductions is way, way smaller and the majority of kids being abducted is when a parent in the middle of a custody battles snatches the kids.

               <p>
                Is this for the article or your own understanding about pizzagate?
               </p>
               <p>
                By the way, the more I think about it, this is probably a great exercise in teaching journalism.  You can probably easily get a month of lessons how trying to pin down how pizzagate started and what caused it to start: Sorting Fact from Rumor on the internet, chasing down evidence on ephemeral digital media, weighing claims of fact from anonymous screennames, libel law, etc.  You could probably use these and more as an argument.
               </p>
               <p>
                As to your questions I can answer them and even back up my answers, but I don't know how much that matters to your story.  Does it matter what I know/believe?
               </p>
               <p>
                As a journalist what do you know about those emails and what do you know to be true?  In fact, what made you focus on those emails?  Have you already made assumptions of fact?
               </p>
               <p>
                There's a few different fields that try help us find out what is true. Journalism is one.  Science is another.  Law, Philosophy---particularly Logic is very helpful.  In the courtroom when they often use the phrase, Assuming Facts Not in Evidence.  For example a woman is found dead in a hotel room.
                <em>
                 At what time did you walk in and find her dead?
                </em>
                is a valid question.
                <em>
                 At what time did you walk in and find her poisoned?
                </em>
                has an assumption in it. If the prosecutor asked the second question, the defense lawyer made say *Objection, counselor is assuming facts not in evidence."  This means he has to prove she was poisoned first before asking that question.
               </p>
               <p>
                So it seems to me you have an assumption that coded language is being used.  In science, you can say you have a hypothesis that code is being used and then try and prove or disprove it is in fact code.  That might be hard to get to scientific certainly.  You could use logic.  Is there a rational explanation for the language they use?  As an outsider, who doesn't know how these folks speak, it's hard to start from a place of certainty.  The truth you don't know why they phrased this they way they did.
               </p>
               <p>
                There's a common phrase about the burden of proof used in Skepticism: Great claims require great evidence meaning it's up to someone making a great claim to provide sufficient evidence for that claim to be taken seriously.  If you walk in the house and tell me you've returned from the store, that's a hell of a lot more likely than if you walked and said you've returned from Antartica.  In this case the burden of proof lies on those making the claim A. They were speaking in code.  B. They have figured out which words are code and C. They know exactly how to decode those words.
               </p>
               <p>
                By the way, you may want to look up Libel law and Libel Per Se.  Only some states have Libel Per Se, but per se means the libel is so great they don't need to prove they were damaged and they win the case. It cuts out most of your defense and accusing someone of a crime is Libel Per Se.  All it would require is them showing they have never been convicted of that crime and they would win the case and damages.

                  There was a document in Clinton's state department emails that was mistakenly listed in Wikileaks as an email from 1-1-2001.  Based on that somebody claimed Clinton knew her for 10 years.  In reality the document was not an email at all.....in fact there's no TO address info or FROM address info.......this is because this document is not an email at all.  It was an attachment to an email and it was from 2010.  Another email in the Clinton collection shows what the document is and who found it and how it got sent to Clinton.  It all happened after Silsby was arrested.

            Hi there dicedtomatoes. That sounds like a worthy endeavor!
           </p>
           <p>
            We've got a bunch of resources in the sidebar, which you can view on mobile if you choose "view desktop site" in your browser settings. The Executive Summmary of Pizzagate Evidence, the Origins of the Pizzagate Movement and the
            <a href="https://archive.is/vcu4V">
             archives of the pizzagate wiki
            </a>
            (scroll down for timeline) are probably your best bet as far as where to start. The Origins article tells the story of some of the crazy multiplatform censorship that happened, which convinced a lot of there really was something large and nefarious going on.
