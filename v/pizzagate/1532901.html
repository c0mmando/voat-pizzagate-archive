<blockquote>
<p>ORIGIN:Since at least October 2016, some social media users have been echoing the belief that former Clinton Foundation CEO Eric Braverman is missing or in peril. Braverman, an attorney, headed the foundation from 2013 until he resigned that position in 2015.</p>
<p>Rumors regarding his whereabouts began swirling after a leaked document published via WikiLeaks showed his name mentioned in e-mails between Clinton staffers who believed he was furtively releasing information about the foundation\'s financial doings:</p>
<p><em>Eric Braverman, the Clinton Foundation CEO from 2013 until 2015, has apparently been missing since October. His absence has fueled speculations in the blogosphere but so far has been ignored by the media.</em></p>
<p><em>Some speculate, with good reason, that Braverman may have gone into hiding after an email mentioning his name was released by Wikileaks on October 22 of this year. In the March 2015 email exchange, Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden told Clinton campaign manager and confidant John Podesta there was a mole within the Clinton Foundation. Podesta in his reply told Tanden the mole was Braverman.</em></p>
<p>We found no evidence that Braverman is currently a missing person, nor that he has gone into hiding. The only evidence being proffered in support of this claim is the fact that Braverman has not used his Twitter account since October, but that\'s hardly compelling since he is an infrequent user of that social media platform:</p>
<p>The last evidence of Braverman’s public activity was October 12, when he posted his last tweet on Twitter. (Usually he tweets about once a month. His “husband,” Neil Brown, hasn’t tweeted since August, although he rarely tweets.) I left a voicemail on Braverman’s personal phone and sent him an email, but received no response. He is still listed as a lecturer at Yale University and, contrary to some reports, there is a record of his lectures going back several years. I contacted the press office and Braverman’s department at Yale and received no response.</p>
<p>The Yale campus has been closed for the holidays, which is likely why no response was received by the writer quoted above. However, Braverman is listed by the university as teaching his &quot;Innovation in Government and Society&quot; class in both the Fall 2016 semester and the upcoming Spring 2017 semester. He also has an active voicemail and e-mail address at the university (but didn\'t respond to our messages).</p>
<p>We were unable to reach a New Haven, Connecticut, police spokesman, but New York City and Washington D.C. police have no record of a missing person with his name, nor is Braverman listed on NamUs, a national database of missing persons maintained by the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The conspiracy theory that the Clintons have killed or disappeared numerous people they find politically inconvenient has been swirling for decades, but it reached a new fever pitch during the 2016 presidential election. On 24 October 2016, the conspiracy-mongering web site WhatDoesItMean.com started a false rumor claiming Braverman, an attorney and businessman, had applied for asylum in Russia after his name was revealed in a WikiLeaks dump.</p>

            I would say the textbook definition of a missing person is someone that hasn't been seen for months, has not used his social media accounts for months, is not responding to email messages or phone calls, and nobody knows where he is.

            Wow! That was hilarious... I was reading the Snopes.com article about Eric Braverman's "unproven" disappearance. And 75% of it was a series of unsuccessful attempts to track him down. Even his job can't vouch for him! Then they proceeded to explain how this is like many other "conspiracy theories" and ended with the fact that he is still missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I laughed for awhile! It reads like an Onion article. This is like saying "There are claims that when you eat a meatball, it is digested and the nutrients are absorbed followed by the waste product being removed in human feces. Actually, it is conspiracy theories like this that attempt to explain unknowns. There are reports of meatballs staying in the body for the entire life-cycle, and shrinking over time and becoming pimples. There is simply no perceptible evidence that meatballs are digested. So there is no reason to believe this."
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I realized... wait. This is real. They are actually trying to convince me that someone who is missing... is not missing.
           </p>
           <p>
            What kind of Jedi mind trick is this supposed to be? There are many unanswered questions about a great many things, and no one is publicly willing or able to ask them. The assumption that he is NOT missing seems less likely IF he was previously available, visible, active, working, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            One could surmise that if Braverman was active up until a certain chronological point in time, then it would be considered odd for that activity to immediately stop.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has anyone explored this angle? Forgive my ignorance if it has.
           </p>
           <p>
            Man, that article was hilarious.

            The article doesn't claim that they tried to call him, it claims that one of the sources of the rumor did. All the article says is that there is not sign of him, but that doesn't prove he is missing. Snopes is not to be trusted isn't it owned by mediamatters?

            Why even post this? Snopes has been outed  long ago as a shill org. This just gets them more clicks and attention. Ignore them. Except don't ignore the divorce case of David Mikkelson, that should be really good. wesearchr had a bounty on opening his divorce records, can't find it now.

            (1) If Braverman won't reply to a query from Snopes.com, who would he reply to? If Yale won't reply to a query from Snopes.com, who would it reply to?
           </p>
           <p>
            (2) The evidence that Braverman is missing is that nobody has been able to contact him and that nobody has seen him anywhere, while others associated with him ("husband," staff at Yale) are also not saying anything.

            This is not a conspiracy theory. People closely associated with the Clintons really have died or have disappeared and even Stratfor employees discussed in an internal email that Hillary had had Vince Foster murdered.

            Snopes at this point has zero credibility.  Less than zero.  If snopes said it, you can pretty much be sure the opposite is true.  Fuck those fatties.  And their cat.

            Gonna sound weird, but this is kinda useful. If you read this article the other way, Snopes literally tried to find him and failed. I just wish that they asked Yale generally whether he has been showing up to teach his classes - did no one in his same department pick up the phone?
