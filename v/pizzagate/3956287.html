<p>JANUARY 3, 2013, ..eBay’s hot new social commerce platforms aren’t coming from the giant Internet marketplace’s California headquarters. They’re conceptualized and launched by a team of 14 young Israeli geeks (and Marti, their “inspiration dog”) on <strong>Tel Aviv’s yuppified Rothschild Boulevard.</strong></p>
<p>Marti is the first to greet visitors to eBay’s Israel Social Center (ISC), opened in July last year...Right on Marti’s four heels comes <strong>Ron Gura, the former Israeli Air Force lieutenant who runs the ISC along with his sister-in-law, Maya Gura</strong>, and his Haifa childhood chums Matan Bar and Erez Dickman. (Another partner, Guy Schory, now heads new ventures for eBay Inc.).</p>
<p>.In 2009, the friends had cooked up <strong>The Gifts Project</strong> to facilitate online group gifting — what Gura calls “a nice mash-up of existing social platforms and payment platforms to bring online what you do anyway offline.” [<em>That\'s another rabbit hole]</em> .. Following a successful pilot as eBay Group Gifts in the 2010 holiday shopping season, the enterprise was acquired by eBay and morphed into the ISC — a self-contained, offline innovation development center under the purview of eBay VP-social commerce Don Bradford.</p>
<p>Bradford drops by from San José once every quarter, and eBay top banana John Donahoe came in September, declaring that “Israel is one of our industry’s leading hubs for technology innovation and talent.” eBay also owns Netanya-based shopping.com, and its PayPal subsidiary bought Tel Aviv’s Fraud Sciences in 2008.</p>

<p>The article goes on to describe 11 companies founded in this location.. one of them is The Gifts Project, another one is Wibiya..</p>
<p>I came across Wibiya when I was researching a woman known as the &quot;madam of Houston&quot; who ran a prostitution ring for the rich and the powerful in Texas. She had several website including one called WAZALA <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3952228/25005604">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/3952228/25005604</a></p>
<p>You can read all about that at the link.  Yossi Vardi is one the organizing team for The Israel Conference™. And so is <strong>Isabel Maxwell.</strong></p>
<p>For me eBay is synonymous with the Hampstead children: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2614904">The Hampstead children and Ricky Dearman turn up at the 2017 Ebay Business Awards</a>.

             <p>
              BOSTON – Six former employees of eBay, Inc. have been charged with leading a cyberstalking campaign targeting the editor and publisher of a newsletter that eBay executives viewed as critical of the company. The alleged harassment included sending the couple anonymous, threatening messages, disturbing deliveries – including a box of live cockroaches, a funeral wreath and a bloody pig mask – and conducting covert surveillance of the victims.
             </p>
             <p>
              James Baugh, 45, of San Jose, Calif., eBay’s former Senior Director of Safety &amp; Security, was arrested today and charged by criminal complaint with conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.
             </p>
             <p>
              David Harville, 48, of New York City, eBay’s former Director of Global Resiliency, was arrested this morning in New York City on the same charges and will make an initial appearance via videoconference in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York.
             </p>
             <p>
              In addition the following defendants were charged in an Information unsealed today: Stephanie Popp, 32, of San Jose, eBay’s former Senior Manager of Global Intelligence; Stephanie Stockwell, 26, of Redwood City, Calif., the former manager of eBay’s Global Intelligence Center (GIC); Veronica Zea, 26, of San Jose, a former eBay contractor who worked as an intelligence analyst in the GIC; and Brian Gilbert, 51, of San Jose, a former Senior Manager of Special Operations for eBay’s Global Security Team. They are each charged with  conspiracy to commit cyberstalking and conspiracy to tamper with witnesses and will make appearances in federal court in Boston at a later date.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to the charging documents, the victims of the cyberstalking campaign were a Natick couple who are the editor and publisher of an online newsletter that covers ecommerce companies, including eBay, a multinational ecommerce business that offers platforms for consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer transactions. Members of the executive leadership team at eBay followed the newsletter’s posts, often taking issue with its content and the anonymous comments underneath the editor’s stories.

              It is alleged that in August 2019, after the newsletter published an article about litigation involving eBay, two members of eBay’s executive leadership team sent or forwarded text messages suggesting that it was time to “take down” the newsletter’s editor.
             </p>
             <p>
              In response, Baugh, Harville, Popp, Gilbert, Zea, Stockwell, and others allegedly executed a three-part harassment campaign. Among other things, several of the defendants ordered anonymous and disturbing deliveries to the victims’ home, including a preserved fetal pig, a bloody pig Halloween mask, a funeral wreath, a book on surviving the loss of a spouse, and pornography – the last of these addressed to the newsletter’s publisher but sent to his neighbors’ homes.
             </p>
             <p>
              As part of the second phase of the campaign, some of the defendants allegedly sent private Twitter messages and public tweets criticizing the newsletter’s content and threatening to visit the victims in Natick. The documents allege that Baugh, Gilbert, Popp and another eBay security employee planned these messages to become increasingly disturbing, culminating with “doxing” the victims (i.e., publishing their home address). It is alleged that the very same group intended then to have Gilbert, a former Santa Clara police captain, approach the victims with an offer to help stop the harassment that the defendants were secretly causing, in an effort to promote good will towards eBay, generate more favorable coverage in the newsletter, and identify the individuals behind the anonymous comments.
             </p>
             <p>
              The third phase of the campaign allegedly involved covertly surveilling the victims in their home and community. According to the complaint, Harville and Zea registered for a software development conference to explain their trip to Boston on Aug. 15, 2019. Baugh, Harville, and Zea (and later Popp) allegedly drove to the victims’ home in Natick several times, with Harville and Baugh intending at one point to break into the victims’ garage and install a GPS tracking device on their car. As protection in the event they were stopped by local police, Baugh and Harville allegedly carried false documents purporting to show that they were investigating the victims as “Persons of Interest” who had threatened eBay executives. The victims spotted the surveillance, however, and notified the Natick police, who began to investigate. The police learned that Zea had rented one of the cars used by the defendants and reached out to eBay for assistance.
             </p>
             <p>
              Aware that the police were investigating, the defendants allegedly sought to interfere with the investigation by lying to the police about eBay’s involvement while pretending to offer the company’s assistance with the harassment, as well as by lying to eBay’s lawyers about their involvement. At one point, for example, Baugh, Gilbert, Popp, and Stockwell allegedly plotted to fabricate another eBay “Person of Interest” document that could be offered to the police as a lead on some of the harassing deliveries. As the police and eBay’s lawyers continued to investigate, the defendants allegedly deleted digital evidence that showed their involvement, further obstructing what had by then become a federal investigation...

             Thanks for the link.  I've seen cyberstalking with anyone who got involved with the Hampstead case and did not remain anonymous.  It's a thing that satanic cults do.. Scientologists too...it's a cult thing. They spend their time smearing reputations and ridiculing people in order to intimidate. They behave like a hornet of wasps. And to an onlooker they do look mentally deranged.

             Mr Green, who was in his 60s had taken a passenger on a

             I thought that the word 'gift' might be significant.... for those with a background in philosophy and education you might know about the kindergarten movement which was started by Friedrich Froebel and his fame for the 'gifts'... Well, I suddenly wondered if there was an occult background and sure enough...

             From this move would spawn Kindergartens across western Europe during the remaining decade, and into the Scandinavian countries, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and India, they also took root in America, Canada, Japan, Russia, Turkey, France and Switzerland for the remainder of the 19th century. In this regard from the point 1851 and it’s banning in Prussia (Illuminati base),
             <strong>
              Froebel would become the Tavistock programme
             </strong>
             , albeit Tavistock had not been announced to the world in its current form, what was presented as the study of the effects of shell shock as Tavistock was formed in the 20th century, was the implementation of the new mind control system now in the hands of those controlling the British Crown.

            <p>
             The malware, which is frequently bundled with freeware and shareware, presents as a browser toolbar and search engine. Once installed, Conduit changes the user’s default browser home page and search engine and redirects URLs and Web searches. Conduit includes adware and spyware, and has rootkit capabilities that make it very difficult for people without advanced tech skills to remove it.
