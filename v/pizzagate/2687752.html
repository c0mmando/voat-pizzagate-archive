            I was just looking through Wikileaks and noticed the Madeleine McCann documents that they have. I seriously doubt something like that would make it onto Wikileaks if it had no importance regarding the other subjects that they cover. I believe it was definitely something to do with her genetic mutation and research...
           </p>
           <p>
            I also noticed that any time there is a major kidnapping there is always someone willing to publish a book or website debunking it and blaming the parents claiming the child must be dead. Seems kind of weird how they are always able to find a cadaver dog to sniff the smell of a dead body on everything they want.

            I recently heard two sisters interviewed. Their mother was a well-known and renowned artist. From the outside, the family lived a bohemian, free spirited life. Their home had constant visitors--intellectuals, artists and famous writers. The sisters were pimped out by their mother to the visitors. They were middle aged men raping the 14 and 16 year old sisters.  This is the way the elite live. The mores of society don't apply to them

            Not surprised.  Her mother was accused of sexual abuse by a 16 yr. old boy.  Both of the parents were pedophiles.  We know that Clement was accused by young girls, so the apple won't fall far from the tree.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3641876/Dark-secrets-Freuds-Did-wife-47-seduced-boy-16-turn-blind-eye-Clement-s-depravity.html">
             http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3641876/Dark-secrets-Freuds-Did-wife-47-seduced-boy-16-turn-blind-eye-Clement-s-depravity.html

           <p>
            But behind the public image there were dark secrets. One emerged 15 years ago when author Jonathan ‘Joss’ Self, a friend of the Freuds and brother of the writer Will Self, revealed in a memoir, Self Harm, that he was only 16 years when he started an affair with a married woman who was 30 years his senior.
           </p>
           <p>
            He named her only as ‘June’ and it went on for five years until he met his first wife. June is, of course, the real first name of Jill Freud, and it soon emerged that she was the married women involved.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Incidentally, she is said to have been C. S. Lewis’s inspiration for the character of Lucy in the Narnia stories — in World War II she was evacuated to Oxford and was taken in by Lewis and his lover Jane Moore.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Self wrote of the affair with Freud: ‘I learned an awful lot, for me the experience was all positive . . . June taught and I learned; she nurtured and I grew; sometimes, with the callous indifference of a teenager I inadvertently hurt her. I loved June and she loved me. Nevertheless, despite the strength and depth of our feelings for each other, we both understood the impossibility of our situation . . .
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh my God.  He still doesn't realize it.  The Grooming is still evident.

             Yes, what is most striking is that she just doesn't seem to "get" that incest is one of the most harmful things for a child . . . or maybe she doesn't care.

             Anyways, it's obvious that the only reason she doesn't do it is because it's illegal, and she considers it to be only a social thing which could be ignored if it weren't for the legal system.

              Did you notice the CS Lewis reference?  CS Lewis Alice in Wonderland.  She was taken in by Lewis and his lover Jane Moore.  That sticks out to me like a sore thumb.  Red Flag Indeed.  Just like the home she later created in her marriage to Freud.  A pedo couple and abuse.  It was all OK to her because she was allowed to live with those two.  Her parents allowed it.  Speaks volumes.

              Yes, if only those pesky people would do the right thing and legalize it.  She has been heavily groomed herself.  Think about it.  It goes back to her grandfather and even before.  It is systemic and has been part of their upbringing for decades.  Possibly for at least a century.  They know nothing else. This is how it is passed down.
