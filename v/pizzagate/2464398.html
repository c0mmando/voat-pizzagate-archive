            Not surprising since The City of London (Llundain) is the seat of the NWO and original home to The East India Co. and their bloodline banks: Bank of England and HSBC (Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation- opium-drug money).

            "Lud (Welsh: Lludd map Beli Mawr), according to Geoffrey of Monmouth's legendary History of the Kings of Britain and related medieval texts, was a king of Britain in pre-Roman times who founded London and was buried at Ludgate. He was the eldest son of Geoffrey's King Heli, and succeeded his father to the throne. He was succeeded, in turn, by his brother Cassibelanus. Lud may be connected with the Welsh mythological figure Lludd Llaw Eraint,"

            "Lludd Llaw Ereint, "Lludd of the Silver Hand", son of Beli Mawr, is a legendary hero from Welsh mythology."
"Beli Mawr ("Beli the Great") was an ancestor figure in Middle Welsh literature and genealogies. He is the father of Cassivellaunus, Arianrhod, Lludd Llaw Eraint, Llefelys, and Afallach. In certain medieval genealogies he is listed as the husband of Anna, cousin of Mary, mother of Jesus. According to the Welsh Triads, Beli and D√¥n were the parents of Arianrhod, but the mother of Beli's other children‚Äîand the father of D√¥n's other children‚Äîis not mentioned in the medieval Welsh literature. Several royal lines in medieval Wales traced their ancestry to Beli."

            Sir Thomas Myddelton, original investor in the East India Company, was of Welsh royal descent. He is the likely ancestor of a President of the
(American) Continental Congress and his son, a Signer of the Declaration of independence.

             LONDON 1814:
Lord Wellington faced a cash crunch fighting Napoleon: "'It is obvious that an immediate and large supply of money from England is necessary.' It was now that John Charles Herries, Commissary-in-Chief, turned to Nathan Rothschild....he suspected Nathan could help because of the position he had carved out in the gold market. As Nathan later explained:
            </p>
            <p>
             When I settled in London, the East India Company had 800,000 British pounds worth of gold to sell. I went to the sale and bought it all. I knew the Duke of Wellington must have it. I had bought a great many of his bills at discount. The government sent for me and said they must have it. When they got it, they did not know how to get it to Portugal. I undertook all that and I sent it to France: and that was the best business I ever did."
DRAGONS by Liam Byrne  p.194
            </p>
            <p>
             "Key to the Rothschild's strength was the brothers' ability to co-ordinate across the field of Europe access to the huge liquid market of London, where Nathan was now the family's 'general in chief'. By 1825, he was so powerful that when crisis came, he was strong enough even to save the Bank of England itself." DRAGONS, p.199
            </p>
            <p>
             "Before 1824, the Rothschilds had married into other leading Jewish families. From 1824, they tended to marry each other. Of twenty-one marriages between Mayer Amschel's descendants, fifteen were between his direct descendants. In July 1824, James married his own niece, in 1826, Nathan's eldest daughter married Salomon's son Anselm. It was an alliance that stood them in good stead..."
DRAGONS, p. 205
            </p>
            <p>
             "The 99 year British lease on Hong Kong expired in July allowing the Red  Chinese to take over. Hundreds of newspaper stories and TV reports have  covered this event but not one revealed how England first gained control of  Hong Kong! The truth lies buried in the family line of David Sassoon, "The Rothschilds of The Far East," and their monopoly over the opium trade."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Solomon Sassoon (son of David Sassoon) moved to Hong Kong and ran the family business there until his death in 1894. Later, the entire family moved to England because with modern communications they could operate their financial empire from their luxurious estates in London. They socialized with royalty and Edward Albert. Sassoon married Aline Caroline de Rothschild in 1887 which linked their fortune with that of the Rothschilds. The Queen also had Edward knighted. "
            </p>
            <p>
             "Franklin D. Roosevelt's fortune was inherited from his maternal grandfather Warren Delano. In 1830 he was a senior partner of Russell &amp; Company. It was their merchant fleet which carried Sassoon's opium to China and returned with tea. "
            </p>
            <p>
             "Arthur Abraham David Sassoon was born on 25 May 1840.[1] He was the fifth son of David Sassoon (1792‚Äì1864), a Jewish trader of cotton and opium in China who served as the Treasurer of Baghdad from 1817 to 1829...He was an original member of the Board of Directors of the Hong Kong Bank, which later became known as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Hong Kong subsidiary of HSBC .[4] For many years he was a director of David Sassoon &amp; Company of Leadenhall Street, London, a trading company founded by his father Reuben David Sassoon."

               "We have the Remembrancer in the UK .... The Remembrancer is not some weird character in the Game of Thrones, the Remembrancer is real. The Remembrancer is the title of an almost completely unknown but powerful functionary who, when Parliament is sitting, has a special seat to the right of the Speaker in the House of Commons. He also has a mirror image seat in the Lords. His sole purpose is to scrutinise and influence legislation relating to the City of London, and hence any legislation that relates to banks and banking. Nobody elected this representative into our parliament.
              </p>
              <p>
               The current Remembrancer is Paul Double, a former barrister, and he has been in the role since 2003. In that time, he has not provided a single interview to the media. He has a budget of ¬£5.3m, and a ¬£500,000 staff which includes six lawyers......... The City of London (The Square Mile) is the only area of the UK over which parliament has no authority. Instead, it is the Corporation that imposes on Parliament, with the Remembrancer.Ôªø"
