<p>As another voater said, sorry can\'t remember who, &quot;It\'s like this Dr. Phil survivor describes pizzagate to a T&quot;.   This could actually preceed some major red-pilling of it\'s mass audience - an orange pill.  The upcoming protest march <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1738660">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1738660</a> will dovetail neatly with the growing awareness of a large segment of America that beyond the pale sex and pedophilia trafficking of infants and children who are kept in slavery conditions for politicians and other elites does in fact exist and is verifiable.   
</p>
<p>Interestingly, this statement following reveals that at least in one market in the more southern part of the East Coast, the London Attack news coincidentally knocked the airing of the Dr. Phil sex trafficking episode off the network just 5 minutes in.  And the network never returned to the show.   <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1739206/8513987">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1739206/8513987</a></p>

<p>Are you saying you experienced the Dr. Phil show sex trafficking episode actually interrupted on the East Coast by news of the London attack?  I just want to make sure I am understanding you right because that is pretty important.</p>
<p>[–] xxxxx 0 points (+0|-0) 25 minutes ago </p>
<p>Yeah, it was like 5 minutes into the show then &quot;breaking news&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could anyone else on the East Coast weigh in about this?   I asked some more questions in PM but I want to preserve their privacy so they understandably may or may not weigh in further on where they are on the East Coast.</p>
<p>Either way, similarly to the Welch incident and the traffic camera adjustments, is it possible we are witnessing a false flag distraction with the London Attack and the Dr. Phil show was at least one of the reasons?  Sounds a bit far fetched but is it with all that we are aware of?  
</p>
<p>I found this statement online &quot;Dr. Phil comes on twice a day here. I am on the east coast. He comes on at 5-6 p.m. and then 11:p.m. here on Channel 3 during the week.&quot;    
</p>
<p>It would be great to crowdsource how widespread the Dr. Phil sex trafficking show blackout was because of the London Attack news.  Please weigh in.</p>',

            Of course. Also yesterday, It was confirmed that Obama had wired Trump, although the Propaganda Press tried to suggest it was an accident. So yeah, they are fighting for survival, they constantly do hoaxes and false flags. And anytime you hear a story with a Muslim blowing up people and saying "Praise Allah" You know it is CIA/Mossad production. That nonsense is played out. This is a distraction as is the North Korea psyop.

              Their plan is absolutely devastate the US:   Here is Deagle.com's population forcasts for the year 2025:

              They predict our population will go from 320 million to 66 million.  Our average earning will drop to less than 1/5 of what it is now.   That's their plan.

               Deagle says it is forecasting predicting an economic fall in the US and a shift of populations to South America and Asia.  They have a big paragraph at the bottom = "Sorry to disappoint many of you with our forecast. It is getting worse and worse every year since the beginning of the pre-crisis in 2007. It is already said that this website is non-profit, built on spare time and we provide our information and services AS IS without further explanations and/or guarantees. We are not linked to any government in any way, shape or form. We are not a death or satanic cult or arms dealers as some BS is floating around the internet on this topic. Take into account that the forecast is nothing more than a model whether flawed or correct. It is not God's word or a magic device that allows to foresee the future."

                It is a very odd site.   Zero advertising.   I could not find an 'about us' page.   It doesn't seem like a site run by hobbyists.    Why have a page predicting populations in the year 2025?

                 it hardly counts as true evidence of what "they" are planning.  It appears to rely heavily on predictions of Ebola running wild.

                  I don't recall making a claim that it was hard evidence.   I think what i said is that it is a very odd site.    Tons of very specific information.   You can go to the map and zoom into see where military forces are - all around the globe.    And no, what it said about the US was about a an economic catastrophe, such as the banks suddenly not willing to loan any more money to the treasury.   They did mention Ebola too.   It seems to me that the only reason for having a page that shows population in the year 2025 is to highlight what they think is coming soon.    I note that it is entirely consistent with this account:
                  <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/illuminati/svali2_13.htm">
                   http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/illuminati/svali2_13.htm
                  </a>
                  which outlines the economic collapse of the USA, and she mentions the year 2020.   So yes, no proof of anything - just like all pizzagate stuff.  Just things that make you go -  huh, that's odd.

                   So it sounded like you were taking it pretty seriously.  It is definitely an odd site.  If you read the blue print down below the forecast charts, they say the forecast relies heavily on massive Ebola deaths  which then causes an economic crash.

                    Yeah,  I should have been more careful.   I was stating what I believe, not presenting proof.   As for why I believe what I do,  I'll provide some links below.
This is an amazingly detailed account from a Illuminati cult member that isn't addled like most of the escapees:

                    Certainly Hollywood has been coming out more and more.   For example, the 8.5 foot tall bronze satanic statue placed in Detroit:
                    <a href="http://www.desireemmondesir.com/home/2015/8/2/satanism">
                     http://www.desireemmondesir.com/home/2015/8/2/satanism
                    </a>
                    An 8 foot bronze statue isn't  the kind of thing that 19 year old teenagers who wear all black and have nose rings can afford.    Then we have the Arch of B'aal put up in Trafalgar Square in London:
                    <a href="https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/75760/despite-earlier-denials-arch-temple-baal-stand-nyc/#Y43a34OM0JMAOJ8o.97">
                     https://www.breakingisraelnews.com/75760/despite-earlier-denials-arch-temple-baal-stand-nyc/#Y43a34OM0JMAOJ8o.97
                    </a>
                    and another one in NYC:
                    <a href="http://wakingtimesmedia.com/spirit-violence-rises-america-following-unveiling-harbinger-baal-new-york/">
                     http://wakingtimesmedia.com/spirit-violence-rises-america-following-unveiling-harbinger-baal-new-york/
                    </a>
                    As I understand it,  B'aal liked child sacrifice.
                    <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/09/the-harbinger-of-baal-appears-in-nyc/">
                     http://www.wnd.com/2016/09/the-harbinger-of-baal-appears-in-nyc/
                    </a>
                    As for the reduction in population,   we have the Georgia Guidestones which announce that the world will have a population held at 500Million:
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones">
                     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Guidestones
                    </a>
                    And we have the Denver Airport with the super-creepy murals depicting death of children with a Nazi soldier holding an Arabic sword, followed by some kind of utopia:   (And gigantic Blucifer out front)
                    <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_denver05.htm">
                     http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_denver05.htm
                    </a>
                    And finally, there's Deagel predicting a massive die-off in the States but not in China or Russia:
                    <a href="http://www.deagel.com/country/forecast.aspx">
                     http://www.deagel.com/country/forecast.aspx
                    </a>
                    So no, there is no proof, but I think I'm getting the picture.   I think they are responsible for our crushing national debt,  for getting us into the Iraq and Afghanistan  wars, for the social change away from families and towards homosexual and transgender culture to lower our birth rate.   I think they have been in control of both political parties for a very long time.   Things are going nuts now because Trump is not one of them, or was one and betrayed them.

                     This is a good write up, except I believe the Arches didn't go off as planned, or 1 of them didn't   I like the Vigilent Citizen site which I"m sure you are aware of and has covered most of what you linked.   They might very well be planning, and may believe they can do all that BUT they are flawed and frankly if they cannot even pull off rigging a US election I don't think they are going to see any of their major plans realized.

                    <p>
                     It is one thing to fund a movie or erect a statue, it is quite another to actually pull off eliminating half of humanity - a species that fights tooth and nail for it's young and for survival when threatened.  I really do see a historic shift happening and am hopeful.  The Deagle site is the weakest link in the whole thing, I really wouldn't put much stock in their website or their particular forecasting when you put forth your arguments.  Just my opinion.  I always am a bit of an optimist despite my deep cynicism.  There is also a whole lot to be said for inertia - it takes real cataclysms to disrupt massive systems.  The worst thing I've seen get pulled off is that massive movement of people they flushed into Europe and upwards from South America.   That is the worst face of the elites to me, trying to force populations together using war, starvation and violence.

            ET Williams on Youtube accused Comey of being a pedophile, he would not have done so if he did not have the facts. In light of all the evidence it is clear that they are doing everything they can to supress the information. Leaks are occuring everywhere. Dr Phill show might have made the audience connect the dots and look into pizzagate. Mass public awakening dawns. Trey Gowdy is well aware if what is happening. Internal war is raging between white hat agents and satanists (metaphor). London was a false flag following the script of Niece, Berlin and Melbourne attacks - Peekay Truth and others did amazing videos exposing them. Expect more false flags, more diversions.

             do you mean victims of sex trafficking and the Dr. Phil show?  or victims of the London attack.  I take it you mean the Dr. Phil show might help others come forward - yes, very true.

            The "London attack" indeed has all the appearances of another fear-mongering hoax, including a concurrent terror drill that took place 3 days ago in London.

              It was a realistic terror drill complete with fake terrorists and hostages and everything, 3 days prior. Most people don't even know these kinds of drills are staged, I bet.

            It gave them an excuse for sure. Let me tell you this. The Friday before the election early morning Breitbart and Drudge put out the story of Podesta and the Eric Prince that morning. That morning Fox News was off the air until almost noon. Also, Rush Limbaugh had callers flood his phone line with people saying what was going on. Rush said they better not be screwing with us because people are going to be upset.  I tried to tweet articles out that morning and both sites were blocked for tweeting. Called it error unable to send articles. Remember these articles were right before election saying Podesta was in spirit cooking and HRC was into child trafficking, etc., people were still early voting in  NC. I think they thought Fox was going to say something or somebody would tweet them so they shut them all down. So in answer to your question, I believe the networks blocked it out purposely from showing on east coast.  You control what people hear and see, you will control the masses.

             If everyone will check Wikileaks released the most damning Podesta emails Nov. 7 th. A giant DDOS attack occurred against them preventing a stall from some getting posted. DDOS denial of service attacks also occurred on the east coast as well. And against individual companies.

            First, think we have to hear from those covering the London story to know what really happened.

            Story of what "really happened" is something we usually get quite a bit later.

            Truly I had a more vague idea of it being evidence that points to a crime but does not prove it, hence a "mountain" of it may be enough to at least make a case in court.
           </p>
           <p>
            For a few things, google is still somewhat of a friend - Here's a quick definition.   Circumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact—like a fingerprint at the scene of a crime. By contrast, direct evidence supports the truth of an assertion directly—i.e., without need for any additional evidence or inference.

             actually you bring up a good point - is he going to have any blowback?   He's pretty tough.   If he's in our corner and his firey wife, it's only a good thing.

            More likely reason for that false flag, was it was meant to deflect from the breaking Nunes wiretapping assertion.  This story was picking up steam right before the London attack...

             Its not a false flag. Its a jihad attack.
A false flag would have the characteristics of blunting the resurgence of the redpilled right. A jihadi attack sends more people to the Right. 
This jihadi attack comes a) 1 year anniversary of the brussels attack 2) right after Erdogan tells muslims to attack Europeans and breed

              you/we dont know 100%, we dont know for sure.. you can assert there is no connection.. but there still could be.
im guessing this episode was aired on this specific date for a reason.. perhaps to coincide with the anniversary as a plausible excuse/explanation .. Those good people working hard to get this story produced and aired are not the same people who decide when it airs and so on.. so there can be a real mix of motives and overlapping factors.. It could well be a distraction thats got a built in alibi/cover story.. these guys are more than capable of that kind of foolery. 
these kinds of "war games" involve a room full of people strategizing on the right measure or counter measure, they are on the defense and im guessing running a 24/7 war room kind of public relations and military strategist approach to attempt to control/manage the PG problem.

               Am I crazy in harbouring some doubt?  I saw this and thought it a massive red pill gift; a story that would convince, and have shared it accordingly and I'm sure many others have done the same.   I just worry about the damage of a future redaction.  A later 'sensational confession' episode of some sort.   I hate to doubt, especially knowing what we know, but lately trust don't come easy.  It's "flag season".  What can I say?

              It definitely looks like a genuine attack and people almost certainly died from what I can deduce but this doesn't mean it's not a false flag.  The timing of this attack is an opportune moment for the British hegemony and the 'War on Terror' as it advances the dialectic in myriad ways.

             This. James Comey's Congressional Hearing was all about the Russia narrative. They wanted to kill two birds with one stone by both getting Trump impeached over his 'fake' ties to Russia and having an excuse to 'go to war' with Russia. Something the elite have been striving for for quite some time now. Hillary was pushing that narrative very hard, during the presidential race.

             if you have a good link on that put it in your comment.   I don't know about it myself, there are probably others who don't either.  It's been a busy day.

            Please school me if I have made a mistake - I will edit.  I may not have the proper idea of it, I am just conversant with it as it has been used around here.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT:  Definition:   Circumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a conclusion of fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            So my conclusion would be - Big Ben attack was timed at least in part to knock Dr. Phil airing off of East Coast markets.    The evidence is, we know it happened at least in one place.   I hope other east coasters to weigh in.The 4chan image adds to the picture.

               Thank you .  So a False Flag today would make perfect sense.  The Royals would probably be in charge of this orchestration or order.  They are probably sick and tired of the attention we have been getting as of late.  Someone as big as Dr. Phil could really gain a lot of attention and press if this thing really took off.

                   I am sorry but I don't have a twitter account and am a real twit when it comes to using my phone.  Maybe someone else can?  I was hoping someone would see it and offer.  I really think it is a great idea and I think things are starting to boil over and will start going our way soon.....

                    I don't have one either.   Honestly we need to all get them for just the one purpose and retweet each other to get things going.  I have seen "twitter brigades" on other sites and never joined, but for this and only for this, I would do it if others would.  Think about it and tell me your thoughts.  honestly we'd need I think 5 or so - there are probably a lot of people here on twitter already.  if any of them see this weigh in.

                    You don't have to use your phone btw, you can "tweet" from your laptop.  It is just an online account you sign into and send a message from basically.

               The elite have covered up the sra networks and now it's finally coming out, thanks to podesta, it wouldn't surprise me if they pulled off a terror attack for a distraction, but I have a feeling that this time it's different very different
