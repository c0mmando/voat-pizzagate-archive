<p>While studying the strange coincidence of James Comey\'s presence in an Iowa cornfield this July, a day before University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts disappeared, I <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2691330">wrote another Voat post describing</a> how animal and plant genome research was the common thread connecting Comey\'s tweets about Iowa cornfields, Elwood the giant gnome, the Iowa State University Campus and the University of Iowa where Mollie Tibbetts was enrolled in the psychology department. </p>
<p>The University of Iowa psychology department was the subject of a raid by a radical animal rights group named the Animal Liberation Front in 2004. I have since discovered that the FBI has an obsessive interest in hunting down and eliminating &quot;eco-terrorists groups&quot;. Could this be because animal abuse shares an intrinsic link with child abuse? Why were Robert Mueller and James Comey\'s FBI so determined to eradicate &quot;the green scare&quot;? Were they afraid animal rights activists were getting too close to child abuse/trafficking centers?</p>
<p>ANIMAL LIBERATION FRONT\'S 2004 RAID ON THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA\'S PSYCHOLOGY LABS</p>
<p>The FBI has been investigating the Animal Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front for years. The ALF raided the University of Iowa, rescuing hundreds of lab animals at the Psychology Dept\'s Spence and Seashore Labs and destroyed computers containing years of research. The ALF claimed responsibility for the attack and posted a video and comprehensive documentation about the raid, including the names of professors and the work they were involved in such as vivisection, electric shock treatments and drug addiction. The ALF stated that the raid was carried out to halt the barbaric research of the UI Psychology Department’s 7 primary animal researchers and details the cruel and abusive testing carried out on lab animals if you have the stomach to read it <a href="http://www.animalliberationfront.com/ALFront/Actions-USA/iowabreakin.htm">here</a>. </p>
<p>The raid was the largest and most successful operation of its kind, and horrified academics condemned the raid in the strongest possible terms.</p>
<p>FBI HEAVILY INVESTED IN ELIMINATING ANIMAL LIBERATION FRONT</p>
<p>Interestingly, in May, 2004, a few months before the UI raid, John Lewis, FBI Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI testified before the Senate on the ALF and <a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/testimony/animal-rights-extremism-and-ecoterrorism">said</a> the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In recent years, the Animal Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front have become the most active criminal extremist elements in the United States.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In conclusion, the FBI has made the prevention and investigation of animal rights extremists/eco-terrorism matters a domestic terrorism investigative priority. The FBI and all of our federal, state and local law enforcement partners will continue to strive to address the difficult and unique challenges posed by animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists. Despite the continued focus on international terrorism, we in the FBI remain fully cognizant of the full range of threats that confront the United States.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, despite their aggressive stance, the FBI was unable to uncover any leads in the Iowa University raid, and six years after the raid, the FBI admitted that their investigation had stalled and had produced no conviction even though the case <a href="https://globegazette.com/news/iowa/article_11bfb302-fbf6-11df-bd05-001cc4c002e0.html">was said</a> to be &quot;a priority for the FBI, which collaborated with federal prosecutors, UI police and the Joint Terrorism Task Force. Hundreds of interviews were conducted, and investigators collected and analyzed extensive amounts of evidence.&quot; </p>
<p>Although the active part of the investigation was concluded this 2010 article states there are still ongoing investigations into other potential criminal activities that came to light during the course of the investigation.</p>
<p>In 2005, a year later, the ALF was included in a United States Department of Homeland Security planning document listing a number of domestic terrorist threats on which the U.S. government expected to focus resources. Operation Backfire was a multi-agency criminal investigation, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), into destructive acts in the name of animal rights and environmental causes in the United States described as eco-terrorism by the FBI/</p>
<p>Environmental activists coined the term &quot;Green Scare&quot; to refer to legal action by the US government against the radical environmental movement. The FBI and the government had classified eco-terrorism as the No. 1 domestic terrorism threat — even though so-called eco-terrorism crimes in the United States were rare and never fatal. </p>
<p>A Vermont Law Review <a href="http://www.greenisthenewred.com/blog/wp-content/Images/vermont_law_review_potter_green_scare.pdf">article</a> points out that, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This disproportionate, heavy-handed government crackdown on the animal-rights and environmental movements, and the reckless use of the word “terrorism,” is the result of a carefully coordinated political campaign by corporations and the politicians who represent them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UNIVERSITY OF IOWA ACCUSED OF 244 ANIMAL DEATHS BY ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP IN MAY, 2018</p>
<p>Despite the University of Iowa\'s strong public assurances after the 2004 ALF raid that animals were being treated humanely, SAEN, an animal rights organization, <a href="https://www.press-citizen.com/story/news/education/university-of-iowa/2018/05/02/watchdog-group-accuses-university-iowa-animal-abuse/573070002/">recently accused</a> the University of causing the deaths of 244 animals by negligence and abuse in 2016 and 2017 and demanded an investigation.</p>
<p>SAEN\'s attention was focused on the University of Iowa after a goat escaped from the university lab facility where it was  leading the university and law enforcement on a 10-day chase. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goat, which was part of orthopedic injuries experimentation, was euthanized upon capture to the dismay of animal-rights groups keeping tabs on the goat search. The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service investigated the goat\'s treatment following a complaint by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and cited the university for mishandling the animal. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Did this public attention on the University of Iowa in May bring former FBI chief James Comey to Iowa so he could prevent further snooping around by animal rights activists into genetic experimentation by the University of Iowa and Iowa State University? Like Elwood the Gnome, the guardian of Reiman Garden, was Comey called to Iowa to fulfill the legendary mandate of gnomes to &quot;Protect the Garden&quot;? Was Mollie Tibbetts possibly a whistle blower on animal abuse in the University of Iowa psychology department? Was an example made of Mollie to deter other whistle blowers from exposing the activities of the mad genome scientists in Iowa?</p>',

            Fox news just said that at her funeral her father told the townspeople to "look toward the light" just sayin sounds pretty illuminatilike to me. Also I have heard that there are codes for the elites in the news by the colors they wear and the numbers they use in the stories.

            While I don't believe in this angle of the Mollie T. story (Comey on cornfield, next to Gnome etc.), I think you found a very interesting question: In which way are MK Ultra experiments on humans linked to pössible torture experiments on animals?

             It's something worth exploring. I never thought about it, either. Why are animal rights activists targeted by the FBI so aggressively? It's not a far stretch to imagine how the FBI might potentially target pizzagate activists in the same way, someday.

             I understand your concern about ALF. I don't condone their activities, but I do admire their convictions about rescuing animals who are being abused and tortured, esp. when one sees how the FBI demonized them and made them Public Enemy #1.

            There's plenty of other footage from the 50s and 60s of animal experimentation that may be directly linked to MK Ultra. You are on to something.

             Could this be because animal abuse shares an intrinsic link with child abuse? (There are many scholarly articles documenting that animal abuse is an indicator for child abuse.)

            That is a very interesting insight...hmm....

            Just like the rash of shitty TV shows with child actors was likely created to be a honey hole for Hollywood pedos, animal experimental labs could be an excuse to cultivate abusers. I wonder how many sadistic sex offenders worked in test labs that involve experimenting on animals?

             Thanks for this. I'm sure it's standard practice for university psychology departments, but the University of Iowa psychology dept, in addition to testing (and torturing) animals, also does research on children and families.

             Carthaginians sacrificed own children, archaeologists say
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Just as ancient Greek and Roman propagandists insisted, the Carthaginians did kill their own infant children, burying them with sacrificed animals and ritual inscriptions in special cemeteries to give thanks for favours from the gods, according to a new study.
             </p>
             <p>
              "This is something dismissed as black propaganda because in modern times people just didn't want to believe it," said Josephine Quinn, a lecturer in ancient history at Oxford, who is behind the study, with international colleagues, of one of the most bitterly debated questions in classical archaeology.
             </p>
             <p>
              "But when you pull together all the evidence – archaeological, epigraphic and literary – it is overwhelming and, we believe, conclusive: they did kill their children, and on the evidence of the inscriptions, not just as an offering for future favours but fulfilling a promise that had already been made.
             </p>
             <p>
              "This was not a common event, and it must have been among an elite because cremation was very expensive, and so was the ritual of burial. It may even have been seen as a philanthropic act for the good of the whole community."

             Keeping mind that Occultists like Crowley borrowed and mixed whatever they wanted from whatever culture they wanted in their 'Do as thou wilt' excuse for pedophilia and any/all perversions beyond that.

            Hmm, definitely feel you are on to something here. As we well and truly know there are NO "coincidences". Strange Comey was there just before this happened? No I don't think so, I think it was all part of the plan and I feel you are on the right path saying she was a whistle blower and that she possibly knew a lot more than she should. Great posts!

              His wording in that tweet still bothers me. "New growth" but not just in Nebraska but throught the country? That doesn't make sense in relation to the picture of him looking at new growth in a cornfield in Iowa.
