            This is exactly what I have always believed. That the faction of Princes who came out on top in this power struggle are as evil as the Princes that got arrested. The whole tribe is seriously degenerate and their money has made them truly depraved beyond description from all accounts I have read.

              That sure is some heck of a run down.  I have seen info on here lately about Diana Jenkins, especially last week, after the 4chan Q postings.  Sounds like she is the Ringleader or the Pedo Ring Head possibly.  They will need a whole jail just to accommodate all of the people involve in this Sex Ring Operation.  I have believed for some time that Hollywood Ring and DC Ring are connected.  Chris Dodd  was a Congresssman and left to join Disney.  He just recently left to Lobby.  Also we know that Weinstein made it possible for Malia to get a job with him as well.  This is all connected and intertwined.  We know how they roll.
