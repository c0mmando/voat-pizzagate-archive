<p>Award-winning filmmaker Carlos Carvalho died after an accident while shooting the ITV series Wild at Heart. He was tragically killed when a giraffe attacked him while he was getting a shot of the animal.</p>
<p>Carvalho had been working on the majority of the series about a British family who have set up a game lodge in South Africa. While shooting a closeup of Gerald the giraffe’s body and feet at the Glen Afric Country Lodge, the animal became “inquisitive” and headbutted him sending him 16 feet in the air and causing massive head injuries.</p>
<p>After the attack, he was airlifted to Johannesburg’s Milpark Hospital. He died on Wednesday night from his injuries. The announcement of his death was made via a statement on the film crew agency CallaCrew’s Facebook page: “It is with a very sad heart that we have to announce the passing of Carlos Carvalho‚ one of our favourite DOP’s. Carlos was filming a feature at Glen Afric and had a fatal run in with a giraffe on set. He was flown to Milpark Hospital but succumbed to his injuries 20:50 last night. Our thoughts and condolences go out to Carlo’s family and friends during this very sad time. He will be sorely missed.”</p>
<p>Carvahlo won the Silver Lion at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003 for a public service announcement for CHILDLINE. He was also honored in 2014 with an African Movie Academy Cinematography Award for his work on The Forgotten Kingdom.</p>
<p>CHILDLINE <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childline">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childline</a></p>
<p>Childline is a counselling service for children and young people up to their 19th birthday in the United Kingdom provided by the NSPCC.[1] Childline deals with any issue which causes distress or concern, common issues dealt with include child abuse, bullying, mental illness, parental separation or divorce, pregnancy, substance misuse, neglect, and psychological abuse.[2]</p>
<p>In 1986 Esther Rantzen, presenter of That\'s Life!, a popular consumer TV show, suggested to the BBC that they create &quot;Childwatch&quot;, a programme about child abuse that was screened on 30 October 1986 on BBC1, the aim being to try to detect children at risk before their lives were in danger. Viewers were asked if they would take part in the survey in an edition of That\'s Life!. A helpline was opened after the programme so that any child currently suffering abuse could call for help. Rantzen, together with her BBC producers Sarah Caplin and Ritchie Cogan, therefore suggested they should create a helpline specifically for children in danger or distress, to be open throughout the year, 24/7, and launch it on the programme.[4] The project was made possible by a benefactor Ian Skipper who underwrote the charity for the first three years.</p>
<p>Childline has 12 counselling centres around the UK, staffed largely by volunteers. The bases are located in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Manchester, Liverpool, Prestatyn, Birmingham, Nottingham, London, Belfast and Foyle, supported by the online only centres at Leeds and Cardiff. A restructure in 2011 saw the closure of the Childline bases in Exeter and Edinburgh, with Swansea relocating to Cardiff.[6] As many as 4,500 children phone Childline every day, though only 2,500 of these callers can be answered due to lack of resources. Since the merger with the NSPCC the service has expanded, and depends on public generosity to pay for the children\'s phone calls.</p>
<p>Another death in the entertainment industry connected to helping children involved in abuse. Since we know the entertainment industry is government controlled here in the US, and the UK. Since there are many locations of Childline in the UK this has a UK connection.</p>',

             There is some nonsense going on with the childlife org. as well.  The people involved started a charity The Silver Line.  Involved are Dame Judi Dench and HRH The Duchess of Cornwall  I have not gotten to the core of this, but these now popping up, I am scratching my head.

             Yes, and while I realize that we never know what animals will do, this sounds a little preposterous.  All the articles I read said he was loved by everyone.  Then someone from the at the lodge, he said he was trying to I guess be somewhat of a showoff trying to get the best shots, or whatever.  I don't get this whole thing.  Something just does not sit right.  This is a guy that has been taking pictures with animals for years, why would he not understand how to act near one.  One the the guys there with him said that the animal just acted out of nowhere.  I can't see a giraffe acting this way.  I don't think of them as ferocious animals.

            It has been suggested that Childline was established to filter out allegations of child sexual abuse against VIPs and ensure nothing would be done about them.  Whether there's any truth to that, however, I do not know.

             There has got to be some truth to your comment.  Remember, when dealing with luciferian/satanists, everything is never as it appears to be.  Often backwards, upside down, inside out.  When you consider all of the charities run by celebrities, governments, etc. and how they lie through their teeth to the public, this one would be no different.

             You are correct I believe.  And I think there is some truth to it.  The founder Rantzman had a quite suspicious case of abuse happen at her home to a young girl.  She is suspect definitely.

               Good God.  That picture surely is one she is not happy about.  She is also involved with a charity with her cousin Sara Caplin, Silver Line.  It is for the elderly.  Hmm.  Again both ends of the spectrum   Young and Old.

             Possible if Childline was set up to expost whistleblowers, Carvalho was close to revealing discovered info.  This Rantzen should be called Rancid after reading the article about the 5 yr old girl assaulted at her party.  Horrid Indeed.

              I don't know, Carm, but it would be worthwhile to do some digging. Maybe he was 'on our side', maybe he was just doing it for the money, maybe he was a buddy of Rentzen....you never know. I have become extremely cautious.

               You are correct, all of those are possibilities.  Many seem to be doing good when they are not.  We have found that some cannot be trusted when we think they are doing good.  Yes, there are many fakes.  The Whistle blower angle is surely possible.

             From that thread:  Posted by DerivaUK  I’ve read somewhere that Childline was set up as a filter to expose (read: prevent) potential whistleblower victims. There is an article around somewhere revealing a serious sexual assault on a child at one of Rantzen’s parties.

            It depends on how you define 'help', sadly. Esther Rentzen, the lady mentioned, who established 'Childline', knew about the late Jimmy Savile, the most notorious child abuser in Britain, and didn't do anything to help the victims. She was part of the cover-up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, there was a child sexually abused on her property 'while she was away'.

            I think the working theory we had was that it might be an organization that tries to find out what sexual abuse survivors know or remember, and we suspected that they might forward this info to abusers IIRC.

             I just looked into Sarah Caplin who is connected to Childline:
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Caplin">
              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Caplin
             </a>
             Sarah Caplin is a British producer and television executive, formerly at ITV, and before that Deputy Secretary of the BBC,[1] who has helped create two national charities, one for children and one for older people. She was a founder of Childline, together with her cousin Esther Rantzen and also The Silver Line.[2] She was educated at the University of York and has been married to TV presenter Nick Ross for more than twenty-five years.[1]
            </p>
            <p>
             Caplin subsequently helped Esther Rantzen set up The Silver Line, a charity for older people, where she is Director of Policy and Communications.

                From that article.  He also has strange ideas about women besides saying he would watch CP.  CP?!!!

               <p>
                Last week, he was criticised for his comments on rape, when he compared “provocatively dressed” women to a bank “storing sacks of cash by the door”.

             Thank you for that info.  Just from reading your research on Rentzen, it is possible that Childline is somewhat compromised and not at all what some may think.  Possibly Carvalho's heart was in the right place and found out what was going on in the background.  If his death is really as they say, so be it.  But now we may have discovered another Back Actor, Childline.   More research is needed.
