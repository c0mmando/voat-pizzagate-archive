            Something similarly related but don’t have th pages to back up what I am saying but remember it being discussed here long ago.

            When this whole bbc/government pedo thing broke here (I believe it was called operation yewtree?) there was a phone line set up for people to whistleblow/report abuse etc. Guess what .. they lost all of it. All the evidence gone. Makes you wonder how many people who made those phone calls were traced and suicided themselves?!

            It isn't what OP asked for and isn't very useful for PG but here it is. There is a BBC comedy show called Have I Got News For You. HIGNFY.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a story going round which everyone denies of when Jimmy Saville was on it and was torn to bits over his pedo sex life, this was not broadcast.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is what could be a transcript  of it.

            The two dossiers were handed to Leon Brittan in November 1983 and January 1984, but a newly discovered press cutting (see below) shows that Geoffrey Dickens personally delivered a separate file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Thomas Hetherington, in August 1983. The file contained details of eight prominent public figures who were paedophiles that Dickens had separated out from the later dossiers. The list was based on information supplied by the public in the wake of the Sir Peter Hayman scandal. Dickens ruled out any names that were only mentioned once or twice, and double checked information using a team of researchers.
