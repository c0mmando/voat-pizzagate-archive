            Just a side note: It's a big deal for gays and their allies that pedophiles who molest little boys don't get labeled as gay or bisexual.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interesting, just found NAMBLA "usually had no allies except older activists like Harry Hay, and Marxist groups like the Spartacist League and the Revolutionary Communist Party" and Harry Hay himself was a communist. (I'm not going to give a link, if you need the source just plug the quote into a search engine.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet such a prominent gay as the actor George Takei celebrates getting molested by an older summer camp counselor when he was underage.

            The myth of vampirism has some truth in it. The victim once bitten will eventually become a vampire himself.

            You are to be Commended.  Thank you for pointing this out.  Some that are pedophiles and gay may not want to believe or admit it for they are considered pariahs.  This is a hard thing to face.  But it is possible.  I am going to watch the Khazar video later.  I don't know why I save this stuff for evening, for that is the worst time.  Sigh.

             Pro-tip: Voat will only notify the first five people you pinged. If you would like to ping more, just reply to your own comment, and add five more to a new comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, when you edit comments, and add some more people, these will
             <em>
              not
             </em>
             be notified. You'd have to do a new comment, and add the pings there.
