            Film making and such is clearly not his forte, so perhaps someone with better suited skills can put together a documentary based on his research? It would be a pretty massive project, though.

            PSA: I back up George's investigative videos every day automatically on to one of my servers. Should they ever get deleted (like happened to his first 50 odd) I will disseminate them some other way.

            George Webb comes at a topic from several different directions and they are all worth reviewing.  He introduced organ theft from war sites into my investigation and that added a whole new dimension to things...even the high rate of murders in the Chicago area and why the police and the government aren't getting a good grip on things.  Very excellent background information that makes the Clintons the head of a crime syndicate unworthy of being called American.

            I've been studying all these meta concerns that George Webb raises as to arms, drugs and human trafficking for the better part of 30+ years.  It's been like a huge jigsaw puzzle

            After watching George Webb, I feel a most remarkable sense of clarity now on these matters.  He solved damn near every question I had in mind.  A true genius investigator

             Agreed. At first I got annoyed with his daily updates where he would cover some of the same ground as last time and the time before. But it's grown on me a LOT. By going on the same journey has him, you get a taste of the kind of field familiarity he has and how connected all these things are.

            If only he released 1 or 2 comprehensive videos every week instead of 2-3 repetitive videos every day, his following would be huge. I'd like to watch all his videos,  but the format is so offputting.

              I prefer the way he does it now. Every day gives you a little bit to digest. If he hit you with it all at once it would be so overwhelming that the frightening complexity of it all would probably cause oir brains to collectively explode. He's tearing them apart piece by piece laying out an invincible case - and all with open source information. I love the internet. If I know George he'll probably pop up soon on this thread.

               I get the feeling GW is more familiar and comfortable in the research role. He clearly isn't concerned about the fame or he would make it bite-sized and push it out to the masses. He seems content blazing the trail and letting others get the message out. Seems like a very selfless person.
