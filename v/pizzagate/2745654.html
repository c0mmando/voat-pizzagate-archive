<p>not sure if this is elite / politician supply side infrastructure but it has a police sergeant who undoubtedly help cover up</p>
<p>&quot;According to state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, the sting, dubbed &quot;Operation Open House,&quot; targeted &quot;men who allegedly were using social media in an attempt to lure underage girls and boys for sexual activity.
During the investigation, undercover officers posed as underage boys and girls on social media sites such as Grindr, Whisper, Skout and Kik, the Attorney General\'s Office said in a news release. </p>
<p>The release said the defendants &quot;typically initiated contact&quot; with the officers and &quot;are alleged to have made arrangements to meet the \'children\' for sex.&quot;</p>

<p>The suspects were arrested from Sept. 5 to Sept. 9 at an undercover house in Toms River, other meetup locations or their own cars, authorities said.</p>
<p>Those arrested include Howell Township police Sgt. Richard Conte, 47, of Farmingdale, and Richard Hoffman, 23, a firefighter and college student from Mays Landing. </p>
<p>The following suspects also were arrested:</p>
<p>Mina G. Beshay, 27, of Monroe Township
Christopher Vargas, 29, of Toms River
Joshua Rauter, 31, of Little Egg Harbor Township
Joseph Martin, 35, of Seaside Heights
Volvi Lowinger, 23, of Lakewood

Nabindranauth Nandalall, 24, of Bronx, New York
William D. Davis, 23, Bayville

Douglass Walton, 54, of Hillsborough
All 24 suspects are facing charges of &quot;attempted luring or enticing a child with purpose to commit a criminal offense against the child,&quot; a second-degree offense, the news release said. Some also face charges of attempted sexual assault on a minor, attempted debauching morals of a child and attempted showing obscene material to a minor. See the full list of the suspects and their charges here.</p>
<p>“It is disturbing that some of the alleged child predators from this operation held positions of public service and authority, but behind closed doors they went through great lengths to avoid detection online, frequenting social media sites with the sole purpose of targeting unsuspecting children,” New Jersey State Police Col. Patrick Callahan said in a statement. “Our troopers and partners on the ICAC Task Force are unfazed by the outward appearances of sex offenders and will continue to turn the tables on predators by luring them out of hiding and bringing them to justice. These arrests serve as a sobering reminder that parents should closely monitor their child’s online activity.”</p>',

            Interesting last names of the arrested. Blumensteel sounds a lot like Bluementhal. Thal is an interesting addition to a last name because of it's rarity and origin.  The cutting of precious deodar trees in Kumrat, Thal, Kalkot, Barikot and other areas of the Kohistan valley continues unhindered as the locals claim they have no other source of heating and cooking in the harsh winter season.
Deodar forest fast depleting in Dir's Kohistan valley  Opium family name. All the Thal's were born wealthy, if they played the game.

            I am shocked at how many are perverse that hold offices or jobs of power!  It really is sick and twisted.  People can't control their instincts are like dogs humping everything in site....the difference is humans have will power and can think! At least some.

            What are you talking about?  The guy is a sergeant in Howell Township, a town of 50,000 people.  How is that going to help cover up anything?  You think the the elite live in Howell Township?  Also the guy was so far out of touch he didn't know the State Police along with the FBI and Homeland security and like a dozen other agencies and were running "Catch a Predator" stings in his area and he walked into one.

            We need to bring back public torture and burning at the stake.  I want to see these sub-humans endure maximum suffering before they enter the hell from which they came.

            Look at the ages of these filthy scum. The youngest is 22, which tells us the problem is just as much alive today, as it ever has been. Castrate them all I say. Wouldn't think twice about it.

            Seriously, you mentioned "not sure if this is elite / politician supply side infrastructure but it has a police sergeant who undoubtedly help cover up".  It would be interesting to try and recreate (on paper) the moving parts of a "typical" pedo ring.  They all must have certain traits and members - doctor, lawyer, cop, teacher, shrink, etc.  And document their tactics.  Also business infrastructure as well.  Just thinking that a better understanding of the mechanics could serve the larger purpose.  I'll put it on my to do list...

            I saw that a cop from a big local PD here in DC was popped for pedo last week as well.  Remember when this was

               I know all about CCHR. They're running a good show. Did not know that they were also involved in the child trafficking but given my experiences with them and the Scientologists that they introduced me to, that doesn't surprise me. Clearwater is run by Scientology. If you look through my submissions there is one regarding an article I found about the evidence that Scientology is an arm of US Intelligence. It's keeping up the facade of being a cult so nobody will think to look into what they are really doing. You can tell when you meet a Scientologist that they don't have a religious belief in anything. They put on a good show of being in a cult where they idol worship LRH but when you get to know them it's clear that they don't and they have no leg to stand on except claiming you just need to read about Dianetics. Their only possible true religion is the same as LRH which is Satanism and witchcraft / black magic. And they are hypocrites, they aren't really against drugs. They're only against them publicly but LRH took a ton of drugs and I've seen how they treat their detractors, they have no problem with involuntary drugging of someone they do not like. Nor do they have a problem with stalking and harassment and using whatever high tech intelligence capabilities that they have. They install surveillance equipment all over the world and do data analysis of network activity. Doyle Mills recently posted an IG photo of himself in front of a bunch of servers and wires and said he was "playing with elections." Just found out that the 2014 Prime Minister of Ukraine was a Scientologist. I wonder how they get all those Ukrainian girls over here on Visas to be spy kids and such...

             Have you seen the commercials Clearwater runs for its 'tourism'?

             Look at the sealed indictment list. How come Central Florida has the LEAST amount of any region in the country?

             Like you, I see many signs of trafficking and police corruption here in Florida.

              Yes isn't that the craziest thing? In all of America, mid FL (possibly the most corrupt region)  has the LEAST sealed indictments  (2/50k+ )?? This is all you need to know to dismiss the conspiracy that the sealed indictments are for child traffickers. Tampa has long been #1 on Google in "brothel" and trafficking news stories.  I have initiated FBI and OIG investigations myself. Those indictments are for something very different

               So now you know why us Florida Crackers hate most Yankees, and especially those who come down here and start running things like wherever they were from, building skyscrapers and what not. Our hatred is righteous!
