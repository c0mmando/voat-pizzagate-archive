            I apologize if this has been mentioned already, but I wanted to get it in before you close this up. I recently had a post deleted by M_F citing Rule 1:
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2128750">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2128750
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I messaged M_F two or three times asking for an explanation, considering my post touched on the Catholic Church covering up yet another serial molester, but got no response. Finally I messaged
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/vindicator">
             @vindicator
            </a>
            , who told me they wouldn't have deleted my post had it been up to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            While I understand that the Catholic church covering up pedophiles doesn't necessarily involve elites, considering how powerful the Vatican is (and how similar it is, legally speaking, to Washington DC &amp; London), I think posts involving the Catholic church covering for pedophiles should fall under Rule 1. I've been working on another angle involving pedophilia coverups by the church for the last couple of weeks, but I'm hesitant to post anything here for fear it will get deleted.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it would help if the mods could agree on how to apply Rule 1 in general.

            I'm not seeing a lot of movement to change the definition here.  I've seen some users agree with a tighter definition, then agree with a looser one.  I'm not really sure where some of you stand atm, what argument you think was best, or what ideas were best.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm seeing a lot of "combine this with pedogate" which, as far as I know, is just generally about pedophiles wherever, whenever, however.  I posit that doing so would simply erode this place into a free-for-all for shill sliding.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite 290 comments, there was surprisingly little about the actual rule.  I'd wager a good 40% was attacking MF, 20% wanting to combine with pedogate, 10% wanting rule change, 10% wanting no rule change, and 20% ESOTERICshade wasting everyone's fucking time.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of the issues lately have been the interpretation of "elites".  I'm of the mind that the DC elites directly linked to Podesta is what it was referring to, not a mayor or state-level official.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just kinda spit-wadding thoughts here to see what sticks.  Happy to hear your thoughts on the subject.

              Given that I was unable to locate or devise of my own a new wording that didn't open the flood gates, I'm more or less leaning towards leaving the rules as they are.

            I think a wider net when it comes to historical and parallel examples would be great, because there is so much history that provides context for pizzagate. I have been able to successfully post about that here many times, which I applaud as far as the mods allowing these discussions under the current rules. However I've also had some disagreements about the definition of pizzagate when it comes to ritual abuse in the past - specifically on what constitutes ritual abuse. I'm not sure how it would work best to widen rule one.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I also think that it could be narrowed SLIGHTLY so that the sub is not overwhelmed with Awan posts that have nothing to do with child abuse - basically I'm saying that child abuse whether it be trafficking, MKUTLRA/Mind control experiments, ritual abuse, pedo rings, and related issues should be classed as fundamentally pizzagate because that's what was exposed last year - a combination of all of the above. I do not envy mods in trying to come up with a specific definition of that.

            Notice I waited until near last.  If you change the rule, you change the sub from focusing on the revelations of the WL email release subjects to a sub chasing the global elites (or however you want to word that) like nearly every other conspiracy web site on the net.  The noise will be deafening to anyone "just hearing about" Pizzagate.  On the plus side (at least for the latest batch of click-leeches), I'll be done monitoring the sub from then on.

            Just make it so that in order to be a mod you have to have a full public profile of your verified identity viewable by anyone. If mods that are operating on any agenda, it would be apparent.

           <p>
            Painting, sculpture, movies, music videos, literature, illustrations, bands, actors, artists, song lyrics, and a long list of related etc. AND, the people who create, perform, promote, sell, and buy these products. Some pizzagate-familiar specific examples: Heavy Breathing, CPP poster art, the Tony Podesta art collection, Kim Noble, Cory Feldman, Pegasus Museum.

            We need more protection from /x/-tier conspiratards. Every once in a while we get a fucking crazy who manages to get upvoted to the top, but his OP is flat-earther-tier, unintelligent, garbage that is totally unrelated to pizzagate. We get cultists, hyper-religious catladies, and UFOlogists all the fucking time now, and let's be real, here, there are only three reasons why:

              The level of new evidence we get these days are a dripfeed that span weeks and months. People will make anything up for a good story to break the monotony, or as a 'spice' to make PG seem more 'interesting'.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Attention-whoring. Everyone wants their 15 minutes, and some of these fuckers are morally bankrupt enough to exploit trafficked children to get their lunatic soapbox.
             </p>

            <li>
             <p>
              Pizzagate is close enough to a "conspiracy theory", to attract a certain breed of mentally ill individual, and these people have found

            I really think the mods have gone out for cigarettes, I can't even get a hold of Millenial Falcon anymore, and I see more and more of these threads every day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quality is dropping through the floor, and it seems like anything is acceptable here, these days. If I saw the ulrasonic nanite infection/Targeted Individual thread last year, it would have been downvoated to oblivion.

              I don't hate MF at all, I just wish senpai would notice me. Vindicator seems to do his job well enough.

              I don't really know what can be done about kicking the /x/ shit out of here, other than adding more, more dilligent, mods. I chalk it up to a combination of inadequate flood control, as well as people being sneaky about the context of what is, or is not, "Pizzagate-related". Seems like these days, they'll just shoehorn in an indirect, not-proveable, passing reference to PG, and it's barely over the line of acceptablility, so it makes it to the top of the page, even though it makes no sense, or doesn't make sense within the context of why we're all here.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps redefining "Pizzagate-related", to emphasize a more direct relation to PG, or banning/limiting "conspiracy crossovers", a term I just now coined. A lot of people are interjecting other conspiracy beliefs they have into Pizzagate, and making threads about that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now I'm not one to discount the possibility of another theory having a direct or supplementary relation to PG, but it needs absolute, empirical, and convincing, proof. I'd rather treat Pizzagate like a criminal investigation, than a Sasquatch hunt, you know?

            If a thread, about Jesuits or anything else, is full of stuff I know to be bullshit or a skewing of the truth, I definitely "target" it. You can ask DeathTooMasons. I'm sure he'll tell you all about it.

            ESOTERIC, I think you have a misunderstanding about Jesuit schools. Just because you graduate from one doesn't mean you are Jesuit or even Catholic. Only a tiny, tiny fraction of teachers in Jesuit colleges are Jesuits. "Becoming a Jesuit" is MUCH more difficult than simply getting a degree. It requires something like 12 years of seminary as well as taking several layers of vows, signing over all personal wealth to the order and other things far more onerous than someone as wealth and power hungry as John Podesta would ever subject himself to. I have a friend who thought he wanted to pursue this path, but couldn't hack it.
           </p>
           <p>
            JP is no priest. He went to Georgetown to get a law degree. This is a narrative being pushed by shills who think Voaters are too stupid to know anything about Jesuits. I'm surprised you bought into it.

           <p>
            Less than 2% of Catholic priests are part of the pedo abuse scandal. A fraction of those are Jesuit. Saying that all Jesuits torture children just makes this investigation look like a joke. It's equivalent to saying all Democrats torture kids, or all cops cover up for elite pedophiles. If this is the claim made by the video, I wouldn't need to watch the whole thing to know it needed a disinfo flair. Another clue is that the "It's the Jesuits" crew are the same accounts pushing a bunch of hokey, cross-pollinated mythological crap. Before that, they were pushing a Jewish conspiracy, as well as a bunch of scientifically impossible stuff about elites drinking blood laced with adrenaline to get high while retaining their youth. So...which is it? If any of these narratives had any substance, they wouldn't keep trying new ones!

              Maybe. Or perhaps he lacks skepticism and is too fascinated with mystical knowledge to be able to discern the fabrications of shills. We've got a couple of regulars on here who are into psychedelic pharmaceuticals in a quest for enlightenment that likely fall into the latter category. I'm pretty sure there's a room at Shareblue where the kids who troll us with this shit day after day binge-watch X-Files episodes and have editorial meetings to brainstorm crap like "King David is Achilles", "Pizzagate is about pineal gland harvesting for the cannibal elite", "They're abducting rare genetic mutants with coloboma", "the Knights of Malta are the Pope's assassins" and on and on.

                I think you are right. ;-)
               </p>
               <p>
                It would be easier if we could make whatever tweaks to the rules or administration of them we can to give the base of legit users less of a sense of being hindered by mods. They would then join in the shill-handling instead of believing every whining shill that claims we're pedos or compromised or whatever. I'm not suggesting asking for less evidence or being more lax...more like expanding the viable topics allowed (with the supporting evidence requirement still in place).
               </p>
               <p>
                This is my first mod job, though, and the first time I've ever been seriously involved in a forum, let alone the most shilled one on the internet, so this may be a naive hope on my part. The frustration level of legit contributors -- which has grown steadily since December -- really does pain me, though. I appreciate you spending time here assessing things.

            So Podesta and Soros made an outfit called "Catholics in Alliance" and tried (succeeded?) to subvert the Catholic church.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that Podesta is Jesuit seems an irrelevant tangent.  Do people of one denomination not change to another sometimes?
           </p>
           <p>
            And the link you gave - the documentary - what years did this happen, and at what churches?  Is this directly related to Podesta's "Catholics in Alliance" because of the dates of the abuse?  Sounds like it's been happening since before that.

           <p>
            Let's play a little game:
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm going to make a claim like "All the evidence needed to imprison Podesta is in
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh7lp9umG2I">
             this
            </a>
            video."
           </p>
           <p>
            Then when you bitch about it not looking relevant and being a 10h video that you need to go through to make sure the claims about it are true, I'll say this:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The entire video will walk a courtroom through the evidence that John Podesta fucks and kills children. Living people who were tortured are in it. Many witnesses are in it. There is no "one point" that can be marked in the video because the entire video is full of it. I watched it. You didn't. If you have not watched the video then you just haven't watched it. I don't have anything else to say about it to you."

            MF and Vindicator constantly use this to delete threads they don't want people to see, and allow identical type threads in other cases. My posting of this documentary was deleted twice despite being about Pope Francis, Queen Elizabeth and the Catholic church raping torturing and murdering Native peoples in Canada. This was an actual documentary, not just a news site.

              I'm asking because that post completely destroys the "6 million died in DEATH CAMPS" narrative.  From almost every angle imaginable.
             </p>
             <p>
              <em>
               The OFFICIAL 6 million number was based on FOUR of that SIX in AUSCHWITZ who finally REDUCED the OFFICIAL number of dead there to 1.5 million.

             </p>
             <p>
              You ever heard of the 3.5 million?  EVER?  Have you EVER heard of WHY they might have gotten that wrong by 2.5 MILLION?

             <p>
              Not processing that means that either you're JEWISH, or a nigger-tier humanoid.

                Well, you're right about the first part, but you've provided no evidence of the second.

                If you know the holocaust is a hoax, why do you think my post isn't good evidence?  The
                <em>
                 narrative
                </em>
                is that 6 million were killed in
                <em>
                 death camps
                </em>
                .  Does my post not entirely debunk 4 million of that?

                If proving 2/3 of a BIG EVENT false isn't enough to pretty much assume the rest is a lie, then I'm really not sure your standards are realistic.

             Anyone want to spend an hour and fifty minutes confirming what's in that video?  Not including the time it'll take finding out if the sources for the video pan out?  (I'm being sarcastic - if you do it for this one, they'll post another, and another, and another... the point is that NOBODY should be expected to do this)
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, when/where did the Jesuits become an issue?  I haven't seen shit about it anywhere.  Is this "user" a lying kike, or did I miss something with my recent semi-absence?  Maybe I've just really missed something big anyway for the past couple years?

            Another issue that's become of concern is the following: "How should we deal with people using multiple accounts?"
           </p>
           <p>
            This issue is of concern because this is a primary weapon used by shills. Two of our main shills use 3+ accounts (one of them uses 6+).
           </p>
           <p>
            For this I have the following solution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Only ONE account may be used per IP. Those found to be violation shall henceforth have all their extra accounts banned except the one with the LOWEST net SCP and CCP.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before going further, I need to ask a question that is of major relevance to this anti shill defense. That way no innocent people get hit by this. This question is paramount to whether this proposistion is feasible or not.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Can the mods see a user's IP?"
           </p>
           <p>
            I call this proposistion the "Reset Bomb".

            I came here to read Jane Webb's legal posts regarding the Hampstead Child abuse case which ties into Haiti scandal and unfortunately one of your mods deleted them, which does not look very professional, when they included replies from journalists.

            I think your thoughts get to the crux of the issues and also distill much of mine as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            More wording, or too many qualifiers enable many people to use sophistry to continue to divert the energy of this community away from the investigation itself.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Pizzagate" the originating core story that started this investigation is really just a small off shoot organisation of the global informal groups that all protect and enable each other.
            <br/>
            Finding a way to re-focus the community back to the core of the investigation and ultimately exposing the people who do these things in a way that nobody in the public could deny is something I want us all to get back to.

             Honestly, Crensch, I don't see what rule it violates. The Amalek alts have been spamming Christ Church Hampstead stuff all day long, which is probably why MF deleted these and banned several alts (he cited "spamalek" as the reason). But the only rule I could see it breaking is Rule 2 if the "whatdotheyknow.com" site didn't provide links to the woman's correspondence, but it appears they did:
             <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/user/jane_webb_3">
              https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/user/jane_webb_3
             </a>
             . She made the requests from the site. This is the stuff the Amalek alts have been spamming all day. I did not remove most of it, because I didn't see what rule it violated.

              Current Definition of "Pizzagate"
             </h1>
             <p>
              "Pizzagate" refers to the independent investigation of pedophilia and child trafficking by the certain members of the global elite. The leaked John Podesta Emails hint at deeply entrenched and protected pedophile networks operating with impunity at the top levels of government and politics in and through Washington, DC and the world at large. The investigation initially focused on a group of businesses on Connecticut Avenue in Washington DC and their potential connection to a child trafficking ring. While this investigation began and centers around Comet Ping Pong, it involves multiple businesses and numerous connections around the globe. The name pizzagate is simply an easy to remember convenience, referring to what has been called "Pedocracy" which is the suspected, likely informal, association of elite individuals that use pedophilia to organize, manage and discipline their efforts to dominate or disproportionately influence outcomes in matters of interest. That includes government as well as politics -- executive, legislative, judicial, lobbying, military, intelligence -- as well as media, business, finance, law, medicine, accounting, technology, academia, think tanks, philanthropy, endowments, etc.

              Relevant submissions would be any content that can be linked (by the OP in a sourced explanation) to organized human trafficking of children, the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of those children, and/or the systematic cover up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities.

                 I would say yes. It would be hard to deny that there is a pattern of corruption involving abuse of kids in the Catholic Church -- worldwide. Who's to say the deep state didn't instigate it in order to control bishops, whose flock constitutes a gigantic voting block in many countries around the world, and whose doctrine advocates numerous things that undermine state involvement in the family, such as its teachings against divorce, contraception, abortion and euthanasia. Documenting the degree of corruption and where it occurs would be vital to understanding the pattern.

                   Ideally, a pattern should be demonstrated with multiple direct links. We need to spell that out in the rules, but allow the posts IMO. Right now, what is happening is many legit users who follow this stuff closely see those patterns and see posts that fit them regularly deleted with little explanation. If you look in modmail currently, you will see numerous unanswered queries that demonstrate this.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Edit: I do not support abandoning the direct link style rigor. It's absolutely necessary.

                    Given this, I'm wondering if we've been talking past each other somewhat here.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I've always told posters/mods that I'd love for OP to come back with direct links, and have more or less seen in this thread what appears to be people wanting to relax those links.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Ideally, would the valid links not be in the rules/sticky, and just build on each other in each post?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Something like this:
                   </p>
                   <blockquote>
                    <p>
                     Podesta
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     linked to X not in sticky
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     linked to Y not in sticky
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     linked to Z not in sticky
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     and here's A that is linked to Z.
                    </p>
                   </blockquote>
                   <p>
                    Until the sticky gets updated to include X Y and Z?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Literally every post.  Connect the dots so that anyone can pick up at any time and not need to have stared at the patterns like on oldschool 4chan?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That was kinda the idea from the beginning here to allow this to be both archival and forward-moving.

                     This is an interesting approach. First I've really heard it articulated as how we are supposed to be doing things, though. LoL. No one trained me to mod with this approach in mind, and I haven't been teaching users to submit this way. What I learned was "mods don't curate content". If the premise of a connection is clearly articulated and supporting links are provided, leave it up and let the downvotes decide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We could switch to the sticky-based approach, but there are a couple of problems. First, who controls the sticky? That's MF. Unless he is willing to edit the sticky and add new material people think is relevant -- like the Awan investigation for example -- we are no better off than we are today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It also reinforces the thing people are most frustrated about: they can't contibute because the conversation is being controlled by one person with a narrow point of view. This happening on every other forum is exactly what has brought most PG researchers here in the first place.

                      Given what I've seen, there's not a lot to recommend a rule change at this point.  I'm still slogging through all this shit, and if I could delete ESOTERICshade's comments to make it easier to parse, I would.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      That user MIGHT have valid points here and there, but far too much of what he says is complete horseshit.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Any relaxing of the rules seems to be what the shilly commenters want, and some few that don't appear shilly don't want any changes.  That's just my take so far.  Happy to be convinced otherwise.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I'm responding to you here because if any change was made, it could be along the lines of what I was discussing about a running archive.

                      Well, it's not like someone couldn't copy his sticky, and add in stuff that the community agrees has been directly linked.  If that sticky needs to change hands, that's fine.  It was mine at one point.

                 Christ Church is a town in the UK. A couple of kids came forward with terrible claims that their father was killing babies. It was investigated by the authorities and dismissed. The mother and boyfriend are on the run and supposedly put the kids up to it and abused them. The problem is, the UK authorities and media have covered up massive elite pedo rape, so no one trusts the Hampstead ruling. Like Podesta, it's still ongoing. It doesn't help that the BBC head who covered up the UK pedos is now the head of the NYT.

                   True (although either way is relevant to Pizzagate). Also, the NYT has been the leader of the efforts to "debunk" Pizzagate and label it Fake News that should be censored on all platforms. They also removed stories from their online archives about elite pedo investigations in Sweden and Belgium, as did the Swedish press and the big paper in Tampa Bay. Then WAPO hires Podesta? Looks to me like they are all in it. Certainly worth documenting.

                   The "direct" link is that if the kids' story is true, Hampstead is a case of what many people think the Podestas and friends are into: Satanic Ritual Abuse of kids. I personally am not convinced they were telling the truth -- they were tripping over themselves to get their talking points out. But that is my personal opinion.

            Now stop sensationalizing bullshit.  Just a few more days and maybe posts like this will be defined into being left alone here.

            Rule 1 isn't the real issue.  I'm sure it could use some improvement, but the real issue is the inconsistent manner in which the rules are applied by the mods.  You can argue it's the wording/interpretation, but it seems to me, that most of the sub thinks it's

             OK, 10-day-old-alt, do what literally none of you PG faggots has done to date and provide links proving this.

                Faggot, why do you pretend your lazy ass doesn't have access to the logs, yourself?  Your ass wants the research to keep getting wider and go in circles.  The only fucking new leads that are relevant to bringing down pizzagate, in its entirety, are leads that deal with the original characters (Podestas, Alefantis, Abramovic, Foundation donors, etc).  The high-end consumers.  The ones with the power to censor the internet.  The ones that decide who and how hard to prosecute and how wide the investigation should be.  The ones that were already in the WH.  Then you follow the money.  Every pedo ring is compartmentalized.  Going after the smaller rings is not going to create a chain reaction.  The investigations will not expand, because they control them.  Anyone with half a brain could figure that out.  Your stupid ass wants to protect mother_fucker cause you are a motherfucker.

                   Through the ENTIRE life of this subverse, mods have been attacked, and shills have tried to get a foothold.

                   I'm NOT going to do a shill's work for them either.  They can present a valid case, or they can fuck off.

                  <p>
                   Honestly, if they're legitimate users (not shills) and cannot manage to present a valid case, then they're probably useless anyway.

                    This is an example of wtf everyone is complaining about.  I post something you say you and MF are both in agreement with, yet it gets deleted for not having a source/link (rules!).  Give me an example of an appropriate/relevant source/link for that post.

            This investigation has grown in scale from what it was in the beginning. 
This epidemic of child abuse is a much wider net of corruption then first was realized.

Satanic Cult, MSM, Dyncorp, Fondation´s (Clinton´s, Sandler Foundation, Etc), Awan Scandal, Huma and Weiner, Al-qaeda, ISIS, Mexican Cartels, MS-13, Madeleine Mccann, Hammpsted Case, Franklin Scandal, MK Ultra, Senators, Politicians, Community services and many more...

              Its hard to just point to a few subjects, This has been going on for age´s and it stretches around the world and parts of almost every institution at the highest levels. And it is highly covered-up, something we also need to look at.

            My question regarding rule one regards trying to differentiate pizzagate from pedogate.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as I'm concerned, they're the same thing. Pizzagate evolved into Pedogate, but we keep Pizzagate in honor of where it all began.

           <div class="md">
            <p>
             <p>
              The origins of pizzagate stem from the contents of the Podesta emails as shown on /pol in October 2016. Those emails contained some bizzare nonsensical sentence syntax involving food items.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was later discovered on /pol that the syntax could be solved if said words were in coded language. It was later found that the very words in those emails matched known pedophile code language as per declassified FBI documents. For example, cheese pizza refers to underage girl, hotdog refers to underage male, and walnut refers to a child of color.
             </p>
             <p>
              Later on some very disturbing artwork owned by Podesta and his associates was discovered. That and some very unsettling things discovered at various suspect pizza parlors in DC, Hollywood, and other cities. Most infamous of them all being Comet Ping Pong, aka CPP.
             </p>
             <p>
              Eventually, it was discovered that the problem of human and sex trafficking of children by elite pedophile rings along with the massive effort to cover it up by various institutions was a rot that was global in its span. Hence the alternative name Pedogate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its a massive spider web of interconnections so convoluted that it has become a logistical nightmare to keep track of all the relevant players, locals, and events. This doesn't even take nightmarish content like Elsagate into consideration. I have once said that "This is not a swamp. This is an oily, murky, black abyss that leads to the very depths of hell."
             </p>
             <p>
              Thus in my eyes, I find it hard to differentiate between Pizzagate and Pedogate, for I honestly consider them to be one and the same, with "Pizzagate" being a vestigial name in honor of where it all began. For the record, this shit has given me nightmares about torture and dismemberment so intense that my heart was pounding for 10-15 minutes after waking up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Please forgive the long story, but I felt it was nessecary in order to understand where I'm coming from in my argument.

                I see the pizzagate/pedogate issue the same way as darknight111. It's a distinction without a difference. Especially since the premise underlying the whole thing is deep state corruption of democratic governments via pedo blackmail.

Catholic Church Explains the bodies of nearly 800 children found in a SEPTIC TANK behind a former Mother and Baby home.
           </p>
           <p>
            PizzaGate related in that it involves BABIES being DUMPED in a SEPTIC TANK as opposed to being given a proper Christian burial...Is this how the CATHOLIC CHURCH treats innocent souls born into captivity? 800 babies DIE in 35 years? and thrown away like TRASH! WTF? What REALLY happened to those innocent babies?

            Update March 5, 2017: After the story first broke in 2014, many reports, including this report and two stories two stories published by The Washington Post claimed that the bodies of 800 babies had been discovered in a septic tank, however at that time, the number of bodies found had no actual count, The Washington Post reported. According to The Daily Mail, a statement issued March 3, 2017 from the Mother and Baby Homes Commission said that “significant quantities of human remains have been discovered in at least 17 of the 20 underground chambers which were examined earlier this year.” Almost 800 children had died there between 1925 and 1961, according to records, but there was only one burial record for just one child.

            Additionally, the earlier version of this article from 2014 has been corrected to omit probable inaccuracies from an invalid source. Catholic Church took 60,000 babies for adoption in the 1950s and 1960s, Many sent to America in return for large payments disguised as 'donations' Martin wrote about one case in his book Philomena, later made into a film News of the mass graves at Tuam finally made the newspapers last week Religious community's site had primitive conditions with babies neglected Infection and disease ran unchecked; measles and dysentery killed hundreds Two locals, Catherine Corless and Teresa Kelly, set out to uncover the truth Catherine calculated nearly 800 babies were buried beneath the estate

             I always hear this kind of bullshit from low-effort accounts like yours.  We have mod logs for a fucking reason.  If something happens that bothers you, get off your fucking fat lazy ass and do something about it instead of blackpill virtue-signalling.  You think you're helping children when you do NOTHING to help the situation?

                 And an effect I've not yet found a name for.  When a troll wants to pretend he doesn't actually care about the conversation, and puts some faggot emoji behind a random-airheaded quip.  You want people to think you're not invested in this for some reason, but nobody reading this would buy it.

                    Would love to meet u for a beer.
I'm sure we could have a nice rational discussion.
I could tell u about the little18monthold toddler that came into my e.r with cigarette burns all over his little body. Or maybe ud like to know about the little 3 yr old girl who had to have her anus reconstructed and part of her bowel removed after she was penetrated by a huge cock.
WOULD U LIKE TO DISCUSS MORE OF THAT U CROCK OF COLD SHIT???

U &amp; ur know it all goony  friends can down voat me all u want. I'm not here to earn
 'brownie points '.  My life doesn't revolve around being an anonymous poster of trivia. I actually have a real job that helps save people lives.  What do you do for work besides bully others? 
If u ever get out of ur chair long enough to make a  real difference in people's lives, then I'll be glad to sit down and have that beer to intelligently discuss why this whole thing is nothing but a farce. 
Until then, get a REAL LIFE.

                   What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

                     I'll do what I want to do, when I want to do it.  You, on the other hand, appear to believe that telling people what to do will affect change.  I can only surmise that you think this because when people tell you what to do, you do it.

            I agree that the less mod interpretation the better -- such as who is and who isn't "elite". We are investigating the way the deep state may be using child rape to manipulate and control people in power and enrich those who pull the strings. Focusing on this aspect, rather than whether the subject of a given thread qualifies as "elite" would be far more productive, in my opinion.

            Look, I am being sincere here...not trying to be argumentative. I simply want someone to keep a close eye on things. It may seem like I am just being paranoid, but trust me, many great threads have simply vanished. Now I am not pointing fingers, but I find it strange that threads concerning CPP and JA are gone. Were some of them too close to the truth, or contained a valuable avenue to explore? If such is the case, is it possible for a non Voat entity to delete threads?

             last-word, what was in the threads you are having trouble finding? It's really not helpful to make a vague claim of missing threads with no actual mention of what the content included so people can verify if it is true.

            Incredible you of all people are calling me a shill. SMH. Follow me here sunshine...certain threads about CPP and/or JA have simply vanished. A bit hard to prove it when the threads are not there. I am wondering why you are doubting it so adamantly...hmmmmmm.

            If a mod suspects a shill post but it's not obviously a shill post, I think they should not delete it.  Instead, they should have the option to tag it with a
            <strong>
             "suspected shill"
            </strong>
            flag.  This would alert Voat users, who then would make up their own minds about the quality of the post and whether to pursue any research angles it might suggest.

             Yes. This is what our "Possible Disinformation" flare is for. The only problem is, many of the shill posts are spammed in multiple different iterations by different alts. You can flare one to raise awareness, but we really need to remove the majority to prevent them from sliding legit content into oblivion.

              Yes, but, to be clear, I was only referring to posts that are not
              <strong>
               obviously
              </strong>
              shill but suspected to be.  If it's not blatantly obvious, Voaters should decide, not mods.
             </p>
             <p>
              I understand the multiple alts problem, but my question is who needs multiple alts?  As far as I can tell, only people with ulterior motives, including but not limited to shills.  Is it possible to allow just one account per IP address?

              This brings up an important point:
             </p>
             <p>
              We need some way to crack down on shills using multiple accounts.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's two very active shills (we know who they are) that use 3+ accounts (one of them uses at least 6).
             </p>
             <p>
              Since most of the "multi account using shills" are quite obvious, there is an idea I've got cooked up.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe ban all but one (the one with the LOWEST ccp) of their accounts, using "spam" as the justification. Of course this proposistion should ONLY be used on the obvious alts to prevent false positives.

            The information and even theories about pizzagate that have been brought forth need to be ongoing and protected. For example, I have been following developments and findings on CPP and Alefantis since last October or whenever it initially became a blip on the radar. I have noticed that some very good, relevant threads about CPP and Alefantis have vanished. I can't find them anywhere. I am not trying to hijack this thread, but you guys, we have to keep this up and running, AND find the mods or whomever that seem to delete solid research and sound theories  on CPP and Alefantis and fire them. Why are some people on here protecting CPP and Alefantis? We know the answer. Thanks for reading my post.

            Hmmmm, I've been thinking about this. Rule 1 was fine, back when it was written. But* I find it very hard to believe that there is a clear separation from the multitude of leaks that have occurred, and will continue to occur.
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             PG is/was a subset of data within the context of the larger Podesta leak.
            </li>
            <li>
             Since this has broken, multiple, significant events have occurred in light of other leaks (namely Russia)
            </li>
            <li>
             Now we've got Awan/DNC on meltdown alert
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I know that we do not have "smoking gun" evidence of a direct connection between these two leaks -
            <strong>
             but I think that
             <em>
              ignoring
             </em>
             topics such as
            </strong>
            the Awan's, the DNC, Seth Rich, Shawn Lucas, the Russian Investigation, etc... will only serve to weaken the PG community.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we can prove that any significant elements of the enemies' narrative is totally fictitious. That leads us down a collective rabbit hole of what else they may be lying about/covering up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Disproving Russia/embracing Assange/taking down Awan/DWS... these are all methods of potentially discovering far more information specific to Pizzagate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Right now? Aside from the nearly continuous stream of child-abuse related arrests (with 0 ability to link them), the intel is light on PG. We're focused on analyzing historic cases right now.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need more flexibility to open other channels that could lead to more PG related leaks/info/intel.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most recent example of how this could all apply?
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Awan may* be subject to investigation outside of bank fraud with the recent developments around the laptop, server, plea deal
            </li>
            <li>
             Awan's setup was linked to CA Attorney General Xavier Becerra
            </li>
            <li>
             Raymond Liddy was charged on child porn, as the deputy AG in CA:

            </li>
           </ul>

           </p>
           <p>
            1: Relevance: Posts must be directly relevant to investigation of Pizzagate: the sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of children by elites, child trafficking organized by elites, and/or cover-up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities.
            <strong>
             As well as any evidence/crimes that could lead to additional information pertaining to anyone implicated in Pizzagate involvement.

              But this is happening right now... on Voat.co/v/PG... it's like 75% PG related and 25% updates on the leaks/DNC/Seth Rich/Assange related topics. They don't tend to "bleed over" too frequently.
             </p>
             <p>
              That said, to avoid the risk, I'm totally willing to keep all leak/DNC/Assange related content in /pizzagatewhatever per

             I completely agree with this.  I feel the new lead should not be ignored regardless of whether or not there is concrete eveidence.  However,  until said evidence is discovered,  the post should remain in pizzagatewhatever.

           <p>
            A problem with this language is that it implicitly endorses the role of "the authorities" as being legitimate. Instead, I'd suggest "those with apparent power with the political, judicial, religious or corporate heirarchy".

             Good.  Maybe you should post elsewhere anyway if you don't have the intelligence to follow rules and understand why the post was deleted to begin with.

            I think of "Pizzagate" is an adjective at this point. If you think of it as an adjective, it's about the broader agenda of the
            <strong>
             elites
            </strong>
            as it relates to the relevant people and information within the investigation.

            I agree with all that want to change rule #1 when it's blatantly obvious it's pizza gate related but it gets deleted by MF before you can get a chance to post the obvious relation !

            I can't stand all this elites stuff. Posts should be relevant to child sex abuse/ enabling child sex abuse/child murder/organ harvesting/sketchy organizations/sketchy people .The investigation of the smaller, will lead to mid,to big, to elite. There are obviously many layers of operation here. To me it involves peeling off the layers. It seems we're getting closer to a big breakthrough, but posts can't be getting deleted for stupid reasons. Obviously anything that doesn't touch these subjects should be deleted.

            I think the community should decide whether it wants to continue further research (finding and pointing out new trees when everyone already sees the forest), or discussing ways to expose the forest to the masses (focus on exposure/redpilling/dissemination)

             Both are permissible, crazycycle. I made a sticky a while back explicitly clarifying that redpilling threads would be left up if they were written in a way that followed the rules, as well as a description of how to do that.

              OK.  Thank you.  Then, while the wording of rule 1 could still be an issue, the much bigger issue that should be addressed is the inconsistent manner in which the rules are interpreted and enforced by various mods.

              There's a rule issue, for sure, but the mod issue is much bigger.

            ’s comment that use of the word “elites” is a problem.  He suggests instead “those with authority and power, meaning; political, judicial, religious or corporate.”
           </p>
           <p>
            That would be a start, but the entertainment/broadcast industry would need to be added.  But even with that, people like James Alefantis and Jorge Puello would not be included.  Add the hospitality industry, and you pick up Alefantis but still exclude Puello.  To include him, you'd need to add child help organizations.  And then there's the medical industry, fraternal organizations, the military, intelligence, the transportation industry, and on and on.
           </p>
           <p>
            The point is, whenever you start listing, you're bound to miss something and you complicate the mods' job, not to mention limiting the scope of the research.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to face the reality that almost every facet of society today has the potential to harbor abusers because of the extreme infiltration that has taken place.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm in favor of combining Pizzagate and P Whatever because the division between them hampers research.  It’s true that small-town pedo ring members aren't the ones in charge at the top, but they might be directed by string-pullers higher up, whether they are aware of being directed or not.  A huge element of this is the possibility that some of the perps are mind-controlled patsies carrying out the dictates of an "invisible" hierachy.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, an abuser who has been caught victimizing his or her own child or a neighbor kid cannot realistically be deemed by us not to be involved in an organized ring.
            <strong>
             The fact that we don’t know about it yet doesn’t mean it’s not happening.
            </strong>
            We must remain open to the possibility if we’re serious about the research.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it's likely that many people who visit Pizzagate don't routinely visit P Whatever, and so connections that might have been useful are never made.
           </p>
           <p>
            In my opinion, mods should not be censoring/deleting anything except obvious shillage and things that have nothing even tangentially to do with abuse or murder of children.

           <p>
            <strong>
             Relevance:
            </strong>
            The goal of Pizzagate research is to identify and expose the specific persons and organizations who are directly responsible at the highest levels for ordering and/or perpetrating the abuse and/or murder of children in the U.S. and globally.
           </p>
           <p>
            Posts must be relevant to the goal of Pizzagate research and may include sourced information about conditions and circumstances that enable or have the potential to enable abuse as well as sourced information about perpetrators who are or have the potential to be abusing at the direction of others.

             I agree completely with the above information. The issue about sourcing also comes up because there are many whistleblowers on here who are trying to get information out without being directly linked. Some of us have been targeted and worse to silence us. The only way for us to help is dropping breadcrumbs. There are amongst us victims as well who are trying to leave information without being tracked. Many victims are so traumatized that even speaking is earth shattering much less putting together details of already fractured minds. We need these survivors. Some of us our them.
            </p>
            <p>
             It would be great to have a sub for that purpose. I could moderate that and quickly determine what information should be funneled to investigators in this forum.

              I agree that the factual claims sourcing requirement in Rule #2 as written might inhibit victims who want to come forward.  We could simply drop the requirement for victims who are telling their stories, but that would assuredly increase the shill activity dramatically.  Because some of them are put off by having to work at searching for a relevant source, the link requirement helps weed them out.
             </p>
             <p>
              Still, I continue to believe that separating into different subverses hampers the research.  I think Voat users should be the ones deciding the quality of posts, not mods, and most people don't visit other subverses.
             </p>
             <p>
              Instead, we could smooth the path for victims to tell their stories by rewriting Rule #2.  As it stands now, the rule doesn't actually prevent victims from coming forward.  They can already link to any one of vast numbers of research papers and testimonies that have something in common with what they went through, but that should be explained in the rule.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now it reads:

              <strong>
               Empiricism:
              </strong>
              EACH factual claim that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link. If you ask a question: Explain what led to your question and provide sources. If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them. Avoid baseless speculation. ALL posts must include at least one link.
             </p>
             <p>
              I propose we change it to this:

              <strong>
               Factual Claims:
              </strong>
              EACH factual claim in a post that is not common knowledge must be sourced with a link.  If the post is a victim’s personal story with no direct source to link, it is permissible to provide a link that has something in common with the victim’s experience along with a note explaining the connection (for example, “I experienced something like this.”)  If you ask a question, explain what led to your question and provide sources.  If you present opinion/argument, connect your dots and provide sources for them.  Avoid baseless speculation.  ALL posts must include at least one link.

                You'd have to add "must be sourced" at the beginning so as not to include the items that are permissible but not mandatory--like this:
               </p>
               <p>
                Posts must be sourced and relevant to the goal of Pizzagate research and may include sourced information about conditions and circumstances that enable or have the potential to enable abuse as well as sourced information about perpetrators who are or have the potential to be abusing at the direction of others.

            Btw, why does this need to be a sticky for a week? If it is of interest, won't it stay at the top of the "hot" column? I question the need to take down the executive summary 1) over the weekend when more lay people might be browsing the internet and 2) for an entire week. Very much does the cause a disservice.

            Thoughts on requiring all non embedded links (specifically YT and Vimeo) to have a a 1 or 2 sentence description on all OPs?  This could cut down on the shillbots whacko posts.

             Blacksmith, are you suggesting something beyond what Rule 3 already requires? It reads:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              EACH link in your post must include a description of content and how the link relates to the post (except when markup is used to embed links in the specific text they support).
             </p>

             I highly agree.  I really do not like watching YT videos.  I would rather read, but when necessary I will watch, but many times question WTH is this?  Then I have to watch for a while until I figure it out.  Some I just never get.  A few words would help.

            My issue is with the definition of the word "elites".
           </p>
           <p>
            The word has different connotations in different regions, and as such different readers have different ideas about
            <em>
             who
            </em>
            the word refers to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Swapping elites for "Those with authority and power, meaning political, judicial, religious or corporate"
           </p>
           <p>
            Semantically it means the same thing, but any connotations and assumptions are removed by the expanded sentence.
           </p>
           <p>
            For many the word elites focuses attention on the visible people at the top of the pile and omits the non-visible people that support actively them but few people know about.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example a possible draft could be:
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            1: Relevance: Posts must be directly relevant to investigation of the organised and systemic sexual/physical abuse and/or murder of children by those with authority and power, meaning; political, judicial, religious or corporate.
            <br/>
            Topics in focus are: child trafficking, systemic &amp; ritualised abuse of children, and/or cover-up of these activities and/or the protection/assistance provided to the people who engage in said activities.
            <br/>
            See definition of Pizzagate and examples of relevant posts.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            It is a bit overly broad in this first rough attempt, maybe some word-smith can find a way to tighten it up.
            <br/>
            The re-wording is intended to avoid the flood of posts about singular individuals who do these things and force a focus on systematised groups that do these things and use their positions in government, churches and big corporations to hide the activity.
            <br/>
            By going for the organised abuse the singular individuals will be exposed anyway, but the applied effort of the community has a greater effect.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is pretty much the same thing as the definition in the sidebar rules, but maybe it's enough of a change to move past this issue without opening the barn door to disruptors and wagon hopping agenda pushers.

             This makes the most sense to me. I understand not wanting to allow shill posts and I agree 100%, but at the same time, I think there are quality posts getting deleted because they fall just outside of the small umbrella that is Rule 1.

              I have to agree as well. Many well-researched posts by respected researchers get deleted.  We know these people are not shills and should be allowed to post their well-intended research.

              Obviously . they are the henchmen of the elite. The big players don't do their own dirty work. It's foolish and ignorant to ignore this aspect of PG. But of course if we start looking into the practical ways PG plays out rather than the theoretical/esoteric, something might actually get done/get discovered... Not surprising mods have consistently shot down this line of investigation.

                I just got through arguing this point with another goater.  We were arguing with a pedo. Nasty business.  Yes, there are a few things that need to be changed also, but the main thing is the 100 points problem.  Then also I do not like when they give out numbers to people when people can't come up with a name.  When people have a label or name it is easier to recall, but numbers, especially longer ones are totally confusing.

             I totally agree those who couldnt deny pizza gate facts derailed it by defining it ever more narrowly. I.e. see snopes approach.  Lets call a spade a spade and leave past pizzagate confusion behind.
