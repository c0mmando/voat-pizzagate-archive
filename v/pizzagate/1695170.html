<p>So I am wondering, if Julian Assange is still in the London Ecuadorian Embassy, <em>as the ZeroHedge article presumes</em>, why is Ecuador not able to ship him in a diplomatic pouch crate to Ecuador where he could then live more freely?

             Until I began to question absolutely everything after 9/11 (heck, now I  feel 90% sure that we didn't even go to the moon!) and researching everything for myself, I was asking the same kinds of questions.  The answer you are asking for here is very complex and highly technical. Could it actually be pulled off? Absolutely. Was it pulled off? Yes, I think so, And actually very poorly. If you're really interested in more information about this I would suggest going onto YouTube and watching as many videos as you can find about search terms relating to "Assange Hannity Interview hoax". I haven't looked at any because I understand how they could do what I think they did do. But I'll bet you anything that there are plenty of YouTube videos on this question out there if you look.
            </p>
            <p>
             Frankly, the whole thing is fascinating, regarding how they do stuff like this. And not to ramble, but there are very good reasons to take the time to check into questions like this that you have, Because once we understand the tricks and techniques that they use, we can spot things in a heartbeat.  Buckle up... when you're ready try watching every video you can find on YouTube listed as "Sandy Hook Hoax".  You will never be the same again. Taking it even further than that, when you're ready start watching videos on YouTube about "911 was an inside job" or "911 hoax".
            </p>
            <p>
             Someone who is new to all of this may find it more than overwhelming. But the take-home message here, to me, is that if we know how much and how deeply everyone is being lied to about pizzagate, why wouldn't we generalize that to understand that they'll lie and manipulate about everything imaginable  - and BEYOND.
            </p>
            <p>
             William Casey (former CIA Director) is believed to have said, "We'll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false."  Bingo.

            So if wikileaks is saying that Assange is in Sweden, shouldn't someone tell Lasso? and is Sweden going to admit that they kidnapped an Australian citizen out of an embassy? Why is Ecuador staying hush and pretending he is still there? What does Ecuador gain by covering up for sweden? This whole thing is crazy.

            so sweden kidnapped assange for a faux rape charge and he's not allowed to post bail? WTF? It very sad that Australia is not stepping up

             Hannity is a piece of CRAP!!  He and Oliver North -- of Iran Contra-Mena coke smuggling fame -- stole millions with their "Freedom Concerts."  Notice in the paperwork that SH flies via "New World" Air.

            I don't believe that's Assange there. Pizzagate really distracted from the Assange stuff that went down in November. If you think the circumstantial evidence in pizzagate is enough to be sure its real then the circumstantial evidence that Assange was abducted and is no longer at the embassy should be eye opening as well.

             His appearance on Hannity December 15 and January 2 were legitimate. Believing he's not there requires collusion on the part of Hannity. There is a tendency to see conspiracy in everything, but sometimes one has to take things at face value.

              I do not believe Hannity interviewed Assange at the Embassy.  I watched the Fox News Hannity show on 1/3/17 and watched Hannity filmed 'walking toward the embassy' and then a very strange interview where Hannity looked like a midget compared to Assange in the same room. There was Hannity's shadow behind him but no shadow of Assange. In addition, Hannity is known for taking 'selfies' with his guests and posting them on Twitter. He never posted a selfie with Assange. I call BS. I have also called out Hannity to be honest about this. Watch this video:

              did hannity film at the embassy? I didn't watch the videos, nor do I know enough about Assange's voice, face or person to judge these things, so I hope he is okay where ever he is.

               I watched the video at the time, and it was presented as coming from the Embassy. I just went to Youtube to glance at the video again and noted two odd things. The video does not show them shaking hands at the beginning or end, and Hannity doesn't look right against the background. It looks like green screen. I missed this first time around. Quick googling shows this has been discussed in Reddit. I'm going to retract on my certainty. Assange could have insisted on Hannity's presence knowing full well half the planet was looking for confirmation he was still alive, and surely he would know no one would accept green screen chicanery.

                its hard to say, I remember the reddit comments at the time, so I don't think JA is there, but if he is asked to leave it really raises a lot of questions and if the cia took him, then will Obama be held responsible for kidnapping an austrialian citizen out of a foreign embassy? That is pretty fucked up.

             I don't think he is there either, but the leading candidate of the upcoming Ecuadorian election thinks he is there, so that makes me wonder why are they pretending, or better yet do they expect him to walk out the front door when asked to leave? what are they going to say when he is not revealed to be not there? That their embassy was breached?

              I think they are in on the sham though. I have no idea what's really happening with them. My best latest guess is Hillary did kidnap him like it was described. Black bagged and flown to the US. Thing is who is pretending to be assange now and he seems to be trying to help expose the pedos. So far. I don't know if they are bad guys pretending to be good to pull the rug out later or if the good guys are the ones controlling Assange's image since he was taken. Like they are using assange as a voice to expose secrets knowing the bad guys can't call bullshit because they were the ones who took him.

                I don't know what to think anymore.  I was convinced for awhile that the CIA took him to VA and he is kept there underground in that tunnel  or the CIA flew him to Guantanamo.  Then I revert back to well, maybe he is still there, and then......Oh gosh.  The whole thing sounds crazy.  I think something happened because that would be their ploy.  Driving us crazy.

                 I feel the same way, so when Lasso says he has to go, I wonder what's going to happen. The obvious thing to do is for Moreno to ship JA to Ecudor now in a pouch, and then let him be seen, because I don't think Trump will intervene in that, but if the CIA took JA, then it will become obvious and then will Obama be held responsible for kidnapping an Australian citizen out of a inviolate embassy? Pretty damning crime I think...

                  This would make the hottest selling movie ever.  When I was on Reddit, I remember two people following an airplane from London Airport on some kind of radar and they said it was a corporate plane and it went to VA.  It was the day that they shut the Airport down in London.  Highly suspicious. I have always wondered about that.  I wish I could see that thread now.

                     I think someone took him, I guess it is CIA because they had local co-operation and the resources but I think now that Trump won and the Russia war never happened, they had to get rid of him so I don't know where he is now. Maybe they gave him to sweden who will try to figure out how to get him back to E. embassy? He's a hot potato that is for sure.

                     I will edit to say I used to think good guys had him, but now I am not sure.

                      I totally agree.  I became very suspicious after the Vault 7 debacle.  Nothing on Feb. 19th.  Huge build up and Huge let down.  I mentioned this to two friends and they did not know what I was talking about.  I am so grateful for this site, because I don't know who to talk to about this stuff, except on here.  What a let down, having no war.  How boring for them.
