            Fox News is slowly rolling out the most important news story any of you will ever learn of.
           </p>
           <p>
            Prince bin Talal was paying for our presidents through bribing our political elites to get Obama elected. He even paid for Obama's Harvard education.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Hillary offered to do the same, but couldn't deliver, she owed bin Talal all his contributions back. Obama sent funds to Iran before leaving office to repay the bribes. Those funds ended up in various locations funding ISIS.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Trump visited Saudi Arabia (first stop as POTUS) he was given a King's welcome, unique among past presidents. This is because the King hates this pedophile caliphate and Trump offered aid to remove bin Talal and open trade on the NYSE. This eliminates the need for harmful umbrella real estate deals currently the only option for Saudi wealth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now that bin Talal is in custody he will be brought here and his information will take down HRC, Obama, both Bush presidents and many, many others.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is absolutely enormous.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is in Asia right now assuring Japan that we will retaliate against North Korea if they strike Japan. This opens up more free trade in exchange. China free trade is on the horizon. These were tools to punish nations not bowing down to this Hivite caliphate.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have been subtly (and not so subtly) mind controlled through media moguls owned by this caliphate. They revise events and narratives to their means and have been deep stating governments for a looooooooong time. Think ancient Phoenicia, where the practice of child sacrifice and prostitution, as well as the use of prostitution to ensnare state officials, was common. Sound familiar? The Hivite families use extreme control methods in their raising of children, creating dissociated minds in every child through torture. Have you noticed how much pop culture TV and film lately has themes of mind control and dissociated states? This is the NSA countering the Hivites in Hollywood with their own methods...waking us up to the biggest red pill we'll ever have to choke down. It's going to hurt.

            Hillary was all set to be President and I think white hats in government prevented her from winning by cheating the good guys foiled the plot to rig the voting machines or to reduce the rigging so Trump could win the key electoral states that put him over the top.

            Regarding Alice &amp; Wonderland - I was watching through a video by this guy named George Webb on Youtube (who I was linked to from one of these Pizzagate threads) - and as I was reading Q anon's posts, Webb said something along the lines of "The atmosphere in the House is one of pure terror right now; before, they used to have these shit-eating grins, like the Cheshire (Cat) Grin from Alice in Wonderland, you know.."
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't know about the "&amp;" part being different though. Maybe it's nothing and we're hyperfocusing on it?

            Stop posting this fucking shit.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing is happening. Nothing was ever going to happen. A cuckchan LARPer who doesn’t even know how to use a tripcode is not one of the ONLY TEN PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING WORLD with a specific level of security clearance and “full knowledge of this plan.” Someone that important is not posting on 4chan. Someone that important–if he actually has knowledge he wants to disseminate–is also not going to type cryptic bullshit that looks like it came from more than two people and ask questions that he doesn’t answer. Someone that important is, statistically, owned by jews, even if there are some patriots left up there. Out of 20 of the most powerful people in the entire fucking world, the redditors on 4chan expect one of them to not only be “#ourguy”, but to leak the proceedings of FUCKING NATIONWIDE MARTIAL LAW and–surprise surprise–the arrest of three quarters of the US government.

            Why, that’s exactly what we would want! Happy day! All of our dreams are coming true, and we didn’t even have to put in an ounce of work ourselves! Hooray! It’s over! We’re saved! DON’T QUESTION IT, just spend the entire day ignoring literally everything else that is ACTUALLY happening in the news, never mind your own wildly successful campaign of “It’s okay to be white.” Because nothing ever came from YOU doing an honest day’s work!

            If there is something, why is nothing happening? Where’s the Emergency Broadcast System announcement? Where’s Trump using Obama’s emergency television override to speak to the people? Where’s the martial law? Where are the riots he talked about? Antifa couldn’t even get off their asses for a completely unrelated outing. Where’s the Huma arrest? Where are the Podesta arrests? They were supposed to be in custody by now; no one has any information on that beyond your continued shilling campaign. WHERE IS ANY MENTION OF JEWS, WHATSOEVER, IN ANYTHING THAT HE WROTE? Why is he a CIVIC NATIONALIST? Nothing he said has happened.

             That is the most sane thing I have heard in two days. Half the Saudi Royal family just got whacked over the Saudi Aramco largest IPO in history and the largest oil company in the world and people think our government went all the way to Saudia Arabia to drain our own swamp when all they have to do is arrest their own selves, which ain't happening.

              This isn't that kind of campaign. It's a citizen campaign and must be. It's been waged all year through psy-ops triggering. Go back and look at the films and show content. Trumps Twitter. This must come from us or it doesn't work. They know that in the NSA and THAT'S WHY THEY POST ON 4CHAN. We have to be more progressive in our thinking. It's the progressiveness that has gotten us this far ahead of their narrative.

            Keep pushing, VOATers! Citizen investigators are the backbone of this fight, and you are defeating them!!! They are all running scared, making mistakes, and exposing themselves. This is going to come out, and VOAT will be recognized for the contributions it made to this historic moment. Survivors like me NEED you to keep pushing! We cannot do it without you. Please, don't give up, keep pushing, stay resolute and SAY BRAVE THINGS!!!!

                        I'm going to need to make a long post about your ass. You've already written me from Stephen's today. You also have the Stephen Paddock name on Twitter. I have a list of your names and profiles. I have saved everything. I've asked you to leave me the fuck alone and I would leave you alone. Why can't you just stop contacting me?! Why is that so hard for you?!

                         Listen Stratfor Queen, you are the one bitching about me behind my back, acting the innocent, while trying to get me to cheat with you behind your husbands back.
I said no but we could be friends because I liked you and what did you do?  You had my cousin killed.  I know this because you are in the Illuminati and trying to frame me in a Uranium One scandal with hardened war criminals just because of the Las Vegas mis-hap. 
You bought the ticket, you will damn well take the Uranium Ride by yourself.

                        You need to tell your fuckin psycho friend to leave me the fuck alone. She's threatened me and now she's making lie posts like I'm in the ailluminati.

                       <p>
                        She threatened my kids. I'm sick of this fake fucker who won't leave me alone and stalks me here and Twitter! I've been nice because she's supposedly brilliant.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        She's a fuckin shill that's a dude! She plays tons of characters. I need you to get this bitch to leave me  is the crazy stalker I've been talking about. She's writing me from different threads and starting to threaten me again.

                         srayzie, can you hear how desperate the troll is running these alts? This is a tactic called baiting -- don't fall for it. He will suffer most if you downvoat and ignore. Don't let him get a rise out of you. He's pitiful, really.

                          I try but she's going to make people think I'm in the fricken Illuminati and tried to have an affair with her. I told her I'm not into women. I told her that her art looks like the kind from Comet ping pong and is full of Illuminati symbolism. She would give me links to YouTube videos that had strange glitching music and clicks like she was trying to use some MKUltra on me.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I felt bad for her at first thinking she was a victim and would tell her to stop listening to Satan who she said is her father. She's been obsessed with me. I think it's a guy. Whoever it is, she made threats against me and my family. She acts like she has access to IP addresses and has connections so she can intimidate me.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Some might believe her because they don't know how crazy she is. She's the one that made posts accusing psychanaut of being with Stratfor. She made this post about me...

                          She makes alts and comments to herself on here and Twitter. She uses different roles. Her King shadily Stephen Paddock Twitter that she links us to plays a male role. Another is of a beautiful artist. So it's hard to have her try to convince the people here that I talk to everyday (some have become dear to me) that I'm part of the Illuminati, Stratfor, or tried to have an affair with her.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          It's hard enough keeping my mouth shut when she posts disinfo here. She trolls  people here and tells lies about them. She's friends with Jem (they are close) who is quiet when "Sarah" is trolling, but says how brilliant she is if she posts something that is good. I would appreciate if Jem would tell her friend to leave me alone. I don't want Jem to hate me but it's weird being told that Sarah's from the most powerful family in the world. Bullshit. I pushed it aside so we could get along.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          "Sarah" is on voat ALL THE TIME under different profiles and I can tell it's her. I usually keep my mouth shut since she threatened me. I've blocked 2 of her profiles on Twitter. I told her I would leave her alone if she would leave me alone. But now she's starting things with me again. She says her dad runs Racine. She acts like a whistle blower. She manipulates people. She commented back and forth with a victim here. She was playing a different role. That pisses me off because that's cruel.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          She's going to be mad that I even said this. I'm gonna try to ignore her but hope that people here don't believe this crap.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I'm letting you guys that I pinged know what's going on. You can read thru the different threads to see what happened last night if you want.

                           Take a deep breath...then start laughing your ass off that you've wasted so much Soros money on this shill who thinks they can damage you in any way. They can't. You are living in their head rent free and running up their internet bill. Pour yourself an adult beverage and glory in it. We are winning! 🍻

                           Your ping to Vindicator did not go through due to a space in the wrong place.  I am sorry for your problem with this user.  Let us know if this is corrected when you get through to the mod. Very odd and strange to say the least.

                          I am phobic of you. You were a nice person at first. I was nice to you until you threatened my kids. I felt bad for you. If you care at all, you would just leave me alone and not spread lies.

                          I've been dealing with this person for a long time. He or she has stalked me for months on Twitter and here. I think this is SoberSecondThought or she's involved. She has told me for months that her dad runs Racine but her dad does what she tells him to.

                          She makes several different profiles on different social media accounts and she even responds to herself under different profiles. She's a fuckin psycho and threatened my kids.

                             Jem refused to respect the submission rules despite a direct request from VictorSteinerDavion. Her response to the resulting ban has been to make an alt and go around trash talking mods and concern trolling in people's posts sowing doubt and discouragement. Why would we unban?

            The United States Intelligence Community (USIC) is comprised of 16 agencies/entities which in turn fall under the general auspices of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).  The ODNI and its head DNI, were created as a response to 9/11 and wrested control of the IC from the CIA effectively, but not really.  This occurred under Bush but was never consolidated.  The DNI reports to POTUS and had been so throughout the last administration.  In addition, this ODNI had access to additional strategic intelligence which worked its way up through the top of other agencies, not already under control of the Deep State (DS).  I'll spare everyone the big long list.  Yeah, Wikileaks sucks but all of the information is more or less accurate in this overview:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no unified "military intelligence" per se.  Each service branch has its own "military intelligence" entity.  Military intelligence agencies, of course, cooperate with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).  The DIA exists to collect intelligence for military-related purposes.  That definition, can be applied broadly.
           </p>
           <p>
            About Flynn: (Wikipedia) "In September 2011, Flynn was promoted to Lieutenant General and assigned as assistant director of national intelligence in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
           </p>
           <p>
            On April 17, 2012, President Barack Obama nominated Flynn to be the 18th director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.[21][22] Flynn took command of the DIA in July 2012.[23]
           </p>
           <p>
            He simultaneously became commander of the Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, and chair of the Military Intelligence Board."  Flynn was also very tied into another entity you should be aware of, US Army INSCOM - United States Army Intelligence and Security Command.  These are 10,000+ active, GS, and civilian personnel who have a wide-range of find, fix, and finish solutions, in conjunction with more conventional military and intelligence roles.  INSCOM has very close ties with the NSA, which is still a military and not civilian agency, like the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is generally not discussed is Flynn's former command of...."Military Intelligence" - Flynn was for Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) aka DEVGRU (Seal Team 6), Combat Applications Group (CAG)(aka Delta Force) and a handful of other special operations groups commonly referred to as "tip of the spear".  These operators and their REMFs ((;)) are largely incorruptible absolute patriots in the truest sense of the word.  /most "operators" are never truly out, because they never want to leave.  That bond extends all the way to the men who led them - Flynn, McChrystal, and others had the keys to the Ferrari (JSOC) and they test drove it thoroughly.  The last administration could not crack the top of JSOC.  So those motherfuckers...Extortion 17 is all I have to say.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, if you were Trump and wanted a group of highly motivated and revenge-minded individuals who stared the Deep State in the mouth and tried to kill it, spilling only their own blood, to exact revenge, who would it be?  Fucking JSOC is who I'd pick - Vegas was the first preview.  (Mr. Prince hopefully is getting his hands dirty as well)
           </p>
           <p>
            So under what circumstance would this occur?  That, I'd love to know.  But I'm pretty sure some form of legally enforceable, light footprint martial law would trigger that.  This would allow POTUS to take direct control of any assets he deems necessary - INSCOM runs ops, JSOC performs takedowns and special mission taskings, USMC (look who surrounds POTUS) (possibly in some clause in the USMC charter?) would allow POTUS to use the Marines to oversee the National Guard elements?  Though NG units are under control of the state governors.  So I'm not clear in this area.  Any JAGs in the room?

                You'd be shocked at the depth the DS has penetrated the bureaucracy, as well as the IC.  Note the penetration of the IC is concentrated in non-mil constituents - CIA, State, Justice/FBI, Treasury, HS, etc.  The depths of penetration will vary by department or smaller.  It all depends on who retired, quit, etc. and was replaced by a sycophant, who would then drive everyone else out, away, etc.  If HRC had gotten in, she would have had 8 more years to cement this coup from within.  Now that POTUS knows about it, he hopefully can start rooting it out our government at all levels.

            I think Q is Sarah Sanders. She speaks in Qs for press briefings sometimes. Her father was a minister and Q's bread crumbs have plenty of mention of religious things.   There was a tweet from her showing a pic from the plane high in air. She mentioned something about the view up here is great. Q said something of the same. Just my opinion. We are saving the kiddos, peeps. God be with us all right now and keep POTUS safe

             People have assumed that Q-level clearance is American only .It's not. Other countries have a "q" level that is not as high. 
Furthermore, it is a great tactic for foreign intelligence to leak known wrongdoing by an enemy to his people, so it is also possible that this could be a foreign intelligence operation.

             If it was a larp thread, why derail it? The moment i ask this question, a sperg shows up with some bullshit of "muh trooth!!!"

             Don't buy into it at face value, this is VERY IMPORTANT, that is why they were asking the million questions. They want digging, this is not leaks, this is digging.
            </p>
            <p>
             That is VERY IMPORTANT, that is a key detail, that means that something has been released, is out there, but needs to be made mainstream.

             A big happening yesterday was the prince who owns twitter being arrested. SA was mentioned a lot, and they had a purge.  This is a happening, but this is more than just face value, it is very deep.

                Great! I will be on it when it is posted. When I read post of We The Pizza from 11 mons ago I think the shills came out to kill it bc it was real. Even a guy from Daily Beast wrote article about it.  I am all over it when you see. Thx! MAGA

                 MAGA!  In the stickied thread under 'research* I've posted that someone found the Voat threads. We need someone to look through them and collate / spell out the proofs. If you know anyone : ). If we got THIS, there's no word which describes how HUGE it would be. Thanks D :)

                   Here goes hopefully --- we need source / proof that the entire block where CPP and Besta pizza are located are owned by Saudi Price Bin Talal, arrested yesterday. Can anyone search the Voat threads in this link, for proofs and collate them?

               There is a pizza place in DC called We The Pizza. Sounds like they ship kids out of D.C. To Saudis. I know we had a posting on that place months ago. Don't know how to find.  Somebody thought they were suspect for pedo ring.

            The real Litmus Test, and the "Root" of the real agenda and system of Global Criminal Corruption is Racine, Wisconsin - Paul Ryan's district.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine also has deep Saudi and Pakistani ties, but the real agenda is far beyond the Saudis and Pakistanis. Racine will determine whether this is about the Art of the Deal, or about the Truth.

              George Webb said something this morning in his 1st or 2nd video that some of those sealed indictments will probably be ones that are dead. I haven't been able to check it all out. Did you? He acted like that would be the only reason they are still sealed.

                What I mean is that all the indictments aren't of people that are alive according to him. Only some. I only watched that one video today so I wondered if that were the case.

              Your ludicrous attempts to besmirch his name are backfiring.  Any observer can see this is not limited to "elite Talmudist" Jews.  Your attempt to shoehorn Muslims into this is even more outrageously offensive to everyone's intelligence.  You have CLEARLY been a shill for Webbs crew since day 1.  You think we will lose sight of how many awful racist Jews are involved in Trump's admin?  Get real

              lostandfound123 here...now able to speak publicly as Christopher Cronsell, a victim/survivor with unique insights. This goes deeper than Luciferianism. Consider the Hivites and their infiltration of the Levant. Phoenicia never fell, just reinvented its narrative as deep state actors ever since. This power and control model has been in place since Egypt. The religion doesn't matter, only the psychology control it lends to the Hivite culture.

                I don't ascribe to that concept at all. This isn't a patriarchal issue. That is their narrative, intended to be reversed in the near future. The inverted mom. Wow. Check Beck's new album. The signs have been installed intentionally from within our intelligence community (guessing here but makes plenty of sense as the recent films and shows are triggering many awake) to wake up beforehand and stop their narrative.

                  I don't ascribe to that concept at all. This isn't a patriarchal issue. That is their narrative, intended to be reversed in the near future.

                 Yes it is their narrative and votescam pushes it like crazy. Discuss the reversal i'm interested in that.

                  These people set up civilization. They run looooooooong games for us to play, like this apocalypse from their authored book of revelations. The patriarchal systems have been slowly pushed aside culturally in favor of the age of the woman. As they always deal in inverted meanings and reversals, mom upside down is wow. Meaningless, vapid response to stimulus. Plugged in. General population dissociated through distractions. Also inverted mother means ruling through evil means such as Hillary. As our Antichrist.

                <p>
                 Basically your post is very unclear ... you might try again ... however ...
                </p>
                <p>
                 Which issue?
                </p>
                <p>
                 On our planet -- given the oppression of women all over the world -- women who are the majority despite the murder of 50 million or more at last count -- and this has been going on for more than 50,000 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Evidently triggered by famine -- males came out from somewhere behind Turkey ...
women were those doing farming.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Who is "they" ???
                </p>
                <p>
                 In order for MALES to sexually abuse children, abusers/Elite patriarchy have to control mothers/females.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Nature has given all responsibility for children to females --

                      Is that why your people will not stay out of our elementary schools attempting to teach them how to best sexually your their anuses? Typical pervert. Blaming us of "being obsessed" because you won't stop talking about children's anuses.

                  Nice try. The females in this system are equally evil if not worse. Remember, it was Eve who gave the apple to Adam. The practice of compromising others through rape allegations and ensnaring husbands through pregnancy is not new. Dualities and false dilemma fallacies are a trap for civilization. Be gone shill.

                The sons of man vs the sons of God (ie Guild of Doom). Lucifer is knowledge, as in knowledge of how to deceive and control. Intellect. In that sense it is luciferian. Esoteric concepts reveal a truth beyond the myth. Pharoahs began this system, Joseph stole it and the revisionist methods have co-opted every narrative since. Jesus was a whistle-blower. Killed for waking up the masses and then his message subverted by the Catholic institution.

                   I'm unaware of this term. I use a 'sense' within me to understand patterns and overlay them with my current understanding of their culture. They leave truths within each biblical story. Ham saw his father in his naked form for example, when his father was drunk. He went to his brothers to tell them what he saw. His brothers went to tell Noah what Ham had reported. But they walked in backwards, so as not to see their father's nakedness. This is a parable about admitting their sins openly. It is never done and no one speaks of it. Ham violated the speak no evil policy and was cursed. Make sense?

             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Operation Mockingbird was an alleged large-scale program of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that began in the early 1950s and attempted to manipulate news media for propaganda purposes. It funded student and cultural organizations and magazines as front organizations.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to writer Deborah Davis, Mockingbird recruited leading American journalists into a propaganda network and oversaw the operations of front groups. CIA support of front groups was exposed after a 1967 Ramparts magazine article reported that the National Student Association received funding from the CIA. In the 1970s, Congressional investigations and reports also revealed Agency connections with journalists and civic groups. None of these reports, however, mentions an Operation Mockingbird controlling or supporting these activities.
           </p>
           <p>
            A Project Mockingbird is mentioned in the CIA Family Jewels report, compiled in the mid-70s. According to the declassified version of the report released in 2007, Project Mockingbird involved wire-tapping of two American journalists for several months in the early 1960s.

             Independence ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Did notice over the weekend some Enquirer-type stuff at supermarkets were suggesting 
Oswald had been connected to the CIA ...
            </p>
            <p>
             This is of course true -- but don't know what source they're using ....
            </p>
            <p>
             John Tunheim and panel of 4 headed up the 1992 JFK Classified Records act to totally review the still secret records ....
            </p>
            <p>
             In a program presented on History/Discovery Channel at the time they were calling themselves "The Network for the New Millennia" they covered some details of JFK assassination and combined it with a Report from the Tunheim Panel ...
which was repeated at the very end of this one hour program....
            </p>
            <p>
             At the very end of it, Tunheim repeats again their unanimous conclusion which earlier they had all repeated they agreed with ...
            </p>
            <p>
             Tunheim repeats at least TWICE that ...
            </p>
            <p>
             'OSWALD WAS EMPLOYED BY THE CIA WORKING ON HIGH LEVEL ASSIGNMENTS
AND PROBABLY ALSO FOR THE FBI."
            </p>
            <p>
             and, as Tunheim repeats those words, the TEXT appears below on the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
             I had the recording, except for the last part as something interrupted the taping ....
Was  sure that the program would repeat again, but never got the chance again.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tunheim also reported to some members of Congress what their unanimous conclusion was ...
this was about the time of the GOP attempt to impeach Clinton re Lewinsky.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, we were told immediately by Oswald mother's that he was CIA ... and it was highly believable.
They threatened Margueritte Oswald with being put into an insane asylum.
Same thing they did to Jean Hill -- but Hill kept going.
Marguette was an older woman and much more of a threat to CIA/corrupt government.
She and Oswald's wife, Marina, where pretty much held non-communicato by FBI and other agencies.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, journalists at the time immediately asked to see Oswald's employment records, IRS filings,
W-2 forms, and tax returns ... and they were always denied.  Evidently, threat to "national security."  :)
            </p>
            <p>
             But these are all documents the Tunheim Panel would have seen.

             You have a version of Operation Mockingbird which is rather lame ... 
Go to Wiki for a better version -- surprisingly -- and Wiki has since June been under heavy editing.
Actually, Phil Graham was recruited to move American journalism into the CIA column and this was
also true around the world.  It's not "alleged" it is reality.
            </p>
            <p>
             From what I've read recently, the original enticement or "request" by the CIA wasn't exactly based on free will but threats.
In other words, this program was another arm of the fascist movement being brought to US as "Nazism."
            </p>
            <p>
             Basically, no matter what we're talking about (and see the post by Bopper below) is the violence of the few used to control the many.  Murderous control.  And what we're talking about is Elites ...
            </p>
            <p>
             The head of the snake effecting everything is Elite patriarchal violence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Organized patriarchal religion (male-supremacist religion) in all of its convoluted writings, attempts at dictatorial control over the masses by use of FEAR of Satan/Heaven and Hell, is actually what underpins Elite Patriarchy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Plus our own Constitution where Our Founders actually created an Elite Patriarchy --- endowed them with land grants, gave them immense influence and control over our "people's" government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.
In other words, put them in control.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our Founders saved and supported the system of Slavery for Elites/wealthy which guaranteed the Civil War which split the nation into two camps of hatred which still echo today.  Further, it also created an opportunity for the creation of mass armies and made Elites even wealthier.
            </p>
            <p>
             These are the "Christians" who enslaved Africans here and murdered in the most brutal and cruel ways 112 million native people here from whom they stole this land.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also note that the companions to Operation Mockingbird are also very important in the eventual right wing control we have seen over the US and other nations -- Operation Paperclip, where 200,000 ex-Nazis were brought in to the Us.  They were used to found the CIA, funneled into the FBI and other government agencies, and to "hot spots" around the world to ensure the rise of the Fourth Reich.
            </p>
            <p>
             Operation Gladio was to be used to ensure that only the right wing would control governments
here and around the world, beginning with nations over which the US had influence and control
at the end of WWII ... Germany, Japan, France, Italy.  (I'd also add UK and Greece.)
In fact, the US resurrected the Mafia in Italy to ensure that this program would be carried out efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are only a few dozen or so CIA programs that are generally known about -- 
though there may have been thousands.
             <br/>
             You should also look at MKULTRA ... the Monarch documents were ordered destroyed
by CIA Dir. Richard Helms on his retirement.
            </p>
            <p>
             It would be a mistake to believe that CIA's general control over our media or society
has ever ended -- or its take over of our government.
            </p>
            <p>
             You should also read Carl Bernstein's "Rolling Stone" stone article 
which was a very LATE (1977) unveiling of Operation Mockingbird and it 
reported at that time about 700 CIA journalists if I recall correctly.
             <br/>
             A few years later, in his second report, there were 1,200 CIA journalists.
Imagine where we are today.
We have a CIA/Corporate press which corrupts all media.

            <p>
             Mockingbird was being drafted two years before the end of WWII by Cord Meyers
who later was CIA and it was later run by Allen Dulles/CIA.
Both OSS and CIA were inspirations of the Council on Foreign Relations.

             We won the war against Germany, but not against fascism.

             Where is that hinted at, or stated? The answer to your second question is yes, and your grandparents too. And theirs. Woodrow Wilson admits this. Great Depression was created by the money masters, to further consolidate their power.

                   I bet you do support the labor unions now that you marxists trashed them and turned them into a tool of oppression of the average worker. Back when labor unions still had enough power to fight for the workers I supported them too. Now I would have to vote to destroy and rebuild them because like every other nice thing humanity ever had you screwed that up too.

                    ESO --

                    Do you ever read anything except right wing propaganda ...
Go to your library and you'll find books written by Mafia acknowledging their
attacks on unions and union members for Elites ...
How do you think Mafia was moved into the unions?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is how all liberal organizations are destroyed -- through violence by the right wing.
Why do you think there were never any unions in the South, except for right wing violence?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The uniting bond among us all is that we are all LABOR ... we don't need the permission
of government or corporations to unite together for the benefit of labor.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It is Elites who exploit labor for their own profit.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The highest number of unionization we had in the US ever was only 39% ...
and because of right wing attacks and violence and co-opting of the unions ...
it's less than 7% today .. at the moment I don't really know the numbers.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That's how wages of all employees have been kept down over the past 40 years...
stagnant wages ... aided by the collapse of the floor that unions provided under wages.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Sad to see how the right wing plays with your brain.

                     There you go again. Get it right and replace "right wing" with Marxist Communism and we can eliminate one of "problematic" variables you keep rolling into the equation.

                         Nope. The judiciary around here is not full of cryptos Khazars. They are fine with child rapers getting what they deserve. Great place to live. Your kind is scared to death to even drive near this part of the country. We make sure of it.

                           Nobody is threatening you. If people get caught molesting children in the area I live in they go to jail or they get hurt by the relatives of the molested child. That is the way life must be. If you feel threatened by that then don't come around my neighborhood because that is what would happen to you if you get caught.

that would seem to threaten anyone here.

                           Nobody is threatening you. If getting put in jail for molesting children seems threatening to you then maybe you should be afraid because if people get caught doing that around my neighborhood they go to jail or someone sends them to the hospital. That is the way it should be. Tough if you think its harsh.

                   You have to be so extreme about everything. I can't stand Hillary. That should have been obvious to you long ago. The majority of this nation are mind controlled libtards. You fit right in. You probably wear vagina costumes and go on the women's marches.

                     No. I am a woman. Of course I don't obsess over menstruation and vaginas. Depending on my mood, it's sometimes amusing to see you flip out and have a psychotic breakdown.

                    <p>
                     So because Trump talked about grabbing pussy one time, it makes him a sick pervert for the rest of his life? Who hasn't said something that some consider inappropriate? Who cares that he said that years ago. Good thing I'm not judged by the things that I've said out loud.

                 You mix bullshit with truth and that is your specialty. You are pretty good at it too. But you showed me your true colors when you pushed transgenderism and dared me to deny the holocaust. I know what you are.

             <p>
              Paddock shot from a high ⬆window, like Oswald. Paddock most likely CIA. People claimed to see Paddock after the shooting when he was supposedly dead. There was at least 3 Oswald look a likes, supposedly. 
There is rumors that a VIP was on the tarmac in Vegas, the night of the shooting, Paddock may have been sent to assassinate that VIP?

               Hi say ...
              </p>
              <p>
               Can you provide us with some links to your info ...
I usually read very little about these "events" which are more than ever turning
out to be false flags ... and wait for the investigations which often reveal the 
connections to government ...
Hadn't seen anything yet on this -- EXCEPT the report by the young girl (now dead) who
revealed that there were many shooters at the scene.  And that they were chasing people
and shooting them.
Would appreciate it -- otherwise, of course, I'll be trying to catch up with the revelations myself.
:) Thanks

             There was a good bit of discussion on internet that the
Clinton's had urged Trump to run.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eventually, Hillary looked very sick and like it was being hidden
from public, whether natural or under some attack ... who knows?
            </p>
            <p>
             No one says that ruling forces might not be in disagreement.
            </p>
            <p>
             But obviously a lot of $$ and power behind Trump -- though think they
really wanted Pence.  And that may happen, yet.

             OK, so my opinion about why Trump was chosen, is because Trump was a self-made man.  Granted, he was at one point in time the darling of the media.  And granted, at pretty much the same time he was getting sizable tax breaks in order to develop Manhattan.  But here is where I think Trump's training may have started - any time he tried to expand after that, he always ran into obstructionism.  So as a result on missing out on big deals over the years, perhaps Trump was able to get an insider's view on the shenanigans that the bad guys were pulling to lock people out of the system.  I think eventually he must have deduced that pedophiles control the media, that fixers control the banks and that narcos control pretty much everything else.  He knows where the bodies are buried.
That's just my opinion.

              Trump was an fbi informant in the 80s when trump casino was rising. He went to the fbi and offered his casino to be used for intel gathering on the mob as they were extorting everyone by, for instance, not picking up their trash until they were paid off. As the mob ran the unions, kissing their ass was necessary or they would randomly strike on "worker conditions" or something and kill projected value and thusly financing that hadn't been secured.  His donating to both sides of the aisle was not a "cost of doing business" it was intel gathering. By doing this for the bureau he became super vetted and via his uncle he was able to generate the contacts within MI as many of his projects based on tesla had military application though his uncle only used the powers for good. I have family deep in the bureau (JTTF mainly) but I have to get them drunk and ask yes or no questions (and mix in utter nonsense to shake things up) and watch their reactions cause they dont leak for shit.

              Trump was chosen because of his appeal for the dark side ... KKK, "White Supremacists" and fascists
Basic authoritarians who don't like freedom of speech/free press, democracy, or right to free thought and personal conscience.  Christianity as it exists within the RCC dictatorship.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump was not a "self-made man" as he has only failed at all of his business deals,
many of which have resulted in many bankruptcies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't know how Trump ever got a TV show but for whatever reasons it was dedicated
to be part of the propaganda to get the public used to "being judged" by people who 
yell and scream at them.  And that's about whether or not you're willing to kiss his ass
or someone's like him and whether about baking a cake, singing a song, or writing a 
script with sufficient vileness to please producers today.
             </p>
             <p>
              Anyone who can't see that Trump is just another criminal is -- or who sees him as a 
hero of the common folk -- just isn't paying attention.
             </p>
             <p>
              More likely that Trump was chosen because he is so malleable, so cowardly,
so willing to fill his own pockets, so narcissistic and uncaring of others in our society.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sessions, as right wing/authoritarian as he is, seems to be the one who isn't happy
with MKULTRA and pedophiles being used to undermine society.

               Even if Trump is just another mafia affiliated businessman I would much rather have him than your gang's transgender agenda pushing depravity into the minds of our children.
              </p>
              <p>
               We don't want you sickos in our elementary schools teaching our children how to use dildos and how to have anal sex.
              </p>
              <p>
               We want you scum to keep your depravity in your own houses. You can't do that though because you are parasites and if you don't prey on our children you would die off. Your kind needs a  host and we are sick and tired of being your targets.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you kept your depravity to yourself and just preyed on each other we wouldn't bother you. We would be glad to let you do it and watch you die out.

                 I'm not religious and I don't read the bible. I have not set foot in a church since I was a little kid. You don't have to tell me there is no difference between the left and the right because I know it all too well.

                <p>
                 With that being said its funny how you constantly beat up on one side of this equation. All your Marxists buddies hide in the Democratic hard left side of the political spectrum with their fake charities and children's education groups. They are scum.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So when you beat up on "the right" you are attempting to drive people to the left and into the arms of your Marxist web of nightmares transgender child fucking nightmare. You don't fool me.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If it was up to me I would sweep both the left and the right wing politicians into the toilet and start all over. I would start first with your marxist communist friends though.

                   For somebody who criticizes people about speaking in labels you sure do spend all your time speaking in labels. I would argue that the left invaded the right and not the other way around.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   If I had to pick between your Marxist Communism and a pure form of Christianity for humanity to live by I sure wouldn't pick your Marxist Doctrine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I don't read the bible and I don't preach any religion but a pure christian doctrine is sure preferable to your third wave feminist transgender agenda.

                  <p>
                   A real true Christian wouldn't advocate teaching children how to do anal sex correctly in the third grade but your Marxists buddies are all too happy to do just that.

                  <p>
                   I would sweep the Roman Catholic Vatican into the toilet with the Marxists too because that is not Christianity.

                    Don't know if you noticed but the Berlin Wall fell long ago and so did communism.

                   <p>
                    And, btw, Communism was created by Capitalists .... thesis -- vs anti-thesis.

                   <p>
                    In other words, when people don't have wars between ideas -- violent wars --
they have the time to think about what is really serving their needs and realize
that capitalism certainly wasn't ... NOT that they would adopt communism...
but that they would create socially responsible governments -- like Denmarks, for instance.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    That's what the American public wants.  They've seen thru capitalism ....
and Capitalism is suicidal by all evidence of it destroy all Nature, polluting everything.

                    "Christian doctrine" ... you mean like Columbus who thought his main purpose here
was to spread Christianity?  So he did it by running an "Inquisition" against the 
native people here ... and just coincidentally while stealing their land?  That was Christian doctrine?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Or maybe you mean the "Christians" who held Africans here in Slavery?
Those "Christians" ...?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Or maybe you mean the "Christians" in our government who are forcing
poverty and austerity on Americans everywhere ... and letting American
children go hungry and homeless over the last 30-40 years now?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And, you're obsessed with one thing ... anal sex ... any chance you have
a sexual addiction?
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    No one is advocating sexual abuse of children -- it is Elites who profit from 
sex trafficking who are responsible for it.  And our military is also involved.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Any true Christians at the time of Jesus' teachings spread throughout the Arab 
states .... that where the Vatican created Islam ... they're on and the same...

                   <p>
                    And then they killed all the true Christians.

Your buddies with their bait and switch Communism ruined capitalism too. Capitalism means everybody having the ability to work for themselves, own a small business if they want to, and flourish. You communists ruined that too with your consolidation. Your people hoard up trillions and treat people like dogs.

                     You're smart enough to know that this is not as I alluded to "a pure christian" doctrine. Those are cryptos larping as Christians. Those are your Luciferians larping as christians and all the while they blame it on christianity in an effort to destroy it.

Invented by "Christianity"/RCC ...
The reason we no longer have a Middle Class is because when the Berlin Wall,
the US no longer needed a Middle Class to compete with the Russians ...
That's the admitted reality.

                       Irish and French Catholics have argued that Columbus, who “brought the Christian faith to half the world,” should be named a saint. Though the move had the approval of Pope Pius IX (reign 1846–1878), Columbus was never canonized because he fathered an illegitimate child, and there was no proof he had performed a miracle.

War wasn't fought by the rich ... they paid people to fight their war for them.... people

                           You would be better off peddling your wares to softer targets. You will only get the facts dished out to you operating in this environment. You probably like to feel victimized by it though. I'm bored with you. Not a challenge.

                       Godwind's Law again. The Khazar Mongol is pretending to be a jew. You're not even a jew. Your ilk probably originated somewhere near the steppes of China and got chased toward the Black and Caspian sea because you wouldn't stop lying, stealing, and fucking other people's children.

                       Was a Marrano crypto "jew" Khazar. Three of the Queen's "jew" money baggers paid for his trip too. Funny how he showed so much concern for Isreal in his will...innit? They chased his sorry ass out of Spain.

                       Nice how you gloss over the fact that the slave ships and main plantation holders were "jews" Khazars. White people virtually had nothing to do with slavery. Only about two percent of the population owned slaves and most of them were crypto "jews" Same scum that started the Civil War and every other war in history.

                     I never said be violent. There is no debating with you. Tried that. You're crazy and you always lead back to man bashing. You bash God and if you do talk about religion, you constantly use Catholicism as your example. You are an extreme feminist and you're totally fine with partial birth abortion. I will never agree with you so there's no point in having a debate. Our debates would go on for days. No thanks 🙄

                      YES ... Christianity is based in the Catholic Church ... 
though it is often called Judeo-Christianity because the Vatican is nowhere unless
it acknowledges the Old Testament/Hebrew on which Christianity relies.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Why is it you fear about feminism ... are women coming to get you or something?

                     <p>
                      Oh, yeah ... you want to demand that no one have an abortion...
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Good work, sray ... force women to have babies.  There's an idea.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      That's also what the Pope wanted the last time he visited the Italian parliament because
the Italian birth rate is way down .... Popey wanted the Italian government to FORCE 
women to have babies.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      And why ... because the Pope so loves babies ... 
No -- because capitalism needs labor.

                       Yawn. There is no need to debate. Go back and read the pages I've written you before about this very same thing. You are weird and it won't get thru to you. You are an athiest, gay loving, man hating radical left wing feminist who's ok with killing babies all the way up until birth. You are probably a tree hugger.

                       If I were in a room and I heard Trump talk about grabbing pussy, and on the other side I heard you describe your weird beliefs, and I had to decide who upsets me the most, it would be you. What Trump said was like 10 years ago, so get over yourself. If that's all they have to make Trump look bad, then he's a saint compared to the rest of them perverted politicians.

                         I told you how my mom did my dad and my siblings, how she chose drugs over her family and how it was my dad who raised me. I told you how wonderful he was. Most of the good people in my life are men. Great moral family men. You said that was good but most aren't like that blah blah blah.

                         Trump's brother died of alcoholism. If anything, he overcame and decided he didn't want to be like that. He never touched a cigarette or alcohol. He could afford the finest wine, but obviously he held onto something deep in his heart that made him determined to be different and not make the same mistakes that other people in his life did. He also talks compassionately about his brother who died of alcoholism. He didn't not talk to him, give up on him or judge him. He loved him.

                        <p>
                         Acting like he's some sexist racist pig shows me that you watch mainstream news and listen to their one sided deceptive stories about Trump. They will take clips of video out of context and make it look like what he said was awful. It's all in the editing. So he said to his friend how he could grab women by their pussy. First of all, that was years ago. I'm sure he could since sluts always flock to celebrities. That doesn't mean he did do it and even if he was living it up with the ladies, how does that affect how he would run a country? They have dug and dug into his life and that's all they could come up with? Telling his friend how women are all over him and he could grab them by the pussy. - OMG he'll forever be a disgusting pig and because of that could never become a successful president!

                         EVERYBODY has said things that others would find offensive. If I were interviewing you for something, came upon Voat and read how much you hate men, I would think you were crazy.

                         One doesn't have to like Trump to realize how unique he is. In a good way. He could have lived the rest of his life in luxury. He could golf, vacation, and sleep around to his hearts desire. But instead, he has spent years being slung thru the mud by those on the left, his reputation smeared, betrayed by the ones he thought he could trust, have much of the country hating him because their brainwashed by the media, works himself to death rarely taking days off, and his life is at risk daily. He has no privacy and has to be followed everywhere. He obviously cares about his country. There is no way in hell that I would choose to live like that. I've never seen anyone be as strong, determined and dedicated as Trump.

                         To answer your question, Trump doesn't upset me. I don't agree with everything he's doing. But, he's smart and he sees behind the scenes. We don't.

                         I associate with normal human beings that don't hate men except gay ones like you. Ones that aren't on the radical brainwashed left and are not ok with abortion being performed on a baby all the way up to 9 months gestation. I think most people has looked at someone and thought they were sexy and said to a friend that they thought that person had a nice ass or something like that.

                          People do NOT chose misery and they certainly don't chose DRUGS as a way to be miserable. It's a health problem and should be treated as such.  And if they did provide that care, more people would be able to function and recover.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          It's an addiction some suffer.  And we have an overwhelming number of people now addicted to opioids because drug companies wanted to make a profit and lied about opioids not being addictive.  They lied to doctors and patients as well about them.  Have you ever heard of Percocet and how many addicted to that drug?  How many of these drugs/vaccines are destroying peoples lives with severe side effects, or simply killing them?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          You Mother, unfortunately, was addicted to drugs.  She didn't "choose" anything.

                          And, wake up to the reality, that your life story has little to do with anyone else's life story -- or reality.

                          I'm sorry that this happened to you, but most human beings do have serious problems in their lives.  What about all of the handicapped people that Trump is trying to deprive of health care while also reducing their benefits?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          If Trump had an alcoholic brother it certainly didn't make him more compassionate or empathetic to anyone else's problems.  So what's the meaning of the story?

                          It's typical of the right wing to delude themselves by projecting their own thoughts and fears and actions onto others ...
It is the Donald, himself, who has exposed himself as being sexist and racist.
Don't you read at all?

                           I'm not going to debate with you about Trump. I know addiction. I struggled with it for years. Addiction runs thru my family. Opioids is just one of the things I was addicted to. I CHOSE to go to outpatient treatment. My life was falling apart. I hit rock bottom.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           I didn't want to
                           <strong>
                            become my mom
                           </strong>
                           . I quit everything cold turkey. It's the hardest thing I've done in my life. I've been sober now for almost 4 years. I can't even have a glass of wine. I CHOOSE not to let myself go there again. I MADE A CHOICE. As hard as it is. You do have a choice. So you have no room to talk and tell me that all this. It is a sickness. But it's a sickness that you can fight. You have a choice on rather or not you are going to ruin your family.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           I'm fine and loved my mom and didn't treat her bad because of it. I used my story to say that EVERYONE has a story. I think something must have happened to you before that makes you not trust men. If that's true I'm sorry. But we can't take our experiences and apply that to everyone. Everyone is different. Here on voat we see all this perversion everyday. It makes it hard for me to trust anyone anymore. Male or female. But I know I can't judge a whole gender over what some may do.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           I'm not going to continue this discussion. Every time we have a conversation, I don't know why we continue because we are complete opposites and there is no way we're going to change each other. I only had to reply to this because your reply about choice is wrong. You always need something to argue about. I am moving on now.

                            Gave you an upvote for your courage and efforts against addiction.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Many of us gave up cigarettes cold turkey and succeeded ... but we are not
so close minded to NOT understand that many were more seriously addicted
to nicotine than we were and that it is almost impossible for them to give them up.
Intelligent people are still smoking because their addictions are so severe.
It's the same with drugs.... not everyone has the same strengths...not everyone
has the same weaknesses.   Obviously, you are stronger than your Mother was
and you have to appreciate that.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            When you shut out information, you will only be able to believe that someone invented 
things they are telling you.
But the history of the Vatican and its war on women is historical in "The Hammer of Witches" ...
in the fact that it underpins Elites and issued "Manifest Destiny" and "Man's Dominion Over Nature"
which are the licenses to Elites to exploit Nature, our Natural Resources, Animal-Life ... and even
other human beings according to myths of "inferiority" -- human beings such as Jews, homosexuals,
women, Gypsies.
Also pay attention to the reality that the Catholic Church has apologized for these persecutions ...
so you have their apology as evidence that these things actually happened.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Our Founders created an Elite Patriarchy ... that's why you still do not have full Constitutional
rights as a female.  Neither does the Vatican acknowledge the full personhood of females as
it acknowledges the full personhood of males -- and bars females from ritual and authority in
the church.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Nor can you deny that it is MALES who are our sexual abusers of children.
You don't trust "Family Research Council" -- a right wing women's group which confirms it for you?
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            When the basis of the information that you live by is lies, then you will be confused.
Truth has a long arc ... but you will finally find truth.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Move on -- and good luck.  Sincerely!

               <p>
                but so is everyone else in both parties and in government -- it's all be corrupted.
               </p>
               <p>
                And our elections are totally corrupted.
               </p>
               <p>
                Koch Bros./John Birch Society and other large corporations own both political
parties --
               </p>
               <p>
                Koch Bros. recruited Bill Clinton founded by Southerners/right wing who moved
the DLC (Democratic Leadership Council in to the Dem Party to corporatize it ...
which they did).... and to end any interest in social programs and/or programs to
benefit the public.
                <br/>
                The party is now dedicated to Elites patriarchy as much as the GOP is.
               </p>
               <p>
                Again, both parties are owned and corrupted by Elites/wealthy -- and have 
been for at least 30 plus years...
               </p>
               <p>
                There have been no liberals in government since the coup on JFK and our "people's" 
government ....
               </p>
               <p>
                Everyone who has been "elected" is right wing -- and that is by design.

                See:  Operation Mockingbird -- and its two companion operations ... Paperclip and Gladio.
Paperclip involved bringing 200,000 ex-Nazis into the US to found the CIA, funneled into
the FBI and other government agencies, and to "hot spots" around the world ... all to ensure
the rise of the Fourth Reich.
Also see Operation Gladio which was created to ensure that only right wing governments 
would be elected and hold government control in nations over which the US had influence
and control at the end of WWII .... Germany, Japan, France, Italy.  In Italy, US actually
resurrected the Mafia there in order to ensure the program would be carried out effectively.

                US citizens have been voting on hack-able voting computers for more than 50 years ....
Germany and Ireland have junked them as "Un-Constitutional."

             Thanks :) just trying to help folks hone in on the importance of what you posted! It is exhausting to go through and most confusing for those who don't get how 4chan and pol work, like myself.

            I believe the one org. not corrupt is the MI.  I remember the day of the Inauguration or the day before, Obama replaced all members of the MI Secret Service.  They guard the President.  I don't know what Trump did about that.  But that was very telling for me.  I really started waking up that day, even more so than before.  There are may answers in here.  Pastebin

               Yes, thank you/just read it myself/was offline today.  Don't know what to make of all of this however.  Another mass shooting today as I read now.  Thought these ff would be on hiatus at least for the time being if everything was legit on the dumps ya know?  Just watching~not like we haven't heard it all before.

             It was the BG in charge of the Washington, D.C. National Guard who resigned/retired/quit the day of (or day before) the election.  I'd have to go back and look to confirm specifics.

            1st question:  What is 'State Secrets' and how upheld in the SC?
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The state secrets privilege is an evidentiary rule created by United States legal precedent. Application of the privilege results in exclusion of evidence from a legal case based solely on affidavits submitted by the government stating that court proceedings might disclose sensitive information which might endanger national security.[1][2][3][4][5][6] United States v. Reynolds,[7] which involved military secrets, was the first case that saw formal recognition of the privilege.
           </p>
           <p>
            Following a claim of "state secrets privilege", the court rarely conducts an in camera examination of the evidence to evaluate whether there is sufficient cause to support the use of this doctrine. This results in court rulings in which even the judge has not verified the veracity of the assertion.[1] The privileged material is completely removed from the litigation, and the court must determine how the unavailability of the privileged information affects the case.[3][5]
