            Not necessarily.

            It was WWII.  It's possible they couldn't have any children and wanted to buy a child to raise or to use for slave labor (to "work around the farm," etc.) , not necessarily for sex or sex trafficking.  There weren't as many laws on the books preventing that stuff back then, so there's no reason the airman -- who was NOT law enforcement anyway -- would have "scared them off."

            Mandy Rei has some great Tweets, but her posts above demonstrate a lack of critical thinking skills.

             I interpreted it as they left because they couldn't pressure a woman alone to surrender her kid to them.
Given it was Canada in the 40's seems more likely they would have pillaged the native population for workers, if that were the case that they needed farm labor.
She mentioned that they offered to babysit him. Or hold him. To touch him. And then offered to buy him.
Yeah, if it were a well-off couple looking for labor on their farm, would they really find adequate help with a toddler? Wouldn't a strapping teenager be more helpful on a farm?
            </p>
            <p>
             Nah, the airman wasn't law enforcement, but that couple could have assumed that was her husband, and scuttled out of there before he found out they just tried buying his son for whatever purpose they had in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
             Guess that still counts as human trafficking, eh?
