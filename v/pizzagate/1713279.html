<p>Brittany and Nicole Pettibone start a fundraiser on <em>GoFundMe</em> to raise money for research and their traditionalist podcast titled <em>Virtue of the West</em>. </p>
<p><strong>January 30th, 2017 (4:24 PM):</strong> Judd Legum, founder of the left-wing website <em>ThinkProgress</em>, tweets that Brittany Pettibone is a white nationalist without any evidence provided. It would be very important to note that <em>ThinkProgress</em> has significant links to <em>Center for American Progress</em> and other left-wing organizations. Judd Legum attacking Pettibone is a powerful attack from a well-known individual, this happens as Pettibone is still relatively unknown in the community. No matter the reason, <em>ThinkProgress</em> and other organizations attack her intensely for unknown reasons. </p>

<p><strong>January 30th, 2017 (4:30 PM) :</strong> GoFundMe suspends fundraiser on apparent grounds of &quot;hate speech&quot; and &quot;white supremacist promotion&quot;. Brittany Pettibone becomes permanently banned for using the services, with GoFundMe citing ToS violations which are never specified. It is widely interpreted as doing with the site rules on hate speech, and Pettibone starts getting linked widely to white nationalism and supremacism. Story goes viral and is covered on multiple news sites, including the Observer, which write <em>de facto</em> attacks against her. </p>

<p><strong>February 7th, 2017:</strong> The podcast series <em>Virtue of the West</em> is created, with Lauren Southern being the first guest. It would be important to note that Pettibone\'s podcast and Youtube channel takes off in popularity at this time. Comments remain rational and reasoned, but this is soon to change. First signs of unexplained unhinged conspiracy theories in the comments begin to emerge, along with some anti-Zionist rhetoric. At this point however these comments appear organic and not the result of shilling, manipulation, or sockpuppet accounts. </p>

<p><strong>February 14th, 2017</strong>: Brittany Pettibone interviews Tommy Robinson of the English Defense League. Comments begin to dramatically shift in tone from research, to conspiracy theories talking about Jews and aliens. Comments about how &quot;Jews are the problem&quot; and how Brittany Pettibone should admit that she is a &quot;follower of the 14 words&quot; begin to popup. Interesting to note that all of these comments seemingly came out of nowhere, and the support came 2 weeks after the articles written about her. </p>

<p><strong>February 21th, 2017</strong>: Brittany Pettibone interviews <em>Black Pigeon Speaks</em> on <em>Virtue of the West</em> #3. Attacks on Christianity begin to emerge in this period. Triple parenthesis are used against Christians as they &quot;worship a Jew&quot;, and self-identifying Christians in the commenting sections and inboxes begin to be attacked. Significant shilling is suggested linking her work to white nationalism and anti-Christian belief by default, likely to repel a large section of her followers and poison her work from mainstream acceptance. Commentators also suggest that she &quot;needs to stop making YouTube videos as only men can be talking about these topics&quot; and how she needs to &quot;go back into the kitchen and make a sandwich.&quot; Checking the accounts show that the vast majority of the commentators have no subscribers or any significant sort of interaction outside the video, which suggests a massive amount of alternative accounts. </p>

</ul>
<p><strong>February 23th, 2017:</strong> Pettibone appears on an episode of <em>InfoWars</em> denying the allegations that she is a white nationalist or a white supremacist, and appears shocked at her support from apparent white nationalists and the accusations that she herself is a white nationalist. This also goes further into the <em>GoFundMe</em> case which happened a month before. <strong>On a side note, this is a critical interview about the situation as a whole to watch and I recommend you watch it. (Assuming you haven\'t already)</strong> On a side note, it is very interesting to note that there is no signs of a disinformation campaign in the video\'s comment section. This is perhaps the clearest example of manufactured white nationalist support for Pettibone, and shows how only certain videos appear to be targeted, notably on her main channel. </p>

<p><strong>February 28th, 2017:</strong> Brittany Pettibone interviews a black conservative Youtuber named Josephine. Comments from inactive accounts accuse Pettibone of allowing &quot;dindus&quot; on the show and express support for slavery. Concern trolling begins to ramp up dramatically, with commentators alleging that cohost Tara McCarthy is &quot;2% Jewish&quot; and whether Pettibone is &quot;0.01% due to not having expected pure Aryan features&quot;. Other interesting comments include inactive accounts saying that &quot;blacks might as well vote Democrats&quot; and that &quot;only white people can be conservatives&quot;, which is a shill technique to discourage support for Pettibone\'s activities from minorities. Looking at the commentators, it is clear that these are strawman arguments that are condemned by white nationalist leaders. (Support for slavery, etc.) </p>

</ul>
<p><strong>March 2nd, 2017 :</strong> In a possible major miscalculation for Brittany Pettibone, she interviews Lana Lokteff of <em>Red Ice Radio</em> during an active shilling campaign against her. Lana Lokteff is a known white nationalist and is the perfect person for the media to link her to white supremacism and white nationalism, and it appears to have encouraged a mix of actual white nationalist support and more shills into her channel. A very important find from reading the comments is a user named  <strong>Asteria accuses Brittany Pettibone of being a subject of MKULTRA mind control and uses the exact same reasoning as the trolling campaign on Voat.</strong> This won\'t be shown until the post on March 10th, 2017. Clear shills start to come out at this time, and conspiracy theories that have recently been shilled on Voat and Gab are being shilled intensely in the comments. Brittany Pettibone and Tara McCarthy are accused of being &quot;crypto-Jews who should be sent back to Israel&quot; and there are accusations of her being a &quot;plant&quot;. (Sound familiar?)</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>March 7th, 2017:</strong> Pettibone interviews conservative Gabber Claire Jordan. Shilling continues with comments such as &quot;a key virtue of the West is female submission&quot; and other obvious key indicators of a shill campaign. A key indicator that these people are not organic in the least is the fact that a Hispanic Trump supporter named <em>Leticia Paul</em> is surrounded by apparent &quot;white supremacists&quot;, but never gets even a single response. Somehow and for some reason, white supremacists and Hispanic Trump supporters are existing side by side. The &quot;white supremacists&quot; do not even act with the real and organic Trump supporters, and it is obvious once you start reading the comments. </p>

<p><strong>March 10th, 2017:</strong> A <em>Voat</em> thread by an unknown user titled <em>Something Wrong About Brittany Pettibone...</em> suggests that Brittany Pettibone is a false narrative and shill to misguide the community. Upon closer digging of the content, I found similar themes posted by an account named <em>Asteria</em>. Asteria she accuses Brittany Pettibone of being a &quot;sex kitten&quot; and references MKULTRA. This comment is exactly similar to similar behaviors recently observed on Voat within the past day. </p>

<p>Due to the 10,000 character limit I am forced to conclude this thread. But there is much more evidence that this isn\'t organic and is traced back to the Tweet from Judd Legum on January 30th, 2017 when the shill operation became intense and noticeable. </p>
<p>It appears someone is really ticked off at Ms. Pettibone. The question is then, who is that person?</p>',

Significant shilling is suggested linking her work to white nationalism and anti-Christian belief by default, likely to repel a large section of her followers and poison her work from mainstream acceptance. Commentators also suggest that she "needs to stop making YouTube videos as only men can be talking about these topics" and how she needs to "go back into the kitchen and make a sandwich." Checking the accounts show that the vast majority of the commentators have no subscribers or any significant sort of interaction outside the video, which suggests a massive amount of alternative accounts.

           Pettibone appears on an episode of
           <em>
            InfoWars
           </em>
           denying the allegations that she is a white nationalist or a white supremacist, and appears shocked at her support from apparent white nationalists and the accusations that she herself is a white nationalist. This also goes further into the
           <em>
            GoFundMe
           </em>
           case which happened a month before.
           <strong>
            On a side note, this is a critical interview about the situation as a whole to watch and I recommend you watch it. (Assuming you haven't already)
           </strong>
           On a side note, it is very interesting to note that there is no signs of a disinformation campaign in the video's comment section. This is perhaps the clearest example of manufactured white nationalist support for Pettibone, and shows how only certain videos appear to be targeted, notably on her main channel.

           Brittany Pettibone interviews a black conservative Youtuber named Josephine. Comments from inactive accounts accuse Pettibone of allowing "dindus" on the show and express support for slavery. Concern trolling begins to ramp up dramatically, with commentators alleging that cohost Tara McCarthy is "2% Jewish" and whether Pettibone is "0.01% due to not having expected pure Aryan features". Other interesting comments include inactive accounts saying that "blacks might as well vote Democrats" and that "only white people can be conservatives", which is a shill technique to discourage support for Pettibone's activities from minorities. Looking at the commentators, it is clear that these are strawman arguments that are condemned by white nationalist leaders. (Support for slavery, etc.)

           In a possible major miscalculation for Brittany Pettibone, she interviews Lana Lokteff of
           <em>
            Red Ice Radio
           </em>
           during an active shilling campaign against her. Lana Lokteff is a known white nationalist and is the perfect person for the media to link her to white supremacism and white nationalism, and it appears to have encouraged a mix of actual white nationalist support and more shills into her channel. A very important find from reading the comments is a user named
           <strong>
            Asteria accuses Brittany Pettibone of being a subject of MKULTRA mind control and uses the exact same reasoning as the trolling campaign on Voat.
           </strong>
           This won't be shown until the post on March 10th, 2017. Clear shills start to come out at this time, and conspiracy theories that have recently been shilled on Voat and Gab are being shilled intensely in the comments. Brittany Pettibone and Tara McCarthy are accused of being "crypto-Jews who should be sent back to Israel" and there are accusations of her being a "plant". (Sound familiar?)

           Pettibone interviews conservative Gabber Claire Jordan. Shilling continues with comments such as "a key virtue of the West is female submission" and other obvious key indicators of a shill campaign. A key indicator that these people are not organic in the least is the fact that a Hispanic Trump supporter named
           <em>
            Leticia Paul
           </em>
           is surrounded by apparent "white supremacists", but never gets even a single response. Somehow and for some reason, white supremacists and Hispanic Trump supporters are existing side by side. The "white supremacists" do not even act with the real and organic Trump supporters, and it is obvious once you start reading the comments.

           suggests that Brittany Pettibone is a false narrative and shill to misguide the community. Upon closer digging of the content, I found similar themes posted by an account named
           <em>
            Asteria
           </em>
           . Asteria she accuses Brittany Pettibone of being a "sex kitten" and references MKULTRA. This comment is exactly similar to similar behaviors recently observed on Voat within the past day.

           Due to the 10,000 character limit I am forced to conclude this thread. But there is much more evidence that this isn't organic and is traced back to the Tweet from Judd Legum on January 30th, 2017 when the shill operation became intense and noticeable.

           It appears someone is really ticked off at Ms. Pettibone. The question is then, who is that person?

            This poor girl had her entire family lined up in front of her and shot execution style by her uncle just days before her nationally televised news conference and five days before the televised funeral.  The gunman meant to kill her, but she survived.  She lost part of a finger when, with her hands tied behind her back, she blocked the shooter's bullet to the back of her head and played dead.  Please donate on Go Fund Me to help this poor girl out.  It might be of some consolation, that on her social media, apparently her finger has since grew back.

            The title of this post is misleading.  It isn't about a general misinformation campaign, it is specifically in defense of Ms. Pettibone.  Her work was never my cup of tea, but now I am suspicious because one of her supporters is willing to mislead.

            I am editing this comment because it is stupid:

             There is no proof whatsoever that Ms. Pettibone endorsed this and I apologize for my comment.

            I figured out within the first few weeks the Pettibone twins were all about promoting their book. They put on a good show for a few weeks, then all you heard about was the book. It was interjected into the conversations often.

             Yep, he's a 'divide &amp; conquer' utility and unfortunately the strategy's worked quite well.  He has created a rift between pizzagate investigators/supporters and there is now both vociferous disdain for him and blind faith in support of his convictions.

              No he hasn't. No one has . That is their goal to desband us so we can go back to argue what football team has the best quarter back We dont give a fuck about no shill. We dont look at the shills we see past them and right trough them.  With that said I have to pay to play soccer at my local League while pros and semI pros get paid.  That dosent take the joy I feel from the sport nor do I ponder why some get paid.  Now that I think about it I'm perty sure they get paid cuzz they are better players, better business people or both.  Either way the collective consciousness has awoken and evil will be exposed.

              I don't think it's working that well actually.  His following mainly consists of non-researchers and people who aren't inclined to be active at a political level anyway.  Content consumers, the kind of people who just love the drama..it's all just entertainment for them really.  The old conquer and divide games aren't working anymore and the pedos haven't got the creativity to change their tactics.

            Maybe disputing my points would be more effective than speculating about my genitals.
            <br/>
            Do you realize that if I were ashamed of my genitals, which are assigned a size randomly through genetics and no fault of mine, it would be only because of a cultural meme perpetuated by women whereby genital size influences sexual prowess and can thus be used as an insult so painful that some men may commit suicide?

            I'm honestly a bit taken aback at this attack method where they use bullshit accounts in comment sections to create false images of support. It's so sloppy. Either whoever's behind this is desperate, can't afford a better campaign, or wants it to be weird and chaotic on purpose, like for psychological effect.
           </p>

            I will probably start paying attention to Pettibone now that I know all this, so that's a shill fail.

            This disinfo formula has been so over-used and abused, it's easy to identify now.  Call target racist, make a zillion shill posts about the Jews and flat earth, then freeze crowdfunding accounts.  Fortunately enough people are wise to it now that it tends to backfire.

             It may be easy to spot but it is not easy to fight.  This board gets completely overun with too Many shills, bots and actual trolls.  Some days it isn't worth the fight.

             The fact that they clearly have financial support shows that those of us doing this for free are at a clear disadvantage. Yet when anyone says, I need help to continue and grow....sshhhhrrrreeeeeek.

            Lmao talk about missing the forest for the trees.  Do you know why Ann coulter and Phyllis schafly are famous? Because they are exceptions and most women don't know shit about anything because it's not in their nature to acquire information and craft a policy.
Is pettibone herself a shill? Who gives a shit? Will her gay little youtube interviews affect anything ever? Fuck no.  And how dare you slander red ice radio

            Thank you for taking the time to make a post about this. We were hoping someone would. It is important, here on Voat where free speech is fundamental, that people meet shill speech and disinformation campaigns with BETTER, more persuasive, accurate and powerful speech. The way to neutralize these shill campaigns is not to delete them -- they can just make another post, or post elsewhere -- but to debunk them.  We need much, much more of this. We need to point out the holes in their arguments, their shitty tactics like innuendo and fallacy. It helps everyone become better information consumers, critical thinkers, and more resistant to shilling.

             The suspicious part is that they seem very well funded. They managed to spend dozens of hours creating narratives around it, and appear to be running an expensive and massive botting campaign to discredit her. The recent shilling on Voat appears linked with Asteria. Compare her comments to the one posted on Voat yesterday, they are exactly identical.

             Whoever is doing it has to have a vast network of resources and time, which isn't something most people have.
