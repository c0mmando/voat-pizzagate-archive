            hunt1954, do you know any redneck who are thespians, enjoy writing screen plays, have an eyebrow piercing and have a father that's a film producer?
Yeah, I didn't think so. ;-)

            Here's another possible explanation:   The guy had some vehicle injuring case and may have believed his life was screwed.  He either came up on evidence or felt what he'd seen thus far meant kids were in danger.  Perhaps he went in with the intent to be peacefully arrested.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notice the street was shut down and police must have inspected Comet and nearby places.  Maybe he was crazy enough to believe they left evidence anywhere out in the open police could find it?    That's a crazy possibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or he's mentally disturbed and went off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or it's a false flag.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those are all possibles.
           </p>
           <p>
            Obviously nobody believes showing up with a gun/shotgun and causing a big scene is 'investigating' anything and is anything other than a quick ticket to jail.

            Dude that thing is false flag as fuck. If someone was BALLSY and crazy enough to actually go in there do you not think he would have done something, like actually search the damn place instead of walk in to one room, fire a gun randomly (some say did, some say didn't), then walk outside and turn himself in peacefully? This wasn't a real person.

             To be a false flag the guy would be working for someone and he will be prosecuted.  So this guy is willing to go to jail for this?  It is just what I said and the effort will look much more credible if we just admit that someone went off the rails.

             I they let him off ... then I'll concede that I'm wrong.
