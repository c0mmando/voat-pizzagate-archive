<p>ATOKA, Tenn. – A Tipton County pastor was booked into jail Tuesday afternoon, one day after a grand jury indicted him on 47 charges related to sexually abusing minors.</p>
<p>Ronnie Gorton, the former pastor of Awakening Church in Atoka, has been accused by three people.
One of Gorton’s alleged victims was under the age of 13, according to the Sheriff’s Office.
Walking into jail Tuesday, 39-year-old Gorton kept his head down and wouldn’t answer reporters’ questions.
Gorton’s former Drummonds neighbors said he was known for keeping to himself, but they also couldn’t help but notice all of the young people who frequented the home he shared with his wife.</p>
<p>“We knew he had a church and, you know, he had boys over there a lot,” said neighbor Donnie Overbeck.
Sonja Young also remembers seeing boys at Gorton’s house going back several years and ending earlier this year.
“They were different boys. I mean, they would have a couple of them for a few months,” Young said.
“When they’re cutting the grass, three or four at any given time,” said Overbeck.
But Overbeck said it never struck him as anything sinister.
“Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. 
Gorton faces one count of rape and 16 counts of statutory rape.
Based on other charges he’s facing, it would appear he showed some of his victims pornography and bought alcohol for at least one.
The allegations against Gorton first became public after deputies showed up to his home January 31 while responding to a report of a suicidal man.
Gorton  was taken in for questioning and a psychiatric evaluation.
During their investigation, they learned that Atoka police were investigating Gorton after an underage boy accused Gorton of raping him. That incident allegedly took place at Gorton\'s home just weeks earlier.
Daugherty said two more victims came forward after WREG’s initial story aired, bringing the total to three, but he said that might not be the final number.
“There could be more, potentially, victims and certainly if there are any victims that remain, we encourage them to come forward,” Daugherty said.
Gorton faces the following 47 charges:
- 1 count rape
- 5 counts aggravated sexual battery (victim under 13 years old)
- 17 counts sexual battery by an authority figure
- 2 counts of continuous sexual abuse of a child
- 16 counts of statutory rape by an authority figure
- 2 counts offense of soliciting sexual exploitation of a minor
- 2 counts contributing to delinquency
- 2 counts enticing a child to purchase alcoholic beverages
Gorton was arrested Tuesday at a home in Union City. The Sheriff\'s Office said he was cooperative.</p>

            Having troubles posting links Mr. Dryer? So am I. Why here? Works almost everywhere else. Lot's of unanswered questions on this one though. Legally not charged. I did like the story of the guy breaking into a deputies car for hours. Priceless photo.

              What in the heck is a T link? Is a fog dryer some kind of hair device? Have you ever researched Yog Soggoth online? I will take these questions one at a time, if you don't have the time. I know the guy that makes time. He is pretty busy.

              But they can on others. Then Vindicater said we shouldn't look at those pedophile signs that the FBI put out so much anymore. Since I made comment about the Cricket heart within a heart T-shirts, the employees are wearing different shirts within a month. They actually look like old shirts by wear and tear, like they did not have time to make new ones. They were acting kind of nervous today when I asked about the old shirts from last month. You see one in your town, take a picture. I would have, but I did not know how with new phone.

            What if the pastor pissed off some kids and they are lying to the police? Not saying this happened, but if I hated the church and was a vengeful snowflake then false witness used as a weapon is a possibility.
