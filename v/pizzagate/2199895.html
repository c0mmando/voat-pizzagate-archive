<p>Today\'s announcement by MGM Resorts distancing itself from MGM Studios highlights MGM Resorts\' growing international brand.</p>
<p>The casino resort operator not only attracts international gamblers to its Las Vegas and Macau resorts, but has a branding division called <strong>MGM Hospitality</strong> that brings MGM Resorts\' management expertise and brands to hotels around the world with partnerships that are both gaming and nongaming.</p>
