<p>List of things I noticed that validate code words for child exploitation:</p>
<p>1) At 00:16, triangle for the dot in the &quot;I&quot; in KIDS. Could be nothing. Not a full pedo triangle.</p>
<p>2) At around 1:15, the child is in a crib surrounded by &quot;monsters&quot; and the child\'s fear seems to be genuine. That alone right there is child abuse, but that isn\'t what I\'m focusing on. I\'m focusing on the reaffirmation that these people use symbols consciously. Worth mentioning is that it is unclear if this crib is in a house or at an establishment that looks like a hotel. It is weirdly anonymous.</p>
<p>3) 2:09 Creepy old man in the background smiling at the mother and kid. Could be nothing.</p>
<p>4) Now is when it gets weirder. 2:15 hooded figures. Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>5) 3:34 Cop as a monster giving the kid back to the mother, who at the beginning of the video seemed to be leaving the kid with monsters as exploitation knowingly/carelessly.</p>
<p>6) 3:50 kid\'s car seat is the butterfly logo. This is when the symbols really start piling up fast. Especially when the cartoon stuff goes down.</p>
<p>7) 4:18 Monster/animal in a cloak. Huh. Alright, then.</p>
<p>8) 4:52 Cartoons start. Kid\'s car seat as obvious butterfly pedo symbol.</p>
<p>9) 5:00 not sure what\'s going on here but the &quot;Mother Moon&quot; thing in the occult maybe. I don\'t know if this is anything but worth mentioning.</p>
<p>10) 5:10 Kid\'s body dissolves and then his head explodes into... hotdogs. More food symbols to come...</p>
<p>11) 5:32 White rabbit morphs into a witch\'s head. </p>
<p>12) 5:36 Witch then flies into a spiral shape. </p>
<p>13) 5:47 do you see the pizza? I know there are other foods being flashed like ham and burgers... but man...</p>
<p>14) 5:52 Hooded figure chasing a kid. For some reason this part bothered me a lot.</p>
<p>15) 6:06 video ends after a kid falls down a hole. Not sure if the 6:06 timing is significant but the falling into a hole thing I think is.</p>
<p>Thoughts on this:</p>
<p>First off I want to mention I think that aside from the fact that Cheese Pizza is used to refer to child porn because the initials are the same and it provides cover for people searching for it online, I think there may be some correlation with the burnt faces looking like melted cheese. Both in real life and in this video the burnt, melted looking faces reminded me of cheese pizza, and I imagine these child exploitation networks are no strangers to dissolving/burning bodies. Just felt like this was worth adding to the discussion.</p>
<p>Finally, I don\'t know if this video has been discussed here at all, but I went back and watched it and couldn\'t believe how many symbols there were. I never would\'ve noticed if I wasn\'t primed for it. I would\'ve just thought of it as some hipster garbage. There are simply too many symbols for this to be anything other than pedo signaling. I wish I were better capable of the hard research like George Webb and some of you who manage to find financial ties and things like that, but showing how widespread the use of these symbols are, and how consciously it is done, I think is important. No matter how insignificant you think your contribution is, don\'t psych yourself out. You\'re doing good work.</p>',

            Yeah, I thought the same thing about maybe MGMT just being weird/hipster but felt compelled to see what everyone else thinks. Thank you for the lead on Lost Prophets, though. I remember hearing about that and sort of ignoring it at the time as just some random pervert.

Enjoy yourselves, take only what you need from it.
A family of trees (bloodline?) wanted to be haunted (demonic possession?)

             Huh. Yeah never thought of the bloodline thing. The "Enjoy yourselves" thing reminds me of the Satanist/luciferian "do what thou will," mentality.

              Just noticed this was your post.  Very Relative.  I could not watch it, for I saw a little of the JP video going around and it spooked me really bad, even though I had a peek.  Your descriptions are amazing.  If all those things you list are in this movie, it is pretty obvious but it also proves that they think they can just throw these symbols in and no one will notice. These things can not be taken lightly, that is what has gotten us into this mess.  Thank you for bringing this up.

               I think things like these videos serve as a "canary in a coal mine" for the elites. When people start saying "hey, somethings up here..." it tells them there are enough people aware to start destroying evidence. I wouldn't worry about it though, because fear makes people skittish, and skittish people make mistakes.

                I believe they have made plenty of mistakes, for they have been hiding in plain sight because many of us were not clued in.  We just have to find them as some of us have already done.I think that some of them may now be trying to mop things up.  I am just now looking over Ricky McCormick, the pizza places, Wonderland Club and tomorrow Lisa Jackson again.  I am convinced that they have replaced the Wonder Club Operation with something similar.  I don't think they would want to lose all that lost revenue.  I believe there was an obvious  reason they called it Operation Cathedral.

            I always thought that video was strange when it came out.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember this video was on Bevis and Butthead and they also made mention of putting a kid in the crib with the monsters something along the lines of, "Who's parents would let their kid do this video?  It's like alright we are going to put you in this crib and surround you with all these scary monsters but don't worry you're like 2 so you should be able to handle it."
           </p>
           <p>
            Also is it just me or did one of the monsters look like a vag?
