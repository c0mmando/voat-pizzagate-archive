            Is Voat having some sort of fakest post contest?   Is it the solar eclipse?   This might be the silliest drivel, I've seen on Voat.

            This read like a bad spec script that even George Webb would reject.  This like the sort of stuff that would circulate on CompuServe when people didn't understand how email worked.

            I wouldn't take any attention from Pelosi lightly. And your son shouldn't either.

            She's one of the nastiest, most aggressive people on the Hill.

            People like to call the Clintons and the Bushes "crime families" to emphasize their misdeed. But Pelosi is a member of an

            If you can find mainstream media stuff it helps convince those taking blue pills (sounds like you have tried offering red pills and they won't take them). It may be best to respect their (shitty) choice and keep the warnings palatable - if they don't want to know then whole story then fine, continuing to push it may push them away, so just give them the info they need to know.

            Don't say "there are heaps of peodophile grooming videos YouTube won't stop" say "don't let your kids you the internet unsupervised, they may be traumatised by stuff like these videos that YouTube isn't censoring and are marketed towards children using popular characters." And link to:

            Globally, politicians and those in positions of power are known to be into this sick stuff. Britain has a lot out in the open on pedophile politicans for you to find even on Google, but I just gave you a BBC link so here's something more local to me:

            <p>
             Are you so blinded by your anal retentive urge to moderate shit that you don't even
             <strong>
              get
             </strong>
             that we've got some significant news here?!
            </p>
            <p>
             I'll explain:
            </p>
            <p>
             This is sourced.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/HannahRebekah6353">
              @HannahRebekah6353
             </a>
             is providing her news from the
             <strong>
              same source reporters get most of their raw news from
             </strong>
             :
             <em>
              people who've had something happen to them
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             It's just one stage back on the food chain, where her source is a live witness. And a very significant one. And one who I find more credible than the "anonymous sources" MSM types love to use in their hit pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
             And it's about one of the harder Pizzagate players to get info on.
            </p>
            <p>
             And it gives us a unique perspective of Pelosi.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pelosi is one of the most compulsive information management and image management operators in American politics. You see very little of her shit released into the wild, even though she's as nasty at the street level as HRC.
            </p>
            <p>
             What we see from HannahRebekah6353's son's experience is how Pelosi acts in an unguarded way around some people she regards as insignificant ("little people" who have no access to the media and who she doesn't realize might have a clue, however small, about elite pedophilia.)
            </p>
            <p>
             She
             <strong>
              never
             </strong>
             would have talked that way if there were opposition politicians or MSM people around.
            </p>
            <p>
             So now some significant news, and the work of all kinds of people who have done all kinds of research for this thread, will have it deleted because some guy acting like a Wikinazi has noticed that the original post doesn't come from somebody else's "publication?"
            </p>
            <p>
             Just imagine if CNN had published a news article based on something said by one of their infamous "anonymous sources" with a title like: '
             <em>
              Pelosi said Something Scary Around One of the "Deplorables
             </em>
             "'
            </p>
            <p>
             People would have been trumpeting it all over
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             ,
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/conspiracy">
              /v/conspiracy
             </a>
             and
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pedogate">
              /v/pedogate
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             But now you want to bury that information?
            </p>

             So we'll consider HannahRebekah6353 to have published a significant news article in the media publication
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             , for the purposes of keeping voatnazis like you happy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Wowee!
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             is now a publication!
            </p>
            <p>
             Yeah, the post is problematic because she also asks an advice question. Don't know if Voat allows one to do this, but perhaps someone who's a mod on both
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              /v/pizzagate
             </a>
             and
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/askpizzagate">
              /v/askpizzagate
             </a>
             like Millenial_Falcon could move it over there?

              Mods have no power to "move" posts. Only to remove, unfortunately. Also, you will notice I didn't remove it -- I asked for some evidence to be added.

               I think the only vindication we're going to get is HannahRebekah6353's word. But at least we can talk to her via PMs. I believe her more than any of CNN's anonymous sources, LOL

            Also have them LOOK up the stalking stories, there were 3 incidents of stalkers trying to snatch kids. One was a furniture store, one a movie theater at a mall, and third at a gas station. These were posted on FB. Absolutely terrifying!!!!

            Point out that up to 5% of the population are attractived sexually to children.  Then ask them how many they know with this inflection.  Then mention the local priest. Every community has a few. Then mention by name a few high profile pedos. Hastert, Sandusky, Podesta, etc. Don't forget jail, jail, emails, etc. Bill Clinton is a rapist. Then shut up. They will come to you. Then you can throw a little Aleister Crowley their way or your own research.  Red pills are hard to swallow at first, but soon they will begin to hand them out to their friends. Be calm and remember light is the only disinfectant.

            Show them the highlights of Finders, then show them the stats of missing kids in VA against other states. They all seem to poof.  Also, African American girls disappearing high rate in DC.  Melatonin is highly coveted and desired by the elite.  The girls in DC might want to save for Part 2. They might think you have lost your mind for sure. My family thinks so.

             Ditto.  I have gotten some really strange stares.  And remarks.  Some are stranger than mine.  I think they like to make smart remarks cause they think I have lost it.

             Do you have a link to show them the highlights of Finders? Also, do you off hand have the stats of missing kids in VA? I don't understand the part about the Melatonin when you can buy that over the counter. Can you elaborate on that? Too late, I'm pretty sure they already feel that I've lost my mind. This is a tough subject to talk about when your young and invincible. Things like that only happen to other people.

            Thanks for sharing. This is a very hard topic to discuss. The Franklin scandal and the Jeffrey Epstein cases are good eye-openers. The evidence is solid and both Larry e king and Jeffrey Epstein used their power and associations to abuse and cover up the abuse of minors. The conspiracy of silence is a great documentary that will make them ask themselves a lot of questions. At least it should... but that's easy to say.
           </p>

            I don't talk about this stuff with most people because they wouldn't believe me. The denial runs deep. It's a mechanism to protect ourselves... but at what expense? I'm not ok with the expense being the total disregard for humanity.

             Yes, denial runs deep. Most people think I'm completely crazy if I bring up MK Ultra despite the dearth of evidence that it existed at one time (99% chance it still does).

              Actually, there are lots of published sourced on MK Ultra Project 68. It's just that you'll never see references to them in the MSM.
             </p>
             <p>
              For example, an MD whose mother was a victim of Project 68, published a book on her MK Ultra experiences in 1990, and those of others, with extensive documentation: "
              <em>
               Psychiatry and the CIA: Victims of Mind Control
              </em>
              " by Harvey Weinstein, ISBN: 0880483636/978-0880483636
             </p>
             <p>
              LOL, you'll never see that book referenced on CNN or MSNBC.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's out of print, and is kind of pricey on Amazon or the used bookstore sites, but one might get a good deal on eBay. And I was able to read it in the public library.

            One of the only reasons I could remotely believe "this" was happening was because I knew about the kids vaccine program.  It is  genocide and pure evil...   the same dark-grossness as found in the pedo world.
           </p>
           <p>
            After people realize that the medical establishment is after their kid, they can also understand that these  pedos are too.
           </p>
           <p>
            The vaccine red pill is a hard one because it takes a ton of time to sift through and learn
           </p>
           <p>
            Recently, I told someone about the  vax hoax by having him read a flu vaccine insert.
           </p>
           <p>
            He thought I was mistaken when I told him that 1 flu dose from a multi - vaccine vial has 25 mcg of mercury.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then, I read it to him from the insert.   I think he almost had a heart attack right there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm sure, now, he will do some research.  (I gave him videos to watch)
           </p>
           <p>
            It is just really hard for people to imagine such evil-ness and, as you know, they do not want it to be there so they refuse to look.
           </p>
           <p>
            Very sorry for you but you sound persistent which will help.     That may not have helped you, but that is all I could think of at the moment.  :-(

             Do you have a copy of that vaccine insert? That is another topic I drum about to my children so they can take precautions with their children.

              Just get them to read the insert of the one they are considering. Last one I saw had no declared mercury but lots of formaldehyde some other nasty things. Just tell everyone the fact that vitamin C is a great preservative and ask your friends why they think TBTB use dangerous ones instead of vitC.

            Unfortunately most young parents don't realise the danger out there. For my youngest I homeschooled and only used very close family for babysitters. About all you can do is pray for them. Nancy Pelosi seems to be a sicko!

             I have one son who is going to homeschool. I sure wish the others would do the same. I just don't trust anyone anymore. If we have heard that there are family members who have violated that sacred trust within their own families and molested children how could anyone trust anyone anymore. It seems to be everywhere anymore.

              My daughter is 13 now and contracted Lyme around the time she went to a daycare on a Military Base.  This was after 9/11 and I love d the idea she was behind armed gate guards just to go to daycare.  But I feel they gave her Lyme there.  Do research on Lyme Disease.  It is a slow crippling Disease that makes you not strong enough to fight them.  She is home schooled now and we are eating as Organic as we can because I believe the whole Organic movement is a Illuminati trick to make sure the poison they are flooding us with can be avoided by the ones in the know.  I dont think they really thought bottled water and Organic food would catch on as much as it did.  Now they are making propaganda videos that bottled water is a crime against nature and it is a sin to drink it.  They want us on the public water where they can dumb us down as they wish.
             </p>
             <p>
              Look into the reasoning behind why people began public schools that were compusotory.  It was to make better workers.  The original German movement actually write they want to change the student as much as they can from their parents.  The feminist Movement is not to free women but to make them taxable.  Away from home more so they have to put their kids into daycare to be mind fucked by whatever Satanic shit they think of next.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is building to a head.  The preppers have been right all along.  They plan to destroy us all when they get there plans totally in place.  When the shit hits the fan they will start a civil war here first.  Then a major foreign war followed by releasing whatever evil diseases they have cooked up for us.
             </p>
             <p>
              Dont take the Vaccines.  Eat better.  Avoid processed foods.  Drink bottled or filtered water.  These bastards mean business and they are weaking our immune systems systematically before the big events.

               Forget the bottled water, buy yourself a distiller and purify your own. We distill our water now and you wouldn't believe the crap that it takes out.

               I know. Right?  I still can't get over it.  But if I were to tell people about it, they would say, Oh, they must have made a mistake.  They probably didn't hear right.  Oh the frustration of it all!  They just refuse to believe.  They are afraid to face anything that horrific.  But when the time comes, I cannot wait to say I told you so.  For it has not been fun, being the butt of people's remarks and weird looks.
