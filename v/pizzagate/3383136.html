<p>EXCLUSIVE: Did Jeffrey Epstein have painting of Bill Clinton wearing a blue DRESS and red heels and lounging in the Oval Office inside his Manhattan mansion? Visitor reveals bizarre image inside pedophile\'s $56m lair</p>
<ul>
<li>Jeffrey Epstein had a painting which appeared to be Bill Clinton wearing a blue dress and red heels hanging inside his Manhattan home</li>
<li>Source who saw it during a business meeting told DailyMailTV</li>
<li>The blue dress seemed to be a pointed reference to Clinton\'s former intern Monica Lewinsky who wore a blue dress during their tryst in the White House</li>
<li>The painting was snapped inside the pedophile\'s mansion in 2012, seven years before he was accused of running a sex trafficking ring of underage girls</li>
<li>The source, who asked to remain anonymous, was visiting Epstein to present a business proposal </li>
<li>She told DailyMailTV: \'It was absolutely Bill Clinton. It was shocking... it was a very provocative, sexual picture\'</li>
</ul>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein had a bizarre portrait which appeared to be of Bill Clinton in a dress hanging in his Manhattan mansion, DailyMailTV can reveal.</p>
<p>The picture depicting the former president apparently lounging on a chair in the Oval Office, wearing red heels and posing suggestively in a blue dress redolent of Monica Lewinsky was in a room off the stairway of the Upper East Side townhouse.</p>
<p>The painting was secretly snapped inside the pedophile\'s lavish $56 million home in October 2012, four years after Epstein completed his sweetheart deal for prostitution of a minor and seven years before he was accused of running a sex trafficking ring of underage girls. </p>
<p>The source, who asked to remain anonymous, was visiting Epstein to present a business proposal - an encounter with the pervert which included spotting a girl who seemed to be 14 waiting to see the financier.</p>
<p>The woman said she was shocked to catch sight of the portrait through an open door as she walked through the ornate home with her business partner. </p>
<p>She told DailyMailTV: \'It was absolutely Bill Clinton. It was shocking - it was definitely a painting of him. It was a very provocative, sexual picture. He was wearing heels, a blue dress and his hand was in a weird position.\'</p>

             Well, that's weird. How'd you even spot that? It's like the thumb is split forming a semi-circle or clawlike aooendage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Did the artist paint Bush's hand this way?
            </p>
            <p>
             In terms of the dress, yes, she did wear something like that.

            There were too many people who saw it including law enforcement. Read the NYPost copy and you'll see that law officers saw it.

            I think we're so used to seeing professional shots, that this is off putting. But it was snaped on the fly. This visitor didn't even know it was there and they did it in a rush.

            Sorry. Real portrait. Even the NYPost was forced to treat it as actual news cause they can't debunk what's true.

            This is waking up normies big time. Look at the comments in the DM. In the UK, the story can't be found on the main site. I had to search for it. That speaks volumes.

            Wow. They Brownstoned Billy Boy too. That’s how they made him do what they wanted. Also he knows they can expose him any time. It would be funny if it were not for the evil things they got him to do. Sick. Wonder if Monica knows about it.

               Yes, there was talk about that, but her relationship with Linda Tripp would seem to contradict that rumor.
              </p>
              <p>
               Linda befriended her and Monica was constantly on the phone with her and telling her things about the affair. Linda was the one that told her to save the dress. And because Linda was working with the GOP to try to prove Clinton was having sex w/other women (remember the state troopers doing the same thing), the calls were recorded. Lewsinky was very insecure and very needy which is pretty much the opposite of what Mossad operatives are.

                 And her pet cat disappeared after she'd been threatened. It just doesn't point to someone who worked for MOSSAD. But she could have been being handled to make the mistakes she did .... wait a minute? Wasn't she also having an affair with some general?

               You wouldn't believe what I heard. It was someone who used to live in NYC. She said one of the Royals used to give pool parties way back when. It was a female Royal and while young girls and men were invited, this Royal preferred young boys -- very young boys. I've been trying to find anything I can to corroborate it, but nothing in print. I will keep trying so I can post it.

            Note the RED shoes. There's a whole "conspiracy theory" (which as time goes on most "conspiracy theories" are turning out to be true) that claims certain red shoes, including mens shoes, are made from the skin of ritually murdered kids and presented to elites as a sort of memento or membership in a club. The late (or still early) Epstein must have been aware of these rumors and purposefully included red shoes in the painting.

             Mostly for facade in the modern concrete era. Still used, and not easy to replicate, given modern time demands, and Mexican/other slave labor! Quality work can only be produced by a very few very old USA citizens.

            Ah, yes. Good old imgur. Known for removing images they don't like, and for sending you malicious javascript. In 2014, imgur received a $40 million investment from a company co-founded by a kike. But that couldn't possibly be related to anything, right?

            Also, stop using imgur, faggot.

             I'm sure he's a cross-dresser. Probably walks around in Hillary's duds. Or has a closetful of ostrich feather embellished gowns.

            I’m happy they talk about it in the news now but dailymail is famous for bs articles. I want it to be true so badly, so fingers crossed. The painting looks fake as fuck though.

             Here's the NYPost printing the story. Somebody snapped a photo. We've got to thank him or her for doing that because I doubt the media propagandists would have published this on their own.

             Yes, they often publish bs. But I don't think they would dare to publish a pic of Bill Clinton like this if it wasn't legit.
