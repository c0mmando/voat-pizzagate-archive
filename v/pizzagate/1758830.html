            Ease up pizzagaters.....yea, he let us do when we needed him most, but he's red-pilled millions over two decades. Trump personally called him out, michael savage, etc. I believe he's genuine overall....he talked about these satanic elites for years/decades....he knows his shit....he just seriously fcked up with that vid....seemed all wrong even if he was being sued.....but who are we to judge....just saying guys

            I believe "Alex Jones" was MKULTRA-ed. Think of how he can transform to extreme anger at a moment's notice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doesn't someone have to be trained for that? Especially when they are acting?
           </p>
           <p>
            Some kind of conditioning involved, IMO. It's un-natural.
Think of "Skippy" - They are trained to do that?

              Of course nothing I say is going to change your mind, but I am duty-bound to point out for others how easy it is to disprove the Jones is Hicks hypothesis, or prove there is no God. Besides some common physical traits that mislead people, Jones and Hicks do share another characteristic to a very great degree, and that would be an unwavering commitment to their philosophical understanding of the world. Hicks was indeed an atheist who despised and ridiculed Christianity, but Jones talks about the Creator and Jesus constantly, so much so, it annoys a good deal of his more secular listeners. Here's a video, not that you're going to watch it:
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWh_trPA8GU">
               https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWh_trPA8GU
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              ...but maybe some other more open minded or curious reader will, in order to test your theory that Jones and Hicks are indeed the same person. In the video, Jones is discussing Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the British Doctor who has evidence that the CDC was covering up data that proved the MMR vaccine is causing devastating rates of autism in children. Jones also discusses late term abortions. Then Jones does something interesting. He segues into God and Jesus yet again, and the judgement that is going to befall all those who hurt children.
             </p>
             <p>
              If Jones is merely acting in this ten minute clip, then it would be the most compelling, nay definitive proof that there is no God.

                LOL, as if someone couldn't find a moment in thousands of hours of animated broadcasting where he raises his hand in such a way that it could give the appearance of making the all seeing eye. You're very gullible. Why Jones should just strap his hands to the desk lest he make any more accidental signs of working for the devil. As far as the so called horns in your next picture which you hold out as the best evidence to support your hypothesis, this gesture has been used for a long time by a great many people and for a multitude of different reasons, and not all of them are going to hell. It is hardly surprising that there might be a photo of him making this symbol, but it is so rare, this is the first time I have ever seen him do it. It's also quite old, and Jones's faith has certainly gotten stronger in the last few years, so I doubt he would do it now. Given that he had a bullhorn in his hand, it was likely a spur of the moment sign of victory in disrupting something like Bilderberger's meeting. It has no impact whatsoever on his religious beliefs. Also, I am curious, have you ever in your life formed this hand structure, with baby and index finger extended? The last of your pictures is thoroughly irrelevant, being a complete work of Photoshop.

                  Such media 'franchises' are worth millions of dollars - thus any public scrutiny that would expose Alex Jones as a cheap entertainer posing as a patriot would be disastrous for the large investment that Genesis has made in the Austin based broadcaster.

                  You produce a video which is going to prove that Alex Jones is not a Christian:

                   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L65GdmkNtzE
                  </a>
                  I'm a sporting fellow, so I decide to watch it in entirety before making any comment. I start watching, and by the time my jaw hit the keyboard, I had to stop. Here's why:
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Your internet sleuth (which could be you for all I know) who is going to prove Jones is not a Christian, tells me to go look up Kent Hovind and support him and his good work. However, there is a problem. The problem is I already know who Kent Hovind is, because Alex Jones passionately discussed his plight in being wrongly jailed probably a dozen times while he was in prison by my recollection, and Hovind was even a guest on Infowars

                Not only does it have everything to do with God, you introduced it as your centerpiece that Jones is Hicks. See bold sentence from your post which I copied.
               </p>
               <p>
                Further, the video you provide is so typical of the kind of videos which are used to brainwash others that Jones is ___________ (fill in the blank). Such videos are comprised of clips taken completely out of context, manipulated with repeats, special effects, voice overdubs, and all kinds of trickery. Jones has been on the air for two decades and has produced literally thousands of hours of content, which means it is very easy to take select clips and edit them to make Jones look as bas as possible. In contradistinction, the clip I volunteered shows a perfectly rational and reasonable man whose purpose at this particular time was to tell everyone that MMR vaccinations can and likely will ruin your child forever.
               </p>
               <p>
                Watch the clip I provided in entirety, and then tell me Jones is an atheist. If you can't do that, you're good for nothing.

                 Right if you recognize "Jones" is a fake name and "he" used to have another name, yeah, then you know, if you didn't figure it out otherwise, that he is a fake Christian.

                 "Jones" is a good actor. His life probably depends on it. Or maybe he just thinks it's funny to fool the schnools?

Is Alex a shill now granted he does have some great info and videos which I have on this site...
I will not take that away from him but all he does is spread fear and yes he is a known fear monger and is contolled opposition.
On this page i will prove he is a shill!
Let's start with Alex and the presidentail election being rigged and Ron Paul being a part of the system which Alex heavily promoted when the presidential elections were happening thake a look at some photos of good'ol Ronnie!

            I've never liked AJ, I never got how anyone could listen to some fat ass screaming about Governments agenda's being rammed down our throats etc.. arghh arghh but I'll ram MY FATASS AGENDA DOWN YOUR THROATS SO LISTEN OR ILL KEEP YELLING
 (which is clearly the same agenda, he is payed by CIA to sell)

            I know there's a lot that don't like David Icke, but he's pretty spot on, and leaves you with information to ponder on and make of it what you will, he's happy to get people's minds thinking out of the box wether you agree, disagree or think he's nuts.. it's ok that's your opinion.. you have the info now..
           </p>

            Where AJ seems to trap his viewers into a one sided negatively fuelled agenda, that doesn't really do anything positive

            Everyone is bashing Jones but the same damn thing happened to Swann. These guys are being attacked hardcore. The elites threatened to end Jones' business and Swann lost his show and his website. It's easy to call them sellouts but honestly how many on here have actually risked their careers exposing this stuff worldwide without hiding behind anonymity? This brings up another point about those of us with careers and families. We all know Alefantis is as guilty as sin, as is Podesta but until we actually get charges, an LEO investigation, or a victim to come forward we all run the risk of getting sued or worse. Everything on voat can be traced even if you use an alias. Most of the people on here are not tech savvy enough to stay completely anonymous online. Those of you posting real facts need to get a gun and carry if you can. Just some food for thought.

                It's uncertain because when you are dealing with secret organizations, the front men are not the men in charge. They have their own hierarchy which is hidden. Brought out here in the work of Jaysun H. , J. Irvin , Joe Atwell... Jaysun explains it well. How it works over time; how their agenda is achieved, how they remain invisible.

                 Alefantis is too careless to have been given any major role by those who deemed themselves extremely careful. He did his part, and they were willfully thanking him for it, but now it's too late for JA. He was was the pebble that rippled into a tsunami.

             If Podesta bros., Clintons, etc., were actually investigated (which would likely lead to arrests) as Jones clearly lobbies for passionately every single time he touches on PG, do you really think JA would escape scrutiny because of anything Jones might have said? Do you really believe Jones's saying Alefantis is not a suspect is going to have an impact on any actual investigations?
            </p>
            <p>
             Jones has done the very best he could after being set up through a ridiculously fake Comet Ping Pong menu passed to one of his ace reporters that overtly listed children for sale including those which were lame from previous torture, the story of which was broadcast on twitter under Infowars banner. I can barely believe you cannot see the utility or rather necessity in Jones's tactic of exculpating Alefantis because of this ruse and yet still keeping
             <strong>
              everyone else
             </strong>
             in play.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you could throw some magical switch and have every high profile pedophile in the D.C. area arrested tomorrow with the one condition that Alefantis, assuming he's guilty, would get away, would you do it? One can only infer it's all or nothing for you, which is not smart or realistic.
            </p>
            <p>
             What you're suggesting would be exactly the same as finding fault in a prosecutor who cuts a deal with one pedophile when same reveals the names and produces evidence against nineteen other pedophiles at the top of the food chain.
             <strong>
              By your rationale, the prosecutor would be a disgrace for letting the one get away instead of going after all twenty on principle and losing nineteen through acquittals because the evidence from the one willing to testify against  the nineteen was unavailable to be exploited. Man, you are one piss poor tactician.
             </strong>

              Agreed! Jones is just biding his time until a victim comes forward. I love all the haters bashing him on here but I don't see any of them starting their own radio program and fighting Alefantis's lawsuits.
