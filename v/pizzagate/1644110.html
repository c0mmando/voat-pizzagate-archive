            Just wanted to add on the Sandusky connection.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is interview with Greg Bucceroni talking about being a victim of a pedo ring. He was in a Boy's Club in Philly and was groomed by a man named Ed Savitz. He talks about how the ring would trade boys and how they were shuttled to visit Sandusky at Penn State, New York, D.C. etc.
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Also one interesting tidbit on Savitz, he would pay boys to defecate for him, he also would request that they eat cheese because it would make the feces taste better. When he was arrested they found tons of PIZZA boxes filled with feces, that he had kept as some sort of weird trophy!

            also read the first comment in this link where persons says *i hope people are not waiting for coutrs, AG, police etc to do anything there are far too many bested interests in covering it up.  Everyone on here neds to know that people have been trying to expose these crimes and the people involved for a long long time.     If we don't want to be just another site, like the one i am linking to below, where sometime in the future others investigating some new child abuse crimes stumble upon we need some effective plans!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Believe me TPTB are not worried by this site there have been so many over the years.   I think we need yo think about how to start breaking through the fact that those with the power to stop this for one reason or another don't want to. LE etc are often compromised

             Louis Freeh is almost bizarrely absent from discussion in Pizzagate and the wider conspiracy community at large considering his connection to some of the most intruiging events in recent history.
            </p>
            <p>
             Aside from the above listed:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              He really burst onto the scene as a US Attorney and lead prosecutor of the "Pizza Connection" cases, which showed how the mob was using pizza parlors as fronts for world-wide drug trafficking among other things (The "Pizza Connection" case was, at the time, the most complex criminal investigation ever undertaken by the U.S. government."
             </li>
             <li>
              He represented Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan (a.k.a. Bandar Bush) in the HUGE Al-Yamamah Arms case
             </li>
             <li>
              He left as head of the FBI just when the "lights were blinking red" regarding an unprecedented terrorist attack in June of 2001.
             </li>
             <li>
              He was involved in a crazy suspicious near-death car accident that was immediately discovered by another FBI agent that "just happened" to be tailing right behind him.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Just reading his wikipedia and nothing else just ask yourself: Why was this particular guy picked out of the blue to head up an "independent" investigation of the Penn State scandal?

            I tried looking up information on Sandusky and also the Second Mile from before his arrest by searching on earlier years, and very little came up. I did come across this story, though, from The Morning Call (Allentown, Pa):
           </p>
           <p>
            The story is from 1999 when Sandusky retired, and it is actually called: "There's no pretending: Sandusky is for real"
           </p>
           <p>
            The "pretending" refers to "The Great Pretenders," a group of Penn State football coaches Sandusky put together to perform for children:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The Great Pretenders -- Sandusky and fellow Penn State assistant football coaches Joe Sarra and Bill Kenney -- tried everything to win the cheers of kids attending their summer football camps. They danced atop a Penn State Blue Band wagon. They squeezed Kenney into a rubber Batman suit -- "It was 85 degrees," Spider said. "Bill was dying in that thing."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The story says about 100,000 children were "helped" by the Second Mile (I'm sure many were, but we have to think now many were also hurt).

            Former AG Kathleen Kane filed a report in 2016: "The email report Kathleen Kane commissioned into offensive and pornographic materials identified 13 senders who were either judges or senior government officials and another 38 "high-volume senders."

            August 25, 2016. A series of pre-trial decisions rendered against PA AG Kathleen Kane in the weeks and months leading to the jury verdict helped to seal her fate - long before a jury was ever selected. In Pennsylvania, you are protected when you go along, and you’re endangered when you don’t.

            "During his second term as AG, Corbett assigned only one—yes, one—state trooper to investigate the Sandusky scandal. Then there’s this tidbit from a January 25, 2012 Sports by Brooks column. “From the month he learned of the Sandusky allegations to the day he took office as governor, Corbett’s AG office issued 42 press releases touting hundreds of arrests by the Corbett-commissioned Child Sexual Predator Unit.” Strangely enough, Corbett’s crime-fighters didn’t mention a single word about Sandusky. Zero."

            John DeCamp wrote about the Penn State connection decades ago in his book, The Franklin Cover-up.  I remember watching a youtube vid the day it broke of a local official on a radio program there saying that it goes much higher than Sandusky, and you will be hearing more in coming days.  I also remember thinking how naive he sounded. !DOORSLAM!  Not another word.

             Not sure about a Clinton connection, but HW Bush called the Second Mile one of the thousand points of light in the new world order. HW is also a well documented serial pedophile. See Cathy O'Brien's books, Brice Taylor's book, Senator John Decamp's book on the Franklin scandal, David Icke's research, Saint John Hunt's work, etc.

              I know what was done to HW Bush by his father.  That would be Prescott Bush.  He sodomized him until the day he died.  I have no sympathy for him but I admit it is horrible and must have affected his actions in some way.  George W Bush is MK Ultra, no wonder he had that strange look on his face the day of 911 while he read to those children.  What a great family.

                It was in an article posted on here by Cynthia McKinney, a trafficked slave that also became an agent for the CIA.  Very bazaar story.  But everything about these elites is bazaar.

                  You are correct and I am not!  I got that name mixed up and I cannot remember who wrote the article but it was a girl that grew up within the elite global ring and ended up being an agent since she had special talents due to her MK Ultra mind control.  I just read it about 2 wks. ago.  So sorry.

                    Barbara is so the opposite.  Hmmmm.  Have you noticed that they both went in to the hospital this year at the same time?  The same happened last year.  Very strange to me.  Some kind of youth serum?  At the looks of them it is not working.  He has partaken of so many evil satanic rituals and maybe dinners that it has taken it's toll.  Yuck.
