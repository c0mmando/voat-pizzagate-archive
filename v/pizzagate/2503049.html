            Police in India are corrupt as f@ck. Girls and women are unwanted and hated by men, and are seen as less than human. Most Indian men (over there) are sexist pigs.  Of course, when they emigrate, the next generation takes on the social mores of the adopted country and they become a bit more civilised towards women.

             police are corrupt but the culture is deeply feminist. most men a radical feminists. they worship multiple female deities. totally crazy. if you touch someones woman they will call the whole family and kill you. abrahamic religions are what you are describing.

            The movie Best Marigold Hotel, British TV series The Real Marigold Hotel and Good Karma Hospital are cover stories for organ replacement therapy tourism, that cut out the kids dying to supply the organs part of the story. The themes are of old people being rejuvinated, so if someone comes back from India with a new lease of life everything is already normalised.

             The word Hindu means black slave in its original persian word..the word india comes from that word...this is why they still use the word indian in USA to officiallyndesignate aboriginal americans even when its been more than 400 years after columbus made that ...'mistake' ...
Its no mistake its legal language trickery to designate a people black slave..
East indians are so brainwashed ..and r living under a police state set up in 1857...the first law the british brought in after 1857 revolt was to remove guns...
Thier other sub corporation called the US created 14th amendment citizens ..legally black slaves under voluntary servitude around the same time..
Hind or india..or black slave or 14th amendment citizen ade legal entities to operate voluntary servitude..

              i just checked hind in persian means PRICE or RATE of goods. 
14th amendment citizen means a 'slaves recently FREED' so where is voluntary servitude here?
any source for guns being taken away for public in 1857?
             </p>
             <p>
              i thought hindu was the name given to people living east of river Sindhu. Some couldnt pronounce the letter S so they called it H and so Hindus.

               Baggage and burdens inside the English language. I have heard and maybe read some stuff where Hindus were named after the Indus River, all this region from Eastern Europe to the Middle East to Asia was part of ancient trade and countless wars. The Hindu name it was a name given by the Macedonian Greeks maybe Alexander of Macedonia, then the invading Iranian Persians, to refer to the land and peoples beyond the Indus (or Sindhu) River it then became part of the Indian language. The Indian Desi river is called Sindhu in Sanskrit, which the ancient Persians(from pre-Islamic times) called Hindu in the Avestan and later in Farsi language. Also 'Indian' is another false name, at one time people had the idea of  'Flat Earth' if you sailed to far you would fall off. When the major Europe explorers of the world the first Portuguese, Spanish, British set sail they hoped to find a trade route to Asia by sailing West from Europe. With the fall of Constantinople to the islamist muslims and Ottoman Turks trade with Asia became more difficult, dangerous and problematic for Europe. Christopher Columbus landed in the US then not named and the indigenous people were way different from the Europeans and he thought he may have landed in India and hence he referred to the resident people as Indians. Explorers had difficulty funding some voyages because of politics, many Roman Catholic theologians still used to believe that the Earth is flat. There is still ongoing discussion about the changing terminology for Native peoples, First Nation peoples or indigenous peoples of the Americas.

            the whole story is made up on a writers laptop then executed in real life. the motive is to have this story out which brutalizes the emotions of anyone reading it. Rape is just what fit the bill in this story.
           </p>
           <p>
            the purpose to brutalize the emotions is to polarise the voters of india on religious lines.
           </p>
           <p>
            this article is for domestic consumption. to again polarise them on gender lines, push feminism.
           </p>
           <p>
            a divided population is easier to handle for those in power. the powers dont want voters united pointing fingers at their shoddy governance. they want the population cheering them on to be their saviours!
           </p>
           <p>
            US intervention is not the goal. While the Syrian chemical attack staging focused on crimes committed on children in a preplanned fashion to brutalise the emotions of readers and demand an action as desired by the writers of the story the same way this rape story was staged by focusing on crimes commited against a child (whether real or fake) in a preplanned fashion to brutalise the emotions of readers to NOT demand an action from the government but to HATE EACH OTHER on both RELIGIOUS and GENDER lines.

            My heart hurts for these victims, and rages at the brazen perpetrators.
           </p>

            I have read about victims of the caste class system in India. The Dalit is an "untouchable" caste of below-lower class. They are considered to be subhuman by the other classes. For most of modetn times, super horific crimes were committed against them without repercussions. They are the invisible people that do the most undesirable and unclean jobs. Migrant and nomadic tribes fall into this class. The sikhs and the hindus and the muslims all have trouble finding peace, which doesnt help. I am not an expert on India, sharing only the benefit of what I have read. Anyone feel free to correct me. I will be praying and I invite anyone o do the same for these victims and this massive chaotic nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            PS: I have seen reports that Japan also has such an untiuchable bottom caste. I wonder if other societies do, and if so.. Do young ones from these groups fall victim more easily into the pizza pipeline?
           </p>
           <p>
            Probably they do, and probably we can find another angle and more rocks to look under.

            In 2008 there was news of a poltical party guy Amar Singh,  Samajwadi Party general secretary big money moving around, might have been instrumental in $ 5 million donation paid a certain Foundation, New York Times (NYT) report made similar reports. Today Kuldeep Singh Sengar, the main accused for allegedly raping a 17-year-old Dalit girl in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao, India is a horrible mess with people living brutal under a continued 'caste system' but big for business, call centers and Facebook’s Business Development Vice-President Ash Jhaveri going there.  Indian police have made another arrest after the alleged rape of a teenager by a ruling party politician sparked protests across the country, federal investigators said Sunday, second person, a woman named Shashi Singh, is arrested police said in our ongoing investigations of the case. Crimes are reminiscent of the fatal gang-rape of a Delhi student on a bus that made headlines around the world. Also in recent case girl was kidnapped, drugged and repeatedly raped over five days — including inside a Hindu temple — before being strangled and beaten inside the India shrine with a rock.

             The Mexicans have evolved to these type of "people" who can't be touched, cartel and politicians who get out of hand. I have seen stories of a military type death squad that regulates. They supposedly leave calling cards.
