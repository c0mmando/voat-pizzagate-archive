            This thing is huge, and its the real story, and chasing comet-pizza is a distraction.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I was a kid, I lived in LA I was taken from my parents at 10 years an made a ward of court, in foster homes they would frequently and have me stay over at other homes and note most of the times the foster family's had a police man as the foster father.
           </p>
           <p>
            The gist here is this started in 1950's in LA, and Social Services was a pre-text to STEAL children and make them into sex-slave, and identify children who would fit into the MK-ULTRA program.
           </p>
           <p>
            The rabbit hole? In 1960's-1970's 10's of 1,000's of children sent to China-Hat under MIL control, to Area-51 ( largest  base infants cages ), and sheridan, Oregon ( jesuit center, now scientology education center ); Today these kids are all grown up, and are an army on the streets with no remorse, and no heart.

             I don't know if it's a distraction. It's more a foothold on the mountain. Sometimes if you open one thing up and prove it, you can open the can the rest of the way.
