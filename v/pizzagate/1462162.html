            Has anything happened with this?  I know they were shutting down pretty much everything related to the original sub.  I'd be surprised if this one was allowed to remain.

             They shut it down without stating a reason and now my whole computer is acting fucky and crashed with me having to write a shit ton of essays. It started acting really laggy so I figured I'd check my ports and all that shit. When I googled TCPView to check if I was being monitored the screen flicked off and on, the mouse arrow moved by itself then the whole thing shut off and won't boot properly. Forgot to use a proxy or Tor when I posted some stuff. At least it's a good thing that in a tinfoil hat moment I put tape over my Webcam, just in case. I swear this is all completely true and I don't think it was a coincidence at all.

            I have created a reddit account for you to post your info under so that you do not have to risk your own account or ID. The name is AnonymousPizzaPost and the password is AnonymousPizza. I have no doubt that it will be compromised very quickly but if you can post anonymously from it before then I would appreciate it. Obviously when using a public account use the necessary precautionary steps to protect your personal data. I give it less than an hour before it gets shut down.
