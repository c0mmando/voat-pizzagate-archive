Here\'s a video of her entering a bar <a href="https://youtu.be/U8XrE0FSQv4?t=21">looking for her friend Gary.</a></p>
<p>So right there first up we can establish the Welch family has a certain proclivity for entering bars with automatic weapons looking for people. But this isn\'t about Edgar\'s sister. This is about Edgar. And Edgar got in a spot of bother a short time before he decided to enter Comet Ping Pong and shoot into a closet while looking for children being held against their will........possibly in hidden rooms....and closets.</p>
<p>O_O</p>
<p>What was that spot of bother? Edgar appears to have accidentally <a href="http://www.wbtv.com/story/33467722/13-year-old-struck-by-vehicle-in-salisbury-airlifted-to-hospital">struck a 13 year old with his car.</a> And I know what you\'re thinking already. Edgar must have been impaired due to recreational liquids and/or chemicals. But no, there was no DUI. Therefor what must have happened is Edgar must have been looking for that 13 year old and found him and said to himself &quot;Hey! That\'s who I\'m looking for. Maybe I should get his attention by running into him with my car.&quot;. So like any rational human being would do after finding someone on the road they were looking for Edgar ran into him with his car.</p>
<p>Ok. Now that I\'ve cleared that up I\'d like to dispel a rumor that\'s been going around <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">/v/pizzagate</a> and that\'s in exchange for leniency in the case where Edgar found a 13 year old kid he was looking for (yes at this moment in time evidently in certain Southern States you can still be arrested for finding someone with your car. God I fucking hate Republicans and fucking Donald Trump) TPTB made some sort of plea bargain where Edgar could repay his moral debt to that Southern State by agreeing to participate in a Sandy Hook style False Flag that evidently the Federal Government can now use for <s>Domestic Propaganda</s> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1938870">&quot;Public Diplomacy Broadcasting&quot;</a> as AreWeSure likes to call it to stage a completely fictional video production at Comet Ping Pong to prove that, ding ding ding, cars are much safer than assault rifles. Or assault rifles are safer than cars. I can\'t remember because I have a hard time processing American Culture after Smith-Mundt 2013 allowed the government to legally lie to the American People through the use of <s>&quot;Domestic Propaganda&quot;</s> &quot;Public Diplomacy Broadcasting&quot; like the Sandy Hook Hoax(no shit it was a hoax, I couldn\'t believe it either, look up Wolfgang Halbig on youtube) to further some sort of Orwellian goal of creating a distopian Police State out of the country I formerly knew as the United States of \'Murica.</p>
<p>Get it? There was no plea bargain or &quot;deal&quot; or &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; you Deplorable Shit Lord! </p>
<p>Fuck I hate Trump.</p>
<p>:-D</p>
<hr />
<p>UPDATE 1: </p>
<p>AreWeSure just got it <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1951434/9603256">from both barrels</a>. In case you don\'t want to click here\'s the discharge:</p>

<p>&quot;and was facing no criminal charges.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course AreWeSure and thank you for pointing that out to <a href="https://voat.co/user/AssFaceSandwich2">@AssFaceSandwich2</a> because I was about to open up on him with both barrels myself for thinking just for one second that the fact no criminal charges were filed could possibly have been part of a plea bargain.</p>
<p>I mean seriously do people really think Rich White Fascists inside the Deep State could ever in a million years do something so diabolical as pass a modernization act that allows the government to stage <s>&quot;Domestic Propaganda&quot;</s> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1938870">&quot;Public Diplomacy Broadcasting&quot;</a> in the hopes of unethically influencing public opinion?</p>
<p>Hell no. Fuck that, hell isn\'t a big enough word. I say Fuck No. ....Go home all you Deplorable Shit Lords! We don\'t need your Patriarchy anymore or your ethical &quot;Man Laws&quot;.</p>

            Keep your children in the yard, don't let them watch Disney movies and for sure, don't send them to expensive prep schools. (that is a CLEAR warning to everyone).
           </p>
           <p>
            These satanists - masonic freaks - devil worshippers - whatever you call them are pretty much everywhere
           </p>
           <p>
            These people are not the weirdos in the mall trying to look up your daughter's skirt.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are talking about people that will have other children molest your child   and then come in the room and spank the children who did it  as if they are "in trouble".    (This is to deceive your child and pretend they are on his/her side)
           </p>
           <p>
            They condition your child by giving them candy and showing them movies about how to kill animals.
           </p>
           <p>
            They do this slowly so the child never suspects anything is really wrong - though many feel uncomfortable.
           </p>
           <p>
            What happens if you find out?
           </p>
           <p>
            W E L L...   if your state CPS department is snooping around
           </p>
           <p>
            trying to find children to sell
           </p>
           <p>
            as is the case most places,
           </p>
           <p>
            what the hell CAN you do??  Not much.
           </p>
           <p>
            These bastards are doing what they do best: abusing and killing children.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are getting away with it.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are running the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            DarkMath is very correct:    What we once thought of as America no longer exists.

            We all know you can speak bullshit.  That's what you're paid to do.  There is a MOUNTAIN of supportive evidence that you're nothing but a paid shill, including your apparent OBSESSION with Smith-Mundt, which legitimizes your job.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Welch story is bullshit.  He is an ACTOR -- specifically, a CRISIS ACTOR.  As a fellow lying JEW -- or at least a Jew apologist, evidenced by your constantly calling your countless critics "Nazis" -- you should know a thing or two about that.

             Horsefucker I said I speak Bull Shit I didn't say I went to the Hillary Clinton School of Bull Shit where you learned to fight your opponent by accusing them of the very offense YOU are guilty of which in this case is you being a shill not me.

             Horsefucker when I implied my article was real news that was a joke. My entire post above is completely "Fake News". It's 100% fake as in it's a little comedy routine I do here where I use sarcasm and humor to highlight the absurdity of our now "fundamentally transformed" 21st  Century America.

            </p>

             this charade is  PAST overdue for an overhaul.

             You can disagree on specifics, but if you   aren't a troll yourself,  you will get the basic point.
