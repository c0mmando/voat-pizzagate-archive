            The tactic worked. You destroy the central meeting place, and people scatter. I'd post links to some great threads that have appeared on Voat and direct them at these "leaders" or influencers. Say something about joining Voat to help the cause and RT. I think it's better done that way. Yes, there should be ten times the amount, but we need to get back to investigative reporting.

            Yep just like that great meme on the pizzagate.com page. You can call our leaders shapeshifting lizard aliens. You can say Osama, Hitler, and Elvis are all chilling in the Galapagos islands. You can even auction off alien urine and bigfoot hair on the internet without being censored.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bring up pizzagate though, and the term 'fake news' is an overnight trend, twitter accounts go away, paypal accounts get frozen, youtube videos get removed, forums disappear.

            Because they brought up a subject that was true , and was so deeply disturbing to the PTB, if it reached a very high proportion of the population, all credibility in these fake governments would need more than spin to restore their credibility. Guess what? it has reached a tipping point, now the general population realise that a good proportion of these people are immoral.

            Totally agree this thread should be at 100k subscribers, if it were still on reddit it may be an even larger number than that but they have done a good job slowing us down by spreading everyone out. Censoring content across all platforms and doing actually a decent job of it.
