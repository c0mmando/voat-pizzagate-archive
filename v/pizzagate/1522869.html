<p>If you were an aspiring CIA lawyer living in the southwest and this boys town in Omaha had been exposed, you could not, no longer have a spot because of the increased attention to boys town.

<p>I believe what he was saying is that a couple of the &quot;beta&quot; males from there had a conflict with the alphas that were actually getting the kids and it had to be shut down and moved. Regardless of what was really going on there, that situation has ended and the OP has once again been moved.</p>

<p>Denver International Airport (DIA) was slated to be finished in 1993, but wasn\'t finished until 1995  and went 2 BILLION over budget. They also moved more dirt than it took to create the Panama Canal. Think about that for a minute. <a href="http://www.industrytap.com/denver-airport-2nd-largest-in-the-world-twice-the-size-of-manhattan/7982">http://www.industrytap.com/denver-airport-2nd-largest-in-the-world-twice-the-size-of-manhattan/7982</a></p>
<p>DIA openly admits that they have a underground baggage system &quot;that doesn\'t work&quot;, but that\'s where they say it ends. Other people have another story and with the amount dirt they moved I tend to believe the other people. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1994, Alex Christopher and Phil Schneider gained access to the underground facilities beneath Denver International Airport before it officially opened.</p>
<p>Below are some of the photos they took, along with commentary written by Ms. Christopher in 1995:
(Pics are in the link)</p>
<p>All of the following pictures are of the underground area at the Denver International Airport. Most of the areas are not being used, dead baggage equipment, long highways, many chain link fences and locked up fences that lead to lower levels and to what I know not. Many large open areas are not being used. Many large fenced in areas are not being used.</p>
<p>[Phil Schneider is] an engineer who had been involved for many years working in construction for the Industrial Defense Complex building giant “Deep Underground Bases.” He told me that he had been offered the position of head engineer for the construction of the base that was to go under the new Denver International Airport back in the early 80s.</p>
<p>[Phil Schneider] pointed out many things to me, such as, on the lowest level we could go into in the underground was very hot, not cool like a basement. He said it was hot because there were many level below it and the heat from there was rising from below us.</p>
<p>As told to me by a person that worked with one of the construction companies, there are five secret underground buildings with a depth of from 75 to 120 feet on each one, all with interconnecting tunnels to each other and with 2.50 to 3.00 mile long and 16 feet wide. I have even been told of a huge forty foot diameter tunnel that was already constructed and in place in this area and is believed to connect with “Dreamland.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is where I believe their OP has been moved. Not only is it the perfect setup, but Denver has all the signs. </p>

            Brilliant sleuthing!

           <p>
            Here are two sites with perhaps related information.  There's a lot in each of them if you can suspend any discomfort you may feel about "conspiracy-looking" sites.  It's not hard for me because I keep an open mind, these days, and I never say never.  I remind myself that there are plenty of people who think pizzagate is a conspiracy. I know they're wrong.

            I'm from Colorado, have been to DIA/New World Airport many times. There's all sorts of weird stuff there: Terminal C, I believe, has a giant replica Mayan ruin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's the underground train (which is a great deal of fun, actually, but one can see that there is a huge amount of unused space and a lot of extraneous tunnels down there). My boyfriend took a video the last time we were there, I'll see if he still has it and would be willing to share. The main line splits off probably every hundred meters or so, and there are dozens of little side stairways leading up to doors.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think the creepy NWO murals are gone (at least the one with the gas mask soldier is). There is a lot of peculiar artwork, though, including a statue of an Apollo XIII astronaut (the command module pilot).
           </p>
           <p>
            Blucifer the horse remains.
           </p>
           <p>
            Curiously, while many airports are dead zones for Pokemon Go, DIA is packed with Pokestops and Gyms. (Coincidence or deliberate distraction?)
           </p>
           <p>
            They've also recently finished construction of a Westin hotel on the premises.
           </p>
           <p>
            I may be going back soon, as I'm very fond of traveling, so I'll keep an eye out while I'm there.

             I've been on that train a few times myself. It's like a roller coaster haha I also have pics of all the weird art, the mason yime capsule and that satan horse. Interesting find about the Pokestops! Is there any way to prove that? I don't play Pokemon so I know very little about it.

              I'd have to go down there and screenshot. I'm fairly well-traveled, and even though most of my traveling thus far took place pre-Pokemon Go, I did play a lot on my last trip to NYC/Europe. Didn't see too much at the other airports but DIA is a huge spawn point.
             </p>

              The time capsule creeps me out, and now I'm inspired to go digging and see what else might happen in 2094.

            Notice how Webb and charles ortel website, connects Chelsea as hired Braverman. Ortel website shows how Clinton foundation recontract Braverman with half million, salary, few days before he goes abruptly mia.
Ortel also goes missing. His website needs mass archive and post asap.

            I live in Colorado and there is definitely a human trafficking problem here. In November 10 men were arrested in a human trafficking sting
            <a href="http://collegian.com/2016/11/10-arrested-in-latest-fort-collins-undercover-prostitution-sting/">
             http://collegian.com/2016/11/10-arrested-in-latest-fort-collins-undercover-prostitution-sting/
            </a>
            but their names were never released which is unusual because every other sting that had happened before the names were always published in local newspapers. The Larimer county Sheriff even called out the local newspaper for NOT releasing the names
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SheriffJustinSmith/posts/1181288638626310">
             https://www.facebook.com/SheriffJustinSmith/posts/1181288638626310
            </a>
            this is the statement from the Editor of the local (left wing) paper on why they weren't going to publish the names this time, basically I guess she decided it wasn't news worthy.

            However I am almost certain they are protecting somebody.

            On a side note Colorado has a billionaire family here, the Strykers, (Pat and John Stryker specifically) who were some of the biggest donators to the Clinton campaign (through a superpac) and to her foundation. 
The Wikipedia page
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Stryker">
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Stryker
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Pat Stryker, Jared Polis, Tim Gill, and Rutt Bridges are known in Colorado political circles as "The Four Horsemen" (aka "Gang of Four" or "The Four Millionaires") who have donated to liberal causes, fought against gerrymandering, and were instrumental in taking back Colorado politics from social conservatives. [5][10][11] Significant political contributions from the four to favored Democratic candidates has played a role in electing a Democratic majority in Colorado's house and senate.[12][13] Stryker has been frequently represented at political meetings by Al Yates, former president of Colorado State University.[5]
           </p>
           <p>
            The more you dig into the Stryker family, especially John Stryker who is a gay right activist that created ARCUS a gay rights foundation, you start to get a feeling this family has more going on than just philanthropy.

             All y'all, notice the multi coastal locations of boystown on my comments, google boystown on wikipedia, their website, and more on searches. Easy to transport to various locations, including creepy Colorado airports. Boys town has 12 major locations, then 11 are on COASTAL, ( SHip.ports, refugees, illegals, etc),/including Texas, Dc, va, Florida Miami and panhandle, NYC, new Mexico/Cali, etc. Boystown is in India and more countries. Boystown has TWO research hospitals, renowned in USA and ww. Boystown even sells gold silver IRA and coins. Easy Google search to see who is licensed and selling to archive.

             Here’s some research I have done so far into some questionable associations with Jon Stryker
            </p>

             Terry Bean,
             <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/11/20/kiah-lawson-terry-bean-human-rights-campaign-gay-sex-obama-prison-column/70021560/">

             </a>
             the billionaire super bundler that was arrested for molesting a 15 year old boy, created a gay rights foundation called Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund. 
Jon Stryker the founder of the gay rights foundation the ARCUS Foundation is a Platinum Council donor (giving $50,000 USD or more in annual contributions) to the Gay &amp; Lesbian Victory Fund.[2

             And here’s a more controversial write-up of his life and pursuits.

             I don’t know if any of this has anything to do with research into Pizza Gate , but regardless Terry Bean is a link that circles around to a billionaire connected to Colorado politics.

            Colorado man sentenced to 210 months in federal prison for role in
            <strong>
             global child exploitation enterprise
            </strong>
            PUBLISHED: October 18, 2016
           </p>
           <p>
            According to authorities, as of July 2014 the website had some 30,000 members who were required to share
            <strong>
             child pornography
            </strong>
            in order to gain and keep their access to the site.
           </p>
           <p>
            Delalio is one of five people to be sentenced in connection with the site, prosecutors say. Authorities say another defendant in the case sexually assaulted and produced
            <strong>
             child pornography
            </strong>
            involving several children while he was

            very interesting.  George Webb does have a LOT of info in his videos!   One thing I saw him say was to find evidence and proof of who the 1,100 high donors were, they could be prosecuted.

            I'm sorry. In no way am I trying to add "crazy" ufo theories or disinfo here but I just want to add another dimension to this open discussion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's put aside the UFO/Cow mutilation aspects of Chuck Zukowskis 37th Parallel theory, and focus on the possibility that there may be a network of connecting underground bases, bunkers, and caves stretching along the parallel from coast to coast.
           </p>

           <p>
            The Denver International Airport is closer to N40 parallel, but considering the massive amount of earth that was excavated during the construction of the DIA and the presence of underground bunkers at the airport perhaps it could act as a stop-off point / detention / storage area that feeds into a nation wide network (37th parallel).
           </p>
           <p>
            It is very interesting that the 37th parallel connects important government facilities such as the Pentagon / Fort Knox / Area 51.
           </p>
           <p>
            Webb points out in several videos how weapons running and human trafficking are often connected through various networks as we have seen in Syria to Libya with the red lines and rat lines.

            Hi. FOUND MORE! URGENT DOTS CONNECTED..Connects Miami Haitian refugees to Virginia AND BOYS CLUB, in Nebraska AND its all over USA from Orlando, NYC to Texas and more.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/quantokitty">
             @quantokitty
            </a>
            Found a book by Haitian detention victims on google read. By Melinda Miles and Mary Eugena Ch ( dang can't read my notes) Called, "Let Haiti Live: Unjust US policies.
Boys Town is still going on, its just bigger!! All over USA and worldwide. They have two Boys town Research Hospitals, too!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            They destabilIZE the country, and ones escape by boat or shipped. Regardless, if they seek asylum or have family members, they are still seperated even from immediate members by age, gender and more. And blocked from phone, outside contact, food from any source, beyond abuse ( Miami).
           </p>
           <p>
            They are sent to motels, Boystown in south Florida first them some to boystown all over usa ( Nebraska, NYC, Texas, Colorado ( check that due to airport), or sent to motel ( for regufees needs check.out as mass abuse and owner getting mass govt money), Krane Service Processing ( jail), or Broward correctional institute high security prison, just for being a deportee.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if a minor. That is. A dentist will check teeth, and say not minor, and send to Krane or broward and seperate from family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Boys are also sent to other states, thru boyclub or by sponsor parents. More girls go to sponsors, more boysvto various boystown homes or research hospitals.
           </p>
           <p>
            . High interest in boys. ( yet, did you know anal penetration is common to girls in pedi).yuck..
           </p>
           <p>
            The  book was written  when Bush was pres and MUST READ. DIRECT from two victims and more. Monica reporter was onto the Clinton industrial park.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ah, so much to say , found so much, so many connections.
           </p>
           <p>
            If seek asylum, ones maybe bieved are interviewed twice by ice asylum officers, then sent to Guatamo, then stuck there or sent to Venezuela, Guayamala, or Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dhs asends to VA and NYC!!!..to "sponsoring parents."!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Boys can be sent all over USA with boys club, yet if near 18, ,sent to Krane or other jail, after Boys town.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even in the motels, must stay in room, can't use phone or pol, can't even wear shoes, only flip-flops,any in room, even sick and pregnant with no medical. Can't even have food from fans orvrelstivrs brought or see them.in motels, Krane, boystown. Kept from their lawyers, relatives, in deplora condition.
           </p>
           <p>
            Miami commissioners spoke up and a Women's tight group for reguees and Bush and Fed da Schroft, even overturned a ground breaking federal case!!

            page 215 of the Haiti book says kids sent to Virginia and NYC, regardless if relatives and parents to SONSORS and group homes!!??
           </p>
           <p>
            So, they get many kids from refugees escaping. Ecuador is having a situation , too. Think Sleep, MORE children to route, by destabilize political war.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's what Webb meant, boystown still going on, they are just bigger. Boystown and both of their research hospitals has a lot to find on all three websites and who is running what. A Father Flanagan is running it. Head directors are John A run, De Edward Kolb. Medical research is huge and boystown is known as a top RESEARCH In nation and world with children.
           </p>
           <p>
            PLEASE look at my post on bones, bloods, organ multi industry markets and nationwide huge research. Bone even makes bio fuel. ( Obama podesta, green movements, no wonder he made it hard for solar with epa).
           </p>
           <p>
            Read the book asap, archive it, then resrsrch Krane, all three boystown sites for homing and two research hospitals!
           </p>
           <p>
            Krane on Facebook has many revealing posts and ones to interview.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if have immediate relatives, they are SEPERSTED. Older siblings separated from their younger siblings. Its awful deplorable conditions and treatments.
           </p>
           <p>
            Besides escape on boats, guarantee a boat by us dept is being used to ship. Read this book and see how many govt staff at every level, depts, corps, npos, eyc are involved!!! These victims wrote the book and nopne is even buying it, nor reviewing it!!and public health care and CP's. Connect to us aid and the corp.industries of Clinton foundation that Monica reporter said the industry park!/
Boys town is San Antonia Texas but boys sent group homes in each state or their research hospitals or other states they are, or their group homes. They in a bunchof states, BUT do communitychecks assessments in over 100 areas in USA, and MORE ABROAD ( HAITI, Ecuador, Saudi,  ???)..its also worldwide research hospital.
           </p>
           <p>
            Summary; boystown andbireland nuns STILL EXIST BUT ARE BIGGER AND INFILTRATE A BUNCH MORE..HOLY SCHNIKES.. excuse typos, over 12 hours nonstop research to find this!!
Sorry, I have to wrap my head around all...Nothing evercstopped, bigger and expanded into more of ALL INDUSTRIES!! SICK MOFOS VERY BOLD!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Find more victims, who is in Miami area???
           </p>
           <p>
            No wonder When double afraid to talk as Boys TOWN is bigger, JUST LIKE the NUNS Npo in Ireland, was not shit down, but they are worldwide, too, including in USA!! Look the nuns up, its all linked on wikepedia even in all the Ireland cases!! Surely, finders still going on, too.
           </p>
           <p>
            They just all have used destabilization of countries PLUS the healthcare systems/ CPS!! They just changed up their infrastructure and also use work programs for refugee and criminals and Juvies ( igneus is another direct connect to Obamacare)... just found and Its 20/pages of notes and more links.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at boystown locations maps..SURROUNDS the coasts, shipping ports, migrant areas, yep near epstein ranch in new mexico..
So the big secret..it never stopped it EXPANDED!
           </p>
           <p>
            Boystown is all over USA, 12 cities, ea Dc too, 100 plus community assessments, in India and all over worldwide, also as two USA research hospitals and worldwide medical...Andvtead the affiliations the directors and all have!!!

               Definitely will take a look. You laid out the basics pretty comprehensively so I understand the operation and what they're doing. It's incredible that the press or some advocacy group never got the message across of what they're doing to these children/families.

             He said it moved to a neighboring state from Texas and the rest is speculation at this point. I got here from thinking about the best location in a neighboring state, Denver 2 billion over budget airport (with underground conspiracies) popped in my head. I thought about asking Webb, but he sounded very concerned about having a heart attack or something if he said too much and I don't want to have that on my conscience. Could be anywhere though, you are correct. There could be multiple locations. Why put all your eggs in one basket?. Ya know..

            Webb did say "neighboring state". Just pointing out that Colorado and Texas are not contiguous states.

             Good point, it's pretty close though. You get an upvote for thinking critically. I'm not at all certain about any of this, it was just the first thing that popped in my head when I saw the video.

             I can't, but I'm open to it if a mod wants to add (DIA) to the title. I didn't want it to be considered click bait.

            Very interesting...personally I've never been to Denver airport but these murals are very disturbing. It does seem like an ideal place for human trafficking, especially considering the underground 'bunkers'.

            I naturally thought of Louisiana as the neighboring state Webb eluded to, found a few articles covering a Satanic Pedo-ring there
           </p>

            <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1491327/Satanist-paedophile-ring-ritually-raped-up-to-25-children.html">

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            2005 - Satanic/Ritualistic rape of 25 children -
           </p>
           <p>
            But after reading your post i think you're really on to something here. Great work!
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT - I was a bit confused, I thought when Webb mentioned a neighboring state he was referring to a state neighboring Texas (pointing to Waco). Now I think, like you suggest, that he meant a state neighboring Nebraska.

             Not to dissuade the article there from 2005, but just fyi, everything occult is seen as Satanism in places like Louisiana.  My guess is at some point there was something going on like with the Podesta's and Omaha where they were doing some evil shit and kids talked about it and the parents freaked out about it and went on a witch hunt after everything "satanic".  Even doing occult work with angels would be considered satanic by LA's standards.

            I could sit and talk to George Webb for hours. He knows so much. I was reading a link that was in one of the links posted. It said under the Colorado airport where there are underground bunkers, children are kept there. They are used and abused and then eaten. This was before pizzagate was out.

            Conjecture about the trafficking, but it is an airport, and with a large "unused" basement, that would tragicly be perfect for them. I've been there, seen the murals etc. Not the kind of wishy washy shit you'd expect to see at a run of the mill human transportation facility....definitely symbolism for insiders. Good call.

            Interesting theory...I'll say this...if Pedogate truly goes to the top and the CIA is involved, then this is totally possible.  Also, if there truly are large amounts of people being trafficked, Epstein's ranch would not likely be able to handle the volume covertly.

              There is so much we don't know.....if we had a better idea of how many people were actually being trafficked it would be easier to identify transportation hubs based on their capacity to covertly transport people.

             Thank you for the references about the many DIA conspiracies. These are what made me think about DIA. At the very least everyone can see the Masonic "New World Airport Commission" time capsule at these links.

            That airport has always given people a creepy and unsettling vibe. It makes little sense, in its artwork, construction, design... It would shock me not at all to find that nefarious and sinister things went on at that place. Good info, OP!!

              *I drove south along Wasserman Way, into Newtown, CT. That town is SPOOKY. It’s either a government façade, or some type of cult town.

              The most bizarre part of Newtown is the FAIRFIELD HILLS CAMPUS – site of the abandoned Fairfield State Psychiatric Hospital. Opened in 1931, it was finally closed in 1995 but was never demolished.

              This Fairfield Hills Campus (surrounding the decrepit mental hospital) is a bunch of huge abandoned buildings with paint peeling off and doors boarded up (see photos). It feels like a secret government training facility because along nearby roads (eg. Trades Lane), many buildings are abandoned shells, as a buffer from the “real” buildings set back from the road.*

              *The only sign of life is an occasional person walking a dog, or sitting in their parked car for no reason – doing nothing. The few “townsfolk” seem to be stationed at key vantage points, doing nothing other than observing.

              They seem like Stepford-wife actors, just “looking busy” among all these totally abandoned buildings with boarded-up doors, busted-out windows and big holes in the roofs.

              It seems someone doesn’t want anyone who “doesn’t belong” to have any reason to loiter. Fairfield Hills Campus feels like a military base that got decommissioned, but the government didn’t feel like allowing anyone to develop the land, so they just kept it. They mow the perfect lawns, while ignoring the crumbling buildings.*

              *Police sit in their (parked) cars every few hundred yards, just watching. This confirmed what I’d read beforehand – along with ghost stories and tales of what happened (prior to 1995) while the Psychiatric Hospital was active. At its peak, it housed 4,000 patients. Lobotomies were common, and patients were transported between buildings through a tunnel system – adding to the rumors of spooky happenings underground.

              The feeling of the place: There’s a bizarre agenda here. It’s a VERY BAD agenda. This place isn’t what it seems. This area is being watched closely because interlopers aren’t welcome. Part of me wanted to uncover it, but an instinctive part of me felt compelled to gather whatever photos I could, then get the heck out of there. Yes, I felt something was very wrong – but the most ominous part was that I couldn’t “place” that feeling. It was unlike any feeling I’ve had. THAT was the part that spooked me – I couldn’t figure out WHY the place felt so evil.

              Here’s the best way I can describe that feeling: It felt like the “powers that be” were ready to railroad anyone who showed up snooping around – and the townspeople (such as there are) would keep quiet about it, no matter what happened to you … Just like they kept quiet after the Sandy Hook “shooting.”

              Newtown feels like an “abandoned Manhattan Project.” Is this where our (occupied) government plans their false-flag “school shootings” and “terror bombings?”*
