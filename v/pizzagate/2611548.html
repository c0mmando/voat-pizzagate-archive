            This is what the text says, for those who are unable to read it, "I'm a digital forensic examiner and former
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             /r/pizzagate
            </a>
            mod. Sometimes I think that somebody killed my Dad because of that.
I've always been a very logical person. I work as a private-sector digital forensic examiner, have testified under oath in court on numerous occasions as an expert witness, and have lived my life with a very rational and evidence-based outlook on everything.
           </p>
           <p>
            In my personal life, from about 2013-2017 I lived with my Dad. I moved in with him after he lost his wife and after my then-fiancee decided she wanted to be with someone else. We had a great father-son relationship and things were good.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the tail end of 2016, I functioned as a mod on
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             /r/pizzagate
            </a>
            , and focused specifically on trying to keep the "investigations" focused and evidence-driven. I encouraged validation of external claims, proper inductive reasoning as opposed to wild conclusion-jumping, and I participated in analyzing a number of files for steganography. Nothing significant (to my knowledge) resulted from this.
           </p>
           <p>
            In January of 2017, I was woken up by the coroner pounding on the door, telling me that my Dad was found dead in his truck in the middle of the intersection two blocks from the house. He didn't crash - just stalled the engine and drifted to a stop in the middle of the intersection. Supposedly people just drove around him for three hours until a sheriff's deputy finally found him.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was 66, in perfect health. He didn't smoke, didn't drink, worked out with me multiple times per week, and had a pretty low-stress life. He had just been to his doctor for a checkup and told me that his cholesterol and blood pressure was "like that of someone half his age" according to the doctor.
           </p>
           <p>
            About two minutes after talking to me, the coroner concluded it must have been a heart attack "by process of elimination," handed me a card for the funeral home, and told me that I'd have to pay $200 by the end of the day to get his truck out of impound. And that was it. My entire world blew up around me in an instant. My Dad was my best friend and my only real family. I was in complete shock, and frankly have been for over a year. Because of this I've been battling severe depression and grief for over a year and most days can barely keep things together.
           </p>
           <p>
            And the more I think about it, the more I realize that everything seemed very sloppy about the whole situation. I was never offered the chance for an autopsy. The coroner's report (which I saw later) seems to have been written hastily, even misspelling his name and my name (which was also on the truck registration, determined from a DMV lookup). The coroner also that they "couldn't find his wallet," which I later found in the glove box of the truck after getting it out of impound. Obviously very little investigative work was done if they didn't even examine the vehicle. I also forensically examined my Dad's phone and found no attempts to call 911 or anything of the sort. I had the chance to see his body at the funeral home, but at the time I was just too psychologically unstable to do so.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm the first person to cite "correlation does not equal causation," and I fully understand that psychologically I don't have any logical reason behind why any of this happened. It may very well be that there is no logical explanation for why my Dad apparently just dropped dead in the middle of an intersection, so I'm connecting dots where no dots should be connected.
           </p>
           <p>
            But some days, something deep in my heart just screams at me that this isn't normal. And I've never shared this with anybody, but here I am laying it out on the table. If this can just be written off as the psychologically-disturbed disregarding of Occam's razor by someone in the throes of depression and grief, so be it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Given the timing of
            <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">
             /r/pizzagate
            </a>
            being banned about a week before my Dad died (I think), the fact that I had done all my activity on that sub from my home without a VPN, and the fact that I was (probably) the only professional investgative person involved with it, in my darkest moments I can't help but feel the circumstances are related. There, there's my crazy conspiracy theory. I'm a shell of my former self, so I don't care what repurcussions it brings to say so, but it's good to get off my chest in any case.
           </p>
           <p>
            From that moment onward I had completely abandoned all work toward the pizzagate stuff. It didn't matter. The fact that I've made it this far without just offing myself is honestly shocking even to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I didn't know where else to get it out, so I got it out here because anywhere else on the internet I'd be either condemned, mocked, or committed. But I've already lost it all, so I have nothing to lose by putting this crazy association into writing."

            I get creeped out as I've had like four Facebook accounts masquerading as girls add me on my personal Facebook account in the last year and add multiple Facebook friends of mine and try to speak to me. A week ago a " Kouame Koffi Alain" added me and mentioned she was a fan of my previous YouTube page and that she followed me research here on Voat on Pizzagate. I blocked her and was sort of freaked out.

            I got visited, and later poisoned. Probably just a coincidence. Get a gun folks. I don't care if you are in one of those places that don't allow you to pack. Better dead than safe? No, better alive and in trouble!

            I tried using ceddit to pull the deleted text and comments and it looks like an admin came in and permanently deleted everything.
