            , please have a look at our submission rules in the sidebar. We have a separate subverse for purely speculative posts --
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever">
             v/pizzagatewhatever
            </a>
            . However, if you'd like to make sure you have linked support for each major claim, we can leave it up. I will give you the 24 Hour Grace flair to edit. Thanks.

            John of Hod was just named as running a baby farm inNraxil. Bill C visited him at some point and so did Oprah. John of Hod held women hostsge to give north and hesold the babies.  He very well could have had some Irish girls at the farm. There was a post on this the other day.  You have to add a link to your post that is connected to your text in your post. You must do this or it will be deleted. Please do ASAP this a very important post. :)
