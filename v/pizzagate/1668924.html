            the process of cremation uses temperatures higher than that, but the ovens look similar

           <p>
            Ill help you out here because there is a lot of conjecture among people involved in this thing. Not saying non of it is true just saying some bold claims.
           </p>
           <p>
            The basics are that the leaked Podesta emails contain some weird stuff that people think are code worlds for child abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            That gets tied into all the fishy stuff surrounding the Clinton foundation and suspected human trafficking among other crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its also been suggested that the point of the child abuse is to have a way to blackmail people in places of power to control them. The people responsible for this aspect of it could be CIA or Illuminati or both or some other group depending on who you ask.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then you get a step farther with the satanic angle.. this idea ties it all together based on the claims of people like kathy obrien and others. Short version is a lot people around the global are part of a cult that kills and tortures kids maybe cannibalizes them as part of a ritual.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would suggest finding one of the summary threads because there is actually a lot of real information that would suggest that at least some of this is true. I think the crux of it is that its too fantastic for people to believe. I know if I came to a forum and was told this with out having found a lot of things on my own first I would probably roll my eyes.

             This is helpful thanks.   I'm not down with that Illuminati stuff, so yeah, it's feeling fantastic at the moment.

             I thought the fishy stuff around the Clinton Foundation was mundane stuff like that uranium thing.

             Cuz this is starting to look like bold claim plus bold claim plus bold claim.   You know when the coyote in the cartoons has run off the cliff, but he doesn't realize it yet.

              I am kind of in the same boat, not really an illuminati guy lol. I think the reason pizzagate is a thing is because there are some shady things surrounding the Clinton foundation that could be really bad. I would suggest checking out George Webb on youtube for a more secular angle to these things.

              Also podesta and his art and some of the emails are just too strange imo.

            There are several references to Moloch or Molech in the Podesta emails. Marina Abramavich has several portraits of her depicting the symbols of Molech or the horned one. This is an ancient Canaanite god to whom followers sacrificed children.

            I don't have the reference, but I came across a mention of how black magic or evil is the destruction of innocence. There may be a joy in some twisted people who watch as innocence is being destroyed.

            John Podesta has several direct links to actual cannibalism/ cannibalism fetishism, etc that people with eyes open can draw inference to. It's his personal interest like music or cinema or religion might be your thing that focuses your enjoyment. Skippy's life seems to revolve around the culture of people eating other people.  I'll do the big Skippy cannibalism thread showing all the links if I have to, but there are contributors who can put the ultimate Podesta cannibalism thread together better than I could. Have subheadings in the thread that separates direct reference from speculation.

            Sorry, I know how grotesque that sounds, but no other way to bring clarity to this situation.  Our government top players are enthralled with eating people when they aren't screwing kids. Mostly Democrat top players, but we've come to learn that the Republicans who are supposed to be the decent people protecting us from this shit are often just as guilty.

             Actual cannibalism/ cannibalism fetishism?   This seems way more than that painting.  My reaction to that painting was it seems like a metaphor people use, dog eat dog world, publish or perish, that sort of thing.  Didn't the President say his cabinet was going to be a great bunch of killers or something like that?  He meant in the business world.

             Cannibalism is sort of being included in the pizzagate conspiracy because the people we investigate keep making cannibalism jokes. Again, pizzagate is an investigation into how people represent themselves through their words, photos, and what they do.

            When you say "sort of," and this is completely ludicrous does that mean people don't actually believe this part?

            Because this painting seems like a joke.  It's like that joke about the panda who assaults the waiter?  Why he's asked.  I'm a panda.  A Panda, shoots and leaves.   LIke the three points you make are not projection, ........but actual cannibalism.  That is a projection, no?

            The point of the pedophilia was to have some kind of terrible act that can be used as blackmail. Cannibalism also falls into the category of 'terrible act' and probably helped with body disposal.
