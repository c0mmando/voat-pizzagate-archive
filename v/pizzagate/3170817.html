The Process Church of The Final Judgment: The Process, or in full, The Process Church of the Final Judgment, commonly known by non-members as the Process Church, was a religious group that flourished in the 1960s and 1970s, founded by the English couple Mary Anne and Robert DeGrimston (originally Robert Moor and Mary Anne MacLean). Originally headquartered in London it had developed as a splinter group from Scientology, so that they were declared &quot;suppressive persons&quot; by L. Ron Hubbard in December 1965. In 1966 the members of the group underwent a social implosion and moved to Xtul on Mexico\'s Yucatan peninsula, where they developed &quot;processean&quot; theology (which differs from, and is unrelated to process theology). They later established a base of operations in the United States in New Orleans. &quot;In June 1979, an unknown person or persons under the pseudonym R. C.

Christian is a play on words for Christian Rosenkreutz or &quot;Christian Rose Cross&quot; (R stands for Rose and C stands for Cross, Christian is the first name of the mythical founder of the Rosicrucians, therefore R.C. Christian is a play on words). R.C. Christian is mentioned in the first public document of the Rosicrucians dated 1614 and named Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis. The Rosicrucian Order also trained Helena Blavatsky through their Great White Brotherhood, Helena Blavatsky claimed that she was in contact with an &quot;Ascended Master&quot; named Koot Hoomi, this of course is a play on words for Ol\' Koot or Olcott, the surname of her coleague Col. Henry Olcott. Alice Bailey, a disciple of Helena Blavatsky also claimed to have gotten in contact when Bailey was 15, of course the figure of Col. Olcott was alleghorical by this time and still much revered amongst Rosicrucians. Helena Blavatsky co-founded the Theosophical society and Alice Bailey founded the Lucifer Trust publishing company later renamed Lucis Trust, headquartered in 866 United Nations Plaza.

            asks for I have read your report (as hard as it was) and find it quite interesting.  What I would like to know is how this figures into the Atlantean Child Murders?  John Lennon and Yoko aside I didn't see it.  Just would like to know why you think it does.  Am willing to listen to your point of view.  I had a huge interest in those murders for they completely fooled me.  Now that I have been woke up, still Very Interested.  Are there clues in those messages on the stones?

Currently, this submission doesn't really meet any of them. However, I will give you our 24 Hour Grace flair so you can edit this into a presentable post, in case you are human. To create a paragraph space, hit "enter" 2x, not just once.

             Take it as you will, I been watching this shit to long to have those ignorant of language to advise me on how to present shit. If you spent the time to even flick through the vid you would find a wealth of info, to bad you have not the capacity to connect. My advice, stay with  milk it digests a little easier :)
