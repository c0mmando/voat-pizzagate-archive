            Rosa Monckton, sister of Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton (born 1952), journalist, public speaker, and outspoken climate change sceptic, has an interesting bio herself. Is this why Epstein was targeting her daughter?
           </p>
           <p>
            "Rosa Lawson was Chief Executive of Asprey &amp; Garrard until in 2002 she became a non-executive chairman of Asprey London and Garrard &amp; Co.
In 2017, Monckton wrote a controversial piece for The Spectator arguing for learning-disabled people to be able to work for less pay than minimum wage, citing 1.3 million unemployed people of 1.4 million people with learning disabilities in the UK.[2][3] This article was criticised by members of the disability rights movement."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Rosa Lawson is a fundraiser and supports several charities relating to children and Down's syndrome. The charities include:
           </p>
           <p>
            The Acorns Children's Hospice for the care of life limited children in the heart of England
Downside Up a Down's syndrome charity in Russia
The Down's Syndrome Educational Trust based in Portsmouth, England which through research provides education, information and training to promote the development of children with Down's syndrome
Kids (charity), a disabled children's charity based in England. KIDS helps in developing and improving the lives of disabled children
The Bulgarian Abandoned Children's Trust, a British charity dedicated to helping disabled and disadvantaged children in Bulgaria and campaigning for an end to the use of institutional care
Team Domenica, a charity named after her daughter which supports young adults with learning disabilities to find employment[4]
Lawson was awarded a Member of the Order of British Empire in 2017 Birthday Honours List for voluntary and charitable services to People with Learning Disabilities and their Families in the UK and Abroad."
