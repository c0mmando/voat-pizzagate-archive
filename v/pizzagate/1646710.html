             While my affiliations do not go to either side of the fence in terms of politics, I stand on the side of what's true and what isn't true. Trump is going in and trying to "Drain the swamp" so to speak. But as Obi-Wan told Anakin Skywalker, "he's a politician and he's not to be trusted." I take that road. I
             <em>
              do
             </em>
             want to believe that he's really trying, and I do think that he is. However I'm not going to campaign for Donald Trump in the case that he becomes corrupted. I'll never vote and never have. He's not a God, he's a man, and men are so easily corrupted. And what I know is that you can't get into a mud puddle and soak it up without getting filthy. The media is completely corrupt and trying to paint a picture about Trump that is not true. In most countries, if you talk about the leader in the way they talk about Trump, you're usually tried for treason. People have no respect. He is waging a silent war against the corrupt. I believe NOTHING the MSM says about him. Yes he's over the top crazy, but seriously, you need someone who is extreme to deal with absolute psycho's. Batman, complete crazy guy who dresses in costume to beat the hell out of evil psycho's like the Joker. Donald Trump has turned himself into a symbol just as Bruce Wayne does with Batman. I say again though, people have no bloody respect. They only respect their low sense of morality. I'll give you an example. I was born in America. I am an American, but I am a human first, made in God's image. I have never saluted the flag or said the pledge because I was always taught that you only pledge your allegiance to the Creator; God. Having said that, I would never, ever, in a million years disrespect the flag. And when they say the pledge in a public place, I stand with my arms at my side out of respect, yet not pledging my life to it. Think about it like this. You have said the pledge of allegiance and Hillary became president of the united states and starts a war with Russia. You're then drafted into the Military to fight for the evil deeds of politicians (which is the what happens in most wars) that started the war just to fill their pockets. Standing on the side of political neutrality is the only win, even if they imprison you. Now you are letting God be the judge of the situation, and when the dust settles, you find out later how unjust and all the lies the war was based on. 
This is fitting so I'll use it. In Star Wars, the Republic was fighting a war against the Separatists who wanted Diplomatic immunity to break away from the trade system and Laws of the republic. (Sound familiar? Syria dropping the US Dollar like other countries we've gone to war with.) All the while, there is a single powerful politician pulling the strings of everyone. He's on both sides of the war just to throw everything in disarray so he can fulfill his ultimate goal, absolute power and the extermination of the Jedi and the political system, The Republic they uphold. Modern example, world war 2. Ford motor company was an american company that made cars, but they sold engines to the Nazi regime. When the war was won American Military went over and finished bombing all their war machines. Ford motor company sued the United States Military and won. Henry Ford was awarded the Nazi Cross Medal. Why do you think Hitler had a life size painting of Henry Ford in his office?
All the strings are pulled by a few to fulfill absolute power, just as Emperor Palpatine does in Star Wars. George Lucas knows about this stuff and he wrote it very subtly in the prequels.
Sorry to answer your question in such a round about way, but there was no easy answer for me. My hope is that he stands on the side of "chopping these psycho's down at the knees." I do want to see these people brought to justice in such a severe way. But from what I know, in the end, the outcome is the same according to biblical prophecy. Balance can only come through one person.

             Hopefully a lot, because from where I see it this was from out of left field.  Who knows what they had on those servers they thought was in not relative threat.  I'm sure there is so much going on many think they will never get busted and are hidden in the crowd so they just leave it out there like it ain't really an issue.

             This looks like a great intel op.   This could really help PR when the Clinker slams on the high ups for the first night.  FBI Press release... It was the Itallian Mob that faked it's death many years back.. They went clean investing in various benign things in the entertainment industry and with their Jewish mafia buddies they bought the media out, then they got some new cover and started trafficking kids.... not so hard to accept.  People will come out right after the news breaks OOOOWW I can't wait to see the Movies that come out of this!  It'll be great you'll see.

            Elites tend to go for more than just a typical spa hotel...
Surely you get some together and they will work out some high dollar entertainment to put in the mix as well.  Such an environment fosters pedos for sure.  Heck the YMCA fosters enough common sickos... this for sure is where elite sickos gather.
