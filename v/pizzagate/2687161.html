<p>&quot;&quot;Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It\'s important to note that all records of experiments on children were destroyed by CIA chief Richard Helms in 1973. Although many victims have come forward recounting their experiences as children in this program, a huge effort has been made by all the institutions involved to hide or destroy any evidence, for obvious reasons. The biggest being, the possibility of a massive class action suit on behalf of the estimated hundreds of thousands of survivors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So, where did that little girl go with her newborn brain? She would not have returned to her Grade Three class, or posed for a normal-looking school photo, and her school records would show an absence of many months. More than likely that brain-wiped child would have need 24/7 care in an institution. </p>
<p>Many children in these experiments ended up dead. Some, allegedly, went on to become \'mind controlled operatives\', \'sleeper agents\' and \'super soldiers.\' Chances are, things did not turn well for the anonymous girl in the photo, but we will probably never know.&quot;</p>
<p>Another child victim.</p>

<p>&quot;I have another photo which someone sent me, which I believe is of Dr. Josef Mengele, in 1949, taken at a notorious Quebec City mental hospital where Duplessis orphans were incarcerated, abused, tortured and even killed in heinous medical experiments. For several reasons, I think it\'s Mengele -- but people at the Montreal Holocaust Centre laughed and shrugged when I showed them the image. In the first place it\'s too small for clear identification.&quot;</p>
<p>On the left is supposedly Nazi monster Dr. Josef Mengele, the “Angel of Death” He is examining a child in this photo.</p>

<p>I summarized all the most important parts of Cathy Fox\'s blog.</p>
<p>&quot;None of this prepared people for the explosive testimony made on March 15, 1995, in Washington, D.C., before the President’s Committee on Radiation, however. In unpublicized sessions, New Orleans therapist Valerie Wolf introduced two of her patients who had uncovered memories of being part of extensive CIA brainwashing programs as young children (in one case, starting at age seven). Their brainwashing included torture, rape, electroshock, powerful drugs, hypnosis and death threats. According to their testimony, the CIA then induced amnesia to prevent their recalling these terrifying sessions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From what I have been able to discover so far, many American children, as well as children from Mexico and South America, were used over a period of about 40 years, starting around 1948. In fact, the program may still be going on. Doctors and agents who administered it wanted to obtain control over the minds of these children, ostensibly to create superagents who wouldn’t remember even what missions they carried out, because of hypnotically induced amnesia (which could be removed by their controllers and reinstalled at will).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;“Published articles in my files include descriptions of administration of 150 mcg of LSD to children age 5-10 years on a daily basis for days, weeks, months, and in a few cases even years. Neurosurgeons at Tulane, Yale, and Harvard did extensive research on brain electrode implants with intelligence funding, and combined brain implants with Large numbers of drugs including hallucinogens.”</p>
<p>This is important right here.</p>
<p>&quot;Children were trained as sex agents, for example, with the job of blackmailing prominent Americans — primarily politicians, businessmen and educators. A great deal of filming was done for this purpose. Eventually, people from the inner core of the CIA program filmed each other, and some of the centers where children were used as sex agents got out of control and turned into CIA-operated sex rings.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some children were considered expendable and simply murdered.&quot;</p>
<p>Both Andrew Goliszek and Cathy Fox give a very similar report of children being used as sex slaves in blackmail.</p>
<p>Jon Rappoport\'s own experience as an MKUltra survivor child who was used to compromise politicians by raping children.</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;“Between the years of 1957 and 1984 I became a pawn in a government scheme whose ultimate goal was mind control and to create the perfect spy. All through the use of chemicals, radiation, electroshock, hypnosis, drugs, isolation in tubs of water, sleep deprivation, brainwashing, and verbal, physical, emotional and sexual abuse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;“The next year, I was sent to a place in Maryland called Deep Creek Cabins to learn how to ‘sexually please men.’ Also, I was taught how to coerce them into talking about themselves. It was Richard Helms (Deputy Director of the CIA), Dr. Gottlieb, Captain George White and Morse Allen, who all planned on filming as many high government and agency officials and heads of academic institutions and foundations as possible…I was to become a regular little ‘spy’ for them, after that summer, eventually entrapping many unwitting men, including themselves, all with the use of a hidden camera. I was only nine when this kind of sexual humiliation began.”</p>
<p>Another picture of a child victim. From Carol Rutz, another MKUltra child survivor\'s blog. Once again I summarized the most important parts.</p>
<p><a href="http://my.dmci.net/">http://my.dmci.net/</a>~casey/slide0010_image048.gif</p>
<p>&quot;In my family pedophilia was passed down from generation to generation. I was a baby in diapers when my father first started to sexually abuse me.  It was at the age of two that my mind felt the need to create my first personality or alter, as I will refer to them, in order to handle the trauma from the continued abuse by him and other family members.  Creating an alter also creates an amnesiac barrier--totally separating these experiences    from my conscious recall. Emigrating from Europe and hidden behind Catholicism, my family also brought their occult practices.  Before my third birthday the trauma from a Satanic Ritual Cult initiation forced another alter to be created.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The nature of my memories include incest, ritual abuse and government experimentation.  How does one understand and talk about the horrors of growing up in an intergenerational cult let alone being drafted into service by our government as a child guinea pig?&quot;</p>
<p>The blog talks about multiple experiments where children were tortured, raped, drugged, or used as sex slaves.</p>

<p>I was going through Archer based on our Vanderbilt reveal, and they have some real red pilled stuff going on through this show. The CIA agent in the show, Slater, says all the terrorism and drug trafficking crimes the CIA did were only done as a distraction to coverup from the more horrific crimes done in MKUltra.</p>

<p>All the pictures of the victims. Look at these children and remember their faces. They were tortured in the most brutal ways possible. Many used as sex slaves to compromise politicians and other figures.</p>

Neurosurgeons at Tulane, Yale, and Harvard did extensive research on brain electrode implants with intelligence funding, and combined brain implants with Large numbers of drugs including hallucinogens.”
          </p>
          <p>
           This is important right here.

          <p>
           "Children were trained as sex agents, for example, with the job of blackmailing prominent Americans — primarily politicians, businessmen and educators. A great deal of filming was done for this purpose. Eventually, people from the inner core of the CIA program filmed each other, and some of the centers where children were used as sex agents got out of control and turned into CIA-operated sex rings."
          </p>
          <p>
           "Some children were considered expendable and simply murdered."
          </p>
          <p>
           Both Andrew Goliszek and Cathy Fox give a very similar report of children being used as sex slaves in blackmail.

           Jon Rappoport's own experience as an MKUltra survivor child who was used to compromise politicians by raping children.

           ""“Between the years of 1957 and 1984 I became a pawn in a government scheme whose ultimate goal was mind control and to create the perfect spy. All through the use of chemicals, radiation, electroshock, hypnosis, drugs, isolation in tubs of water, sleep deprivation, brainwashing, and verbal, physical, emotional and sexual abuse."
          </p>
          <p>
           "“The next year, I was sent to a place in Maryland called Deep Creek Cabins to learn how to ‘sexually please men.’ Also, I was taught how to coerce them into talking about themselves. It was Richard Helms (Deputy Director of the CIA), Dr. Gottlieb, Captain George White and Morse Allen, who all planned on filming as many high government and agency officials and heads of academic institutions and foundations as possible…I was to become a regular little ‘spy’ for them, after that summer, eventually entrapping many unwitting men, including themselves, all with the use of a hidden camera. I was only nine when this kind of sexual humiliation began.”

           Another picture of a child victim. From Carol Rutz, another MKUltra child survivor's blog. Once again I summarized the most important parts.

           "In my family pedophilia was passed down from generation to generation. I was a baby in diapers when my father first started to sexually abuse me.  It was at the age of two that my mind felt the need to create my first personality or alter, as I will refer to them, in order to handle the trauma from the continued abuse by him and other family members.  Creating an alter also creates an amnesiac barrier--totally separating these experiences    from my conscious recall. Emigrating from Europe and hidden behind Catholicism, my family also brought their occult practices.  Before my third birthday the trauma from a Satanic Ritual Cult initiation forced another alter to be created."
          </p>
          <p>
           "The nature of my memories include incest, ritual abuse and government experimentation.  How does one understand and talk about the horrors of growing up in an intergenerational cult let alone being drafted into service by our government as a child guinea pig?"
          </p>
          <p>
           The blog talks about multiple experiments where children were tortured, raped, drugged, or used as sex slaves.

           I was going through Archer based on our Vanderbilt reveal, and they have some real red pilled stuff going on through this show. The CIA agent in the show, Slater, says all the terrorism and drug trafficking crimes the CIA did were only done as a distraction to coverup from the more horrific crimes done in MKUltra.

           All the pictures of the victims. Look at these children and remember their faces. They were tortured in the most brutal ways possible. Many used as sex slaves to compromise politicians and other figures.

            Hi

             @gamepwn
            </a>
            , I'm sorry, but we require that every link in a submission has a description of its content. Please see rule 3:
           </p>
           <p>
            Rule 3: EACH link in your post must include a description of content and how the link relates to the post
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll give you the Grace flair, so that you'll have 24 hours to edit.
           </p>
           <p>
            We can give only two stickies at a time, but once we will have removed the Edit flair, I will flair the post 'Accuracy?', since there is no actual proof that Ellen Atkin really is the girl the photo shows as she claims (please also see my comment on your new thread).
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you!
           </p>
           <p>
            When doing posts about this subject, you might want to try to find out whether claims of alleged MK Ultra victims are legit - many certainly are, but we still need to check and verify the info people who claim to be MK Ultra survivors post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thank you. Please keep up the good work! :-)

                Thanks for editing, I will remove the 'Grace' flair, and flair 'Accuracy?', due to the doubtful claims of Ellen Atkin (as previously discussed).

            Cathy O'Brien makes these same claims in her book, Trance Formation of America. A victim of HRC, she apparently has the 'scar' to prove.
Let's not forget what the CIA did in 1951 to the small French town of Pont-Saint-Esprit.

            Where I see the savage abuse of a $70k Haitian hotdog being flown into satisfy the prurient desires of a politician [and mostly to facilitate his blackmail by his handlers] distorting and making of the natural soiled adult’s desire to spend some platonic time surrounded by innocent inheritors, is that this natural human desire has become twisted by the wielding of duplicitous power. You see a corollary in private business, with legitimate non-criminal leaders of corporations seeking out dominatrix abuse as a kind of self-punishing rite. There must be something about working in a necessarily evil and comprehensive duplicitous government system that so twists the soul as to reverse normal needs, even “normal” perversions. For this is not the wielding of power, so much as the twisting of truth, perverting of reality and the fanatic belief in lies.
           </p>
           <p>
            It might be instructive to compare such perverse use of children as carnal objects to the well-documented facts that murderous criminals of various racial types, the product of broken homes and of a juvenile justice system in which [according to a 2013 DOJ report] adult guards routinely rape juvenile inmates, that a healthy percentage, by my estimation being about two thirds, of our most violent and unreformed criminals, refuse to commit violence against children, let a man live who they would otherwise kill on the evidence that he is an active father and have their own punishment system for child rapists in prison. (www.jameslafond.com)
           </p>

            On this last point written by writer\blogger James Lafond (and fighter) case in point: today I read that convicted MSU PEDO--NASSAR--was probably instantly found out to be a CHOMO and prison justice was served. He was transferred to another Federal prison in OK. Unlike Weiner who's in Fed 'lite', NASSAR ain't coming out. He should have killed himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            How many Polanski's, Woody A's, Spielbergs, MKUltra Psy docs, Senators, Congressmen, Judges, Heads of NGOs, and so on, that either run or are involved in these "elite pedo" rings---would survive a day in say Rikers Island...or San Quentin? None of them. Even hardened criminals have more honor than these CHOMO's.

            last I look the False Memory Foundation web site is still up and running. Wouldn't it be nice to peal back the onion and find out where the funding comes from? How bout this for a headline..."Johns Hopkins University and former Chief of Psychiatry PAUL R. McHUGH, M.D, abetted and covered up CIA funded front: False Memory Foundation. It has been learned that the FMF purpose was to provide cover for the most horrific blackops programs rivaling NAZI Germany in scope and design...."

            I found  Psychological and torture experiments but not funding.  I did find this info on funding certain experiments.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. Robert Heath of Tulane University performed experiments on 42 patients with schizophrenia and prisoners in the Louisiana State Penitentiary. The experiments were funded by the U.S. Army. In the studies, he dosed them with LSD and bulbocapnine, and implanted electrodes into the septal area of the brain to stimulate[146] it and take electroencephalography (EEG) readings.[147][148]

             Funding source will be shrouded in a cloak. It could have been channeled through other agencies, NGOs, ect. But you can bet your ass you'll never see it anywhere in public domain. All of the blackops\off-the books "Business Lines" are cash business channeled through a nexus of off-shore accounts. The multi-billion dollar (a few aircraft carriers...maybe a Zumwalt, throw in a few dozen F-22's ($339M per jet)...The Company has banking fronts all over the damn place. The good news is that I feel a sea-change is in the works as more and more of the general population have had enough. We are slaves essentially.

            This is only the surface.  We don't know the origin of all the photos.  Make something black and white with 1930's medical devices and everyone freaks out.
           </p>

            I'm not denying that any of the allegations are not true, but random pictures out of context doesn't do it for me.

            Psychiatric, penal, criminally insane, retarded, special, etc. all were and still are, very unique clinical environments.  All were ripe for abuse until the last 20-30 years.  Yes, it still goes on by modern comms keeps it tamped down when compared to what used to happen...
           </p>
           <p>
            LOL - ""“The next year, I was sent to a place in Maryland called Deep Creek Cabins to learn how to ‘sexually please men.’ Also, I was taught how to coerce them into talking about themselves. It was Richard Helms (Deputy Director of the CIA), Dr. Gottlieb"
           </p>
           <p>
            I've stayed at Deep Creek.  Ironically, Sydney had a cigar business before he went into full retirement.

             Thing is, I trust the victims more than I trust you. Any day. I trust them over your word and other bullshit. The victim said she thought it was Mengele and heard people speaking german. These photo's do more to confirm Pizzagate then a random person online. Not to mention, if you are the alt of "DonkeyHole" you personally told me my YouTube page I ran for years before I was banned "was gay since it's fiction and fiction is for faggots" when I had a few thousand people following me and told the community I was going to redpill my fanbase and dropped a Pizzagate video that had 100,000 views.

             Which had my picture on it and show's I'm a guy. The whole "you're female, you're jew, you're black" bullshit is what's bringing the human race down and allowing monsters to run things from the shadows. Humanity is gullible. Nations can be compromised. Any nation on Earth including the Nazi's. Also, fake jews known as Zionists are the ones running things. The Jews of Jesus's time have been long since compromised and washed away. I know what kind of person you are. Trying to make new people see us as extremists and turn away from Pizzagate and you make me sick.

              Lmao I already debunked that, bitch. They never label Pizzagate antisemitic because it would evoke vague references people remember of jewish ritual murder that all our ancestors recorded yet we now consider a fiction. And no, not "Zionist Jews", the wider Jewish community covered up these crimes in every country.
             </p>
             <p>
              Conversely there's literally zero proof or contemporaneous recording of a Holocaust,  but we now consider it historical fact.

               No, I'm smart enough to admit I don't. I don't know everything. I didn't even realize how truly sick our world was until a year and a half ago. Mass child rape and people being broken into slaves was much darker then 9/11, CIA drug trafficking, false flags such as Vietnam's Gulf on Tonkin, or your average conspiracy theory. Much worse. However, I know enough to admit we don't know. You're not an elite insider and I'm not. We don't know. What I do know is not every jew is some evil piece of shit. I knew a Jewish girl in High School and she had a really good heart. All she wanted to do is help people and spoke about reforming the world. Every weekend she was at the Homeless shelter helping people out. Her family were good people. I don't think your average Jewish person is some evil person, despite what some do in the name of their religion. I know your average person just wants to get through their day, and find something that makes them want to get up in the morning and not want to die. I know your average person, not your elite, work hours and hours of slave work making slave wages so they can afford to function in a society that for all purposes wants to subjugate and manipulate them into a numb and sad existence. The more sad and numb you feel the more you want to buy stuff that makes you happy. Rather that be material items or drugs or whatever vice you have. I can agree for sure there's a war on white people, and I'm sick of my skin color being demonized to the point where we are seen as some kind of vile demons. The difference between us is I don't blame a whole group of people for this. Millions and millions of people. I blame rich elite assholes who got so much power through a broken system it got to their heads, and they see themselves as gods who can do whatever they please. They make the propaganda, the entertainment, the opposition, and bend laws and media at a whim. I know their are evil people in every race who for no reason torment and sadistically do the worst they can to their fellow man for sometimes no reason at all. You should direct your anger at the elite, at these scumbag inhuman monsters who do whatever they feel like. Say Pizzagate breaks out, and a revolution occurs, you would be okay seeing your average Jewish family being hung and tortured in the streets? Children? Babies? Even though their are people of different races and colors doing this evil shit?

            Great work.  Deeply sickening to think what these poor innocents suffered through.
