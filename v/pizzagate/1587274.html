            I disagree - there was a point in this discussion: You (unwittingly) confirmed everything I said and you gave me more clarity of how to win this cultural struggle.

            First of all, I am expressing my views with impunity, if you want a "Safe Space", go to the Huffington Post.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second, you argue constantly like the libtards (ad-hominems, strawmen arguments like "Do you think straight people are virtuous?", etc.).
           </p>
           <p>
            Third, the only way to ever learn anything about humans in general is to make generalizations. Sure there are exceptions, but those don't invalidate the generalizations if they are grounded in facts/statistics. In fact the "you must not generalize"-meme is a prime example of how the MSM wants to keep us stupid and ignorant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fourth, pizzagate proves (and our conversation confirms that in an impressive way) that facts are not enough and that we have to break the MSM conditioning to restore sanity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fifth, the whole attitude that some groups are beyond criticism is the basis of tyranny, again as exemplified by pizzagate, which is run by a group of "untouchables": Artists and art-collectors (must not criticize them, or you are a hillbilly), leftists (must not criticize them, or you are a Nazi) and homosexuals (must not criticize them, or you are a bigot - and gay yourself of course).
           </p>
           <p>
            I am so sick of this tyranny. And when you call me a hillbilly, a bigot, ignorant and gay (LOL), that confirms that I am on the right track.

            Those who hate the truth think that truth is hate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly I merely posted facts and you responded with ad-hominems (i.e. hate).
           </p>
           <p>
            It is a fact that most homosexuals have been abused as children.
It is a fact that gay acceptance has not made homosexuals happier.
It is a fact that pizzagate is squarely inside the homosexual subculture.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until my mid-20s I firmly believed in the liberal attitute towards gays, therefore you would have spared me of your gay accusations at that time.
After having lost my belief in the media and learning a little bit more about crime statistics, I learned the truth and became affected by "gayness" in your mind, which is hillarious when you put it this way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you realize that you have confirmed everything I said?
           </p>
           <p>
            Pizzagate is just one battle in the culture war: Reality (what you call "hillbilly attitude") vs. the MSM
           </p>
           <p>
            If/when we defeat the MSM, then the whole liberal house of cards will fall down and sanity will (hopefully) be restored.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that will be good for you too, because both murder and suicide was much lower before the 1960s for "queer" people.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please explain how that attitude is "hateful".

            Well, what about those queers that are perfectly innocent and behave exactly as per the Hollywood cliché?
           </p>
           <p>
            First, blaming others will not help or cure your own psychological problems in any way. Since the 1960's, society became much more accepting of homosexuals, yet the homosexuals kept murdering each other and commiting suicide - in fact it only got worse, the sexual serial killings started mainly in the 1970's and hardly existed before the sexual revolution, which proves pretty much that it is much more healthy to suppress perversions than to indulge in them (which is pretty much the opposite of what is teached in colleges today).
           </p>
           <p>
            Look, I didn't screw you up in your childhood, I am not responsible for repairing the damage, which may not even be possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            But what I know for sure is that for example alcoholics can only be "cured" when they accept that they have a problem and supress their urges. That will probably lead to a happier life for you than that of the average homosexual.

            Great observation. There's a lot of use of the word "uncle", especially with single mothers and their children. It always bothered me to hear the misuse of that word, and others, e.g., cousin. It's code even for the mainstream.

            Alrightee then! So we are left to scratch our heads in wonder. On some level I just think part of this crowd is just caught up in the whole gay liberation scene and not really a part of anything more than celebrating new found freedom .. but are they so focused on what they want that they really ignore EVERYTHING else?!!! Like the abrogation of rights of wee ones not old enough to give consent or say no? Nope, wouldn't let my kids do that. Would not. Hope something major comes out that will open up these people's eyes to the truth.

            Funny how I firmly believed the TV-image of them when I was younger and only changed my mind after reviewing crime statistics (about half of mass murderers are homosexual), murdered celebrities (Versace, Mooshammer, etc.), their constant culture-destroying remarks and pizzagate of course. In my opinion that is a very sick and twisted subculture and is hugely overrepresented in everything that is depraved and sick, including non-sexual things like drug abuse, suicide and murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now of course you can argue that research made me "ignorant" while TV spreads the only true wisdom, but I think most people have lost faith in mainstream TV a long time ago, so good luck with that narrative.

            Ive always thought that the whole neighborhood is somehow a private little community with little safe-houses and living quarters in surrounding houses, living in their own world doing their own things by their own really fucked up standards. Its like a little undercover pedo/cult base.

            Also note that JA talked about culture in the Pegasus facebook harassment incident.

             WTF?  My parents would NEVER have allowed me to dance on a table in a public restaurant.  Seriously stupid parenting.  And the owner of the restaurant (JA) thinks this behavior is acceptable?  Makes you wonder what other behavior is permissible in his restaurant.

            Most "gays" have been molested when they were young. (For example Milo, who is supposedly a "conservative" said he had his first experience with 14)
           </p>
           <p>
            Without pedos there would be no gays - or much less of them anyway. And they know it.

            Thank you for all your work. Everyone... I really mean that. However, all the citizen journalists are doing is making a circus out of the investigation. I realize you are trying to raise awareness...and you give me so much hope. A full investigation will require going in head first. Yes, putting yourself in danger. You need to be on the ground talking to people, and pulling up records. If you are going to this, go all in. You can not do it all online. That does not mean you go in and Periscope your meal at Comet Pizza (eye roll) They are watching your every move, and EVERYTHING you all type online. They are a step ahead of you. Detective work is not done on VOAT, and 4chan...and you do not broadcast the entire investigation online with YouTube vidoes. That is speculation, not evidence. You need evidence. Solid evidence. I just got done reading someones rant about Comet Pizza. He was attempting to get people to go in Comet Pizza and do something destructive. Seriously? That will accomplish nothing.  Look...this is deadly serious. People have died trying to expose child trafficking. You all know this...Go ahead and flame me for my comment, I don't really care. Pray this new administration has the courage and conviction to expose this. Because law enforcement does NOT. I have put enough time into this to declare it a full time job..aside from my other job. Peace.

            Right, the parents have no internet? Even if I thought it was genuinely debunked, I would at least question whether going there with my kids was a good idea just in case I was wrong, the fact they slowed them to dance on tables with that song playing? What the actual fuck? Now if the DJ was playing tool? Maybe, but still not at fucking CPP.
