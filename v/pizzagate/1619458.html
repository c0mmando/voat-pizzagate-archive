Second sentence in reads, &quot;Basinger will continue to be managed by Oren Segal at Media Talent Group.&quot;  Click what\'s hyperlinked and your stomach will turn when you read the first couple of movie titles.

<p>Is it just me or do these movies reference young people a little too much?</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5873916/?ref_=nm_flmg_prd_1">the IMDB page for the short #Horror (2016)</a> following the release it says Guam which is hyperlinked. Click on that link and it bring you to another page that says Guam again which is hyperlinked.  Click on that and you will see two movies listed as under \'Upcoming Releases for Guam\' </p>

<p>Continuing on:</p>
<p>The director and writer of the movie #Horror (2015) and executive producer/producer of the short #Horror (2016) is Tara Subkoff.<br />
Go to Tara Subkoff\'s wikipedia and you will see this under her personal life:</p>
<p>\'In the fall of 2014, Subkoff married artist Urs Fischer. Subkoff gave birth to a daughter, Grace, in May 2016.  In June 2016, it was reported that Subkoff and Fischer had filed for divorce.  Subkoff resides in Los Angeles, California\'.  
</p>
<p>Go to Urs Fischer\'s page on Artsy.  After going through all of his art and his auction results, you will see some repeated patterns.  You may find Artsy difficult to navigate at first.</p>
<p>I will not speculate any further for now.  Feel free to share, edit, and use this information for your own investigations and research.  Truly disgusting stuff.  I know there is more to be uncovered with this sick fuck Oren Segal on IMDB.  I only read through some of the articles in the news section.  Thank you for your time!</p>',

            Oren Segal is Facebook friends with Tyler Shields.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tyler Shields is the photographer famous for using human blood in his artwork. He has also become very popular very quickly with Hollywood. Rumours are that he used to deal drugs in gay bars and his photoshoots are a cover for drug deals. He has had exhibitions in America and Europe.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to interviews Tyler Shields has real human skeletons and other organs in his home. He has also been accused of being homosexual and using famous women as beards. Such as dating Abigail Breslin when she was 16 and he was 30. He's also been linked to Scientology.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a film called The Final Girl directed by Shields, starring Breslin, men can be seen wearing panda heads. The film is about a group of men who take young girls into the woods and chase them for sport. This kind of resembles the stories a young English girl talks about on Youtube who now lives in America.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tyler Sheilds is based in LA. He has been photographed with Zachary Quinto on their way to get pizza after Quinto's yoga class. Quinto used YogaWorks in LA. James Brown worked for YogaWorks in LA at this time. James Brown is Instagram friends with James Alefantis and has posted creepy, sexual child related images to his account. James Brown is also Twitter friends with Club Kids murderer Michael Alig.

             This shit is always in Blind Items for doing everything you just described above.

             Interesting about photoshoots being covers for drug deals. Terry Richardson too, you think? Every single person he's shot looks like theyre on meth.
