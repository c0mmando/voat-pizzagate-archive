             At this point I'm willing to believe that Trump witnessed it, maybe even participated in it so he didn't appear to be an enemy, and decided to do what it takes to take them down. Time may tell...

             Where have you been?  This has been beaten to death since Trump announced run.  It was also COVERED by FBI in Epstein investigation who cleared Trump after voluntary interview....which is why the fucking names are circled.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, Trump knew Epstein. He's a freaking billionaire real estate developer and media producer who lives in the same city as billionaire "who's who" guy.  Yes, Trump attended at least one Epstein party and...ate in the kitchen with the help.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, Epstein hung out at Mar Lago...until Trump threw him out for hitting on another members teenage daughter.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pizzagate has been full-on 24 hours a day for months.  Thousand of people...every day.  Before that, Democrats were (and still are) searching everywhere for dirt on Trump...haven't found More than "bubut Trump is a meanie".
            </p>
            <p>
             Just because a perv has your telephone number...or even all of your numbers doesn't mean you ever called him or talked to him at all.  It means...he has your number.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is not "new" info, it is old crap and you aren't going to convince anyone investigating Pizzagate that Trump is a major insider, secret pedophile who hung out with BFF Epstein but managed to trick millions of people who are just too stupid to know.  IF HE WAS A SECRET PEDO...HE'D BE A SHOE-IN FOR DEMOCRATS.  He wouldn't need to go through all this bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you
             <em>
              really
             </em>
             think no one has looked at this, you are a moron...and need to STFU until you have some perspective on how big this is.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you are shilling, you aren't very good at it.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is February, Donald Trump is the President and you need to get over it.  Go away.

            Here's some more research on Epstein. I talk about Nadia bjorlin who's mother says Epstein tried to recruit her from interlochen.

             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1587483
            </a>
            Here's and update on interlochen/ Nadia.....
 I was looking through the black book for the 50th time last week and found one of Nadia's brothers listed. I'd never noticed it before. 
Also I dead ended in interlochen. There's an interlochen house mentioned in the black book and an article about Epstein building cabins there. (See my prior post). Anyway there is no info on their website about the guest cabins that Epstein built. I called them and even though there are no pictures online, they do still rent both out and call them a different name obvi. I have the cabin names in my notes and will post them later. Also re: Epstein... Aline Weber is proof that he was traveling with underage girls....

             Epstein is a MOSSAD spook. The main objective of the game is to create and keep the blackmail network running. Trafficking these kids is secondary. If you look into Epsteins ties with Dyncorp and the scandal in Bosnia that followed you would notice that he was trained by the CIA in abduction runs. This is Israel's sick way of controlling our politicians.
