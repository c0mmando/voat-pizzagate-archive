<p>\'The horrors of Huddersfield are hard to hear. Another town tainted on a growing list of shame.</p>
<p>Another 15 children raped, abused and trafficked by yet another ruthless gang of 20 paedophiles, that were recently convicted.</p>
<p>Rotherham, Telford, Rochdale, Oxford, Newcastle, Aylesbury, Huddersfield - when, and where, will this all end?</p>
<p>Not soon that’s for sure in a land where vulnerable children are easy meat for evil gangs browbeating them into a fearful silence with terrifying threats.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Sammy Woodhouse, abused as a teenager in Rotherham, gave us her experienced verdict: “I don’t think we’ll ever be able to stop this. It’s an epidemic and the UK is a paedophile’s paradise.”</h1>
<p>And Sara Rowbotham, the sexual health worker who uncovered the Rochdale scandal, could offer no hope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The numbers in Huddersfield will be the tip of the iceberg,” she said.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>“I’m more worried about the towns and cities where there HAVEN’T been any court cases.</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“Because if they haven’t identified this crime in your town, then you are not looking hard enough.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h1></h1>
<p>I have investigated child sexual exploitation in the UK for the Sunday Mirror for almost three years, and each story I hear is more sickening than the last.</p>
<p><strong>The authorities want us to believe this is an historic problem</strong></p>
<p>That couldn’t be further from the truth. Just 15 miles from Huddersfield, in Bradford, the local council received a staggering 1,153 child sexual exploitation referrals in the year to April 2017.</p>
<p>Police there are in the midst of <strong>Operation Dalesway</strong> which has already seen 109 perpetrators seized. At least 70 more are likely to follow in coming months.</p>
<p>In Telford, a Sunday Mirror probe revealed up to 1,000 girls could have been attacked over four decades.</p>
<p>Abuse was also linked to five deaths. Police in the Shropshire town have launched a new investigation as a result of our findings and Telford and Wrekin council will soon hold a public inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>Yet on Saturday they refused to give us current victim numbers despite a freedom of information request.</strong></p>
<h1>In Rotherham, where Sammy was one of 1,500 girls targeted between 1997 and 2013, the police probe is so vast some victims could face a five-year wait for justice.</h1>
<p>Earlier this year, the National Crime Agency had to ask for 100 more officers after specially trained detectives had been able to contact less than a fifth of those abused.</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Sammy, 33, who now delivers seminars on child sexual exploitation across the UK, has been contacted by thousands of traumatised victims.</p>
<p>Yet she can’t see an end to the crisis.</p>
<h1>She said: “Government and agencies are out of their depth. It’s really sad to see just how many people have gone through what I have, but it’s rife all over the country.</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“We constantly hear lessons have been learned, but it keeps happening. How many professionals have been held to account, not just for turning a blind eye to this issue but for actually covering it up?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sara added most women exploited as children will never get justice because so few cases come to court.</strong></p>
<p>She said: “In Huddersfield, 15 victims might seem a lot but there will be so many others who can’t go through the judicial process.</p>
<p>“Some will have mental health issues or they may be addicted to substances. Others may still be involved with perpetrators.”</p>
<p>Both Sara and Sammy believe the only way to stem the flow of grooming gangs is to teach boys about consent and respect for women.</p>
<p>Sara said: “This is about how those men view these girls as having no value.”</p>
<h1>Maggie Oliver, the Rochdale detective who quit to speak openly about police failures and grooming, said: “Nothing will change unless public sector workers are held to account for failing these children.</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“If they knew they were going to lose their pension for failing kids, they would make sure they addressed this problem.”</p>

             How do u explain the pedo rings in parliament ...
I admit islam is a problem..just read the koran ..its a joka and a half that people who read that book ..arr even allowed to be taken seriously...a comedy of errors ...
But the error is being used to program a populace ..and the gang culture that exisst in any society is readymade in islamic societies especiallly in pakistan ...
If u understand that pakistan is an mi6 construct created by british agent and fteemason amjad ali khan for the british ...and the operations are carried out by aga khan ..whi i strongly believe is running these rings...
One also has to understand the mechanics of the debt currency system to know that we are physically funding these mongrels...
If we reduce debt at the teewsury it will be the begininng of the end of this system..we then dont have to delegate respinsibility to the govt ..we can under commonlaw and universal jurisdiction form military tribunals...and charge the culprtits...
People and institutions are run by the deep state to generate more debt currency and deposits for bank..
If u look at how aga khan launders his money via international bank networks..it is the bug banks who requite deposits from outusde that creates the pressure inside an econimy to run criminal rings that generate the paper cash required to shift and money launder depisots into the banking system
..if u kook at the bigger picture ..it is the banking debt system that is the force behind criminality ..and use of children as a commodity...a child can generate way.more money than a woman proatitute..
..banks were built off feeding opium to the chinese ....niw instead of feeding opium to the masses to generate bank deposits..they r feeding chilsren..for rape rings, organ trafficking and snuff child porn ..that generates huge amoints of cash in a short time..that provides short term liquidity to support the banks long term debt system...
            </p>
            <p>
             UN repirt on thr 2008 mortgage crisis points out that the entire financial system was propped up by laundered offshore funds providing liquidity to the troubled big banks...
            </p>
            <p>
             Any surprise that pakistan the mi6 opium state is also farming children ...

This forum is rigged and is a counter intelligence operation to stop the peagasus museum invrstigation...itnhas done its job of veering the crowd away from the kill room and thr cinnecticut avenue child logistic operation...any business that requires supply of high profit  value commodity for the elite  requires a logistic network from procurement , transport , distribution, resource allocation for rape rings , abuse and snuff movies and its retail , waste managemnt and disposal via high end restaurents and orgwn trafficking offering tender or dark child meat for cannibals..
At every stage , profits are extracted and maximised ...lime how one would set up a chicken supply network..

              Debt slavery is a very real issue, truthdemon -- the most widely perpetrated form of slavery in this world. It's not that we avoid it here, it's that our subverse has a limited focus on elite abuse of kids. You'd need to focus on evidence that pizzagate blackmail has been used to prevent the financial crisis banksters from being prosecuted, for example.

               Everyone is a voluntary debt slave..u r under statute law becasue one uses the banking system...it also givee licence to the one we delegatr authority and power to rape kids and get away with it..all becassue we r too lazy to understand  the bigger picture that we r all inside a game set up by the papal bull of dum diverrsas..of 1452...the basis if i ternational law..
..ur only silution to solving the continued rape and killing of children is to activate universal jurisdiction..by taking part in reducing debt at the treasury ..instead of increasing debt at the banking asystem 
This is why the elite laygh at us ..they have completely brainwashed us into us avoiding the use of our own piwer to activate universal jurisdiction ..with the power to control the US and its statutory powers and war powers...
Trump is just a figure head..we t the one in co trol..but lend it to the debt game and hence ha ve to be under its policy..
..
Sad that people cant even find half an hour to research the birth trust that is ur name and collateral tp the debt system...and tge remedy it offers...
Anyway this place does not offer the only solution...i am sorry to say u r wasting ur time  if u dont address activating universal jurisdiction...

             In plces like the third world it is out in the open...but people are so brainwashed they stick their heads in the sand...
Money laundering from child rape rings , kidnapping organ trafficking is rife and literally running the medical and film industry..
            </p>
            <p>
             ..there is no other way but to create a breakaway civilsation based in reducing debt at the treasury...
...and have the treasury directly hold all property and set off bills of the public..in return they will have to aknowledge our power of them , their statutues and i stitutions and agents that run them...
Its called universal jurisdiction...which only we can hold...
As trump reading from the teleprompter admits ..even the UN has no right to hold even near universal jurisdiction over the people of this planet ...only individials can hold it..not statutary institutions

             But we have to keep up the pressure - there are still not enough police investigators and CPS investigators dealing with the rape gangs.

             <strong>
              New child abuse cases 'not pursued' says MP for Huddersfield
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             West Yorkshire MP Barry Sheerman said new child abuse cases were not being taken on by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
            </p>
            <p>
             In the Commons he cited "senior police sources" as saying the CPS did not have the capacity to take on new cases.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr Sheerman is the Labour MP for Huddersfield where 20 members of a grooming gang who sexually abused vulnerable girls were recently convicted of more than 120 offences against 15 girls.
            </p>
            <p>
             "...So that men that they know have dreadful offences against children, these cases are not being pursued because the Crown Prosecution Service does not have the resources."
            </p>
            <p>
             Nick Smith, Labour MP for Blaenau Gwent, had earlier warned: "The CPS has lost more than 400 prosecutors due to cuts since 2010.

             <strong>
              'An MP has expressed concern the number of people receiving custodial sentences for child sexual abuse (CSA) has fallen despite such crimes continuing to happen on a "massive scale".
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Rotherham MP Sarah Champion (pictured) said fewer cases are being passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and police "cannot cope" with the volume of offences.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ms Champion said figures she obtained from the Ministry of Justice show the number of CSA offenders receiving a custodial sentence at crown court dropped 4.7% in 2017 - the first decline since 2013.'
