<p>Just a few random thoughts and restating important information:
--RW was a partner for a company named Amedues operating out of a building owned by Freeman Harding who works for Dyncorp in Qatar.<br />
--RW has experience in shipping. 
--I don\'t have face book, but could see some of the pictures and comments on RW\'s page, it seems he is gay.
--Felony conviction for arranging contact with a child months after starting his business.
--Can\'t find much on his business, but one link above suggests he earned $99,000 annually.  That\'s a lot for not much of a presence online, lack of a professional webpage, etc.  He also lives in an expensive area.  Current home and work address on sex offender registry are the same.<br />
--RW also had legal issues in 9/2015 for domestic violence and it appears he had a show cause hearing for noncompliance with probation in 1/2017.
--RW is from Michigan and went to UofM.  Seth Rich\'s girlfriend lives in Brighton, MI approximately 20 mins from UofM.</p>',

             So honored to be witness to so many creative/gifted investigative reports who actually give a shit about children's rights. Human traffickers are on the run because of your excellent detective work. Bravo, so far. Far from over. Been going on for centuries.
