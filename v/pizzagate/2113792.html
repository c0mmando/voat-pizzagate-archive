            Thanks for the kind reply, obvious your not a shill. The real gaters know each other just by the way they show respect for the case and to each other because we dont want anyone to ruin like people like yourself have put hundreds of hours into. 100s. This site is almost a year old can you imagine? Wow, i cant even fathom all the hours that people have put in..

            Im sorry your offended but none the less your theories should be kept for yourself buddy, thats how you think and its NOT fact its an educated guess, Thats what hypothesis means.. Cold hard facts ARE the keys of putting the puzzle together, thats when the picture of events can take place. These facts are real puzzle pieces that you can work with. A real  puzzle is not put together with theories, it put together with the pieces that are proven to work. This site was intended for facts not theories, just sayin. I do apologize for the insinuation that you dont love children, that was not intended to be. so sorry for my lapse. I can see where I hurt you. I have theories myself, we all do. This sight used to be nothing but facts LEADING us all in the direction of the truth. The truth has been found out, now people are taking action and looking to build this case with provable facts for court of law. A theory is painting  the picture BEFORE all the facts have been discoverd, its just NOT provable. Do you believe that your theory could be used by a lawyer in court? They would laugh , I'm sorry to be so blunt but this is serious business, they are trying to fatten the case so theres NO dispute. There are other areas you can post theories on. If you really do love children, which its impossible for me to know for sure thats why I'm saying this,, you would post your theories somwewhere else. You know I'm making sense dont you. This is NOT your fault and you have every right to help these kids but our feelings are going to get hurt when it comes to law because the law doesnt care how each of us feels when your standing before a jury and judge. If you cant prove it it doesnt count and it wastes everyones time and energy that they DONT HAVE. Please see my post about real pizzagate news, no theories. It could help you. Stay away from speculation interluded with facts because its hurting your vision, only makes real gaters cringe and they wont read your posts because of the theory and they will hate to see you coming. I'm talkin no love, these people stay as far away from theories as they can because real agents are trying to push the gaters into the " you cant believe a pizzagate theorist because its a conspiracy theory" Do you see how this is playing out Gilderoy?. Its concidered " clouding the waters, the issues" It also diminishes you in thier community, that means they will look down on you and then maybe even your good hard facts are over looked. Theories will not stand up in a court of law. Now, if you can prove your theory thats some really good work and post it here,  but keep unproved material  at home, thats what the real gaters are doing. They are not educating the public with theories. This site educates the public and gives leads for further investigation. do you have any leads? I'm trying to help you help these kids and we all need to be humble so we work together. Mistakes are in everyones back yard. If you are using your hypothesis to fullfill your investigation you are mistaken on how real detectives do thier work. And you say you use that as a mainframe. Crimes are not solved by mainframes.Thats called FRAMING! Have you ever heard of someone being framed? Well, thats what it is. In fact mainframes can PREVENT you from solving a crime because you want a certain out come, your mainframe. So live and learn and go on to help these kids.

            Can somebody corroborate a relationship between what the paths of the hurricanes are and where global pedo rings are known to be in Texas and Florida? The mars slave colony seems like a psyop, but if there's a direct correlation with the locations of the pedos and the hurricanes, then you might be on to something.

            There's no advantage to running a slave colony on Mars. The costs of running an operation far exceed the benefits. That's what we call disinformation, pushed by Mr. Steele.

            I do think for sure these hurricanes are manufactured. Don't know who is doing it or for what purpose yet, but hopefully we will find out.

            Its a theory! Its your theory. Police have all the theories in the world but where does it get them? It doesnt win in the courts. True pizzagaters are trying to get this investigated by the law. Hypothesis should not be here pizzagate cant count on it. COLD FACTS hold up in court. Some might say gives you away and the mods should do something but voat is not the same as it used to be. If you really loved children you would help the investigation. Thanks for your reply.

            For those people who want to investigate should learn how to first. There are many sites that will help you and then you can report what you are learning here to help others do it to. Mostly all want to help but they dont know how and its not their fault. Learn and post thats what the old investigaters did. There are NEW people that are reading this theory. What is the message this is sending to them? It sends that pizzagate really IS a theory because they are reading conspiracy ARTICLES on the big investigation site. Also they are showing thier friends these conspiracy articles. The opposition to pizzagate WANT these articles here. It backs up what mainstream media  is saying about pizzagate. This article is like putting a drop of watercolor in a glass of water, thats how poisonous it is. Im sure some of the old investigaters would have passed out if they saw this on the site and there were huge fights against the mods. Big battles. Remember that the opposition is PAID to keep a lid on this. The real investigaters are taking to the streets in protest because pizzagate didnt get an investigation. The media, what your reading right now on your computer, is suppressing, changing pizzagate info everyday. Archive.is and the wayback machine have all been hacked. The wikipizzagate is gone. They say oh the links are here but when you go inthere ALL the links are broken.

            I wish the mods wouldnt let these IDEAS in here. No offence to the poster because it is interesting but the fact of the matter is is this is a THEORY. This is SUPPOSED to be a fact site only, a fact site that exchanges whatever people have dug up. This THEORY article is only CONTRIBUTING to the conspiracy theory plight on pizzagate, this theory article chinks away at pizzagates truth!. Cant anyone see it? Its right here in our faces and noone cares!!!!!!!!! I think all the real investigaters are gone and gatewaypundit investigation has taken over. Articles like this were thrown out quicker that quick 6 mnonths ago. They wouldnt even been given a sniff from a real investigator.

            Though some people would think this is crazy the reality is the US already has the ability to manufacture and control natural disasters through HAARP so why wouldn't the Russians. I have always thought it was very strange that the US astronauts and Russian cosmonauts go to space together, live on a space station can allegedly see the planet earth but the leaders are at the same time amassing troops to kill each other in WW111. It seems ridiculous.
           </p>
           <p>
            And how does the President just give a call to the astronauts and say fly home tonight?
           </p>
           <p>
            Putin promised that if things did not change with the US he would personally expose the Satanic Pedophiles so maybe he is making good on that promise.

            NASA is a front agency. The secret space agency is what they have covered up.

             LOOK UP NEXRAD weatherwar101 on youtube. Clear as day that we have a global weather geoengineering program. This channel has been censored by not only the higher ups but people like alex jones and controlled oppositions. HARRP is the distraction, nextrad is the real weather manipulator and it's clear as day when you look at the ionsphere radar. Also, this post seems a little shillish.
