            BUTTER is the name of a Weinstein film....remember Tony Podesta's email about having "Lobster dipped in butter...?" We need to break down the connotations of "butter" ...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter_(2011_film)
           </p>
           <p>
            Read this PLOT...sounds like a total mind-fuck MKULTRA programming movie! WTF?
           </p>
           <p>
            The film takes place in and around Johnson County, Iowa. Destiny (Shahidi) is a ten year-old foster child in Iowa who gets placed with Ethan (Corddry) and Jill Emmet (Silverstone). While visiting the Iowa State Fair by herself, she wanders into the exhibit of the winning butter sculpture, a life-sized Last Supper, and skillfully finishes the Holy Grail cup, which impresses the sculpture's creator, Bob Pickler (Burrell).
           </p>
           <p>
            Bob had won the fair's butter-sculpture contest for the past 15 years straight; because of his dominance, he is asked to abstain from future competitions to give others a chance. Bob's wife Laura (Garner), overly competitive and socially ambitious, goes to the home of the competition's organizer to protest. Bob goes to a strip club and solicits stripper Brooke (Wilde) for sex in his minivan. Laura discovers them and T-bones the van with her SUV.
           </p>
           <p>
            Laura decides to enter the county's preliminary sculpture competition herself because of the social status that comes with winning. Destiny decides to enter as well, as does Brooke, who just wants to harass the Picklers because Bob owes her $600. Despite practice, Laura comes in second to Destiny.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Brooke appears at the Picklers' seeking her money, Bob's daughter Kaitlin (Greene) admits her and takes her up to her room. After talking a bit, Kaitlin challenges Brooke to a game of truth-or-dare which escalates to them having sex. Kaitlin is drawn to Brooke's alternative style and attitude; Brooke just wants the money (she ups the amount to $1200) and Kaitlin says she can get it. While this is going on, Kaitlin's stepmom Laura is hooking up with Boyd Bolton (Jackman), an old high-school boyfriend who is now a used-car salesman. She's seducing him to get him to falsely testify to county officials that Ethan paid him to help Destiny in the competition. Laura suggests a rematch at the state fair. Destiny agrees; everyone else is disgruntled.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brooke gets her money from infatuated Kaitlin, meets Destiny after school, and takes her to the mall to buy her a $1,200 set of chef's knives to help her in the rematch with Laura. When Destiny gets home, a social worker informs her that her biological mother has died.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the state fair, Laura carves a replica of John F. Kennedy's car immediately after his assassination complete with the president's blown-up skull and Jackie Kennedy and Clint Hill crawling onto the trunk; Destiny creates her biological mother holding her infant self in a rocking chair. That night before the judging, Boyd sneaks into the butter-sculpture room and defaces Destiny's sculpture with a blowtorch. Destiny, disappointed and expecting to lose now, encounters Laura in the restroom and offers the forgiveness of her handshake. Laura tells Destiny that winning the butter-sculpting contest means more to her than the little girl can comprehend. Laura feels she has little opportunity to distinguish herself otherwise, while Destiny has talent and her entire life to realize her own potential. Despite the damage, Destiny's sculpture wins. The sabotage of the piece is recognized as "higher art", as the judges believe the melted face lends the butter sculpture a greater depth. Destiny goes on to win in the state competition, where judges give a positive critique on her piece, deeming it an "angst-ridden exploration of post-natal abandonment." Upon her victory, Destiny assures Laura that the butter-carving contest is "not all that you have". Laura kneels down to Destiny and hugs her, understanding that she must move on to greater triumphs that are her own.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later, Destiny is officially adopted by the Emmets and Laura is running for Governor of Iowa, claiming that God appeared to her and advised her to run.

            So... sorry I'm late to this, but, have victims come forth that were underage? It's still sad if true that he's leveraging power like this and it is apparently well known in Hollywood. But, if he didn't violate/traffic minors or produce/consume CP, he's just an asshole... not a PG target.

             Do you realize the consequences if anyone underage or not came forward? I'd recommend them to leave town immediately. Many have done so.

            <p>
             I once tried to complain about not being paid proper wages on an acting gig. Everyone told me to immediately shut up as I was committing career suicide. Even though the situation violated CA State Labor Laws ALL MANAGERS in CA State Gov't (I only talked to the top levels) and ELECTED OFFICIALS whose duty it was to enforce the written labor law did nothing but thoroughly insult me.

              All of the reports I'm reading state that his recent movies have performed so shitty, that he's no longer the mega-untouchable Hollywood mogul he used to be. And that is why people are all coming out of the woodwork right now to take him down.

              Fair enough. It certainly seems like the recent news surrounding this is indicating a younger preference... his association with names we've already discussed here is beginning to put a new lens on this too. But, like you said... TBD.

            Oh, yeah! Only the NYT could turn this into a puff piece! Knew something was up! This was coming out, so the NYT was used to throw glitter over the LEWD, LASCIVIOUS, CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR!
           </p>
           <p>
            Ms. Bloom, who has been advising Mr. Weinstein over the last year on gender and power dynamics, called him “an old dinosaur learning new ways.” She said she had “explained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Yup, just an old dinosaur! Not a "SEXUAL PREDATOR". And "whatever his motives" ... excuse me, but are there "good" motives for humiliating, degrading, and demeaning someone that has absolutely no way to fight back? Didn't Bill Clinton exhibit this identical behavior? Remember Paul Jones? "Gee whatever Clinton's motivation for taking out his dick and telling Ms. Jones to kiss it ..." I mean, COME ON!!!!
           </p>
           <p>
            Doesn't this remind anyone of the judge who concluded that pedophile that raped a very young child was not trying to hurt the boy?
           </p>
           <p>
            Just sickening. SICKENING! And for every whore like JLaw, there are umpteen who turned this fat "dinosaur" down and saw their careers end the very next day.

             We all know what "massages" and "watching him naked" means.  Just like Epstein.  And BJC.  And all the rest.  Rich and powerful men with boners don't stop at a "massage".  That's what makes it out of the court room based on attorney negotiations.

              Absolutely. It's tantamount to a pedo saying to a little kid, "Come sit on my lap!" When the kid starts screaming, and other adults come running in, hey! The perv can say that the kid was ONLY sitting on his lap and got upset!

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               An investigation by The New York Times found previously undisclosed allegations against Mr. Weinstein stretching over nearly three decades, documented through interviews with current and former employees and film industry workers, as well as legal records, emails and internal documents from the businesses he has run, Miramax and the Weinstein Company.
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              THREE DECADES this has been going on?!!!! And the NYT didn't know about it? This is just laughable! What part am I supposed to believe here? It sounds so much like the Bill Cosby thing in terms of nobody knowing! Of course, they knew! Everybody knows everything about everyone!

             After this article came out online the increase in the very long lines "to meet" Harvey increased. Don't think he only "met" blonds. Some currently super powerful Black women were among "his proteges" as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             Working on a movie set (not in Hollywood) I overheard 2 well-established costumer directors talking about me behind my back. I had accepted an offer from an established A-lister to be mentored. Word travels fast in the entertainment industry despite my silence re my good fortune. While I actually really liked &amp; admired him, it was a professional rather than a sexual situation. The prof. insiders were lesbian and commented that they'd far, far rather see me being mentored by "G" who was a talented and considerate lover than by Harvey. Then they exchanged bizarre looks re his reputed S&amp;M kinks.

              Yuppers! Thanks for the article. UpVoat for you.
             </p>

              Makes so much sense. Some of these were a surprise; some not. I wondered why there are talentless whores in these films and now I know why. They're the only ones who'll play this sick game. What happened to the most talented person getting the part? It's as out of date as real journalism.

             This is absolutely absurd. Did you read that article?  All of it?Do you have any idea of how wrong you are?
            </p>
            <p>
             You are able to indulge in your outrage and call this SICKENING because the NY Times spent the time and money to report this.   And they did not stop at the initial case from 2015, but went deep to research and discover previous cases.   They put 5 people on this article and went all the way back to 1990.  They certainly did not do this to puff up Harvey Weinstein.
            </p>
            <p>
             What you describe as the NY Times being using to throw glitter is a quote from Weinstein's lawyer.  What did you think his lawyer would say?   Giving the subject of the story or their representative a chance to comment is a journalistic best practice.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's no way a reasonable person can think of this as a puff piece.
            </p>
            <p>
             Generally sexual harassment is a civil matter, not criminal.  It's only a criminal if a separate crime is committed during it, like the allegations that were investigated in 2015.

            So this explains JLaw's meteoric trajectory from relative unknown, hillbilly ingenue to Academy Award winner whose Golden Globe speech specifically thanked "Harvey, for killing whoever he had to kill to get me up here".

             Here's Jennifer Lawrence nominated for Best Actress in 2011 for Winter's Bone a movie Harvey Weinstein had nothing to do with.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rotten Tomatoes  94%
Critics Consensus: Bleak, haunting, and yet still somehow hopeful, Winter's Bone is writer-director Debra Granik's best work yet --
             <strong>
              and it boasts an incredible, starmaking performance from Jennifer Lawrence.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             "the way Lawrence captures a young woman's fear and resolve, often non-verbally, well ... this is a considerable talent well on her way to a great career."
            </p>
            <p>
             Lawrence was 18 when she acted in it and the whole movie rests on her shoulders.

              I'm familiar with the film. And to deny HW has played a part in her meteoric rise is naive. She wouldve been another one hit wonder. This town is full of them.there are far more talented actresses than she, whose work will never see the light of day

               You didn't claim he played a part, you claimed he explained it

               Your first claim is completely false and denies her both her considerable talent and how she connected with audiences.

               You now claim Harvey "played a part" in her meteoric rise.  This is still not supported by the facts.  Her highlights before she ever made a picture with the Weinstein company include
              </p>
              <p>
               Oscar nomination for best actress
Lead actress in Jodie Foster film (a director who knows a thing or two about acting)
An X-men movie
And a little thing called The Hunger Games that did $700 million worldwide.
Her meteoric rise had happened by the time Silver Linings Playbook came out.
She would still be a giant Hollywood Star if she didn't get that part.  The four Hunger games movies have grossed $3 billion and her other movies have grossed another 2.5.
              </p>
              <p>
               She didn't have to go meet Harvey or the director to get the part.  In fact, she auditioned over Skype from North Carolina where she was filming.
