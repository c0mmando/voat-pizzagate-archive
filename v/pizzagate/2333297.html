<p>Followiing up on SWORDFISH69 LADY GAGA LEAK: Rob Fusari Mentions Pizza and Strange Occurrence Before Lina Morgana Suicide (pizzagate)
submitted 2 months ago by quantokitty
RELEVANCE: Swordfish69 has alleged a massive child abuse ring operating within the music industry. This is one of the links and it concerns Lady Gaga, a person central to #pizzagate through her relationship with Maria Abramovic and Spirit Cooking</p>
<p>Okay, so first off, I\'ve been led to believe the official Swordfish leaks are not official. I don\'t know for certain that they\'re not, but even if they\'re bogus, they were posted, so I decided to follow up on the third one, the one about Lady Gaga and a talented young singer named Lina Morgana. This is the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://theyellowbrickroads.tumblr.com/post/74867421052/linamorganaincyberwunderland">http://theyellowbrickroads.tumblr.com/post/74867421052/linamorganaincyberwunderland</a></p>
<p>So the story in a nutshell is that Rob Fusari is a producer coaching a young talented singer named Lina Morgana. He introduced Lina to Stefani Germanotta (Lady Gaga) in 2007. Lina ended up committing suicide by jumping off the roof of a hotel during a coin convention. After the death, Stefani, took the name Lady Gaga (Rob came up with it and supposedly coached the hell out of her), and overnight Stefani stole Lina Morgana\'s identity. You can see if from a music video. I wanted to check out a video so I could see if it was true that Stefani actually stole, copied, absorbed Lina\'s identity and it\'s absolutely true. The blonde wig, the poses, the styling, everything was appropriated by the talentless auto-tuned faux singer. Here see for yourself. Here is the talented one, the original, Lina:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuCFwS_n7To">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuCFwS_n7To</a></p>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>I started looking through more videos and came upon one that blew my mind. The freaky part starts at 1:25.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zfOgda4xycYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zfOgda4xycYouTube</a></p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> Rob Fusari starts talking about how he and Lina ate some pizza. They left the pizza shop when a stranger came running up to them and said, &quot;God has sent me to tell you something.&quot; Rob waved him away, and &quot;shortly after&quot; Lina committed suicide. Rob says he regrets not listening because he would have liked to hear what God sent that man to say.</p>
<p>Okay, a totally creepy story. I have no idea how long &quot;shorty after&quot; is. A day? A week? That night? But is this part of the farce the Cannibal Elite put on? Do they expect people to play along with this performance? Or were they only playing mind games with Lina?</p>
<p>I thought I would post it. Again, this leak is not supposed to be from Swordfish, but I\'m finding this whole thing fascinating and if Swordfish has something even better, I CAN\'T WAIT!!!</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<p>Someone else on 4chan is linking this up with Phil Collins too which I am about to do a post about.</p>
