<p>The announcement comes after local prosecutors dropped charges in the death of a 3-year-old boy at the compound site. Taos County District Attorney Donald Gallegos said Friday his office would now seek grand jury indictments involving the death. Gallegos said seeking indictments would allow more time to gather evidence.</p>
<p>&quot;The defendants, Jany Leveille a Haitian national illegally in the United States, Siraj Ibn Wahhaj,  Hujrah Wahhaj,  Subhanah Wahhaj, and Lucas Morton, are charged in a criminal complaint that was filed earlier today in the U.S. District Court for the District of NM,&quot; the bureau said in a statement. </p>
<p>&quot;The criminal complaint charges Jany Leveille with being an alien unlawfully in possession of firearms and ammunition in the District of NM  .&quot;The criminal complaint charges the other four defendants with aiding and abetting Leveille in committing the offense, and with conspiring with Leveille to commit the offense.&quot;</p>
<p>District Judge Emilio Chavez dismissed charges against Lucas Morton, Subhannah Wahhaj and Hujrah Wahhaj, ruling that authorities violated the state’s “10-day rule.”</p>
<p>3 ‘EXTREMIST MUSLIM’ NEW MEXICO COMPOUND SUSPECTS RELEASED AFTER JUDGE DROPS ALL CHARGES</p>
<p>The five suspects were arrested after a raid following a monthslong inquiry into the disappearance of Abdul-ghani Wahhaj, 3. The boy, who had severe medical issues, disappeared from Georgia in December. The occupants of the compound were &quot;most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief,&quot; an official said at the time.</p>
<p>Taos County Sheriff\'s deputies discovered 11 children at the compound, who were taken into the custody of state child welfare workers. On Aug. 6, a child’s remains were found on the property.</p>
<p>Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was allegedly training children to commit school shootings, according to prosecutors, who later alleged that the juveniles were taught how to use firearms, as well as tactical techniques, in order to kill teachers, law enforcement and other institutions they found corrupt.</p>
<p>Health officials confirmed earlier this month that the discovered remains were positively identified as the 3-year-old\'s.</p>
<p>all five suspects without incident were arrested.</p>
<p>Leveille faces a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment and deportation upon completion of her sentence if convicted, according to the bureau.</p>
<p>If convicted of aiding and abetting Leveille, Leveille’s co-defendants could each face a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment. If convicted on the conspiracy charge, meanwhile, the five could each face a statutory penalty of five years\' imprisonment.</p>

            It seems to me that while the original police charges (which got dropped) were focusing on the more serious crime of brain-washing children to carry out school shootings, the new FBI firearms charges are comparatively minor, and effectively cover up a much larger crime. The original local police charges revolved around child abuse, and causing the death of a child.
           </p>
           <p>
            When children report they are being trained to carry out school shootings, and are being kept isolated in appalling conditions, that sounds an awful lot like MK-Ultra style brain washing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quite the opposite by the sound of it. The kids themselves reported they were being trained to carry out school shootings. The local police were going to charge them with child abuse, and with causing the death of a child. Notably, "training" (brain washing) children to carry out "spree killings" in schools, is very serious "child abuse". The Feds are now only charging them with firearms violations. The local cops focused on the substance of the very worst crime, a crime that would have caused massive blood shed across the USA. The FBI appear (judging by these reports) to be doing everything they can to ignore the worst crime, and focus on peripheral matters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fox News (to their credit) have hinted as much as they can about what is going on  (in my view). Note that the group was run by the son of an Imam who was part of the original 1993 Twin Towers bombing, that was a forerunner to 911. (Siraj Wahhaj is the son of one of the original conspirators, see article below). The twin towers bombing was an FBI organized "sting" operation, that apologists for the FBI claim "went wrong". It could very easily have ended up being 911 ten years before 911 was carried out. But here is the key point: The fact Wahhaj Senior was never prosecuted for that crime, indicates he was working for the FBI. Now his son has been running this MK-Ultra style operation turning out trained child spree killers. That's a very serious crime, yet the FBI are quietly focusing away from the brainwashed "Manchurian Candidate" kids and focusing instead on some firearms violations. Firearms violations that seemed so minor by comparison that local cops didn't even focus on those violations.
           </p>

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            *"Wahhaj’s family background was already controversial prior to his arrest.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to his father reportedly being named by prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 bombing, the elder Wahhaj, who heads Masjid At-Taqwa mosque, was a character witness in the trial for Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the notorious “blind sheikh” who was convicted in 1995 of plotting terror attacks in the U.S."*
           </p>
           <p>
            UK papers reported that the "Blind Sheik" who these conspirators have a connection with, worked for MI5. No surprise that America's equivalent works for the FBI. This child camp sounds a lot like MK-Ultra, and that has US Military Intelligence written all over it. I hope I'm wrong, but the brainwashed child assassins element of this case may be quietly "forgotten". Here we have kids being trained to carry out school shootings. An FBI/CIA specialty. (more on that below, I know I can't throw that out there without information to back that claim up) One wonders if the local cops stumbled on a Federal operation, rather than a bunch of standard Jihadists.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lets compare this to recent events in Florida. Some may recall about a year ago now the Florida airport shooting. In that case a man turned himself into the FBI in Alaska asking for their help, saying the CIA was forcing him to watch ISIS videos. Naturally the FBI took him into custody and then passed him onto local police. The guy was psychiatrically assessed, and then released, being totally ignored, yet declared entirely sane. Think about what that means. The cops shrink didn't think he was delusional. He was simply released. Presumably under orders from higher up. A couple of weeks later, he stars in the Florida airport spree killing. This is just one recent event that hints at "mind controlled" killers.
           </p>
           <p>
            An entire book has been written pointing out similar cases with regard to the now forgotten "Serial Killer" phenomenon - Programmed to Kill : The Politics of Serial Murder, by David McGowan. Its a superb book, covering a difficult topic without gore, and with great black humour. Now we have spree killers rather than serial killers, as if at  a high level there has been a change in policy on how to keep the public in "shock and awe" by these "lone nuts". (Who are anything but that when one looks at the details of such cases, particularly as exposed in court.) If you want to understand what is going on in this case, David McGowan's book, and a subsequent follow up book "Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon", really nail what is going on.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those who are unconvinced that this looks like a potential MK-Ultra style brain washing camp for kids. Consider that a key player running it appears to be an inter-generational FBI informant, if not an outright employee. Compare this with what went on over the Alfred P Murrah Bombing with Tim McVeigh. In that case, years after the event, it was revealed that Tim McVeigh had never left the military, but was working under-cover to infiltrate and discredit the then new and growing Militia movement. His medical records showed every week for a year in his final year in the military he visited the "Dentist", and he was still working for Military Intelligence when the bombing was carried out. There is a superb interview done by Alex Jones where he interviews two documentary makers who made a very good documentary exposing that part of the background to the bombing. It appears that McVeigh was a "real life Jason Bourne". A guy programmed to carry out the role he did.

            So here we have a group of kids living isolated in such brutal conditions that one of them died. Kids under the tutelage of an inter-generational FBI "Jihadi" who is connected with a prominent MI5 run "Jihadi" over in the UK. The kids tell the cops they are in training to carry out school shootings, and local cops prosecute on that basis. Then the FBI take over, the local charges are dropped, and the only thing mentioned is breaches of firearms law.
           </p>
           <p>
            In my view, its a very obvious deep state mind control program turning out young spree killers. The local cops busted this operation without the Federal government being able to stop them in time. However now the FBI is moving in to cover things up. I hope I'm wrong, but that is how it looks from the limited information to hand. I also doubt that the deep state will want to lose its investment in those kids. I dare say many of them will continue in the "care" of the state, and may yet be used for similar purposes.
           </p>
           <p>
            The effects of these state organized spree killings on society are very serious. They give the impression that people can just randomly become a lone nut spree killer, and of course are useful in changing legislation and disarming the populace. (Ultimately rendering them defenseless).
           </p>
           <p>
            Individually, cases like this can be written off as "the government mishandled this", or "they didn't want to paint devout Muslims in a bad light" and so didn't pursue the very serious charges of training children to be spree killers. But when one sees a pattern of behaviour in related cases, it becomes obvious each case is not "incompetence" or the state being "politically correct. David McGowan's book documents from the public record, case after case where mass killers are continually released when caught, apparently to continue their mission. Case after case where FBI "Profilers" pronounce people "lone nuts" when they obviously were working with a large organized group.
           </p>
           <p>
            So as an isolated case, yes, we could write this off to incompetence. However, I hope the books mentioned above, and links given above, and connections between those running the camp and the FBI, will highlight to people that this story is much bigger than it might initially appear to most readers.

            The FBI theoretically could use the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Kidnapping_Act">
             Federal Kidnapping Act
            </a>
            (Lindbergh Law) to pursue charges of kidnapping across state lines since the boy was supposedly kidnapped in Georgia.  But they're not.

             Perhaps that is a key point in this. They are attempting to avoid the satanic type activities by only focusing on the one child's death. That is the only fact they can't avoid. There is a body. But heaven forbid it be addressed that if questioned, the words of all of these children could confirm ritual sacrifice.

              Yes, and eventually even the death will likely be ruled as unintended and wrist slaps handed out.

            I knew something was amiss when the prosecution didn't meet a simpleton deadline. Feds took it and are hopefully going to buttfuck them...but in reality they'll probably get more funding and munitions from the FBI fucktards.

             Looks like they didn't meet the simpleton deadline for the purpose of handing it over to the feds. Probs because this the fed's mess in the first place so they need to handle it in-house.

             The five suspects were arrested after a raid following a monthslong inquiry into the disappearance of Abdul-ghani Wahhaj, 3. The boy, who had severe medical issues, disappeared from Georgia in December. The occupants of the compound were "most likely heavily armed and considered extremist of the Muslim belief," an official said at the time.

            How was it discovered that the three year old child had disappeared? The info is that the child had "severe health issues."  Did some doctors report the family to CPS or something?

             The boy was kidnapped from the ex-wife's custody, she reported it to police and fingered the father. There were warrants issued. I think the boy was taken from a hospital or daycare, not really sure. It's kidnapping and aggravated 1st degree murder, the father knew the boy would die without care. The five adults were accomplices at the "ritual" when the boy died, so NM should have charged the five with at least manslaughter, or more depending on how much they knew of the boy's condition. Murder isn't a federal crime though, so the feds are prosecuting the federal weapons &amp; conspiracy charges to keep them off the street.

              In my opinion that area is controlled.  The ignoring of the date to charge those criminals is way to obvious.  Some are trying to hide everything that really went on there.  Where have those children been sent?  In the articles past, there was so much interest in those kids, now we hear nothing.  As usual the public is left out of the loop.  This is so frustrating.  Remember who has a place in NM.  Jeffrey Epstein.  Suzanna Martinez the Gov. and Bill Richardson are all involved in the trafficking of children.  We have had info on them before here, although a while ago.  I don't think we are going to find out the real story here as usual.  There are always loose ends. The feds may be trying to do what they have the power to do, but they also should try to find what is really going on in that area.  There is much to dig into.

               Dropping the ball on an important high profile case seems to be suspect. Why did they really miss the deadline to charge? Was there FBI agents putting pressure on NM prosecutors? Who ordered this gun charge arrest? Did someone at DOJ ask for it? Was the FBI hoping they would find a connection to a terrorist instead of just closing the camp? How many other camps like this one does the FBI know of, but are not taking action on? Why were weapons found at the compound after the arrests (if police left the guns it was super sloppy, and if they were delivered after the arrest, who delivered them?)
              </p>
              <p>
               When there's multiple odd things going on it's no longer a coincidence, it's a pattern. It's just statistics, if the FBI have a %50 chance of screwing up on reported terrorist camps, and the police have a %10 chance of leaving all the evidence behind, and the prosecutor has a %10 chance of going on a bender for more than a week straight... then there's only a %0.5 chance of all of that happening at once. They can't reasonably say that incompetence is the cause of the poor handling of this.

                These are all questions I have been asking as well.  There are never any answers only speculation as usual.  I too believe it seems like incompetence, but it was on purpose.  I will try to find my post on this there were many things found.

             I think the woman Jeny wrote it down in a book.  A record of sorts.  Also the children must have spoken up as well.  They also told that they were being taught to shoot up schools.  So evidently they thought it was wrong or they would not have offered it.  Duh at least they had the sense to know.  Seems like the FBI took a long time to figure that one out.

            The sentences they would receive if found guilty are way too low.  First of all anyone teaching children to shoot up schools and teachers and LE should never get out of jail.  But that probably won't fly so how about 30 years.  If he is guilty of killing that little boy who was his son, well life with no parole.  The sentencing has to get tougher.  Way too lenient.  I am wondering if they were being trained for False Flag Ops.

              I know. I can’t believe they released it. It seemed they were trying to side it at first. The FBI dragged their feet. Looks like someone is on the ball ginally. This is a heck of a case. We must keep an eye on this. They must bring charges for the death of that poor little boy. My question has always been where did he get the money.

               His dad was one of the original bombing masterminds of the World Trade Center. They used a van in the basement and blew it up. I’m sure he was getting money from one of the N.Y. imams like his dad was.

                I can't believe the FBI was not on this right from the start.  Knowing who his father was, there is so much wrong with this. Could be his father was the one gave him the money.  This stinks.

                 I’m not sure what to think at this point but that they were popped early. They may have been watching them to see all these involved. I find it funny that the prosecutors failed and released them, only to have the fbi swoop up and arrest them again...

                  and I were researching that entire area and we believe NM has many controlled areas.  I believe that LE is heavily involved.  Remember Jeffrey Epstein owns property there.  Also there are reports by teens in the juvenile home that they were abused.  The Prosecution dropped the ball just by missing the date. Really. Possibly FBI was watching to see if they did their job.  So now they are left to pick up the pieces possibly.  I hope they are not being too hard on those kids, they are with social workers.

                   I didn’t know JE had property there, but do know about the construction business which has all sorts of property along the border which came up in Q posts. Probably related.

                   Also remember Renegade on 4ch releases the details about all the orphanages in Texas being a part of it...so it’s not just NM.

                    I am sorry I was lazy!  LE means Law Enforcement.  I too at one time wondered what it was and had to ask!  I believe there are rat lines running through those areas that facilitate their human trafficking and all their other crimes.  Arizona is extremely important in all of this and McCain also played a big part in it.  I believe that something big was about to come out about him and that is why he is gone.  The mayor of Tuscon, his last name is Rothschild.  That should tell us something.  Bronfmans are heavily involved since they took over the Purple Gang decades ago.  The Bronfmans pretty much own Canada.  It all connects.  Yes, the Mafia and CIA I believe are in control of NM and in Texas, well the Bushes control all of that surely.

              I know.  It is heartbreaking.  I worked with children years ago and could never think about killing a child.  These people killed their own.  Every child is precious.  They all come here for a reason.  To be killed is not one of them.  Stiff sentence.  Very stiff. No parole.

            Notice that previously dropped child abuse charges other than those directly surrounding the death of the 3-year-old are not being readdressed.  The feds are only looking at firearm violations and conspiracy to commit firearm violations--nothing about the kids.

               I sure as hell wouldn't. All of this coverage, cnn, abc, nbc, and other alphabet news actually reporting and asking (some) questions, yet still nada about this Lucas Morton. Seems like a key figure in this case to me.

                Likely FBI running the child terrorist false flag prep and surprised in local arrest, imo.  He's supposed to be Muslim?  Is that not a gym towel on his head?

             It's because they were charged with child abuse crimes but the prosecution failed to present the charges within 10 days at their preliminary hearing.  I don't know why the prosecutors missed something so obvious, and I also don't know if those charges can be levied against the suspects again.

             I believe the FBI is arresting them on anything that can't be legally challenged at the moment while they figure out what to do about the other charges.  There will be plenty of time to bring up the child death as the case moves forward; I can only hope it doesn't get swept under the rug somehow.

               I do legal work for the State of Michigan and there isn't an elected prosecutor in the world who misses the ten-day deadline in a child protection case.  There isn't an elected prosecutor in the world who would want that on his/her record and announced to the public.

               There is far more to this than we're hearing, and enough that this prosecutor put his livelihood on the line for it, I'm betting.

              So what turned out to happen is that prosecutors announced today they're seeking a grand jury indictment on the death only.  No mention of a grand jury for the child abuse charges, even though it would be legally possible to do that.

             What do you suppose the reason is for not addressing the children?  I would think that is an important factor.  The children are with social services and I remember looking them up in that area and there have been complaints made by juveniles regarding abuse.  This is worrisome.

              See my comment to Samsquamch.  I think they're not readdressing the child abuse charges because they believe the charges don't warrant the convening of a grand jury, which is apparently the route that would need to be taken.  I hope the reason is not more nefarious than that, but it certainly could be, what with the feds filling in tunnels right away, etc.

               Wonder what else was going on there that they don't want to charge for the death of a child.  Very interesting and quite scary as well.  This case has been strange from the very start.  Nothing ever is told to straighten the info out that we have received. It only confuses more.
