unfortunately war is not only an means to an end, but taken what smedley butler sad : it is a ( highly profitable ) bloody racket !**

            watch "checkmate to humanity" comes in various languages so is easy to pass around, this is important as we have a global crisis which
           </p>
           <p>
            needs global cooperation of people NOT corrupt politicians or taxempt "charities" to be emilorated.

           <p>
            as more and more countries show signs of willfully implemented lawlessness a fix in a trial is not to be expected at the moment.
           </p>
           <p>
            see the treatment of bbc scandal in britain or the x file witnesses in belgium .. the fix needs to be more encompassing, as there are too many

            How to save the World

Oct 14, 2017 All well and good but I think you make some assumptions that confuse the issue. You, “many people in our world believe in Globalism”. This is not exact. People believe in world peace through cooperation. Globalism is not defined. I believe in VOLUNTARY cooperation and VOLUNTARY technocracy. The problem is the use of force to make people ACCEPT a New World Order. This force has details like police state government, economics, and social conditioning. Secrecy is the primary enabler of evil. Using engineering principals to propose new ways to cooperate is good as long as it’s VOLUNTARY. Ending secrecy with the true revealing light of disclosure is humanities first priority in achieving world peace.
           </p>
           <p>
            And in FelatedNews™ We have a global crisis and need a global solution &gt; feel free to translate etc. The most important countries should be clear. Here is a good method how to spread info nice n sleazy :-DD . https:/ /www.reddit.com/r/New_American_System/comments/66xwk4/ideas_that_can_help_you_spread_the_message_for_a/
“ For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy .. . It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations”
           </p>
           <p>
            The following points are a common denominator for enough people i believe, that it could work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Above all the other points, i think the most important was stated by Smedly Butler:
           </p>
           <p>
            To Hell With War! (and its industry one should add)
           </p>
           <p>
            After that
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Global debt cancellation between all countries, debts to non state creditors (private, corporate etc.) need to be cancelled as well.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            :: IF ALL COUNTRIES ARE BROKE; WHO OWNS THE DEBT ?? :-DD ::
           </p>
           <p>
            Debts, and property rights, between companies and persons stay untouched, so basically not too many will loose anything or have a reason to feel cheated.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             25% flat tax on consumption.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            That money, if spend on usefull purposes , should suffice for all infrastructure, payment of vital jobs like nurses, police
           </p>
           <p>
            (here a sidenote is warranted: military and secret services should be organized like special police forces and NOT vice versa!)
           </p>
           <p>
            etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            This solves the problem of taxation on automation and robots, too.
           </p>
           <p>
            And practically eradicates tax evasion.
           </p>
           <p>
            No one (no company, institution, religious entity or”charity” ;-) shall be taxempt.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Politicians shall openly declare income
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Income in excess of state or federal payment shall be subtracted from it, basically eradicating most incentive for corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            4.Religion should be a private matter
           </p>
           <p>
            This doesnt infringe on religious freedom but societies should be secular in its instituions.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Medicine and medical care
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Just look at this, to see how crazy things are right now: reserve antibiotics in animal farming
           </p>
           <p>
            Food shall be medicine and vice versa as in Ayurveda. People should be encouraged to produce and consume healthy food.
           </p>
           <p>
            Various easy to grow plants have high nutritious value e.g.
           </p>
           <p>
            Doctors and nurses etc should be paid (via public salary or private insurance) as long the patients are healthy (Ancient China) and treat them, if need be, for free.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the incentive to enter the medical professions (decent pay like for other vital jobs ,police etc. granted) wouldnt be to enrich oneself, but to actually help people and the focus would be automatically on preventive medicine.
           </p>
           <p>
            The current system of poisoning the planet as well as the people AND sell the “cures” is disgusting.
           </p>
           <p>
            (For example the scientists Tyrone Hayes and Arpad Pusztai were villified, and did nothing wrong one may add ;-)
           </p>
           <p>
            So Pharma and Agrochemical companies should be strictly monitored.
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             Law
            </li>
           </ol>

            7.Banking
           </p>
           <p>
            Apart from the obvious problems of the current system , fiat money, fractional reserve baking etc., the compund interest system seems to be problematic sui generis, so a modified “halal” banking might not be such a bad idea.

             grantdrights........"IF ALL COUNTRIES ARE BROKE; WHO OWNS THE DEBT ?? " The banks......they are corrupt. World wide debt jubilee is the only answer. Used to be standard practice every 7 years. ..until Rome. All 3 major religions believe in it. Have read about it in the bible . old testament.........It was discussed seriously. Muslims do not believe in charging interest....early on when the church broke away from catholicism.....Martin Luther did not want interest charged.Father of methodists. Father of baptists , forgot his name, but more fundamental, did want interest charged. Churches perpetuate the crimes of high finance.

           <p>
            Were Stormy Daniels, James Alefantis, Eric Schneiderman, and Anthony Weiner there at the Nxivm recruitment party mixer in Connecticut in 2007? Subject answered, "Yes".
           </p>
           <p>
            Were you aware that snuff videos were broadcast at the Nxivm recruitment party mixer in Connecticut in 2007? Subject answered, "Yes".
           </p>
           <p>
            Were you informed at the Nxivm recruitment part mixer in Connecticut in 2007 that the real Nxivm parties were held upon occasion at the private island of Richard Branson? Subject answered, "Yes".
