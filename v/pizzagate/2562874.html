             Unfortunately Carmencita up and down the UK he is known as the biggest racist there is. 10 years ago I didn’t understand why. Until Pizzagate. It is sad they foreseen it and destroyed his credibility. I am worrying GREATLY for his life left alone in a prison full of Muslim pedos he probably helped lock up.

              That's too bad he is such a racist  This sometimes clouds people's visions and can have a bad effect on their outcomes.  I can understand how people can get that way with what is going on, but in the long run it does not help.  Yes, it still is totally unfair how they are trying to silence him and it may just create a Hornet's Nest for May &amp; Co.

               I don’t think he is a racist. I stupidly believed what I had read in MSM. Only when Pizzagate broke did I understand how he has been branded that!

             This is a tough one for me,
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/carmencita">
              @carmencita
             </a>
             .  Let me explain.  Stephen Christopher Lennon now known as Tommy Robinson is a far right activist who co-founded and served as spokesman and leader of the English Defence League, an extremist far right group widely known for violence and racism and it is fact that during his time as their figurehead Robinson was indeed a confirmed racist and thug.  So on the one hand, it can safely be said that  Robinson is no saint.  However, More recently, Mr Lennon/Robinson has resigned from the EDL and states himself as disassociated from far right extremist group membership and instead, has taken up the mantle of ‘journalist’ focussing on exposing the ever increasing Muslim paedophile grooming gang scandal in the U.K.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is true that excepting of a brief mention on the sentencing of a few token convictions, the lack of mainstream news coverage of the Muslim grooming scandal is an outrage in itself.  No consideration to the increasing frequency of such court cases or more so, the increasing geographical areas of occurrence.  As a result, there are many who are still of the erroneous opinion that it is a ‘Rochdale/Rotherham’ ongoing (lower socio economic) problem. Because of lack of coverage, few are aware of the cases occurring in the more middle class areas such as Oxford, for example.  More importantly,  handcuffed by ‘political correctness’, we are prevented from outwardly speaking about the facts that the perpetrators are for the most part older Muslim men of Pakistani origin,  and the victims for the most part, very young white girls.
            </p>
            <p>
             Personally, I despised the EDL as I do any form of far right extremism or the use of violence as a tool of expression and as such, I deeply disliked Robinson as its figurehead.  However, of late, I have indeed found myself giving airtime to Robinson purely because of my involvement in the campaign against child sexual exploitation along with the rest of us here, and his was one of the few voices raising awareness about the problem in the U.K.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, It has to be asked, and indeed it often is, whether Robinson’s cause is truly about raising awareness of the most heinous of crimes against our children? or simply another vehicle for his anti-Muslim views?  And although there is no escaping the sad but obvious fact that in the U.K. the two contexts are intertwined, the question of Robinson’s true motivation remains, and this, together with the fact that Robinson’s rallies and speeches are largely still attended and supported by the EDL and other far right group membership and racist thugs that often descend into the same violent racist scuffles presents a moral dilemma for those of us who dearly want to support one cause over and above the other.
            </p>
            <p>
             Motivational dilemmas aside however, Robinson’s arrest is without question a direct attack upon the freedom of speech in the U.K.  That he was arrested, brought to court and returned to prison for alleged breach of Licence within the space of four hours is largely unheard of here, and combined with the media gag on his arrest represents a clear demonstration of the State’s intention to silence him; and is of course, an outrage against which we should all loudly and vociferously protest.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a march to Downing Street today to protest his arrest and (Downing Street is within reasonable walking distance for me) but that same dilemma remains; whilst I would dearly love to attend and offer my support against Robinson’s injustice and the obvious attack upon our freedom of speech, I, remain, like many others I suspect, hesitant for fear of association with far right extremists or involvement with the potentially violent outcomes.  Nevertheless, I do pray for Tommy Robinson’s safety in prison and will instead find other means of expressing my disgust and outrage against his incarceration, and the blatant censorship surrounding the Muslim Grooming Scandal.  If Tommy Robinson wants to be a voice and properly garner the merited support for this cause, he must more strongly disassociate himself from racism and racists support groups, period.  I will be among the first to align myself.

               .  Katie Hopkins is a pos whose fairly uniformly despised in the U.K. And as for TR I’m glad I made the right decision not to join the protests as it degenerated into a mess as per usual with the EDL mob - not only would it have been unsafe for me, but I did not wish to be tarnished as supporting of their fascism when my reason for attending was intended as support for free speech.  But some (

              How the hell do you expect anything to change when you are so concerned about how others will view you or associate you with?  You Neurotypicals with your need for social acceptance and that sickeningly weak devils advocates view point. No matter how depraved the evil being faced there is always that need to extend a level of emotionally based treatment thats never been, or likely to be, reciprocated on the victims of these people. If NT's dump the pro-social morals when dealing with Malignant Narcissists we'd all be a whole lot better off.

              I just responded to TrishaUK with words regarding the racism of TR.  Yes, this is or will be his Downfall if he does not see the light.  People can get so full of hate that they cannot see the error of their ways.  I hope this all gets ironed out and I can truthfully understand why you are holding back your support at this time.  I have felt that way here as well where I am at too.  I really don't trust May &amp; Co.  so who knows why all that is even transpiring.  They may have an ulterior motive that is not even visible.  They are all sick individuals.

               I just noticed these responses, and was wondering whether to reply or not, because if you do mention anything about Muslim here people very quickly label you as racist whatever you say.  For the record I am NOT racist, but there is a culture clash here in the UK with one group being able to say what they want, and they are protected, then other being shut down by the police if they say what they want.  Sadly I think it is going to get worse :'(   What I am trying to say: This is a Documentary Filmed in 2012 by a very well known Reporter called Stacey Dooley who has recorded in places like South African prisons, Philippine street prostitues etc., This is about Tommy Robinson (before he left the English Defence League in 2013) -

                I am going to look at this, but let me say this.  What you describe is going on all over only not in full force like it is in the UK.  They are pushing this all over.  Political Correctness.  People are afraid of speaking up for being called a racist or speaking their minds.  Go along to get along, is what we used to call it.  People do not realize how this will end up.  They have no clue, or won't, until it is too late to undo.  I am really getting pretty hot and bothered over this.  It's Really Sickening.

                 Here, this is a fantastic, interesting interview, a Muslim Imam Scholar and Tommy Robinson, does he look like a racist sitting listening to every word this Muslim Imam is saying? He is having a great conversation.  I have never seen this Imam before, not that I have followed much about Tommy or the Muslims. It is sooooo worth watching:  Tommy Robinson. Advice to the government from a Muslim scholar. -

                 <p>
                  Tommy has very clearly distinguished himself from more 'unreformed' Nationalists like Jayda Fransen / Paul goulding
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He absolutely knows not to cross a line in terms of recial discrimination, and it is the IDEOLOGY of Islam and how it affects the Standards of Law and Order of those following that ideology that is his concern.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Tommy is a hero to the British Sikh community. Their girls, as 'kaffir' - are also targeted by the grooming gangs, and similarly the Sikh parents desperately appealing for help from the British establishment received NONE.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There is only one reason, and one reason only he is called 'racist'.
That is because the Politically Correct Left has lost all capacity and ability to discern between someone opposed to an ideology and someone who is prejudicial based on race.

                   I totally agree, and would add that their beliefs, regarding little girls ages and older men, also align with the Politically Correct Left elites from a lot of what has been exposed, so they are keen to protect that.  One thing I do not understand.  In the UK it is ILLEGAL to have more than 1 wife yet they are allowed to have 2,3,4 etc., and no one bats an eyelid.  Plus they can even claim benefits for all of their wives and children if the man is not working. I even heard that they can claim for children they have in other countries such as India or Pakistan, but don't know how true that is.  How on earth is that fair or right?  My husband had a stroke in Jan and could not work, we asked if we could get help while he was being seen by doctors and is now banned from driving as he has lost half his sight on both eyes.  We were not eligible for any help, unless he was looking for work!  This despite us paying £1,000s in taxes for the past 22 years.  Praise God that his former employer, hes a Design Engineer Contractor, has allowed him to work from home so we don't have to ask for any help from the Government who refused anyway!

                    yes, look, its plain as day; Cultural Marxism is not about EQUALITY - that's a smokescreen, its about the disenfranchisation of white people

                   <p>
                    like with grooming gangs, as with welfare policy, it is a complete 2-tier system with massive preferential treatment given to muslims

                    I have come to believe that the Globalist goal is to raise and radicalise the islamic popolation of Continental Europe, to re-enact the Yugloslavian genocide within every country. This takes care of a few objectives for the Global Elite:

                   The Sikhs are a very peaceful loving people and I am glad to hear that Tommy knows the difference.  Evidently the May govt. does not care about the Sikhs nor the rest of the people. All they care about is furthering their New World Propaganda Program of saturating the UK and EU with Muslims and their Ideology.  This is a very dangerous time and people had better wake up and take notice as to whom is in their corner and who is not.

              I am glad you mentioned Judicial Watch.  They have been one of my favorites since even before our election here.  They always come through and really I don't see how anyone can say they are either Dem or Rep.  They just call out all bad actors and push for the truth.  Thanks Trish!

            Great expose of the Arrest of Tommy Robinson on Infowars atm. 1st time I have listened to Alex in ages, great article.  I hear over in the UK that there has been a call to meet in London at 3pm today (Sunday 27th).....hope this is the beginning and that Tommy is safe in jail, he almost died last time, as they put him in prison next to the prisoners who HATE him for telling the truth. REVOLUTION UK! Thousands Gather Climb The Gates At 10 Downing To Free Tommy Robinson -

            This is a sad day for Britain.  This is a working class man just trying to expose pedophile rings.   Since it’s muslims and pedophiles the establishment will protect them.  But Tommy is sent to prison while hundreds of pedos are allowed free.  Here’s an example

             you really are a retard.
Tommy is in jail, for real. His life is in danger, for real.  He met with some Jews, sure - it was pre-announced, not a 'secret' meeting - you've psy-opped yourself there, mate.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tommy also meets with Sikhs, and Hindus, and Carribbean grandmothers who are being bullied to move out of their street so it can become an ethnic  enclave

            This is the poorest excuse for evil that I have ever seen:
           </p>
           <p>
            “..multicultural brain-rot, and that leads some local councilors and police to participate in raping the girls...”
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me try to sound out that logic:
           </p>
           <p>
            Public Official/Police Person: “Well multiculturalism is important, so I’ll help these immigrants feel welcome by raping and torturing these teen girls.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Nope. I was right. It makes no sense at all.

             Political Correctness is an authoritarian movement. Enforced through courts, and then that passes down to 'risk management' by Human Resources.
            </p>
            <p>
             So 20 years ago in Rotherham when cops first started investigating pakistani pedophile rings, the pakis would call the cop station and make formal complaints that they were 'racially motivated '  Risk management then says to the cops 'go easy on that community or we'll have a three-hundred thousand pound anti-discrimination payout dangling over our heads.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then there was the Stephen Lawrence report on institutionalised police racism, and after that any cop with even a snifter of racism about them was prone to being sacked.
            </p>
            <p>
             This sensitivity was exploited by the islamic community. Do any dark deed, play the islamophobia card
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              at investigation
             </li>
             <li>
              at arrest
             </li>
             <li>
              at charging
             </li>
             <li>
              at pre-trial
             </li>
             <li>
              during trial and
             </li>
             <li>
              in sentencing
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             enough mud, some will stick, right?
            </p>
            <p>
             Then after some years this is what emerges in the police culture:  the ones that are ethically 'flexible' enough to endorse political correctness and cover up the rape jihad - and even participate - they're the ones who get promoted. The good cops who hate the policies, they languish at the bottom of the career ladder

              Wow. That’s monstrous.

             <p>
              I just reread what I wrote... I wasn’t criticizing the OP at all. Just the system. I think what is truly striking about all of this is how reasonable.. inevitable it all is. The government is crippled everywhere.

              Thanks for the assist. I hope I didn’t sound too snarky.
