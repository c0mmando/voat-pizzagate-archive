<p>Listen, if Alefantis were really going to use a false flag to shut down the investigation for good, I guarantee you there would have been violence. It would have to be bad enough to justify a major shut down of many sites. Better yet, he\'d probably burn the entire place down or bomb it to get rid of the evidence as well. At the very least, perhaps a shooting -- not just a man walking in peacefully and triggering scores of police to swarm the place, shut it down, and start searching around. </p>

            It's not Alefantis in that photo. It's a photo of someone else, for one thing, someone with a beard! Alefantis seems never to have had a beard.

            Except: the police will get instructions from high above to not dig too deep and shut down the investigation real quick.

           <p>
            The best we can hope for is that someone who is assigned to the case is a normal human being who is horrified by child abuse, and who has had a chance to see one of the pizzagate infographics or YouTube summaries and will quietly collect actual proof against these monsters.

            I follow your logic, I just think that it could just as easily have been a pretext for police showing up and saying "ok everyone, nothing to see here, can you shut up about the pizzagate stuff now?" which seems to be exactly what happened. If we are right and there's anything true about this whole thing, then it goes all the way up to Obama himself. Some regular old sheriff deputies aren't about to "bust" the President and all these other high-ranking officials.

            Also it's a lot harder to fake people being actually killed and violence actually occurring. Recently the fake terror attacks have been getting lazier and lazier not even bothering to use fake blood and gore. The recent Chelsea "bombing," the Ohio State "attack," we're really supposed to believe these Muslim terrorists didn't manage to kill a single person? And yet people do believe it, so I guess it's not worth the effort for the real perpetrators to simulate injuries and produce fake death certificates and all that.

            Or it was just a lone wolf. All the whole thing succeeded in doing was getting #PizzaGate into the mainstream news. Maybe that's what he was trying to do. Seems like the simplest explanation.

            Being a skeptic, may I asked for the source of the "police stayed inside for 24 hours" (or any extended period of time, much longer than such an event would necessitate)? Thanks.

            I remember reading someone specifically about protect a child that said they were a bad organization. In any case it could be a plea bargain still. Did the girl he hit happen to be a foster child?

            The camera was moved. There are ties to "people who love children and adopt" in his direct family tree. Dude lived/stayed in Haiti. Alefantis had a prepared speech (that sounds straight out of David Brock's mouth hole). Stories were released online before the event took place.

               Who produced that graphic? I've read it three times and I still can't see when 1) the event actually took place, and 2) when the event was described, and in which newspaper.

            here's a hitch in the theory...  wouldn't the local shops, especially staff of CPP be extra watchful and notice the police activity prior?  Assuming that there was prior police activity, taping off etc?   Or,  did they see the police and wonder what was going on?  It's hard to say, and since it appears that J.A.  has difficulty getting his stories straight we might never discover that answer.

            That might explain the confusing versions pertaining to gunfire -- no gunfire.  Maybe MSM doesn't know which spin is more advantageous,  because they weren't in on it?

            That would be nice, if true.

            What makes me doubt it, is that both Google and Yahoo shows that stories may have been made prior to the event taking place. There was a possible bug regarding the Google search, but Yahoo? Both at the same time on different stories from different outlets? Seems unlikely, and if they pushed early stories, that's CIA involvement.  I doubt they'd be working in our favor. They could be working a narrative like yours in somehow, but use this controversy to bring him up on some charges (like drug distribution), then quietly relocate him somewhere to pacify the pizzagate folks.

             An even weirder discrepancy is that WaPo (and all the other articles I've seen) describe the incident as happening "just before 3 pm (EST)". And yet Sharif Silmi, esq. aka

             , who was supposedly inside Comet, retweeted a picture of the Shooter standing in the middle of the street...at 12:24pm EST.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shortly after that, he posted a few pics of cops moving in on Comet. All before 1pm EST.
