<p><strong>Tumblr will ban all adult content on December 17th</strong></p>
<p>Existing posts containing porn will be switched to private mode</p>
<p>Tumblr will permanently ban adult content from its platform on December 17th in a move that will eradicate porn-related communities on the platform and fundamentally alter how the service is used. The ban includes explicit sexual content and nudity with a few exceptions, the company tells The Verge. The new policy’s announcement comes just days after Tumblr was removed from Apple’s iOS App Store over a child pornography incident, but it extends far beyond that matter alone. “Adult content will no longer be allowed here,” the company flatly stated in a blog post published on Monday. </p>
<p>Banned content includes photos, videos, and GIFs of human genitalia, female-presenting nipples, and any media involving sex acts, including illustrations. The exceptions include nude classical statues and political protests that feature nudity. The new guidelines exclude text, so erotica remains permitted. Illustrations and art that feature nudity are still okay — so long as sex acts aren’t depicted — and so are breastfeeding and after-birth photos.</p>
<p>After December 17th, any explicit posts will be flagged and deleted by algorithms. For now, Tumblr is emailing users who have posted adult content flagged by algorithms and notifying them that their content will soon be hidden from view. Posts with porn content will be set to private, which will prevent them from being reblogged or shared elsewhere in the Tumblr community. </p>
<p>Users have a chance to appeal Tumblr’s decision in situations where they think there’s been a mistake, and the platform admits there’s a chance that the automated tools it’s using could make errors. It’s a process that could take a while, as a bulk of Tumblr posts feature explicit content. Users who run adult blogs can also export their content before the change takes place in order to save what they have.</p>
<p>Explicit blogs will be allowed to remain on the service, but they’ll be heavily censored for all visitors. Here’s Tumblr’s FAQ:</p>
<p>What if my blog (not to be confused with posts) was marked as “explicit” before December 17, 2018? </p>
<p>Blogs that have been either self-flagged or flagged by us as “explicit” per our old policy and before December 17, 2018 will still be overlaid with a content filter when viewing these blogs directly. While some of the content on these blogs may now be in violation of our policies and will be actioned accordingly, the blog owners may choose to post content that is within our policies in the future, so we’d like to provide that option. Users under 18 will still not be allowed to click through to see the content of these blogs. The avatars and headers for these blogs will also be reverted to the default settings. Additionally, posts from these blogs are kept out of search results.</p>
<p>Since Tumblr was founded in 2007, it has largely turned a blind eye to adult content. The company has tried to shield it from public view through Safe Mode and more stringent search filters. But in recent months — and under the ownership of Verizon’s Oath unit — it began to consider removing content more aggressively. “We’ve given serious thought to who we want to be to our community moving forward,” CEO Jeff D’Onofrio says in a blog post. “We’ve realized that in order to continue to fulfill our promise and place in culture, especially as it evolves, we must change.” D’Onofrio says Tumblr weighed the pros and cons thoroughly before making its decision. It also decided not to remove explicit accounts because it wanted to give these accounts a chance to post appropriate content instead.</p>
<p>Under Oath, Tumblr has been cleaning up its platform more rapidly than it had done in previous years. In August, Tumblr announced new community guidelines that banned revenge porn, hate speech, and posts that glorified school shootings.</p>
<p>If users mourn the loss of adult content on Tumblr, D’Onofrio claims they have many other solutions. “There are no shortage of sites on the internet that feature adult content. We will leave it to them and focus our efforts on creating the most welcoming environment possible for our community,” he said. That argument will do little to curtail anger over this decision from people who have used Tumblr as a safe place to enjoy, share, and discuss their preferred flavor of porn and adult content. </p>

            Many of us who created consensual erotic fanarts would not have our blogs marked "adults only", so as to show up in the tags, BUT we'd properly tag our work so that those who wanted to view it (but didn't have their blogs set to "adults only" due to their own naivety) -- could do so.
           </p>
           <p>
            As innocent as our reasons for it were, we were part of an ever-increasing problem on that site.... a problem where words were given trigger-warning tags, but sexual content was a free-for-all.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yes, I am ashamed that I circumvented that rule and guideline.  But pizzagate woke me up, in more ways than one.  I never considered that children could be on that site, pretending to be 13 (or older).  I never considered that they could come across the art.... however consensual and artistic it was, and that it could very well do them emotional harm.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just because most fandom-raised individuals of my age knew that graphic sexual content (art and fanfic) were common place, doesn't mean we shouldn't do something to stop it from becoming "the norm" for kids of today.
           </p>
           <p>
            So bravo to Tumblr for doing what they can. I hope Deviantart follows-suit.  At the moment theirs is more "no erect penises, or we'll erase your blog" but MANY OTHER sexual arts do actually exist on that site.
           </p>
           <p>
            If people want to see erotic fanart for their faves, there are many, many, many locked and safe options for it.... without putting the mental health of children at risk.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry for my ramble.  I'm just one part ashamed and guilty for my past usage of tumblr, and a whole heap of supportive of Tumblr for this move to safeguard kids.

             There shouldn't be anything on Tumblr that shows any Children in any kind of compromising position..  At all. That stuff shouldn't be available anywhere at all.  We know it exists on the dark web but when we have sites like Tumblr and others that are skating on thin ice, well, that makes it just too easy for Children to access.  I am glad you have turned over a new leaf.  Just saw an article today on how seeing porn affects Children.  Not pretty.  I can't believe people actually watch this stuff with Children in the room.  What has this country come to is what I want to know.

              Just to clarify in case it was seen as thus.... I never posted or saw content depicting children in a compromising position.  Mine was above-board with adults, just poorly tagged in hindsight.
             </p>
             <p>
              But yes I get what you're saying entirely.... my half sis used to make me watch porn when I was 12, and in addition to obscene things she did to me it's turned out she was one of three sexual abusers of me.
             </p>
             <p>
              I had just never imagined that tumblr had 13's and under on it.  I feel like an arse and a fool for it.  And have sworn since to do my utmost to fight for the kids who deserve a harm-free space on the web.... wherever they go.

               I am sorry for what happened to you.  Very sorry.  Evidently your half sis was also abused or she wouldn't do such things.  Remember though, that many that get addicted to adult porn may fall into the trap of not having enough results and that's how they get addicted to Child porn.  It becomes a huge addiction.  The fact that you were abused as a Child is what can cause you to need this adult porn.  I suggest you get a therapist to resolve your problems about your abuse, this is very serious.  I have a friend that is a member here that was a SRA Victim of a priest and she has had serious therapy.  This is something very serious that you need to fix within yourself.  It can cause many problems in your life down the road and as I see it has already.  Please get help.

                .  My sister was abused as a child as well :(  I've been in therapy for many years, but my biggest "issue" was that I wasn't talking about what happened to me, and thus other things linked to it (in hindsight) I wouldn't talk about either.  But in the past year I have completely turned my life around, I have returned to my childhood Christian faith, and feel like a whole new me.  That's why I'm in the fight with you all... because I've been a victim of childhood rape and sexual abuse, and I've let myself go down paths I shouldn't because the past experiences made me feel like "oh, it's okay to watch adult porn, it's okay to write erotic fiction, it's okay to create erotic art" and..... it really isn't!  This stuff is satanic in nature, and we (humanity) need to fight to get back to God.

                 You are a good soul especially that you know your faults.  Many do not and many know but won't admit it.  You are on the right road.  The road to recovery.  I too have re found my faith.  The strangest thing is that the pope is the worst one within my life but I now realize how important it is before it is lost.  We must fight to keep God in our lives.  We must fight before they take it away;  They are confiscating Bibles in China.  Catholics are going underground.  Fight for your right to believe.  God Bless You +

             I think the biggest question is.... how do they prevent artists, photographers and fan-artists from labeling their works "erotica" when it is, in fact, hard-core porn.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was something I tangled with a lot in my last couple of months as an erotic art creator.  The best way I could figure that out was by looking at photographic and art books about sex.  It taught me a lot in regards to sensuality and erotica in art, and how to differentiate it - visually - from porn.  The main difference, I think, is in the violence of the acts.  Maaaaaany fan artists create borderline rape art and call it erotica.  One persons kink should not automatically equal erotica imho.

             That is always the question.  If they are allowed to make the rules there will always be a crack they can slip through.  We have to have strict laws for these Bleeping Perverts.

              When Starbucks had that racism issue for denying a black person to just use the bathroom and decided to just let homeless people and drug addicts use the bathroom and hang out without buying anything, I wondered why they weren't worried about people not going there any more and losing money...this would also explain that if they are making the money this way.

               Sorry, thick skull.  Explain.  You mean by CP or that they are now powered by Soros or the CIA?  They are providing their money?  I have heard that Amazon is CIA.  Don't know if that is true, but Amazon received an 800M contract from the CIA to manage their cloud.  This could be possible.

                 So they don't want to deny any people the use of the bathroom.  This could be the precursor to their  Transgender Push and their right to use any bathroom they wish.  I don't trust Starbucks and I don't buy their coffee.  Tastes lousy, imo.  Could be all these soc. media sites are going to serve a very important tool.

             Well lets hope that there is heavy filtering and a good plan to keep Children Out.  We almost have to have systems that police things for the parents.  Parents are too lax and lazy  to do it themselves.

             Some are saying it is their death knell because so many go there for their porn.  Also I read that the consensus is that they needed to spend more money on better filters and more attentive mods. We shall see.  There is a new owner too.

               Heh Heh.  Yeah a safe space for them but not for Our Children.  We have to keep watch now and see.  So they are switching from CP to SJW?  Hmm somehow I don't think they will give up their sick pleasures completely.
