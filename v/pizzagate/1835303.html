            JFK was killed by the CIA and the Mafia. The reason was he didn't provide air cover for the Bay of Pigs invasion. There were other offenses but Cuba was the main reason.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suggest watching Oliver Stone's movie JFK for specific details.

            It wasn't Bush Jr. W is too retarded to have done something that complex. It was the Deep State and most likely George H.W. Bush SR than did the dirty deed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would they kill JFK Jr? Because Hillary Clinton is Deep State all the way but unfortunately for them she's an unelectable cunt demon that would stand no chance against someone as popular as JFK Jr.

            To the family of one of the best people I ever knew:
Thank you for raising a man who is irreplacable in my heart and in my mind. Sturdy was my closest confidante during our time together on the Erbil CAT-A, and at times he was the only person keeping me going. I don't know what I would have done without him. Please be comforted by knowing that we all loved Michael, and his legacy is permanent in the KRG and in the hearts of all those who knew him there. Even people who didn't know him were deeply affected by the accident- Sturdy had a way of affecting people. Thank you for sharing him with me- if I could, I would give you back every minute of the 10 months he spent near me. Lord knows you all deserve it more than I, but I am nevertheless overflowing with thankfulness that I knew Michael Sturdivant. My prayers will remain with you, and I sincerely hope to meet you all one day to express my condolences as I should.
Sturdy- I will never forget you, buddy. I can't. You were too much a part of me to ever let go of you fully. I hope I'll join you up there one day. Til then- we'll be okay down here.

            Michael Sturdivant,  His first and only unit of assignment was the 431st Civil Affairs Battalion, North Little Rock, a subordinate unit of the U.S. Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command (Airborne), headquartered at Fort Bragg, North Carolina
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/Michael-Sturdivant-86488301">
             http://www.tributes.com/obituary/show/Michael-Sturdivant-86488301
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The primary mission of Civil Affairs is to conduct civil-military operations. Civil Affairs soldiers are responsible for executing five core CA tasks, Civil Information Management, Foreign Humanitarian Assistance, Nation Assistance, Population and Resource Control, and Support to Civil Administration. Some sub tasks to these core tasks include identifying non-governmental and international organizations operating in the battlespace, handling refugees, civilians on the battlefield, and determining protected targets such as schools, churches/temples/mosques, hospitals, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to supporting commanders, PSYOP units provide interagency support to other U.S. government agencies. In operations ranging from humanitarian assistance to drug interdiction, psychological operations enhance the impact of those agencies' actions. Their activities can be used to spread information about ongoing programs and to gain support from the local populace.
           </p>
           <p>
            Used during peacetime, contingencies and declared war, these activities are not forms of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments. Persuading rather than compelling physically, they rely on logic, fear, desire, or other mental factors to promote specific emotions, attitudes, or behaviors. The ultimate objective of U.S. military psychological operations is to convince enemy, neutral, and friendly nations and forces to take action favorable to the U.S. and its allies.

            No one gets this kind of access without a proven history. Something stinks here. Sounds like a CIA op who has a ready made resume and auto contacts. At 21 you aren't doing subprime mortgage auditing "just to pass time". That's just a BS bio that no one thought would be called out ever.

            Damn this is good work. Even if there is never an arrest at top level (how could there be? Cant expect judges, police, lawyers, and poiticos to arrest and prosecute themselves!) its still good that anyone who cares to look into pedo gate will see an OVERWHELMING compilation of evidence as to what is going on.

            Hey guys, i have been going through the emails a lot and this came right to mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            She was involved with this Marathon called Ragnar and even mentions how its a secret that being a volunteer is more fun then actually running.

            If I remember right Tamera (Sick bitch with the blog...) may have participated in the jog also.  They have two vans and it seems they are trying to cover their tracks with well managed actions receipts and possibly medals?

            !?LOOK UP RAGNAR!?
           </p>
           <p>
            There is something sketchy about this run or maybe they are out doing something else during the marathon?
           </p>
           <p>
            THERE IS ALSO MISSING PICTURES THAT SHOULD BE IN THOSE EMAILS.

              There is lots of mention of abbey.  Which may be a kid they purchased.
Eryn is more than a secretary in the idea that she is HELPING RAISE AND TAKE CARE OF ABBEY.   Eryn seems to be training/raising Abbey!!

Who all is part of the "Ragnar Family"
They seem to have 2 vans rented and may be covering their tracks while Participating in what seems like a 2 day event?

            This line really jumped out at me:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             She took a job as a subprime mortgage auditor just to pass the time.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Who would hire a 21-year-old about to be deployed (with possibly no experience) as a subprime mortgage auditor? It says she did this the year before she was deployed in 2007. Could she have a connection with Herb Sandler through World Bank, which he sold in 2006 and was partly responsible for the crash of 2008? Is this how she met John Podesta - thru Sandler?
