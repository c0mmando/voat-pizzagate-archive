<p>Ok so recent topics have found the exact same girl-lover pedo symbol found on Terasol Bistro\'s site (before it was scrubbed) on other sites.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.prospectphysio.co.uk/">http://www.prospectphysio.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>I think it\'s safe to say this isn\'t a common image online. But what the hell connects its usage among UK physicians, a DC restaurant, a SC homeless teen outreach group, and an Irish site for kids with Congenital Heart Defect? Did we confuse a medical/charity symbol with a pedophile symbol? And if so why the hell was it on Terasol\'s site for so long with no indication they were connected to charities?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using reverse image searching has yielded the exact same symbol but it\'s located on sites completely unrelated to anything associated with pedo fronts as far as I know, the possible exception being the homeless teen outreach site. I mean is that UK physician site a pedo front? We need to track down the symbol\'s origins to better cement Terasol, and thus the businesses around it on that block, as part of a hub of trafficking.</p>
<p>You know they\'re shady, I know they\'re shady, but I think anyone can call our bluff on this symbol until we find a concrete connection. How else other than TinEye can we track image history? And please stop upvoting bullshit.</p>',

            Props to the cunt that downvoted this. Please do keep upvoting bullshit that doesn't substantiate leads or connections.

            I used Google Images and after uploading the symbol I found a match with this "parent coaching" site:
            <a href="http://www.elisabethstitt.com/">
             http://www.elisabethstitt.com/
            </a>
            The number listed has a California area code (650).

            */http://www.elisabethstitt.com/
           </p>
           <p>
            It's linked to "CTI"
            <a href="https://www.coactive.com/">
             http://www.coactive.com/
            </a>
            based out of CA too, and "ICF"
            <a href="http://www.coachfederation.org/">
             http://www.coachfederation.org/
            </a>
            based out of KY.
           </p>
           <p>
            So here's another sketchy site with this symbol related to children if indirectly (or directly depending on how you look at it).
