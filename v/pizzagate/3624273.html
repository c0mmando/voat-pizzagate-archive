            Wow wow wow! Just unreal. Oh yeah, 1995 was a banner year for implementing many things, including the scumbags perfecting their  harassment and covert spy game bullsh$t on innocent people. This just sickens me as we all known 1000's of innocent children were killed off, maybe after organs has been taken. The evil of these scum is so vast, so dark that had I not lived through my own nightmare I would just not want to believe it. I want to wrap my arms around many of you that actually give a shit and are trying to expose this horror show. As I have said before, fuck the Giustra's and the Epsteins, we are just common fodder for this massive evil that gets off off on destroying and killing the innocents. If not for us and CDAN much of what has transpired would go unnoticed. Hard to have a regular conversation with anyone that is unaware. It is TOO EVIL for most to comprehend.

            I don't think any of Q's references to "keystone" pointed to vaccines or blood. They referenced the NSA program and the blue and white striped imagery of Epstein's temple, as well as the NSA being the "key" and Potus + anons being the "stone". Those interpretations were all confirmed by Q.
           </p>

            Also, is this Keystone Industries a large company? Who is on the board? What else do they do?
