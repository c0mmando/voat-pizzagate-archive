            No, as what and why it happened is very clear. Theres 100,000cfs of water being released out the main spillway atm. The waters I last heard has been lowered by 3 ft from breaching again. So id say its under control. Its a Earthen dam, shit like this happens..

            definitely not, I agree, It's barely getting any coverage and honestly it should be getting a lot MORE coverage than it has... over 200,000 people evacuated and this little? Because it goes against their climate change narrative. They've been using California's drought situation as evidence for global warming and climate change for a while. Michael Savage has said for a long time CA has a Mediterranean climate, Long periods of drought followed by long periods of rain. He is finally vindicated. They have gotten so much rain that this dam is failing. So, no not a false flag. In fact it's the exact opposite. It's not getting the time of day because it goes against the narrative.

            um, no. I live up here and even had to look into whats going on. Its the emergency spillway thats in danger of collapsing under heavy erosion from all the water overflowing out. The dam is fine. The auxilliary spillway is the long "waterslide" next to it which has that gaping hole. The structure at the top of that spillway which allows for release of water is fine. But  the
            <em>
             emergency spillway
            </em>
            that allows water to run off , just like an overflowing bathtub, is in possible danger of giving way if the erosion creeps back enough to destabilize that area. My goodness, go look it up and inform yourself.  Unless you want to include mother nature as a co-conspirator. 
BTW, want to talk about how idiotic california is, as i understand it the engineers who regularly audited the dam structures were doing so from a distance using binoculars. The did this for years. I would personally like to know if Butte County was ever denied monies for repairs or upkeep due to the california govt giving preference and priority to the south, the cities, and urban areas. If you want to talk about a  conspiracy, this would be a better one to talk about.

            edit: Sorry. What I called the  "emergency spillway" should actually have been called the "auxiliary spillway", and what I called the auxiliary spillway should be called just the "spillway". Eitherway, there are two spillways, plus ONE dam. Both spillways are "broken", but one may collapse.

            California has been so shittily run for decades that I have no doubt their infrastructure is in this much trouble. They would rather pay for prisoners to get sex changes than build a new reservoir or fix their roads.

            No, the dam is not a false flag.
           </p>
           <p>
            When it was constructed, they didn't use rebar. That's why its failing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oroville is in a rural, agricultural area. It's Republican territory (neighboring town Chico has the university, and thus a hub of tie-dye wearing liberalism) and most of the "elites" in the area are ranchers/farmers whose livelihood is based on the rice/almonds/dairy and a large population of gun-loving enthusiasts (State of Jefferson is armed, yo) that don't need much of a provocation to act out. Farmers are already pissed that their vote for Trump means their cheap farm labor isn't around; deliberately shitting on them won't end well. The wealthy ranchers have ties to politicians... so yeah.
           </p>
           <p>
            Want people to take the Pizzagate investigation seriously? Then stick to what we do know and not make assumptions. OMG, we're investigating pizzagate and the weather causes erosion on an old dam and OMG THEY DID IT BECAUSE WE'RE ONTO THEM!
           </p>
           <p>
            No. Just stop with that mentality. You start seeing demons in the dark when it's just shadows messing with you, you're doing more harm than good to the investigation. If they were going to do a false flag operation, they're going to target a more densely populated area with a lot more news media syndicates to help broadcast the terror.

            I think there is a strong possibility... people say it's getting no coverage, but I'm seeing it trending on FB and it had MSM coverage on the morning shows... Plus a big story on reddit.

            No because there have been no arrest. No arrest, no distraction needed. If we have arrest today, I would say possibly. Did the dam even break?

             Pizzagate is going to reveal the fact that Donald Trump is controlled opposition, and that the whole him vs. the system paradigm is complete bullshit. He is listed by Hillary as an okay opponent in WL for Fucks Sake. But in allowing for relatively unrestricted communication on internet, these motherfuckers have allowed stuff like this to come around:

             Would have been nice to see a bunch of politicians hanged (especially the Clintons), but it isn't going to happen. Donaldo is the Swamp.

              I have considered this also, but it doesn't add up. This is not the average show of disagreement like with the Bushes or McCain. We have never seen so many people acting so desperate. The amount of money still being poured in by Soros against Trump is staggering. Trump is not 100% clean, but he's not part of the "swamp." He has dirt on these people and they are in full panic mode.
             </p>
             <p>
              EDIT: I also don't think anything will happen until Wikileaks makes something big public. If people were to be arrested now, Trump would be criticized as a dictator imprisoning his opponents. That's why they constantly compare Trump to Putin.

              I have considered this but can't decide. The lack of arrest are leading me to beleive he is a show to slow down the Truth movement momentum, and make them think they have their control back, they have their white hats in place fighting for them. I am just about come to that conclusion. Seamen is finished, the recent anon is a joke.

             They want pizzagate arrests to have a high news profile. This would have prevented that from happening, being overshadowed by a "natural" disaster.

              There are no arrests coming. Donald J. Trump is literally the Freemasons incarnate. They are not the good guys lol. Don't get caught up in the rage. A huge struggle, on a national level, is what it takes. Not 1 man.

                Same way Hitler did it. Redpill the public lol. It's happening as we speak. We don't have to "do" anything except be aware of it all, and talk to others respectfully, while revealing how the system is rigged. That's how change comes.

            Why would the dam stop pizzagate arrests? Also... there are no arrests to hide.

            Heard people say there was a newsitem in that region which stated that they were saving the "fish" a few days ago. (Podesta, Hands, 14, Fish) remember?

            The feeling that rests with me is the dam is not going to break. They need the chaos to transfer the children out of there without them being caught by police.

             There is a salmon hatchery. Literally, the salmon found in the Feather/Sacramento rivers come from the Oroville hatchery. They have strict fishing laws below the hatchery. Go watch NatGeo's "Wild Justice"... it takes place at the damn hatchery. Toured it as a kid, and have toured the hatchery with my own kids. It's legit, not some cover for skuzzy pedos.

             Want secret places? In Shasta Country (Redding is the seat) there is a government bunker. Have fun with that.

            A relevant exchange in the thread:
Question: Rumor has it pizzagate arrests kick off at Midnight or early tomorrow. Does the proximity to those have anything to do with it?
