<p>As you may recall, we have become quite familiar with the <strong><em>Maccoby family</em></strong> and it\'s not like they themselves are unaware that they have such a prominent place in America\'s history. So let\'s examine:</p>

<p>I find it just <strong><em>so interesting</em></strong> how these two conspiracies can coincide here with what seems to be perfect serendipity. It gives me great pause and a long period of reflectlivity. Oh what a small world we live in.</p>
<p>Is this contribution by Nora one of the little ways she is getting back at the cabal for what they did to her and countless others or is she an infiltrator like so many others we have uncovered?</p>',

           how these two conspiracies can coincide here with what seems to be perfect serendipity. It gives me great pause and a long period of reflectlivity. Oh what a small world we live in.

           Is this contribution by Nora one of the little ways she is getting back at the cabal for what they did to her and countless others or is she an infiltrator like so many others we have uncovered?

            Hi there ASolo. Thanks for bringing attention to this. I find it quite suspect Maccoby is involved in this book, but even more troubling that CIA huckster Robert David Steele is. Phibetaiota is his site, he wrote the forward of the book, and he is heavily involved in the INTJ fake court.
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1970082">
             Here he is, featured in a Media Matters piece, going on Alex Jones to claim the deep state is trafficking kids to into sexual slavery on a secret Mars colony
            </a>
            . He is probably a Brock creation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone who follows your links, gives his site clicks.
           </p>
           <p>
            If they aren't using a VPN, they also expose their IP address to the wrong people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would say that it's a very good bet that is part of the scam, since
            <a href="https://searchvoat.co/?t=Joachim+Hagopian">
             the last person to mention Joachim Hagopian's book on Voat
            </a>
            was thewebofslime, who
            <a href="https://searchvoat.co/?st=comments&amp;t=TheWebofSlime&amp;u=MadWorld&amp;b=on&amp;nsfw=on">
             captures Voater IP addresses and uses them to dox people
            </a>
            . It would be a good idea to replace those direct links with links to
            <a href="https://archive.fo/UWEKf">
             archives
            </a>
            instead.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm giving this the "Potential Security Risk" flair. I'm happy to remove it, if you want to include a warning about all this in the body of your submission.

             Whatever, I think you're making much ado about nothing. I put in an archive link for
             <em>
              HER
             </em>
             site for that very reason but in classic voat style you want to take it just that much further, fine. Let your post here serve as the warning along with the flair, I personally don't give a shit.

               So you are already so convinced of your theory that the books author is a shill that you have to try and deride me here on the thread? Everything most of us do requires that kind of precaution I'm sure ppl are aware of their own actions. Thanks though for trying to hem me up into some silly argument beside the point of this thread.

                Deride you, huh? Please show where I expressed "derision" of any kind.

                I repeated your own words back to you to make sure I was clear on your meaning.

               <p>
                I don't know anything about the book's author, nor have I seen anyone provide any information about him whatsoever. The only thing I do know is he chose a Maccoby for his cover art and a nutty spook to write his forward and advertise his book -- the latter point you neglected to mention.

                 You'll have to accept my apologies I may have been a bit presumptive and jumped the gun and did not pay enough attention to what a couple people were saying about the material containing Steele's work. I was triggered by the flair and didn't quite understand your urgency to warn the board. You are right in light of these developments your premise should be carefully considered before proceeding. Thanks V for the input.

             That's a great speculative question and one I didn't consider until you just brought it up. It would have to be considered considering who's involved with the project. How in the world would an author stumble upon her out of the millions on earth unless he has some prior knowledge about her? I haven't read far enough down to ascertain whether or not she was mentioned in his material but he may have run into mention of her at some point. Good question though.

            Well, these are not conspiracies, but investigations of actual pedophile rings.

            <p>
             Well, of course they are conspiracies, two or more people have indeed colluded to extort and traffic in sexual abuse of minors and adults for nefarious purposes, the least of all to defraud and compromise the United States government. I would definitely contend that these are conspiracies, methinks- you are applying the the normie view on the word conspiracy that implies that just because it is a conspiracy that it is somehow not true.
            </p>
            <p>
             I completely agree that Epstein being exposed does not mean the end of this sort of thing and there are many more operations of the same nature out there that are not as transparent. If anything it should serve as an example that our government has been severely infiltrated and most likely fatally damaged.

              Yes, I understand how you used it (sometimes conspiracy is not a theory, it's a crime ;-) ), but I try to avoid the term 'conspiracy' when referring to Pizzagate, even if it might be accurate, due to normies who might misunderstand it.
