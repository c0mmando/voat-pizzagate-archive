<p>WOODBRIDGE, NJ — Four former priests who served at various Woodbridge Twp. churches have now been named by the Catholic church as having &quot;credible&quot; sexual assault allegations made against them at one point in time.</p>
<p>The four priests were on this list the Metuchen archdiocese released Wednesday: The Trenton diocese and Newark diocese released similar lists (see below for full lists). In total, 186 priests across the state were named, all of whom have &quot;credible&quot; sexual assault allegations made against them in the past seventy years or so.</p>
<p>Many of the priests have since died. The archdiocese said it was releasing the list in an effort &quot;to help bring healing and restore trust in the leadership of the Catholic church.&quot;</p>
<p>The Woodbridge-area priests are: </p>
<p><strong>Michael Cashman</strong></p>
<p>Michael Cashman
Multiple Accusations. Parish Assignments: Immaculate Conception, Spotswood; Our Lady of Peace, North Brunswick; Sacred Heart, New Brunswick; St. James, Woodbridge</p>
<p><strong>Michael Santillo</strong></p>
<p>Multiple Accusations. Parish Assignments: St. Joseph, Bound Brook; Our Lady of Lourdes, Whitehouse Station; St. John Vianney, Colonia; St. Jude, Blairstown; St. Mary, Perth Amboy; St. Joseph, Washington</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Ganley</strong></p>
<p>One Accusation. Parish Assignments: St. Ann, Raritan; St. Cecilia, Monmouth Junction; St. Matthew, Edison; Immaculate Conception, Spotswood; St. Cecelia, Iselin; Our Lady of Fatima, Piscataway; Sacred Heart, South Plainfield; St. Ann, Raritan; St. Philip and St. James, Phillipsburg</p>
<p>Santillo has since died. Cashman and Dolak were removed from ministry by the church. Patch wrote about Ganley earlier this year: He was arrested in January at his Phillipsburg home and charged with sexually assaulting a girl who is between the ages of 14 and 17. Ganley was working as a priest at Saint Cecelia Church in Iselin when the alleged criminal acts occurred from 1990 through 1994. He was currently assigned to Saint Philip &amp; Saint James Church in Phillipsburg before the church removed him from ministry.</p>
<p>Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin, the archbishop of Newark, said the list includes all those from New Jersey who were credibly accused of sexual abuse of minors dating back to 1940.</p>
<p>&quot;The revelations of clergy sexual abuse of minors throughout this past year have provoked feelings of shock, anger, shame, and deep sorrow throughout our Catholic community,&quot; he said. &quot;In an effort to do what is right and just, we are publishing the names of diocesan clergy credibly accused of sexual abuse of minors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This list of names is the result of an extensive review of Archdiocesan records dating back to 1940. It is our sincerest hope that this disclosure will help bring healing to those whose lives have been so deeply violated. We also pray that this can serve as an initial step in our efforts to help restore trust in the leadership of the Catholic Church.&quot;</p>
<p>Tobin had announced that the Roman Catholic Dioceses in New Jersey were undertaking a complete review of their files so that the names of all priests and deacons who have been credibly accused of the sexual abuse of minors could be made public.</p>
<p>The dioceses are undertaking this action in coordination with the Attorney General of New Jersey\'s ongoing task force examining the issue of clergy sexual abuse.</p>

<p>&quot;Cardinal Tobin admits to &quot;temporarily&quot; housing Italian actor known for posing shirtless&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/news/cardinal-tobin-admits-to-temporarily-housing-italian-actor-known-for-posing-shirtless/">https://www.mostholyfamilymonastery.com/news/cardinal-tobin-admits-to-temporarily-housing-italian-actor-known-for-posing-shirtless/</a></p>
<p>The Pope-Francis-appointed Cardinal admitted to American Spectator’s investigative reporter George Neumayr Nov. 15 that he ‘temporarily’ housed in his rectory the movie star while the actor improved his English at a nearby school.</p>
<p>Speculations are now abounding that 36-year-old Francesco Castiglione — who runs an Instagram account with hundreds of shirtless ‘beefcake’ poses — may have been the intended recipient of Tobin’s ‘nighty-night, baby. I love you’ tweet from earlier this year. Tobin quickly deleted the tweet and apologized, saying it was meant for his sister.</p>
<p>‘Was Castiglione the real recipient of the ‘Nighty-Night Baby’ tweet? Tobin stuck with his story about sending it to a family member. ‘I sent that to my sister,’ he said. I asked him if she could provide proof of that. That didn’t go over well. ‘I don’t have to prove anything to you,’ he said, as he started to walk away from me.’</p>
<p>Tobin, the Archbishop of Newark, has personally welcomed an ‘LGBT pilgrimage’ to his cathedral. He was named in Archbishop Viganò’s testimony on Pope Francis’ covering up for McCarrick as rising to power outside normal processes. Viganò linked Tobin’s appointment to McCarrick. ‘The appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick, Maradiaga and Wuerl, united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first, and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two,’ Archbishop Viganò said.</p>
<p>Catholic pundits are also questioning why a successful movie star stayed with the Cardinal during his English lessons instead of renting his own apartment.</p>
<p>‘Was the man who’s widely believed to be the next cardinal for the Washington archdiocese, Cardinal Joseph Tobin of Newark, bunking with a houseboy?’ asked American Thinker’s Monica Showalter.”</p>
<p>Tobin said:  &quot;The revelations of clergy sexual abuse of minors throughout this past year have provoked feelings of shock, anger, shame, and deep sorrow throughout our Catholic community,&quot; he said. &quot;In an effort to do what is right and just, we are publishing the names of diocesan clergy credibly accused of sexual abuse of minors.&quot;   
</p>
<p>A man of the cloth claiming he has compassion for the sexual abuse of minors and a Cardinal yet, shacking up with a Shirtless Actor in his Residency.  Imo, this is a Blasphemous Act.</p>

             Yeah they need a really large tarp to cover that elephant.  The Lavender Mafia has taken over the priesthood and the Vatican.  It is said the percentage of homosexual priests in the Church is  80 - 90%.  I totally believe it.  Shocking.  Thank you for the in depth article.

               I agree.  There are many hiding their sexual preferences in order to keep their cover.  They masquerade behind the lgbt label all the while they are pedos.  Many think that gays can't be pedos so they stay safe. Until they are charged by a Victim of course.  Then their cover is blown.

                 I keep wondering if something will happen to blow it all wide open.  The Faithful Catholics of old will have to push hard.  They are starting but not enough of them.  This is not just about the Catholics, they want to kill all of Christianity.  Blasphemous Heathens.

             I agree.  It seems to be snowballing.  More and more coming.  Some states were forced to post Hot Lines and boy are they calling in.  His speaking out made all the difference.  What moxie.
