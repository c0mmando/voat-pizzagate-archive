<p>Although the election is over, the problem of fake news isn’t. Apple CEO Tim Cook said it’s time to do something about it.</p>
<p>“All of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news,” Cook said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;There has to be a massive campaign. We have to think through every demographic,&quot; Cook said.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Much of the fake news controversy has focused on Facebook, where in recent months fabricated stories have become wildly popular. In January, the social media giant rolled out new filtering tools in Germany for users to flag stories that are potentially fake to be reviewed by fact-checkers.</p>

<p>Apple’s Eddy Cue, senior vice president of internet software and services, will be joining Recode’s Peter Kafka at the Code Media Conference tomorrow, where he’ll be asked more about Apple’s position on fake news, especially as the company moves to start making its own TV and movies.</p>
