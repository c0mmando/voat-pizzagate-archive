            You are a follower. You are sheep. You enjoy thinking that you are "smarter" or more informed.. your ego has probably gotten you in trouble in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Take a long look in the mirror.. you are nothing but the culmination of pretentious thoughts and spoon fed views/narrative. A cocky, arrogant bacteria created from the shit Petri dish that is MSM and liberal thought process. You're doing nothing but contributing to the spread of a disease. You are infected and worthless. We are all doing you a favor as the only cure from this insufferable disease is the truth.

            There is few replys  but "someone ". Gives the corrected spreadsheet with 3000 sum  odd  email addys, passwords and amy paid . Please trust I downloaded the excel sheet blindly.

             All good I got it, scatty Internet at the moment doing Xmas, will pickup again soon. Been on this all day every day since podesta mails were being dropped, think I needed a day or two to get perspective again. I was chasing that doc cause someone had their password set to thelema, turned out to be an interesting realtor still digging when I can.

            Aside: any cool, legit SHOULD know. I have been hacked on here, my account, my private messages erased. I DID find the security team and emailed them.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do find it odd, that good concerned citizens appear to be quite expendible to ones here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not sure how ones can be concerned of kids lives, corruption, the very fact of harm, threats, death to ones , way beyond Breitbart; for it takes a ethics and compassion for lives to value to be legit about any type of investigation as this.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, others, should know. I'm def not a selfish person that ignores ones safety, rights, boundaries. Hacking is illegal and also ag the terms of service and privacy statements, clearly, legally written on bottom of each page on VOUT in links, in their LEGAL writeup. So my concern is clearly a concern of VOUT, most webs and any person that obviously realizes that account hacking is illegal and creepy, and keep it for the ones killing kids, now, like a normal decent person.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is SHADY, creepy..concerning..if you value yourself more than a roll of TOILet paper OR anyone else's life, human DECENCY.
           </p>
           <p>
            SO yah, its reported, and I'm a real bunion to ones who invade my rights, boundaries, privacy, RTS to be here or anyone else. I'm always for the underdogs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Odd how ones act so perseptive than are not, when shady hits. Inconsistency reveals, for sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            And its not the first shady that has gone on here, or redfit, or four chan, or eight chan, or twitter, or utube..
           </p>
           <p>
            So, now ANY who are legit with human decency that all  lives do matter, now you know; for I am not going to keep it quiet, doesn't benefit my safety, anyone, or the investigation. That should be obvious.
           </p>
           <p>
            This has NOTHING to do with how vout is run, its their OWN LEGAL RULES not to hack, attack, harrass, endanger , invade privacy of ANY VOUT user. Personal accounts are personal, duh.
           </p>
           <p>
            And you ain't gonna solve pizzagate or pedogate by hacking lil me, to stress my point of how CREEPy this is AND the odd apathy, minimizing of such felonius acts, is creepy/selfish, too.
           </p>
           <p>
            So be careful and try to matchup with ones that WOULD give a EF about your life and have your back!! I'm sure that type of person, CONSISTENTLY, all my life. I don't have to be asked, explained too, begged.
           </p>
           <p>
            And, if you read the Franklin area guys book and recent blog on this issue, HE says same thing, there is certainly a safety issue lacking as not being addressed, even though ones whine boo how about Clinton long list, Breitbart, Haiti journalist. And hardly, victims would ever post, for ones would stupidly sabotage their doublespeak done for safety, for pedos use codes and Illuminati but clearly ones who investigate DO NOT have the skills. And I could bet a trillion dollars, ones are lurking and do not feel safe....
           </p>
           <p>
            Legit is legit in talk and action..is CONSISTENT in ethics..
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyhoo, found two sites that need archiving asap as quite revealing and I don't have that tech capability!! Thanks to Anyone not here to let ones get screwed around by serial killers.
           </p>
           <p>
            It sure is apathy of lives that enabled corruption to pedo and more to grow this large and for solo long in decades to the mwx, but hey, some will keep the mind program propoganda of such vs break on free..

             Anons notice your quality.  We've quietly piggybacked on some of your research and commentary.  Your powerful (highest ranked) comment calling for immediate reporting/investigating/enforcing against Jimmy C for reprehensible child endangerment instas (filled with pedo mssging)-- you focused on example of inapropriate tape binding-- imo clearly struck a nerve, and put a target on you.  &gt;This deletion/hack to a VOAT citizen researcher is worrisome.  Obv. im a bit confused, as I'm unsure of the content of your deleted comment.  But clearly its a massive concern if you dropped knowledge, and rather than allow this uber redpill to reach your fellows, the perpetrators and their agents targeted your narratives for deletion.
Will you re-post the deleted mssg? or maybe you already have, I'll check.  Anyways, such a breech could ruin voat integrity &amp; scare off contributors.  What will come of this?  Anyways, stay safe &amp; keep up the good work.  Protect the innocents, save the Children.

                following up the removal of mod &amp; content of 17 deletions.  Since you were allegedly targeted on this site (our previous commentary), I suggest you keep an eye on the infiltraitor mod situation.  It gives the impression that the content targeted for deletion has value/merit to it.  This is a situation you can perhaps relate to.  Maybe you could share your experiences in these threads &amp; see if your targeting shares patterns to 
1) mod
2) recent content

               Ive been listening to alot of author interviews on the podcast "The Opperman Report".  For a historical review and wider critical institutional awareness building, into this research.  Supplement your reading with some of his 2hr interviews.  His 2016 catalog is helpful. GL in 2017.

                Hi, happy new year.
No need collab..meant just watch...
Deletions of 11 private mags hacked, also))
               </p>
               <p>
                Its targeted content of multi
1 CP's comet pics my psych law data and Dc CP's number to document CP's fed failures Dc CP's 2026717793 and pressure any psychs of report, esp.if they do false news propoganda or utube shows, blogs, etc etc of child abuse..pressure act not talk as by law they must mandate report via a application to CP's if see those pics
3. Obamacare frauds..corp govt contracts that connect to jersey isle/ guerne island and a FBI floridacurrent investigation of a shell corp.of providence..providence owns Logisticare and igneus..way connected..I got over four yes research on it..def hits a nerve and already had prior to pedo gate as I and others advocated research it for years...
4. Shills telling victims or ones that know victims to contact churches and ABCs directly, as IF safe. 
5. Shill sent me email of creepy warehouses, said I must identify or he will report me to them..like etf..who talks acts like that
6. Also, reports and screenshots of ones on fb that simply just shared, Illuminati nation posts that are all over fb, Africa, Ohio, NYC, UK, get account locked on fb that requires ones to send and prove their Id
7.from more imp data I posted, and shill activity, why ask to piggyb/ look.
Whoever the mod is that called me a shill when I first joined as I was teamed with that warehouse email and another, then hacked..hint hint ..infiltrator...
8. Definitely my emails hacked and erased, have to hack.my account. So not alleged. I also screenshot some of those on a Dif card, that I had those Msgs. Still waiting to hear back from bout owners on both multi comments and emails to the emails they give put on their rules of privacy and termsbof service, where hack Harrass other members, violates their rules, and violates internet laws.
               </p>
               <p>
                As I am not like Hillary, public position, Npo or power or treason..no justify reason to hack me. In fact, if ones knew me and my lifetime track record, I am as ally as it gets..so beyond phrucked up, was hacked on here. ..def I'll agenda..creepy..shady
..unnaceptable...two of those initials shills, not even on here anymore , at least with same  account names.
               </p>
               <p>
                Alright
Rock n roll out))

              Yet, the underlying, repeated public health care laws and contracts mandate, no harm to beneificary/stockholders, and any level, local and up, must mandate report and fix to stop harm, asap. But do not, as systemic habit.

             <p>
              Hi, thanks.
             </p>
             <p>
              Private messages, over 11 were erased with about 6-7 dif peeps.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regular comments erased were when I stated that ones were saying to contact ABC  and churches, ( on those pm emails)as IF that was safe, and I called them out in public for that is not safe to tell anyone, and could lead to dangers, esp if a victim or advocate for years in such, got on board. Then they were erased.
             </p>
             <p>
              I had a strange email with one that I have not seen on here, on a private email that sent me a strange pic of warehouses and demanded I say where it was, or he would contact them. That was a weird thing to say.
             </p>
             <p>
              After that, I dropped contact, and said to him that was creepy and he should tell me what that place was. I kept an open mind that he might have just been testing me in proParanoid, but it was creepy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then, I had subscribed to over fifty subverses to try gain more points, weed ones put to see who's cool, trustworthy, and all subverses erased, comments I saved to reference later, 1- 2 PMS, reaching out, like once there was a attorney on here, so I asked him what type, to see if he wanted to go more legal angles, in corp structure or public health care law.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've also had "ones" contact me, elsewhere, but not to say in public.
             </p>
             <p>
              For CP's, calling and reporting is so important, to demand they adhere to state fed law and contracts they are under to welfare check each child / baby in photos; but no not to trust in blind faith. But to inform record the reports made on each child,  document as base legal court cases/investigations require those series of events in documenting govt violations in their infand astructure of legal process of the systems; and also can lead to firing, investigariins ,  fed prison etc, which help clean swamp faster, IF, someone, will do their govt job and investigate, enforce the law.
To hack me is creepy, and as of who I am my entire life in solid traits, always advocating issues for life, for free, even my comments show that genuine pasion that legit just know their is that vibe of "knowing."
             </p>
             <p>
              I wrote on some poetic or code, from the incident off this site, that occurred right prior to VOUT, and by viewing reddit, fourchan, eight cgan dynamics and the Hawaii guy, maybe mia, to test the waters, as I began here.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tech and access is clearly not my forte, so I stay open to confusion to others in my weak areas, but hack was not first odd event.
             </p>
             <p>
              Appreciate your writing to me. Love working with ones as pieces of the puzzle. It has been concerning, though. But, with what its about, not suprising.AndI spoke out not just for myself, but all involved for every one good and legit is a life value in my book. Ive ran a lot mazes))). 
Needs to be a private area for some things with groups. In reality, there is a lot of false news being chit chatted and gossipped all over the world of web, and all of that surely is not bringing in voyeurism at commie level.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps we are all just making a movie here, art. Can't we define our art, too, without the harassments? Isn't imagination the keys to knowledge?
             </p>
             <p>
              And yes, taping might be a game to an adult, but to the child, that is boundary development and mixed messages, not healthy development or construct, and a child comes first, not an adults need for pleasure from some game. And games always build up to next levels, as does any interaction. 
If alive and we'll, who would want to grow up being the taped girl in this situation, so yah, its about her not him.
