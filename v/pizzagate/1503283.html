             Cheers mate, it seems like either people love it or they hate it. Mark Passio can be very hard to digest for some, but I love the work he's done with Jay Parker, who in my opinion is the most interesting, credible and content-rich Satanic Ritual Abuse victim I have come across so far. If you haven't listened to any speeches or interviews with Jay Parker yet, I CAN'T stress enough that you do this. Jay Parker is the living proof that EVERYTHING from PizzaGate is in fact going on for real, on a MASS, GLOBAL scale. I'm telling ya, you're gonna have problems sleeping after listening to his revelations..!

            This is excellent! To begin to understand this! Know your enemy,he says, know their tactics! This is their religion this is not just their crimes they believe this they worship evil. Their religion all leads to to the same whether Thelmaic, Osiris, Luceferian, or masked in the mix of the Vatican with Hitler's Scientists to CIA Mind control....it all leads to worship of Satan. I don't want to get religious because I am not religious but I believe in God and that He is revealing all of this now for a reason. We are the army of Truth and Justice and should be proud as we continue to expose. Satan is the father of lies and deception as God said when He cast him down as a fallen angel Lucifer who chose greed and worship of himself and power. It is hard to breathe with all of this evil but just know we have on our side the most powerful of all who gave grave warnings to those that hurt little children. We are on the right side of History. There was an experience as our soldiers entered Germany to face the Nazi's that were overcome by the evil that had occurred to the Jewish people as the concentration camps were found with millions dead and burned after being sold as cattle.  History cannot repeat itself was the common phrase used after the horrors were revealed. I have had a first person account told to me over a year long account of the rise and fall of Hitler's from a perspective of an 8 year old whose parents were high ranking in the circle with Hitler's himself. She witnessed the slow indoctrination of Germany indoctrinating children who worshiped Hitler's in the beginning. Making it easier to round up the Jewish people because they had been vilified through indoctrination in schools and society that these peopl were less than human...expendable. The Jewish people themselves most often walked willingly into the demand of the Gestapo. Brainwashed, terrozied, they lined up and climbed aboard the cattle trains unable to turn on their captors. As the American troops busted through to Berlin my subject who shared the first person account of being 8 yrs old at the time of Hitler's power. Witnessing horrors over the following years death in her family, rape as a child by the soldiers who had taken over her family's theater as a way to indoctrinate German soldiers. Then The Americans march into town and she as a youngteenager is confronted by American G.I.'s, who picked up her younger siblings and helped take care of them as the USA soldiers were kind and compassionate organized moral principled young soldiers. My contact for all of this escaped Germany during that time although spent time in the horrendous psychiatric hospitals of the Nazi Regime before escaping through Switzerland and then to America right after war. She became a world famous artists who painted as a way to express the tormoment she had witnessed. She was incredibly bright and extremely worried about Obama in 2010 because his promises of free everything for everyone reminded my friend's recollection of the early days of Hitler. Get the youth involved socially through camps, social engineering, etc.? Then they  began the outright indocrination of children and the adults involved to turn on Jewish people. They had now been discredited . Americans showed and my succass

            I respect Mark Passio but there's a good few things I think he's naive on - such as anarchism. I think power will always fill a vacuum and he really laments 'order followers' (as do I, people who blindly follow orders without question) but he seems to extend this to the concept of a nation, police, government and military generally...
           </p>
           <p>
            On the topics of morality and natural law / the occult, Mark is a great listen however. I'll check it later.

             Yeah, I agree on what you say. I'm also seeing too many holes in his anarchistic utopian visions, and frankly, I dont think anyone should have to be that fatalistic in his thought patterns. It's like he thinks that the world only can be fixed in ONE single way, black or white. He doesn't seem to understand that a 1000 roads actually led to Rome.

              Wow this place seems to be full of people who can't handle differing opinions. Every time I give a constructive criticism of one of these famous speakers I get down voted into oblivion. I'm quite a committed PG researcher who wants to help down vote genuine shills, but it seems like a lot of sad people have gained a lot of CP and are abusing it to shit on everyone they disagree with? What's going on here? How about write a comment or response rather than mash your dislike buttons?

              Is it possible for some ass holes to stalk your posts and down vote everything  you say? Because it feels like that is happening to me..

                No idea, just after a day or so of posting I'm randomly nearly -50 CP from people downvoting very innocuous posts. Is the downvote function there to say you disagree or you  think a comment is poor / misinformation? It's just a bit disheartening as I would like to be able to message others, etc.
