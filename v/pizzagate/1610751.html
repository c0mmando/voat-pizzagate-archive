<p>NEW ORLEANS - It\'s no secret that human trafficking is a growing issue in New Orleans. There\'s a task force specially designed to attack the crime and rescue victims. Wednesday that task force held a press conference updating the community on its latest two-day operation. </p>
<p>The operation, by The New Orleans Violent Crime against Children and Human Trafficking task force, rescued 11 women in just two days. The victims range in age, from their early 20s to late 40s. This sting focused on victims so no arrests were made but police are cracking down on human trafficking especially as more people travel to the city for Mardi Gras parades and the NBA All-Star Game weekend. </p>
<p>&quot;Anytime you see somebody being victimized, it\'s heartbreaking. The scars, both physical and mental, are incredible. If you are a pimp, do not come to New Orleans,&quot; said FBI Special Agent in Charge Jeff Sallet. </p>
<p>Sallet also said other operations like this one will be taking place in New Orleans in 2017. </p>

            When I think of what is going on with children in other countries it makes my blood boil.  The Whore of Babylon gave away $24M of OUR money to pad her pipeline of kids when our kids are starving here and drinking dirty water.  She is at the bottom of the barrel and needs to be swallowed up into the bowels of the earth like the rest of them. You will all be exposed. We Will Not Be Distracted.  I realize my name for her is somewhat harsh, but she has earned it.  After all, she and they have had their way with a Smorgassboard of children while we have been working our asses off.

            This is fishy and we are being had.  The Covenant House had a former CEO leave due to sexual abuse.  This is their ploy to make us believe they are on it.  They are in panic mode and are trying to hose down the flames.  They are trying to make everyone believe it is just about pedophelia when the organ transplants are the big money makers.  Move along folks, we've got everything under control. Watch it again.
Someone else posted this and a few thought it was fake as well.  They are getting pretty good, huh?

             What's Covenant House have to do with this?  Didn't see them in the story.

             Also what's a 37 year old case have to do with today?  Are the guys who play on the Steelers today, this year's Super Bowl Champions?

              Kevin Ryan is the CEO of Covenant House.  He is at the press conf.  Usuall if there is sex abuse by a priest it has happened before and will happen again as I and others have found as we have investigated a lot of the different cases on here.
