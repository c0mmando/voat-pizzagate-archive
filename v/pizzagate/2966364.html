            The time is NOW to call Representatives. This is the first day of NO PAYCHECK from government shutdown. We need an UNDERGROUND wall to block the HUGE amount of tunnels coming from Mexico UNDER our border. The U.S. is ALREADY FUNDING ($3.8 BILLION/YEAR) an underground border wall for ISRAEL which will be completed mid-2019. It is being built by the Israeli MILITARY along the Gaza border and they are working 24/6 to get it done. IT WILL ALSO HAVE AN ABOVE GROUND FENCE and sensors to detect underground tunneling. DEMS AND REPUBLICANS APPROVED THIS 10 year military aid package under Obama. If we keep back a one time $5 billion from the aid (CHARITY), TRUMP can get his $5 billion and use it to start on a MORAL UNDERGROUND WALL. The govt. SHUTDOWN will end.
           </p>
           <p>
            Currently, the SHUTDOWN is blocking the FRAUD INVESTIGATION REGARDING VACCINES AND AUTISM. On Jan. 6th there was a BOMBSHELL ANNOUNCEMENT, that a key expert witness HAD FOUND THAT VACCINES DO CAUSE AUTISM in a subset of children. THIS WAS COVERED UP BY DOJ LAWYERS IN THE 2007 OMNIBUS VACCINE COURT AUTISM CASES, where this FRAUD was used to deny hundred of families compensation. The timing of the release of this sworn affidavit and the government SHUTDOWN is SUSPECT. This will affect every child in America.

            "Israel Speeds Up Underground Border Wall To Block Gaza Tunnels" January 24, 20189:08 AM ET
           </p>
           <p>
            "The Israeli military is speeding up construction of its first underground border wall. The 40-mile-long wall will run the length of Israel's border with the Gaza Strip to counter tunnels that Palestinian militants have dug into Israeli territory. Dozens of tunnels, reportedly running dozens of miles long, have been constructed in attempts to infiltrate Israeli territory and carry out attacks, according to the Israeli military. "This is now a significant game changer," said Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus. Work on the "obstacle," as the military dubs it, began last summer. About 2.5 miles are already complete. Now the military says it is accelerating construction, working 24 hours a day, six days a week — breaking only for the Sabbath — to complete the wall by mid-2019."
           </p>
           <p>
            "On top of the underground barrier, Israel is also building an aboveground border fence. The government is installing sensor technology to detect when militants are tunneling close to the border, the military says."

            WHY SHOULD AMERICANS PAY FOR ISRAEL'S UNDER AND ABOVE GROUND BORDER WALL, WHEN CONGRESS WON'T FORK OVER A MEASELY $5 BILLION TO PROTECT OUR OWN CITIZENS?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Israel can spare $5 billion from their GENEROUS U.S. military aid package......Can't Israelis just ask Niki Rothschild for a donation?

            Cartel Tunnel to California Discovered in Mexico
           </p>
           <p>
            "Breitbart Texas recently reported on assertions by Roberto Mendez Meza, the vice president of the Association of Engineers in Mexico, which dispute a claim made by the Mexican Attorney General that there were 30 narco-tunnels found along the U.S.—Mexico Border between January 2010 to June 2017. Mendez Meza said that the likely number was 80. Mexicali is a stronghold for the Sinaloa Cartel and registered more than 60 homicides in 2018, most believed to be related to internal conflicts involving the cartel and regional gangs aligned with competing factions.."

            ""We know that the main function of these clandestine excavations is to get drugs across," Kevin Kelly, a special agent with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Nogales, Arizona, told Efe.... "Once they set up a tunnel it's a virtually secure way to move the drugs," Kelly said. He added that the cartels invest a lot of money and employ many people in the construction of and operation of a tunnel, and so when authorities discover and dismantle one it's a heavy blow to the traffickers.... "We've had all sorts of discoveries, ... tunnels that begin in one house or business on the Mexican side and end inside a house or establishment in the United States," he said. Kelly said that these tunnels are particularly sophisticated, and some of them have electricity and ventilation. "These organizations are always going beyond the (old) limits, they're always thinking about new ways to build and set up new tunnels," he emphasized."

              , I'm not a mod anymore, but I'm afraid the mods gonna pull the post, as the rules require to have at least a bit of text in the body of a post.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'd suggest self-deleting and reposting.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, you might want to refer to one of the recent posts about child trafficking at the border, so that the post can stay up.
             </p>
             <p>
              You need at to point out the connection to the Pizzagate investigation (specifically,
              <em>
               child
              </em>
              trafficking).

            The time is NOW to call Representatives. This is the first day of NO PAYCHECK from government shutdown. We need an UNDERGROUND wall to block the HUGE amount of tunnels coming from Mexico UNDER our border. The U.S. is ALREADY FUNDING ($3.8 BILLION/YEAR) an underground border wall for ISRAEL which will be completed mid-2019. It is being built by the Israeli MILITARY along the Gaza border and they are working 24/6 to get it done. IT WILL ALSO HAVE AN ABOVE GROUND FENCE and sensors to detect underground tunneling. DEMS AND REPUBLICANS APPROVED THIS 10 year military aid package under Obama. If we keep back a one time $5 billion from the aid (CHARITY), TRUMP can get his $5 billion and use it to start on a MORAL UNDERGROUND WALL. The govt. SHUTDOWN will end.
           </p>
           <p>
            Currently, the SHUTDOWN is blocking the FRAUD INVESTIGATION REGARDING VACCINES AND AUTISM. On Jan. 6th there was a BOMBSHELL ANNOUNCEMENT, that a key expert witness HAD FOUND THAT VACCINES DO CAUSE AUTISM in a subset of children. THIS WAS COVERED UP BY DOJ LAWYERS IN THE 2007 OMNIBUS VACCINE COURT AUTISM CASES, where this FRAUD was used to deny hundred of families compensation. The timing of the release of this sworn affidavit and  the government SHUTDOWN is SUSPECT. This will affect every child in America.

            "Israel Speeds Up Underground Border Wall To Block Gaza Tunnels" January 24, 20189:08 AM ET

           <p>
            "The Israeli military is speeding up construction of its first underground border wall. The 40-mile-long wall will run the length of Israel's border with the Gaza Strip to counter tunnels that Palestinian militants have dug into Israeli territory. Dozens of tunnels, reportedly running dozens of miles long, have been constructed in attempts to infiltrate Israeli territory and carry out attacks, according to the Israeli military. "This is now a significant game changer," said Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus. Work on the "obstacle," as the military dubs it, began last summer. About 2.5 miles are already complete. Now the military says it is accelerating construction, working 24 hours a day, six days a week — breaking only for the Sabbath — to complete the wall by mid-2019."
           </p>
           <p>
            "On top of the underground barrier, Israel is also building an aboveground border fence. The government is installing sensor technology to detect when militants are tunneling close to the border, the military says."

            WHY SHOULD AMERICANS PAY FOR ISRAEL'S UNDER AND ABOVE GROUND BORDER WALL, WHEN CONGRESS WON'T FORK OVER A MEASELY $5 BILLION TO PROTECT OUR OWN CITIZENS?
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Israel can spare $5 billion from their GENEROUS U.S. military aid package......Can't Israelis just ask Niki Rothschild for a donation?

            Cartel Tunnel to California Discovered in Mexico
           </p>
           <p>
            "Breitbart Texas recently reported on assertions by Roberto Mendez Meza, the vice president of the Association of Engineers in Mexico, which dispute a claim made by the Mexican Attorney General that there were 30 narco-tunnels found along the U.S.—Mexico Border between January 2010 to June 2017. Mendez Meza said that the likely number was 80. Mexicali is a stronghold for the Sinaloa Cartel and registered more than 60 homicides in 2018, most believed to be related to internal conflicts involving the cartel and regional gangs aligned with competing factions.."

            ""We know that the main function of these clandestine excavations is to get drugs across," Kevin Kelly, a special agent with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Nogales, Arizona, told Efe.... "Once they set up a tunnel it's a virtually secure way to move the drugs," Kelly said. He added that the cartels invest a lot of money and employ many people in the construction of and operation of a tunnel, and so when authorities discover and dismantle one it's a heavy blow to the traffickers.... "We've had all sorts of discoveries, ... tunnels that begin in one house or business on the Mexican side and end inside a house or establishment in the United States," he said. Kelly said that these tunnels are particularly sophisticated, and some of them have electricity and ventilation. "These organizations are always going beyond the (old) limits, they're always thinking about new ways to build and set up new tunnels," he emphasized."
