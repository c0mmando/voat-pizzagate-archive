<p>&quot;Zuckerberg is blocking vital truth ANNA-MARIE GORALCZYK·TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2017 Mark Zuckerberg is blocking my accounts as though it is fake news but it’s not fake and is real and is vital to life... and Zukerberg is blocking it because he is a part of a murder ring, raping children, killing people, and stealing inheritance and using scanned ID to insert into scene of crime etc...</p>
<p>he is blocking it because it is true and he is a pART OF A killer RING..if you want info or are attacked by his world wide gang... I will email you info anne.gorczyk@gmail.com</p>
<p>if trying to kill you, police will not help and he will try again and again AND AGAIN... UNTIL YOU ARE DEAD... SO DON’T TAKE HIS STALKERS LIGHTLY... IT IS SERIOUS&quot;</p>

<p>that is just to get things rolling. It is much much bigger as you will see when you review the Wikileaks documents. It spells it out, bloodlines, modern day relations and the psychology, methods and more.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here is the link to the series of documents. It implicates Stratfor, Elite Families, Oprah, Angelina, Jack the Ripper.... fucking everyone and also explains how the bloodlines work and the psychology of pedos and how to cover up or strategize.

<p>On Monday February 27th, 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing The Global Intelligence Files, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered &quot;global intelligence&quot; company Stratfor. The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal\'s Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor\'s web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt of the &quot;orangmen&quot; doc on the doc links on Wikileaks written by Anna G: This is the organization of the Monarchies that is also in cooperation with the Freemasons that our police, judges and politicians allow to molest and murder our children and extort our properties. They murder witnesses and police cover it up. It is destroying happiness &amp; freedoms for the majority so that a few can have child rape parties. The police enforce these crimes against us by these criminals and makes our laws worth nothing and due to this, when we pay tax, we are forced to pay for the molestation and murder of our own children. Further when we vote in Canada for a person that will not declare themselves a true Canadian in writing as illustrated in the Declaration of undivided leadership, this fool is voting for the molestation and murder of their own family. No politician in Canada has answered the questions in the Declaration posted on my wall. They all ignore it like a psychopath would. When a politician is able to answer it, you will know about it as I will tote there name proudly. I am a true Canadian, not a Monarchist.</p>',

            . . tl;wr . . We need to try hard not to, even inadvertently, screw over others' work by using attention-drawing post titles on our own work.
           </p>
           <p>
            Most posters here try very hard to create titles that follow common protocol. It creates a neutral space in which everyone can share their work equally, on a level playing field, creating posts which rise on the merit of their content alone. Much exceptional research here is overshadowed by hyperbolic titles, which, whether intentional or not, serves to push other posts down, sometimes into oblivion and often to the detriment of the kids we are trying to save. While everyone can get excited, no post is more important, urgent or valuable than any other here.
           </p>
           <p>
            The extraordinary hard work and effort of people on this forum is diminished by the use of hyperbolic titles (for example by the use of all or partial CAPS, !!!!!!, "** ****, and or exclamations of URGENT, BREAKING, DIG DIG DIG, THIS ONE TO THE TOP, #PODESTAFORPRISON (all in caps), etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I've posted my strong feelings on this in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatemods">
             v/pizzagatemods
            </a>
            , asking them to consider creating a new rule banning such titles. I've also left comments in a meta discussion on the topic, which a user created in
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagatewhateverhttps">
             v/pizzagatewhateverhttps
            </a>
            ://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1682030. If anyone is of like mind, please consider:
           </p>
           <pre><code>1 Also reaching out to the mods - 2 Also leaving comments in the meta discussion - 3 Also leaving reminders, similar to this one, in posts with hyperbolic titles
</code></pre>
           <p>
            I will continue to speak out on this until it becomes a new rule - or until I give up. At that point, I believe this will not be a neutral forum that highlights the most important research based on merit. Instead, in all likelihood it will eventually descend into a free for all. If you think I'm exaggerating head over to some of the reddit subs and take a look. It would have very different consequences here because reddit, in large part, involves sharing and opinions, while this is critical research directed at saving innocent lives that, by the hundreds, if not thousands, are being taken as we speak.

            Ontario Police are using Children's Aid Society to take kids from their parents whether they like it or not. This mother took her kid back and had a manhunt put out for her, as if SHE was the one hurting the kid. It's the fucking childcare in Ontario, they take people's kids away so easily and the parents have no say. Also the missing people list is VERY suspect, compare these two sites

            The church is very strange and quite new-age-y for a Christian church. I know they have a basement and recently in November of 2016 they had the parking lot filled with police cars (including the black Mercedes vans that look similar to what kids were being transported in). The school next to it also recently underwent construction. I wonder if there are a few "underground" ties in the literal sense between the two buildings. I contacted the detective that is in charge of the case and hope to hear back.

            OK. This document is strange. It is over 1000 pages long. It was created in 2006 and updated in 2007
           </p>
           <p>
            It has alot. One thing I am going to mention is Trump References (among other things)
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS WAS IN 2006. WAAAAAY before anyone EVER imagined Trump had political ambitions or woudl eventually become POTUS.  I have only looked at this briefly as it is huge. Dropping it here to get the Trumpophiles panties in a twist to counter this.

              Reference to Debbie Row (michael jacksons surrogate) Jennifer Aviado, Mary Aviado's twin sister, went to Monmouth University with Linda Quinn &amp; Deborah Rowe (womb of Michael Jackson , accused of pedophilia &amp; belonged to Dianetics

           </ul>
           <p>
            again, there are over 1000 pages. She sure knows alot about the current construct that is developing around human trafficking, organ harvesting and the role of CPS and other authories in this coverup. worth a look. I got the above after about 5 minutes. POsting now as I am trying to confirm the details of her court case outcomes and the status of her daughter.

            The care for the mentally ill, whether one is slightly mentally ill or severely mentally ill, is deplorable in the USA.  Patients are boomeranged back-and-forth, back-and-forth, and on and on it goes.  We are no better off than we were decades ago except for the fact that no one is lobototomized anymore and that there is a plethora of medications, many of which do more harm than good.  Psychotherapy is a joke, ya know, actually spending time, quality time, with a patient.  Even when you find a rare gem who does, forget about being institutionalized.  The inpatient care is a tragedy, and I would revel if I heard accolades about one institution in our country who made a difference with a significant mentally ill patient.  Now, I am really hoping to hear a response from a psychiatrist, or at the very least, a medical person who works in an inpatient or outpatient psychiatric setting.

           <p>
            excerpt - The writer &amp; the writers son was horribly molested in Children’s Aid care. The writers daughter, Annie Ivy-Lee Aviado b. May 10, 2000, more recently was abducted through the illegal use of these loopholes described herein causing criminal &amp; slanderous court Orders by the Freemason favoring judges. I am extremely alarmed for her well being, being aware of the illnesses plaguing those withholding her. My family is not alone, many of my neighbors are detrimentally affected by this psychopathic &amp; machine like criminal organization of loopholes which are not incidental or directed at just one family.

            Pedophilia rings are not uncommon. Many countries throughout the world have carried out busts of highly organized trafficking rings, most recently in Norway and Great Britain. The people involved in these rings are high-ranking politicians, celebrities, and distinguished athletes. For example, consider the case of Annie Ivy Lee Aviado, a Canadian girl who was abducted in 2004. Members of her family alleged that Annie’s abduction was covered up by the government, that the highest political offices, including the Attorney General of Ontario and police chiefs, were involved. While somebody may be quick to dismiss PizzaGate as a conspiracy or “fake news,” one should not dismiss the truth: trafficking rings exist and powerful agencies are involved.

            If all of Anna G.'s horrific experiences were true, she would more than likely be catatonic.  Her psychosis, in my non-psychiatrist opinion, resembles a combination of schizophrenia, paranoia, and mania.  Any psychiatrists out there who could address this?

             I am going to look into her information to confirm first... i have no doubt she is suffering mental illness. True or Not. Mental illness alone is no reason to doubt her claims. I am sure many survivors struggle with it every single day.  People who are heard, helped and then able to constructively get the informaiton out seem to be able to build a life again. (just like Cathy Obrien, Arizona Wilder and countless others)  If she is a victim... she deserves consideration that clearly no one has given her yet. I may leave this here and move on, but not until i finish check to see if her story check out with outside information.
            </p>
            <p>
             NO ONE listened to the victims we have heard of, for most of their lives. We only know about them because someone gave them the benefit of the doubt and did everything they could to confirm the story they tell with outside fact checks. I believe Anna Marie is one of those people. Proving any of this pizza related stuff has proved to be difficult in every single story or leak. We can only rely on the larger patterns of this construct and the links that we find that may or may not support it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Shit most of the world thinks ALL of this is nonsense and that WE as citizen investegators are completely nuts. If only they would check into things further they would see SOMETHING is going on. Most wont. Hopefully that is changing.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Anna G is correct. She is an untapped source and she is willing to talk about it. Here email and phone number are published. From what I can tell she has been at this since at least the early 2000's.  She has gone to court on this many times and has not yet been institutionalized (as far as we know) I am sure they thought she was crazy too. Why didnt they lock her up ?  She doesnt appear to have let up in almost 17 years.

            I am not a psychiatrist, but I am in the medical field.  After reviewing several posts on Anna G.'s facebook page, it is blatantly obvious that she manifests symptoms of extreme psychosis.  This is my first submission after lurking for the past 2 weeks.

             I agree, bouts of actual experiences mixed in with impossible ones. 
Not lying, but programmed to spout crazy things.

             I am not sure about her yet... but there is much to support her claims so far. I have found more and need to review  before i post.

            <p>
             Let me ask you this.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you were the victim of generational ritual abuse, kidnapping, rape, abduction, with a child that is the same (a prostitute involved in much more than prostitution) would not not exhibit symptoms of extreme psychosis????
            </p>
            <p>
             Would these acts not  cause psychosis? I think it would.

              by the way. I believe her daughter she references is a person she is following on her instagram page. She is definately a sex worker. And I think I found a story about her in regards to sex abuse and trying to sell her own child. Need to check for references further but I think that may be true. Does this not further support her claim if it is?
             </p>
             <p>
              The logic that is being applied in regards to ANna G  doesnt make sense to me. If you use these assumptions then it would make Cathy Obrien a liar. And many other victims. I woudl like someone to explain to me how they could expect ayone to be normal IF they did experience abuse to the levels that these women have. They would be damaged beyond belief and need serious care to even function in society. Instead, people just dismiss them as crazy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Isnt that part of the problem for victims of extreme abuse? Espeically ones with incredible stories to tell (like Cathy Obrien).
             </p>
             <p>
              We actually no nothing about Catherine Agnews real story either. Yet she is used as evidence of "crazy women" out there taling about things that are just too horrible to be believed. Again, the victims suffer with this logic. Somone has to belive them at some point if they are going to survive the trauma.

            My assessment: The OP brings this "find" with great excitement. A review makes it clear that they are the rants of a clearly crazy person, making no sense at all. If she is a true victim, the crazy communication may make some sense, but it is impossible to really understand all of this without more explanation or corroboration. The OP misrepresents all of the "data" as being something the intelligence community is interested in when, in fact, STRATFOR received this spam from this woman. I see no evidence that they sent anything related or seemed to be concerned with it. For some reason, the OP really focuses on the rants that implicate Trump. Is there a reason for this? It seems to point to more of an agenda than a search for information and the truth.

            Yes. Many have looked at this with a critical mind, realizing random rants spammed to STRATFOR. The poster finds this as conclusive, insinuating: "why the intelligence community is interested in this?" You cannot infer interest by someone who receives spam! Unless there is actually corroboration or explication with details, the rants look to be that of a crazy person. Maybe some truth is mixed into it, but good luck finding it in the word salad.

            I don't doubt that something is going on with this woman's life, and it wouldn't surprise me if people at Facebook were involved either but I went to her main FB page and it is up and she posted something as of March, 4th, 2017.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of times, powerbrokers will patch through someone as a proxy - they take the credit for the campaign and they may be an attack campaign leader yet they are not directly powered up. I doubt that Zuckerberg is as big as he is appearing to her, I deal with the main powerbrokers routinely and I haven't seen anything significant from him. He is likely proxy powered up by the Rothschilds.

             I am researching the MANY court cases she has filed in Canada. If she is a liar, she is persistant and has money to pursue this in the courts for many many years. She has sworn this stuff under oathe and appears to have not let up.
            </p>
            <p>
             To say that Zuckerberg is not BIG, is just insane to me. He "apparently" controls the largest social media platform in the history of the world. We know he has CIA connects (I think he is the figurehead assett for CIA) and very connected to the Zionists (aka Rothschilds)
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe that if you actually review her reports. Reserach the names she has mentioned and we take a look at all the court documents over the years it will all start to become more clear.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do not equate her with the Catherine Agnew type... yet. If anything that was my first impression but it is quickly dissipating. I believe she is for real. Remains to be seen. If she is, she is a key to breaking some aspects of this. If she is not... oh well. I think there is still something to learn here.

              When I said not that big, he is a billionaire but money is one thing. Real power is quasi-magical in this world, there is gang-stalking that works with phone calls. That's one thing, then there is COMPREHENSIVE immersion in quasi-gangstalking where the entire society (through toddlers/infants) are manipulated to totally immerse you in what appears to be an outrageously large network of gangstalkers that follow you everywhere. That tends to be a blend of a few real gangstalkers and mostly "magic" - really the mind control network that is accessible to those who are privileged enough. Like I said Zuckerberg probably can't manipulate those things directly. Yet he probably is seemingly chiming in to her brain when the attacks are going on - often times a voice changer is used so what she hears is most likely a Rothschild minion. I have confirmed that he is powered by the Rothschilds since my last post. The Rothschilds use the Queen to turn on the societal immersion quasi-gangstalking street theater that she seems to be dealing with. The Rothschilds like trying their hands at propping people up, especially quickly - to try to make someone totally fearful of someone who is seemingly omnipotent when in reality they are mostly doing other things (although they are likely involved).

            So, in looking at the wikileaks link you provided with all the attached files (
            <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/53/531436_news-u-won-t-find-in-the-news-.html">
             https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/53/531436_news-u-won-t-find-in-the-news-.html)
            </a>
            ), it seems as though the only reason this showed up in the stratfor file dump is because the person sent it to "
            <a class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="deadbbaca8b7bdbb9eadaaacbfaab8b1acf0bdb1b3" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection">
             [email protected]
            </a>
            " in addition to many other people.
           </p>
           <p>
            The email address the files were sent from is "genetic.crime.mapping1000 (at) gmaill.com".
           </p>
           <p>
            If you go to the link you provided and open the document "47078 47078_1 Help Solve Crimes.doc 19KiB", you will see semi-odd instructions to create an account in hotmail.  The instructions say to call the account genetic.crime.mapping101 or 100, 105, 106, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems to me that the owner of "genetic.crime.mapping1000" mail account is trying to get attention from someone and get someone to react to all the attachments.  Basically SPAM email.
           </p>
           <p>
            I make no judgement for or against the information in that particular email, but unless this was spread far and wide by internal Stratfor people, I would personally mark this find as "somewhat interesting but spend my research time elsewhere for now".
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT:  Also the first attachment to the email was actually written By Anna-Marie Goralczyk.  It says it under the photo in the document.

            no. that is not what the emails say. They are pulling for various sources. You havent read the documents clearly.....also look at the dates.PIZZGATE and PEDOGATE did NOT exist at the time. Her Grandmother is the one who revealed that Jack the Ripper was actually not one perp, but a group of elite. I am researching her history and family relations now and IT ALL CHECKSOUT SO FAR. I will continue and then post. She is a generational whistleblower. She appears to have actually been kidnapped and abused as a child as covered int he Story of Anna Doc. CONTEXT.

            Have you asked yourself why the intelligence community is interested in this? Wait until you read it and then ask that question. The names matter. The methods matter. Her history matters. There are millions of crazies out there but Stratfor and the Intelligence community does not send out info on them in this venue. These are all relevant questions. At this point is ANYTHING she is saying out in the realm of fantasy? Elite Bloodlines, Pedophilia, Generaltional Abuse, Abduction and Kidnapping, Usurping her Inheritance, Organ Trafficking, ALL OF IT. FITS. PERIOD. I dont know any of it for sure but I am sure getting tire of dismissal with no investigation or awareness of patterns. This fits the patterns. This is intelligence community briefing and once you get through all the documents (which I have not) and the associated links AND the Global INtelligence community interest. It starts to make sense....
           </p>
           <p>
            If you had a truth to tell (WAY BEFORE THIS PIZZAGATE PEDOGATE STARTED, seh has been at this for YEARS) wouldnt you try to go contact many journalists to be heard? I would. Would she be the first victim to be dismissed as crazy? I think not. THAT IS THE MODUS OPERANDI of the evil system. It all fits.

             there is a document there that talks about a murder and Oprah being a Matriarch and distant relation to an elite bloodline. They are usurpers. They have the bloodlines traced and family trees up to modern times. It talks much. Not the first time we have heard this shit about Oprah. I need to find that passage adn will post.

           <p>
            Ok, that's insane. Trump trained her daughter to kill? Occam's Razor:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Trump isn't really a Real Estate magnate, his bailiwick is training assassins.

            2) This woman is nuts.

            Sounds like my brother... Who is schizophrenic. I am Canadian and a monarchist ... Does that mean I am stealing from her too?  Harper was a cold fish but that ERT stuff is just strange. Waging war against First Nations in Renton NB? Well if quelling a protest with rubber bullets is war... then I guess??

            OK PEOPLE. Focus on the Global Intelligence Files Documents NOT her recents Trump Posts. Apparently many peoples brains stop working if someone even implies there may be something Off with Trump. I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA, and neither to any of you. THe information that Anna G shares goes FAR beyond just one man. What is here allows anyone to research why Stratfor and the intelligence community is interested in Anna G. Here email is right on her facebook and twitter page if you would like to contact her and ask her about that shit yourself. She encourages contact if you have questions.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am going to block anyone that is a Trump Defender. I am not for or against... I am about getting the information out and if your political sensibilities are damaged at new information that may contradict your warped world view then you belong on Facebook and NOT HERE. I have really had enough so self educate or go bye-bye. Lets focus on what is imortant. K?

            I was just deeply questioned about my identity by fb staff. Over some anti-cnn post I made.  This week I have stopped researching and starting torturing trolls, with knowledge.  FB does nothing to prevent pedo's or prostitution on their site.

              Same here. I feel like I am out numbered 20 to 1 though. I have noticed they gas out after a few hours. The key is not to give them anything personal about yourself.

             Of course they don't. For FB, like Twitter, pedos, prostitution and child trafficking are PART OF THEIR BUSINESS MODELS. As well as, I may add, their corporate (ethno) philosophy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Read cantsleepawink's THORN series for more on that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some brave anon in november I think exposed a massive pedo subculture on Twitter. She got permabanned herself.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because they know exposing and removing them will cost many billions of stock market value. And of course hurt their evil agendas.
            </p>
            <p>
             And the pedos, pervs and traffickers will just move on to Snapchat. You know, where these people are now

            I don't know what to think of it, she sounds a bit like "Catherine Agnew", remember her? She says extraordinary things but offer no evidence. I'm not saying she is lying but it is a possibility.
           </p>
           <p>
            Things like:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Zuckerberg is stalking people who use Facebook to rape children, force them into prostitution and kill parents.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            looks way over the top and fishy to me. I know that Zuckerberg is probably involved in very shady stuff... but to say that he HIMSELF would be stalking people who use facebook to "rape children" doesn't make a lot of sense. Suppose the guy is a sick pervert, I'm sure he would not have to do any "dirty work" like that. Low level pieces of shit could provide him with all the children he needs.
           </p>
           <p>
            And  the attack on Trump seems completely random. What did he do exactly? Just wild accusations without any details and she mixes it up with Oprah and the pope and it all becomes a mess. It's hard to take this seriously.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the same time I want to be cautious because I don't want to accuse this woman of lying... but she will have to provide more details otherwise she will not be taken seriously

             Exactly the first thing I thought - and I didn't even go to her page.  Just while reading OP's description of her, I thought Catherine D'agnew saying royal bloodline etc.  I suppose it's possible these women are so scrambled from the horrors and experiments they've undergone :(
            </p>
            <p>
             It's very hard to believe, but I know I'd be a complete nutjob if I were a victim of these evil perverts.  I think they mess them up so badly that they are never taken seriously or they end up in mental institutions or on the streets talking to themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'd like to hear from a psych ward nurse and social workers that handle people on the streets and shelter workers.  They may have heard stories over the years that sound completely looney, but maybe some of these stories all have similarities and maybe the similar stories all come from pizzagate and mkultra victims.

             I got the same impression halfway through her post. Not to seem paranoid, could it be a plant from those attached to pedo rings for whatever reason? Maybe to send people off on a goose hunt.

             Does it not seem to anyone that suckerberg is under mind control??  The dull look is what makes me suspicious.  Beware of those who are all of a sudden worth billions and billions of dollars and then donate that money to their own inititiative, just like the clintons.  The world's people need to unplug from FB, but they won't.

             Tnat was a post of interest on FB. Go look at the Wikileaks documents and all of her communications.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is going to get everyone who LOVES Trumps panties in a bunch. HOw bout skip that and go to the Wikileaks. THen answer your own questions.
            </p>
            <p>
             And SHE will have to provide more details? SHE HAS. They are in the Wikileaks I linked in the sub. Sounds like YOU will have to do your homework to figure it out. Isnt that what this is about? Spoonfeed it to you isnt a fair request when it is aleady there.

               you know what dude. I wont. This stuff is important and just the mere mention of Trump has made people lose there fucking minds and ignore the rest. I am not going to waste time anymore on that shit. I am going to blast them and move on. Be a critical thinker or not. I really dont care. I am going to continue to block mind controlled slaves. They take away from all productivity. So you calm down and do the work. I am done humoring people who have no interest in solutions.

                 yes. I am just PISSED OFF as I am being attacked left and right. Its trolls and I shouldnt care. But I am getting to the place where I have to leave this stuff behind. I am compassionate for those that are innocent or not in the know. But to know about all this and attack someone trying to help and it is getting to me. I am about to walk away. I am literally seething at the messages I have been sent. It is taking me out of any kind of good place. I am different today with all the threats. Looking into this for too long is fucking me up. I am sure that is the point of most of these attacks, but I am just not able to handle it. SOrry... we all have a breaking point.

                  I took a week long break when I went out of town and though there was a constant nagging that in my head that I hadn't "checked in", it was definitely a needed break.  I came back much better.  Just looking away from a screen and getting fresh air really helped Avd getting out etc.  I worked in my flowerbeds too in the beautiful Soring weather and that was really therapeutic.

                  I'm at a HUGE Trump fan, but I will put a child before politics, of course.  I'm not ready to condemn him on this one lady's claim though.  Some of what she says could be true and some false - not that she purposefully lies, but she's likely got a brain that is misfiring a lot.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  One thing I've noticed with pizzagate is that the same names keep popping up in the corporations and the bank accounts and nonprofits and restaurants and foreign countries And adoption agencies etc etc etc
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So far, Trump's name has only popped up this one time.  Not saying it is or isn't true, just pointing that out

                  No worries, I need a break too and I'm not even a hardcore researcher. I've heard this from many in the short time I've been looking into this stuff. It's rough. If you need a break just take one and then come back. No fun getting in that "bad place," been there done that.

                   Its not. I am broken from it. I am going to take a break after today. I simply must finish this fact checking on Anna G.  Something in me needs to finish at least that. My anxiety is crazy right now. It could be frequency based. Whatever it is.... i need a minute to regroup. I am not cut out for this apparently.....

                    Go back to those rivers and streams for a bit. Remember that's why you left your other life. It was a blessing to be delivered from that, don't go "back there" by taking the world upon your shoulders. That will be $50.00. A real bargain :)

            Sorry, you lost me at Trump made my daughter a killer!
If you go look at all the twitter posts that Catherine Agnew has posted she lists names of a lot of people. However, there is no way all those she lists have ever came into contact with her as she claims.
MK Ultra mind controlled people have been programmed to sound crazy. Often the handlers will give them names of famous people so that if questioned or start talking they will sound crazy.
Not saying this girl has not been abused, but the names she throws out needs to be thoroughly looked at.

             the information is there should you choose to read it. Go to wikileaks. LOook at the documents. It is not Trump focused so you can release your anal lock. At that point you can decide for yourself if she is credible -- and her subsequent claims.

              I agree needs a look into. Just pointing out that there is a similar pattern of throwing names out, like Catherine.

                Not lying. The handlers they say program these people to sound crazy. So, mentioning people they quite possibly could not know, it makes them sound crazy.

             Yeah but Stratfor or Wikleaks has NOTHING on Agnew. She has no history. Anna Marie Goralcyk is ALL OVER wikileaks and Stratfor (and the receivers of these emails are who is who)
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition, Anna G is articulate. Read the Global Intelligence Files. Cathering Agnew can barely string a sentence together. Go read the files.
            </p>
            <p>
             Stratfor has sent out NUMEROUS emails regarding analysis of Anna G to the intelligence community dating back at least to 2011. So to me your dismissal is bunk. Better get to digging....
            </p>
            <p>
             hard to swallow because you are a believer in Trump and you dont want to know. Well, it warrants a looksie considering the history on this woman. Review the documents.

              I agree she is of interest to these people. I just see a pattern like with Catherine Agnew so many names she throws out, they just could not possibly all be known personally to her.
So, possibly this one above like Catherine throws out random names she hears on news, TV ect...

               lets get ahold of her numerous court filings/cases (she is under oathe and has notarized filings)
              </p>
              <p>
               Lets research a bit of her family history including her grandmother of the same name.
              </p>
              <p>
               Lets research her kidnapping story from the Global INtelligence files. There are enough names ther to determine if this is real or not from old media reports.
              </p>
              <p>
               These 3 things are far more than anything available on Catherine Agnew. Catherine Agnew has never been found in any WIki's or anywhere else. The Goralczyk's are EVERYWHERE (Warsaw) her family tree is high up elites. I actually think Anna G has a real story to tel which is why she has never given up. She doesnt strike me as the kid of crazy Agnew is. That is my gut and my observation.

             It lost me too... it is what this woman posted. A free thinker has the ability to change beliefs based upon new informaiton. Do not be partisan in this. Ther are PLENTY of reasons to believe this woman. It is one post and it shocked me as well. Why should we throw it all out because it disagrees with your political views. Dig further and we all may have to revise our view of Mr. Trump.

               WHO GIVES A SHIT if you have your viewpoint on who/what Trump would do. That post was an anecdote from her page. CLEARLY not the focus of this Sub. Go read the Wikileaks Global INtelligence files I have posted on this woman. THEN you can decide why STratfor and all those others in intelligence seem to be VERY interested in Anna Marie.
              </p>
              <p>
               Holy fuck I thought that there were more Free Thinkers here capable of putting aside personal bias and just doing the investigation. PLease remove yourself from this thread if all you want to do is dismiss and promote Trump. We HOPE he is a white hat. BUT DO WE REALLY KNOW? NO. WE DONT. AND NEITHER DO YOU. Start digging or shutup and go away. COMMON SENSE.  I am getting really fucking sick of Trolls, Egos and partisan oriented responses. ITS JUST COUNTER PRODUCTIVE TO SOLVING THIS HUGE FUCKING CONSPIRACY. I really am sick as fuck of it....   NOT HERE. GO TO FACEBOOK WITH THAT SHIT.

           <p>
            TRUMP QUESTION: Why are you stealing my inheritance and raping my children ?
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Trump... answer me straight without the media... WHY are you robbing me? Why hAVE YOU TRAINED MY DAUGHTER TO KILL CHILDREN FOR YOU? wHY DID YOU HONE MY DAUGHTER INTO A KILLER PSYCHOTOPATH FOR YOU?
           </p>
           <p>
            IF YOUR SO RICH, WHY ARE YOU STEALING FROM ME?
           </p>
           <p>
            So these are just some clues as we move into looking deeper into Stratfors and others in the intelligence community sharing ANna Maries info to a large intelligence network from as far back as 2011.
           </p>
           <p>
            I need to break on this but hoping we can get some dig assistance. There is so much in these documents.

           <p>
            "I can never stop investigating my family until they are arrested because they are psychotic and will not stop crime against me and it started years before the issues of the will that I have posted to creating safety and will continue after because the police have given them open approval to commit crime against me and are in agreement to fail to protect and it is to hide that they are the pedophile ring of Ontario ungoverned and also being Isis which is: Crisis and corruption set into the family and those corrupt 
members of the families criminally organized together. Multicultural Ontario appears to be a centre point for Isis formation. Infiltrated from within the family lines through monarchies and Vatican joint efforts = Isis."
           </p>
           <p>
            "They only teach how to drive just before you are allowed to drive but they are teaching sex a decade before the children are allowed because they want the children to be prostitutes because then they get pedophilia in silence. By making the children feel like prostitutes, they guarantee the children will remain silent to being raped because this transfers the blame from the pedophile to the child in the child’s mind, this is in no way prostitution, it is pressurized misdirecting human trafficking."

            Excerpt from Jack the Ripper Document:
           </p>
           <p>
            Jack the Ripper: a live machine of intent consisting of human organization in absence of conscience? Under influence of the Monarchies, to psychopathically murder under particular guidelines &amp; for particular purposes with police agreement to succeed?
           </p>
           <p>
            It seems that a “Jack the Ripper” forms &amp; occurs when a number of persons in the authorities want to dispose of someone for whatever purpose, send organized instruction through their hidden contacts within the general citizens &amp; public services to work together as a group methodically &amp; secretly to target &amp; destroy. No one seems to know where it comes from, seems like bad luck when targeted or witnessing events because it gives a feeling of to come from everywhere &amp; nowhere simultaneously or in a particular order or sequence, before &amp; after the fact, to make cause &amp; a predetermined effect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Investigators always look for one perpetrator, not an organized group. “Jack the Ripper” is a group of people however organized who each agree to play a role before, during &amp; after, in organization to make an altered appearance of cause &amp; effect to a targeted persons life. Each of the group that has contact with the person, directly or indirectly, agrees to do something that ought not to be done or not to do something that ought to be done for the agreed intent of creating a cause for the purpose of effect, not always being murder.
           </p>
           <p>
            The results could be that a teenager has disappeared or child abducted (organs?), there is an apparent suicide, false staged arrests (incarseration is an alternate method of disposal – to get someone dispensed with), a car accident with weird details that don’t add up, a mugging / murder, a drowning, an overdose or the name sake of Ripper to cut. It seems to me, now a days, in criminal organization, that the “methods of disposal” rotate to melt in with normal &amp; random statistics of occurrences to not create a “spike” in some way that would allert the public as the events labelled “Jack the Ripper” did.
           </p>
           <p>
            For a “Jack the Ripper” to happen there would need to be a member of the group at each of the pertinant policing, witnessing &amp; authority contact points of the matters to be in agreement to misdirect the evidence as the matters unfold &amp; to continue to cover it up after the fact. When a Jack the Ripper happens, in my experience, it is an issue of harm “to pounce” by a group upon an unsuspecting target, where the police are in agreement, carrying out or facilitating to allow the crime to occur in a concealed &amp; misinforming manner.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe that those that have studied or publicized the Ripper cases have an extra reason for doing so. Some where the perpetrators, some were continuing the crimes handed down through generations, some have loved ones that were victims but none will admit to the reasons while studying. I am studying it because I believe my family is a major part of the Ripper ring today that I’m biologically connected to and that this group has been trying many endeavors to have me killed and at times falsely accused of crimes I did not commit to get rid of me because they had organized the abduction and molestation  of my children &amp; need to get rid of me as a witness. I believe the first attempt against my life was apx. 1976 when I was 12 yrs old. These family members are Allison, Jillian Jackson, Jaqueline &amp; Rick Siwek, Angela &amp; Stefan Siwek, Joseph Anthony Goralczyk, Catherine Goralczyk, Deborah Ann Walker Smith, Kathy Luke, Christine Goralczyk, James Goralczyk, Sarah Addesso Peterson, Adam Addesso, Ron, Lynn &amp; Josephine Richardson, Dr. Manitius to Krista, Gary O’Neill and more…..They are criminally organized and cannot be deemed a family as they attack their own members that will not agree to live in principle’s of psychopathy. The group and it’s extended parts spill into society in such a way that there are hundreds of victims. I hope to save future victims, including my own children, by reporting to the public what I know before they could harm me for silence. Living with terror is not quality life.
           </p>
           <p>
            Throughout this study I have placed at the bottom of entries a questions line which includes i. possible name changes &amp; ii. Persons of interest involved with issues of my life of difficulty that may be of problem to others in society. These further query names are further studied and can be seen by you by going to the public accounts listed at the end of the last part of this article.  It is astounding that the connections are too close knit to be considered at random and there lies terrible danger for anyone targeted who may be in ignorance of not knowing the truth. Study &amp; know &amp; stay alive. I study with no secrets &amp; fully admit that the base of the Jack the Ripper gang of today is my family &amp; why I study &amp; report to the public. I hope that the public uses this information for survival long after I expire as I know this gang intends to carry on in the future as they have through the long past. I have experienced, witnessed, studied and I am now reporting as fast as possible. By you also helping to investigate &amp; distribute the information we, together can safe many lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            I did notice that when Larisa Belekova was murdered Feb. 2010 in Toronto that it appeared to me by things people did &amp; said in the area that they knew that Larisa would be murdered. It appeared to me that when officer Ryan Russell was killed the people in the community were happy. In multiple times when I narrowly escaped the plans of the Ripper gang, I noticed people gathering to watch before hand. At one attempted against me that failed May 28, 2010, there were 19 people, that are my immediate neighbors, gathered to watch me die. This is because a large number of persons of the community are members of the Ripper gang &amp; are receiving inside information &amp; treat the murder as reality entertainment in psychopathy. It’s time to dig for the truth of who is who. Don’t let the secrecy of style Ripper adoption records get in the way. Studying psychopathy can help to understand the mind set of gang members whom are showing themselves in the medias everyday.
