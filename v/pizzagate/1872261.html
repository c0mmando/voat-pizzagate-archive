WASHINGTON, May 6, 1996— William E.

<p>When Colby vanished in rough waters on a late-night, solo canoe trip in 1996, local sheriffs ruled out suicide before they even found his body.

            I read that he was taken by a SEAL team, and eventually killed.  I am not sure who killed him.  The SEAL team then put his body back in the water.  It was not until later that the SEAL team realized who he was.

             And Kay talks about how the Seals are initiated by having to make a hit. Not really any different than a street gang. I doubt Colby was actually ever canoeing. If Seals killed him I highly doubt they didn't know who he was. They probably did kill him and it was extra points to get a valuable target. How better to show off your assassination skills AND send a message.

            Colby wasn't a saint, by any stretch of the imagination.  He was one of the leaders in the Phoenix Program in Vietnam.  The Phoenix Program was the CIAs war on civilians whereas the US Army would fight the NV Army.  They used terror tactics of bombing cookouts, torturing people, and psychological warfare tactics that were very brutal.  Douglas Valentine wrote a very good book about it.  A couple of the soldiers for this program came back to the US and became serial killers - some say they were programmed to kill on purpose, to stop the 60s hippy movement (Dave McGowan - "Programmed to Kill")

             Very interesting book.
I think it describes what is going on in a Scientific way without being so rigid that the facts put me to sleep.
It explains a lot.
This would be a good book to promote.
I sent it to my disbelieving son...we will see if he bites...lol

             You are right.  So, Colby must have learned about the Luciferians a long time ago.

            So many people killed, its really is covert war. Kay Griggs (somehow she is always relevant) talked a lot about Colby, that she was  protected by him but then he oddly died and she had to move in with Sarah McClenden who saved her life.

             I believe it was Kay Griggs that told the story about Colby being taken by the SEALS.

              I have no idea, I don't think so, or she is living in hiding. I think at some point they got to her because there is a website with a report that an interviewer tried to ask her questions and she was incoherent, either to discredit her or because some other reason or health I don't know.  I think her 8 hour video is truth as she came to understand it and with Sibel Edmonds, between the two it explains how pizzagate got so pervasive and effective. People are rewarded financially and with power for being corrupt.
