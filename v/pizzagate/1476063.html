            Well, there's that one photo of a laser beam, but it didn't look like anything special to me. I don't remember the story being all that relevant, but I could see a police state going all out, and it does feel like we are expecting things to finally be able to change in the sense that the government has to admit it is incompetent in the most critical ways. The internet may have made that an inevitability, and it could have been a matter of the right kind of election coming along to change the mood.
           </p>
           <p>
            The story was interesting, but it wasn't deep enough. John Titor gave us no conception of how to accept the paradoxical nature and impossibility of time travel. If he wanted us to prepare or enable him to change an outcome, what did he really give us to go on or what indications were there of his importance? In essence, the only lesson he left with us, is that we can't rely on any event nor person to prepare or guide us for what we will face. Albeit, great change is possible even though the grim nature and coldness of the structures in this world makes us feel insignificant or trapped. That relates to how scary Pizzagate is. No matter how much we think we know nor how wide this scandal can be blown open, it's not clear that we have a solid path forward and can actually change the trajectory of the monster that is taking us for a ride. In fact, this shadow government has long dictated the course of this country. We are only now climbing the streamers, the belly, and the hard-to-reach head of this beast to see the dark places to which we were being lead, but that doesn't mean we can simply take control.
           </p>
           <p>
            One more thing: I don't think that Russia is a people's government, so if it came to relying on them to support a fight in the name of the American people, there would certainly be a price to pay.
