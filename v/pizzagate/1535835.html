            I've been called a nut and a racist/alt-right for mentioning pizzagate in California.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's easy to believe CNN that Russians hacked the election, even though there is no proof, or any solid evidence, or circumstantial evendence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yet, when there are emails, pictures, people involved are being convicted pedos themselves, and many high ranking politicals in other countries getting arrested for child sex abuse, it's "fake" and "racist".
           </p>
           <p>
            California is a cesspool of liberal intolerance and ignorance. Buy into the CNN anti-Trump shit, even though they can't find anything bad on him, yet ignore the countless faults with Clinton.

            i think this is a mistake. pizzagate is a word to use to preach to the choir. Anyone you need to persuade has an MSM meaning of the word, No new arguments introduced, still reprogramming the same words "pizzagate" "fake news" basically you are advertising for them.   You have to say something new, reframe it to own it, at least create a real question of conflict more than just saying "not."

            Get someone to film it and post it on youtube. You'll reach more people, inspire others to do the same. People will have proof that you're doing what you claim and you can even set up a patreon. I'd help you with this, but I'm not in the states.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just an idea. Do whatever works for you. It's great what you're doing. Don't give up. Take a break when you need it, but never give up.

            What's done is done. Prayers for your mission. I'll consider funding, with designation of hiring my cousin Vinny for when some local Sheriff stops you at a red light and "finds" some "evidence" in your glove compartment. And/or, if it comes to worse, designation for a steady-handed, legally-licensed bodyguard. I wish you'd sit tight a while longer, at least until after Jan 20.

               Any one of us can be 8 people at once.. Anon is a choice. Anon is bulletproof. A man is only flesh. Anon is immortal. A man is weak. The sacrifice of anon is irrelevant.. Anon respawns.. The sacrifice of a man is the ultimate price.. This battle must spill into the streets eventually.. Why not now? when they are off balance

            At first I was like "wow voat what an amazing place" but the mods here are a little harsh. I mean this isn't college. we don't really have to impress some shill professor. Oh and by the way using a source in the real world without apa formatting is called collaboration instead of plagiarism. I'm all for keeping content legit but they should def let more slide than they do.

             Wow that's a certification that must let you have a baby zoo. something I saw a picture of on one of the cia workers (or something along those lines) a while back. Is there a better site than voat for pizzagating or maybe it really is time to find one.

            what do you mean "deleted by mods"?  please provide a link the post that was deleted.  even if a mod deleted it, it would have been a mod (singular), not mods, plural.  we don't confer much with each other on posting-rule enforcement.  that would be too cumbersome.

             I get that your strict and focused on good research but can you let some conspiracy shit fall through the cracks every once in a while because sometimes it leads to breakthroughs. Half of the "conspiracies" that used to go down on reddit turned out to be true and excellent leads in pizzagate.

                 putting a number down as a comment is pretty weak. Written explanations should be required. Also, often times the rules are not broken. Unless shills can create thousands of upvote accounts let the platform do its job.

                  that's not accurate.  we explain how the rule was broken, and/or how the submitter can fix the post and resubmit.

                 That seems a bit odd.  You downvoat 25% more subs than you upvoat?  If you're not supportive of our efforts here, wtf are you doing modding it?

              "Main culprits"?  For enforcing reasonable submission-quality rules?  I want to know who the "culprits" are that keep posting effortless posts that break our basic rules, trying to forum-slide and bury useful content.  Yesterday we got flooded with porn.  Around the same time today, we got flooded with general rule-breaking shitposts.  You should be thanking us for working our asses off to maintain standards in this sub.  Just because I'm one of the most dedicated mods doesn't make me a "culprit." And OTPROPHET just started, lol.

               I read a LOT of what's posted here, and I find the the rules for posting becoming more important every day. I have no doubt this site is scrutinized, categorized, by highly paid and highly-skilled lawyers, hired by powerful, black-hearted people building a case for a hard dismissal of Pizzagate. It's possible for one small issue to lead to some legal disaster if not handled carefully. There's lots of well-meaning but poorly-/falsely-presented info out there elsewhere, and THIS PLACE needs to be as real as it gets. Who knows in what way the content here might be presented to a grand jury someday. I see a need for great care. Mods stating reasons for deletion is part of that, and as long as they do that, there's always the option of correcting the problem and reposting. So, THANK YOU MODS, for working your asses off to maintain standards on this sub. I wish US ALL a happy 2017, with results soon forthcoming. I'm proud to be able to include myself as one of the "us," and will toast y'all as I crack my champagne when the shit hits the fan.

            You can't scrap together $500? Dude, it's awesome you're motivated to help but asking for money turns people off. The Truth can't be bought. Do what you can online. Create the digital graphics for pamphlets, posters and memes etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then instead of going to Washington DC start a threat where you ask people in DC to copy the graphics you made to save them the steps of doing it themselves.

             People agree to all kinds of stuff online and don't do it irl.. And apparently not otherwise I wouldn't be asking would i? Irl activism isn't free.. It takes a budget.
