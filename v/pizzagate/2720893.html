MGK when he was 22 tweeted this about Eminem\'s 16 year old daughter Hailie Scott.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok so I just saw a picture of Eminem\'s daughter....and I have to say she\'s hot as fuck, in the most respectful way possible cuz Em is King. That pedo tweet greatly affected his career for a long time and he had problems from then on getting signed on or hired.</p>
<p>&quot;Machine Gun Kelly Says His 2012 Tweet About Eminem’s Daughter Still Affects His Career&quot;</p>

<p>He also said it affected his relationships.</p>

<p><a href="https://hiphopwired.com/483790/machine-gun-kelly-eminems-daughter/">https://hiphopwired.com/483790/machine-gun-kelly-eminems-daughter/</a></p>
<p>This is what MGK had to say on it.</p>
<p>“Pictures of that had came out and I’m like 21-years-old,” Machine Gun Kelly recalls to the crew of Ebro In The Morning. “I’m like, ‘Oh my God. She’s beautiful but all respect due. Eminem is king,\'” What’s wrong with that? Is there a 15-year age gap where I’m a creep for that?”</p>
<p>“Certain people took it and ran with it and hyped it up,” he says. “Certain people won’t even listen or review this joint. Certain places you won’t even hear Machine Gun Kelly on. Certain things won’t even happen. A friend of mine said it best yesterday. They said, ‘Why do you care? You came in the industry blackballed. You already came in with everyone hating you.\'”</p>
<p>Well he wrote his distrack to Eminem called Rap Devil. Rap Devil has a picture of MGK hiding one eye and putting up satanist horns.</p>

<p>Eminem is a satanist as well no doubt. He also does the all seeing eye many times.</p>

<p>Well in the new song Eminem full on calls MGK a satanist. This is the verse.</p>
<p>&quot;Kelly, they\'ll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin\' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (yeah)&quot;</p>

<p>So here\'s two good examples of two satanists calling out each other, with one of them making pedo comments towards the others daughter. The distrack response that Eminem put out came out today and is so popular it broke the YouTube comments on it and has become one of the most popular videos ever watched in one day. The satanists are calling each other out.</p>

              endless education of the normies. why not subcontract that work out? you add nothing new on purpose, then hide behind this word shill. here is a free education: people who use words like shill and terms like lol...well it's just plain lame and obvious that your a boring keyboard jockey.

               Dude I am done talking to you. I have done posts on everything I could. I did research the Dutroux Affair, The Franklin coverup. Dan Schneider and Nickelodeon, Brooke Shields, Heather O Rourke and Judith Barsi, SNCTM, Renegade, Lt. Michael Aquino, The Bohemian Grove, Moloch, and WorldCorpo. I went through the whole web to find every government official who spoke about Pizzagate. I run a Pizzagate channel that I post on all the time exposing this shit.

               When I was a semi large YouTube channel I started waking my fanbase up. It was not even a Pizzagate focused channel it was an apocalyptic media one. I was banned a few weeks after I posted a Pizzagate red pill video that had 100,000 views.

                  It truly is a shame that your mind, once again, is incapable of abstract thought. Perhaps people have older accounts? Dun dun dun!  Research posts? Yawn, middle school was a long time ago and your a real do nothing.

                  Bleep blorp well I typed shit and looked it up and stuff. Yawn. Minor league.

                  You simply can't stop projecting that word shill onto yourself, can you?

                 <p>
                  oh, and nice trying to dodge you not taking any direct action. your keyboard has to have one of those gel pad wrist rest things on it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  we won't stop seeing through you and everyone's bullshit, question dodging and fear. so, any direct action yet?

             They are all most likely raped and made to do the most horrific things. It's apart of the blackmail. I hope not all. I hope people  that fought it and died like Chris Cornell, Chester Bennington, and Avicii haven't or at least broke their programming and fought back and tried to expose all of this shit.
