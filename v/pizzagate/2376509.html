            You should co-ordinate with existing groups such as vets for child rescue to get something like this done.  They take donations and have the resources .

            Ahem - which pizzagaters do you mean? Everybody here is worried about child rape and trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I posted a submission yesterday about the conviction of a British politician who produced and distributed child porn, people here were really upset that LE and court didn't seem to be interested in where he got the children from and what happened to them (as usual).
           </p>
           <p>
            Apart from that, great idea.
