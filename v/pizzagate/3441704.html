<blockquote>
<p>It was 1993 or 1994 when I first encountered Jean-Luc Brunel, the controversial French modeling agent, at a then-trendy South Beach restaurant called The Strand in Miami. A table near mine, set for six, expanded to seat ten, then shrank for eight, then enlarged to fit a party of twelve, and was finally occupied, as I finished my meal, by a pack of extremely young women, teenagers, really, with the willowy frames and lovely faces of neophyte models, and a smaller number of older men who appeared to be … well … smug probably sums it up best.</p>
<p>A quarter century later, I was reminded of that dinner when Brunel suddenly riveted the world’s attention in the hours immediately before the suicide of the notorious pervert pederast Jeffrey Epstein, when it was alleged that the Frenchman had provided underage women to the very freaky financier...</p>
<p>...But there’s more to this story than the handful of damning quotations the papers have lifted from Model, from and about the man sometimes described as a rabbateur, i.e . one who beats the bushes during a hunt to drive game out into the open. There is the videotape of a 60 Minutes segment from 1988—long suppressed by legal order—that exposed him as an alleged serial abuser of young women, for instance; interviews with competitors who described him as a serial rapist; and a 28-page transcript of our taped interview in which I asked about the charges that Brunel was way more loco than parentis with the young women in his charge, as well as his oft-reported fondness for the Champagne of bottled drugs, cocaine. </p>
<p>His assurances of his innocence then were barely credible, but I felt a responsibility to report them alongside the sordid charges against him, and some of the more damning passages from our conversation.  But I left out what happened the same night as our daytime interview.  I don’t remember why I was in the nightclub Les Bains Douches that evening—it was 25 years ago after all—but what happened there and afterward is a crystal-clear memory, most likely because I’d planned to include it in a final chapter of Model that was never written because the book was already long and tawdry enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My plan was to conclude the tome with a chapter on the youngest models of all, known as test board kids, discovered in malls and at modeling conventions and then thrown into the deep end of fashion’s pool—the studios and clubs of Paris and Milan—where they would either swim or sink.  I’d chosen a handful of them at an annual modeling convention in New York, asked them to be my pen pals for a year, and that day at Brunel’s agency, Karin, met one of them, Robin [I’ve changed the models’ names], a Midwesterner who’d signed with him.  She introduced me to her friend, who called herself Dakota, and we chatted and went our separate ways.</p>
<p>But there was Dakota, on the restaurant floor above the disco at Bains Douches, sitting with Brunel and another group of models and older men at a huge table. And when she waved hello, it was clear she was miserable.  She told me she hated the place and Brunel had forced her to come.  “Can you get us out of here?” she whispered, gesturing to another model.  Sure, easy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I took them in a taxi to their “model” apartment off the Champs-Elysées, a crowded room where dirty clothes covered every inch of floor and Dakota told me she’d moved there after first living with Brunel at his far more spacious and glamorous apartment nearby on Avenue Hoche. There, she’d discovered an apparent peep hole that looked into the bathrooms the models in residence used, inspiring her to flee, albeit not very far.  The only part of the story that wasn’t normal was that peep hole.  Models often bunk in their agents’ homes. “Want to see it?” Dakota asked. She still had a key.</p>
<p>Around the corner we went, then up one of those old French cage elevators, to a far more lavish flat, where, sure enough, there was a hidden hole drilled through a wall and a view of a bathroom.  The girls were laughing about their escape when Brunel joined us.  Earlier that day, he’d denied that he still used cocaine. “I had a problem,” he’d said in a staccato burst, “it was not a major. I mean, it was a problem….  For four or five years I did it as fun, because I never did it in the day, and then I did it as an experiment, fine, it lasted maybe a bit longer than it should, but it had never been like a problem, it had never been—I was at work at 9 in the morning.”  But, as the notes I took afterwards say, he was “uncommonly animated,” so I wouldn’t have vouched for the truth of that assertion.  And he was with a friend with a case of the sniffles. And the peephole?  “I want you to look behind all the mirrors,” he said.  Frankly, I just wanted out of there.  
</p>
<p>A demand that Dakota return to Bains Douches with him made me nervous.  Earlier that day, he’d struck me as shrewd, smug and vaguely sleazy. She’d told me she’d had to rebuff his advances. His reappearance added scary to that list.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a white Ferrari with a white leather interior sitting outside his building.  Dakota sat in front and when Brunel offered to drop me off en route, I squeezed into the back.  Her hand snaked around the seat where Brunel couldn’t see it.  I grabbed it. She squeezed, until we reached the Pont des Arts, and I got out of the thrumming car.  “Will you be okay?” I whispered to Dakota. Her voice said yes. Her eyes weren’t so sure.  And off they roared into the night.</p>

             Found something on reddit about the Strand on Volta. A user commented that if you look up Strand on Volta all the links are dead. That alone should tell us something

             If you use Duck site you will find news under Pizzagate Wiki but not much else. A Wapo article only talks about exhibits and never once mentions Pizza Boy Jimmy Comet even once. I just noticed how close Comet and Comey spelling is. Wow 😮

             There was a pool in the club, makes sense if they had shower rooms as well. Cringy AF

             I don’t remember why I was in the nightclub Les Bains Douches that evening, but what happened there and afterward is a crystal-clear memory.

            Here's a look at the "Studio 54 of Paris", the place where Brunel took the young girls Dakota and Robin. Old pics from the late 70s - 80s.  Same crowd we've seen countless time while researching.

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The nightclub was winding down in the 1990s
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             During the late 1990s, famed French DJ David Guetta and his wife took over the iconic institution, trying to keep the legend going, but by the new millienium, its era of Hollywood movie stars and supermodels was over. The owner of the club decided to renovate but ran into some serious trouble with the law when he forgot to ask the landlord or even file for a building permit.
            </p>
            <p>
             The nightclub was finally closed in June of 2010 due to a “serious and imminent danger” to the public, in particular due to the removal of certain pillars that were kinda sorta important for holding up the building. The party was over…

            perhaps not
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Soon after its closure in 2010, to reinvent and save this icon of Parisian life, a new company, “La Société des Bains” was founded under the leadership of Jean-Pierre Marois.
