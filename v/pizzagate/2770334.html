            The character of the Beast is pretty freakin creepy. I have watched the show and it's hard not to get addicted to it. That writer seems ultra creepy. Even on his twitter he presents himself badly, and looks like an empty shell.

             Yea you have to admit it is a good story line and gets you hooked lol I did check his twitter and for someone who writes the books he has a relatively small following and yep, like you said his photos really lack any emotion, he seems like quite a empty person for such creative writing..

            Magicians are TRAINED Mk-Ultra Monarch HANDLERS and HYPNOTISTS and are like an on site doctor for adolescent sex slaves. That is why hard to reach places like Copperfields Musha Cay in the Caribbean are so popular with people like Johnny Depp, Oprah, John Travolta, They are TRAINING grounds and sex slave (drug) HAVENS.

            McNamara - I am worried about this guy  Anyone that has that much hatred for the Pres. needs to be watched.  His hatred goes deep.  Also, since he stands for Victims, why does he treat the NYT as Gospel, when it's head is the one that protected J Savile while he worked for the BBC.  This guy has either not done his homework, because he chooses to believe what he wants, or he is up to something else entirely.  He me be a Fake Shill trying to be a good guy so he can poison people with this Shady Pedo Show.  I Smell A Rat.
