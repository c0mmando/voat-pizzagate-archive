<p>For those of you who aren\'t from the UK, James Caan is best known as one of the investors on the British version of <em>Dragon\'s Den</em> , but this puts him in a new light altogether.</p>
<p>While researching the backgrounds of wealthy British philanthropists, I came upon this interesting story about James Caan, an investor born in Pakistan who has done considerable charity work here.</p>
<p>However, it appears <a href="http://archive.is/JKZvR">he has used his charity in an attempt to purchase a baby</a> from a family for about £725, about 1100USD at the then-exchange rate.</p>
<p>The event happens as below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TV cameras filming his charity work captured the multi-millionaire offering 100,000 rupees (£725) for the baby.
He told the girl\'s parents his brother desperately wanted to have a baby and would be able to provide the best possible life for her.
Mr Caan said he responded emotionally, rather than rationally.
The entrepreneur, born in Pakistan, was looking for a village he could help rebuild in the wake of the August floods that wrought devastation on his country.
The flooding across a swathe of Pakistan left some 2,000 people dead and affected up to 20 million people.
In one village, Mr Caan came across a newborn and made the offer of money in return for the baby.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That\'s already suspicious enough, buying a baby for one\'s brother--but what compounds it further is that James Caan is a close friend of Prince Charles and has ties to his philanthropy organisation, the British Asian Trust:</p>
