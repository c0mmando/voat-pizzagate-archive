             I did not say it was all a big misunderstanding. You're reading way past the intent of my posting.
            </p>
            <p>
             I simply said that this particular iconic picture that has been passed around as "proof" of something may not appear as solid as I once perceived it was.
            </p>
            <p>
             I shared this as a reminder that as dougG said best "We have to accept when a piece of pizza is just a pizza."
            </p>
            <p>
             Whatever the truth is must be brought to light, past and potential victims protected and the proper people vindicated of any wrong-doing, if there was none.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am not suggesting the ANYONE is innocent or guilty of anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm just reminding both myself and others, that if we are really here to determine the truth of something, the truth must flow both ways.
            </p>
            <p>
             As to your comments toward me, I'll take them as a reflection of how horrible this PG info really is. I have been as upset as you -- but please don't shoot the messenger.

            Still that tweet from sept 2015 is saying something about pedostas character.  Why would you write that unless you knew something about him no one knew. Also don't forget breitbart.

             I wasn't addressing the entirety of PG or trying to acquit or accuse anyone.
I was addressing that particular picture that has been tossed around without context, that has been literally used to say nearly anything, and I'm concerned that it just may not be saying what people are saying about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Garbage in -- Garbage out.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not going to debate the entirety of PG with you. My post was about ONE purported fact that is being used awfully liberally and it may not be too fair to do so, unless someone can offer some facts specifically related to it, that cast it in a more nefarious light.

            </a>
            , I am giving this post a "Possible Disinformation" flair due to suspected concern trolling. First Podesta fires up the twitter after months of silence. Then you fire up a 37 minute old account to share these pressing sentiments:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             I mean, seriously, what if it just means exactly what it was purported to mean? If THAT was so misrepresented, what else have I actually fallen for that wasn't as real as it seemed.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm just sort of freaking out, wondering what else I might have fallen for that wasn't really as nefarious as it appeared. I've been CONSUMED by PG for months and months, and have followed it down many paths.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Voaters beware. This image was never central to this investigation, which derived from Podesta's inexplicable emails and his brother's horrific pedophilic art collection. I remind you Podesta has never once offered a logical explanation for any of these, regardless of this picture. Attempts to "correct the record" about it are irrelevant to questions central to this investigation.

             Seeking the truth ought to be a strong motive of anyone that is here. I've explained myself quite liberally.
            </p>
            <p>
             Confirmation bias is a terrible thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't deny the whole matter is extremely ugly, but that picture has been spread over and over again an ascribed all sorts of nefarious meanings. I've merely asked for someone to explain to me why?
            </p>
            <p>
             It is pretty sad that even the mods don't deal with the question.
            </p>
            <p>
             Truthseekers look for the truth WHATEVER it is. Inconvenient or not.
            </p>
            <p>
             My opinion is that TP is a slimy person, but if a picture such as that is used to smear someone/ANYONE and it has a rational explanation, I and anyone else would be an epic a-hole for falsely accusing someone/anyone around it.
            </p>
            <p>
             WHATEVER "evidence" we have better be less flimsy that what any random person says about it on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
             Else, this truly does become a witch-hunt and a book burning party.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm still waiting for SOMEONE / ANYONE here to merely state "Yeah...you know, maybe we DID get that wrong."
            </p>
            <p>
             If we don't have the courage to see what is True -- WHATEVER it is and WHEREVER it leads, WE, ourselves, become guilty of quite immoral acts.
            </p>
            <p>
             That picture appears awfully innocent in it's broader context. Why anyone would even fight my original point is scary to me.
            </p>
            <h2>
             Who then would be guilty of spreading disinformation?
            </h2>
            <p>
             At this point, everyone is so hyped up that even things true scary.
            </p>
            <p>
             Someone once said to me "You can't talk through someone else's emotions."
            </p>
            <p>
             If I or anyone here are blinded by emotions, to such a degree that we can't address even the simplest of facts without skewering each other, that's pretty sad.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Look, there's a kitten!"
"No, that's no kitten, some guy said it is a baby walrus and I agree, because so many other people said it and they said it passionately.
"Yeah. but what  if it is just a kitten? What if it isn't a Walrus."
            </p>
            <p>
             ...then the name calling and subtle-shaming begins.
            </p>
            <p>
             Even someone new to a party can tell if the toilet is over-flowing or the house in on fire.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm neither new to Voat or to Pizzagate. I have had several other accounts that because they were throwaways, I never wrote down the passwords. I only created this account, in direct relation to having been drawn to Podesta's Twitter account, due to only brand new postings about Podesta's Twitter account that were on Voat yesterday.
            </p>
            <p>
             I made a new account, because I couldn't remember the throwaway account passwords and there is no way of recovering them.
            </p>
            <p>
             If anyone reads anything more into everything I have said here that is the 100% truth, you have crossed over in fantasy and not into the truth.

             In this case, you simply can't.  I'm speaking the truth, and Voat better be a Moat of truth when we're are confronting issues as serious as PG, and with just that one fact I questioned, I can see that the bias is to shoot the messenger, and not address the facts.

              Idk it seems odd that he's writing anything on his hands in the first place and there's a ton of different theories and religious practices involving the left and right hand (or 2 different visualizations that come together to an intended goal), that being said; the way he went about that is not a normal way to express that you want something to happen.
             </p>
             <p>
              But sure, maybe he was just writing on his hands for fun like he's not guna have to scrub that off later.

              Being chided and downvoated for raising the right kind of questions, is a bit like being Megyn Kelly'd by my fellow Voaters.

             The comments don't prove anything about that picture...they just throw flames.

             I'm getting heated up over this. That picture has been flying around amidst all the other chaos and dark shit and I sort of fell for how it was offered in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
             I mean, seriously, what if it just means exactly what it was purported to mean?

             If THAT was so misrepresented, what else have I actually fallen for that wasn't as real as it seemed.

             I'm quite entrenched in Pizzagate study, but it throws me for a big loop to see that this one iconic fact may not be  anything close to a fact at all.

              I honestly do not remember any of the post that is above the pic. Not saying it wasn't there, I just don't remember seeing any.
However, there is so much more things that have come to light about this Evil POS than this pic.
No one is drawing the conclusion that he is a Evil Satanic Pedo from just this pic alone!

               Yes, I see your point, but I'm just sort of freaking out, wondering what else I might have fallen for that wasn't really as nefarious as it appeared.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've been CONSUMED by PG for months and months, and have followed it down many paths.
              </p>
              <p>
               I've been in tears and full of rage, and I'm just sort of second guessing small details that are unsettling in that, they may not even mean what I took them to mean.
              </p>
              <p>
               The whole matter stinks to high heaven. It appears, in my opinion, that something is badly amiss all around, but this solitary fact, being perhaps, innocent, is pretty scary to see how people have skewered someone they don't know over it.
              </p>
              <p>
               I mean, look at all the Twitter comments related to that one pic. Are those comments even rational regarding that pic?
              </p>
              <p>
               If they are not, we need to be mindful of falling into dangerous group-think.
              </p>
              <p>
               I want to know the truth, the WHOLE truth and nothing BUT the truth.
              </p>
              <p>
               That requires challenging my own conclusions, especially when they are based merely on what someone else TOLD me about something, I hadn't even directly viewed until now. (The 14 fish pic.)

                Here is the thing. You know deep down who the real John Podesta is right? You do not need voat, Trump or anyone else to tell you. Now, the hard part is finding enough documented evidence to prove in a court of law, what you already know. 
Never, would this pic alone stand up in court to convict him right? So, catalogue it, and move on. 
I go to bed every night now, so depressed and angry since this Evil has been exposed. 
A friend told me, that we are going through the stages of grief. We all mourn differently and are at different stages. 
Sometimes, and understandably we have to just take a break from all of this. You are at that stage. We will all need that break, sometimes some will need many. It's not admitting defeat,  weakness, or failure.

              Look at the dates on some of the comments, 2015, six months before his email hack, some people seem to have been on to him already. You were duped, we all were duped. It was a multi trillion dollar pr campaign blasted at us for over seven decades or longer

               Yes. I was surprised to see that too. But do their comments even address the possibility that that pic had no such nefarious meaning to begin with?
              </p>
              <p>
               Just the fact that people are saying shit en masse, doesn't make the obviousness of the pic any less obvious, or does it?
              </p>
              <p>
               I mean, the Tweet IS about the Sustainable Development Goals and Number 14 IS about the Oceans. Why would people be so ridiculous about that?

               I said that I have many throwaways on here and have been on here for months. I made this account specifically because I just combed through Podesta's Twitter as a result of recent posts about Podesta's Tweets.
              </p>
              <p>
               Besides, you didn't answer the question.
              </p>
              <p>
               The topic was whether or not the picture might simply mean exactly what it was represented to mean. Seeing that the Tweet was about the Sustainable Development Goals and Number 14 is about:
              </p>
              <p>
               "Life Below Water - Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development[33]"
              </p>
              <p>
               What actual basis would anyone have to not believe the Tweet is just at it appears?
              </p>
              <p>
               When you answer that, I'll know LookingGlass isn't just throwing stones from his Glass House.
              </p>
              <p>
               My question is legit.
              </p>
              <p>
               I fell for many alternative meanings of that pic in the past.
              </p>
              <p>
               Seeing it for real, directly from his Twitter account, makes me question the statements made about it.
              </p>
              <p>
               If we're here for Truth, we must be here for Truth.

            All,
I am not here to defend Podesta. Indeed, I have many throwaway accounts and related submissions here, but the recent Podesta tweets got me looking at Podesta's Twitter History.
           </p>
           <p>
            The iconic picture of the 14 and the fish was suggested to mean very sick things.
           </p>
           <p>
            But when I dug further, it seemed to refer to the Sustainable Development Goals and Number 14 is indeed about Saving the Oceans!
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            At least with regard to this tweet, are we at risk of hanging an innocent man?

           <p>
            I was pretty sucked in by what people suggested regarding that pic.
I'm now feeling kinda dumb here.

             If it was just life in the ocean as number 14 there would be no reason to make a picture with 14 in one hand and a fish in the other. But if 14 and fish means something else, then you get a motivation for making this picture. To show other people who knows the meaning of 14 and fish : Hey guys, what a coincidence, life in the ocean ( fish ) as number 14.

             i think this is correct. We read too much into a lot of this stuff. If any of it is real and we think most of it is, then its up to law enforcement to put together a case. we can only put the information out there but you are correct to look at it a second time and question.

             Might have had a double meaning to it, but the first comment on the Tweet was LOL-worthy. Seems you don't need to yell about saving the oceans to come off as rather...fishy.

             I'm inclined to think it means just what he said it meant on Twitter. If you review his Twitter, he has many posts about the environment. Something he may actually care about.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Tweet itself has text that describes what the pic says and it was from over 2 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             If this picture was so misjudged, I'm a bit scared to think of the other things I may have been potentially gullible about.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does anyone have any evidence to suggest that, that picture doesn't simply mean exactly what it is represented to mean?

             He drew a 14 and a Fish as a representation of Sustainable Development Goal Number 14 -- Save the Oceans.

             I feel like an idiot for falling for whoever worked me up over that pic.
