<p>Well Alex Jones is still lying. That is clear, his recent videos show more lies. No doubt he\'s covering his tracks over the shooting. Seems that the guy who went and shot-up the comet-pizza was an Alex Jones listener. Remember when last week Alex Jones was crying about the &quot;CHILDREN&quot;?</p>
<p>[ WHY do I say Alex-Jones is STILL LYING, well he just said today &quot;10,000 mentions of pizza in podesta email&quot;, no Alex Jones, there are 18 mentions of pizza in the entire 55,000 emails, well a week ago Alex Jones said there were 100,000 references to pizza in podesta wikileaks dump, so Alex Jones is slowly coming to earth based reality. Hell YES Alex Jones is responsible for the shooting in DC. ]</p>
<p>Then 3 days ago A-Jones said &quot;Pizzagate was all rumors&quot;, ...</p>
<p>Then yesterday the gun-men, who said he went inside to find children, where he found none, well we all know this place is only open at night, there would have been no customers there at 3pm, just workers doing the prep. So of course there was no children.</p>
<p>Alex Jones knows he\'s in DEEP SHIT, A-JONES has been orchestrating the witch-hunt on James Alefantis all along,</p>
<p>Bigg\'s probably quit because NOBODY WANTS TO BE ON THE TITANIC WHEN IT GOES DOWN.</p>
<p>More interesting is why did MILO go silent? Me think\'s he\'s been offered his own show, ... watch to see if BIGGS joins MILO for their own CIA limited hang-out show, as most of the worst shills I have seen have been these smooth talking MI5 shills from the UK, the USA loves to bring them in something about the British accent hypnotizes the alt-right tards, and toss in the gay to boot, makes you want to vomit.</p>

<p>Alex Jones has lost the narrative, Bigg\'s is probably dead or hiding, he knows the deep state is coming in to \'damage control\'. I think the reason MILO was silenced is they\'re taking two steps back to develop a new narrative.</p>

             A week ago he was crying for the children, hysterical acting
            </p>
            <p>
             Three days ago he dis-avowed Pizzagate and the subtitle under the video said "Pizzagate is only about Rumors" [ Note that prior 5 days he like Seaman said "Pizzagate is real", real to rumor in a week ]
            </p>
            <p>
             Now today Alex Jones is saying that he NEVER targeted James Alefantis by name, that he only covered Pizzagate because he was following the NYT story.
            </p>
            <p>
             ....
            </p>
            <p>
             Alex Jones has been a CIA limited-hangout for 20+ years, and now they're pulling the plug on his ass because  he lost control.
            </p>
            <p>
             The shooter Welch from SC said "He went to Comet-Pizza to save the Children", just like a movie, the cowboy in the white hat goes blazing, trouble is no children were found and me think Alefantis locked himself in that famous hidden door bathroom.
            </p>
            <p>
             The GUNMAN will be linked to Jones, I think this is why Bigg's ran, also Bigg's was doing some good work he would be better off not associated with the TITANIC of the Alex Jones machine while it sinks.

              Anywho, Alex has been pretty careful to directly accuse James and Comet Ping Pong of illegal activity. I have been watching his videos since he started covering it. He was a bit CYOA from go. He even said people have to be careful because these are serious allegations against private individuals.

             MILO is a faggot on ALT-MSM ( Brietbart News Faggot Poster Boy ) that the alt-tards, Trumps-Kids worship,
            </p>
            <p>
             U all note that David Seaman, &amp; MILO, they're all these metro-sexual homosexual fudge packing pussy's, and they're OUR HEROES??
            </p>
            <p>
             Go figure, tell me that the CIA/NSA isn't laughing their fucking head off, in reality TEAM-TRUMP has hired 1,000's of fudge-packers to soften his image.

             Obama had a rainbow on the white-house for holiday, Trump will have the rainbow on the white house everyday,

              I think David seaman is a limited hangout as well.  Never gives any facts.  Same with the pettibone sisters.  Watched her on Hagman and Hagman last night and its just the same shit over and over with no real deep connections about how this is run.  Its a shame that these people have become famous over this horrendous stuff.  I think that until you start connecting the deep state to this pedophile network it will go nowhere.  They will pin it on a middle man just kike at Penn State
