<p>An archived link of the now-discontinued Terra Mar Project website reveals that members of the world\'s most wealthy families collectively threw in their support for Ghislaine Maxwell\'s Terra Mar project, a charity allegedly supporting the health of our oceans around the world. According to their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TerraMar Project is a nonprofit ocean organization dedicated to building a global community built around our mutual love of the ocean and the need to protect and conserve the seas.   We will use the power of our global community to be the voice that leads the clarion call for change on how we manage the ocean and the creatures that call it home.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Endorsements at the Bottom of the page came from members of several billionaire families, including: </p>
<p>Sir Richard Branson, David De Rothschild, Francesca von Habsburg, Shepard Fairey, Lord Peter Mandelson, Nick Pritzker, Leon Koffler, Jonathan Soros, Jacqueline and Mortimer Sackler (Purdue Pharma), Richard Rockefeller, Barry Diller. </p>
<p>Many of these names have been previoiusly named by Pizzagate researchers, including the Sackler family, who held events in Washington DC attended by Tony Podesta and James Alefantis. Ghislaine Maxwell is particularly interesting because her father, Robert Maxwell, has been associated with Mossad and MI6.</p>
<p>Most incredibly, however, <strong>this charity actually links David Brock and James Alefantis to Maxwell, the Rothschilds and a series of &quot;Ocean Health&quot; charities</strong>. <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/reliable-source/2010/06/rs-_cousteau.html">A 2010 Washington Post article shows that the ex-couple hosted celebrity diver Philippe Cousteau at their Kalorama home</a>. To quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fabien, a square-jawed 40-something, beseeched a young policy wonk/socialite crowd at the Kalorama home of writer David Brock and restaurateur James Alefantis Monday night to open their wallets as &quot;armchair divers&quot; for his new cause. Plant a Fish launched this month, in time for the original Cousteau\'s 100th birthday, with Fabien leading Brooklyn schoolchildren in a dive to seed new oyster beds in the Hudson.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now what did Earth Echo International do in DC? They organized <a href="https://earthecho.org/news/HOA-111914">UNDERGROUND TOURS OF THE SEWER SYSTEM</a>, meaning that a Rothschild-linked charity hosted an opening event at the Brock-Alefantis residence for programs hosting underground tours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Join EarthEcho International and DC Water for a truly behind-the-scenes look at how the nation’s capital is combatting its storm and wastewater pollution problems. Engineer James Wonneberg will take you 100 feet underground to explore Washington, DC’s new stormwater tunnels: over 13 miles of massive tunnels that hold and treat storm and wastewater before it pollutes local waterways.</p>

            And Wilbur Ross of Rothschild INC bankruptcy department is Trumps Commerce Secretary. Rothschild saved Trump from bankruptcy over his Taj Majal hotel. Trump is also connecte to Rockefeller through his controling interest in Resort International. It is a CIA/Mossad/Mob front backed by Rothschild and Rockefeller. He is also a Templar/Jesuit Freemason. Yet this sub and most the subverted alt media sells him as fighting these forces. He works for them. He is part of their society and is pushing all aspects of agenda 21 including forced vaccines, Palantir program, 5G. The entire government is subverted. They all work for the owners of the Federal Reserve and the IRS. All intel agencies are Freemasons and intel agencies all are corporations and subsidiaries of SIS (British sevret Intelligence Service) SIS was set up by the Bank of England(Rothschild cartel). Trump is theirs. Trump vs the deep state is a psyop to keep you frm acting by thinking people in high places are fighting for you. The connections are undeniable.

             Very plausible narrative! The group think of US the people, wish this not to be true of course as it would mean there is NO SAVIOR and WE would have to lead the charge. Thats a difficult task but one that must be done if there is ever to be any drastic changes to the way this world currently is.

             Murray Gell-Mann- Famous scientist:
            </p>
            <p>
             "a distinguished fellow and one of the co-founders of the Santa Fe Institute, a professor of physics at the University of New Mexico, and the Presidential Professor of Physics and Medicine at the University of Southern California.[7]
Gell-Mann spent several periods at CERN, a nuclear research facility in Switzerland, among others as a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellow in 1972."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Gell-Mann was born in lower Manhattan into a family of Jewish immigrants from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, specifically from Chernivtsi (historical name: Czernowitz) in present-day Ukraine."
"He was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions."

             HE JUST RECENTLY DIED:  May 24, 2019
            </p>
            <p>
             "Murray Gell-Mann, the Nobel-winning physicist who brought order to the universe by helping discover and classify subatomic particles, has died. He was 89. Gell-Mann died on Friday at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. His death was confirmed by the Santa Fe Institute, where he held the title of distinguished fellow, and the California Institute of Technology, where he taught for decades. The cause was not disclosed.
Gell-Mann transformed physics by devising a method for sorting subatomic particles into simple groups of eight, based on electric charge, spin and other characteristics. He called his method the “eightfold way” after the Buddhist Eightfold Path to enlightenment.
Gell-Mann also developed the theory that identified “quarks”, indivisible components of Earth’s matter that make up protons, neutrons and other particles. Experiments confirmed the existence of quarks, and these objects now form the basis for our physical understanding of the universe, Caltech said in a statement."

             "Though he was best known for his contributions to particle physics, for which he won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics, Gell-Mann wanted to understand the “chain of relationships” that connected the universal laws of physics to complex systems like economies and human cultures. He described these two extremes of interest in his 1994 book, The Quark and the Jaguar, as “two aspects of nature…on the one hand, the underlying physical laws of matter and the universe, and on the other, the rich fabric of the world that we perceive directly and of which we are a part.
To enable a rigorous study of the latter aspect of reality — the fabric of the complex world around us — Gell-Mann co-founded the Santa Fe Institute in 1984, 15 years after winning the Nobel Prize in physics for his classification of elementary particles. At SFI he collaborated with economists, linguists, biologists, computer scientists, and with other physicists who shared his passion for finding fundamental principles in learning, evolving systems."
