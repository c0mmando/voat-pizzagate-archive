<p>Pizzagate Howie is live now on Periscope. In the above videos, he says he couldn\'t believe how unaware, and uninterested in the facts people were, nor how mean they could be. Lots of people told him to fuck off, even old people, and one woman who had been raped at age 10. None would even look at his brochures. They had all read the NYT piece saying that it was fake news, and the only detail they knew about the whole thing was the name of the &quot;shooter&quot;. People were very abusive to him, he was shocked by how much.</p>
<p>This reminds me of Titus Frost\'s latest video <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1811310">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1811310</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFtBjcGzv_k&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFtBjcGzv_k&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player</a>  talking about the CIA propaganda piece that  James Alefantis signed his name to, published by (CIA media outlet) Washington Post.

He framed the article in such a way that any questioning of this innocent family restaurant means you are an Alex Jones follower and responsible for a shooting. This might explain the horrible treatment and refusal to look at even one picture by literally everyone Howie encountered today. (While you\'re at it, you might enjoy Alan Nowhere\'s takedown of the WaPo artilcle, where he overlays James\' words with the reality of Comet Pizza in pictures, including one taken just 3 weeks ago showing the bartender in drag, appearing to be \'fisting\' some guy <em>in the restaurant</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqPnoRvyqBA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqPnoRvyqBA</a> )</p>

            The whole premise of a March for Science is just dumb.  They are mad because you have a real issue that needs to be looked into.  A non political March for Science - except it was totally political and science is a METHOD and does not need a MARCH.  Don't worry people know.  This is just more Soros shit stirring to make money on currency manipulation due to instability,

             Why is it dumb when Trump is declaring major cuts for the National Park Service, the EPA, the NOAA, the National Institute of health and many other major contributors to the prosperity and protection of humanity, meanwhile Trump is giving huuuuge spending boosts to NASA. Yes its cool to explore the galaxy and all, but we don't even have our own planet figured out. Plus SpaceX will be the one to actually take us to Mars if we have to. Science is a method, but our President is ignorant to scientific fact and also without funding there are no "methods".  Without science we can't survive disease, forecast weather to protect our homes and family, ward off toxic pollution and so much more anyone with half a brain can ascertain. Not to diminish the importance of Pizzagate Howie's little protest but the March for Science is very much a real issue whose importance spans far and wide dwarfing our theory of PG with little or no evidence. Let me guess, you believe in PG with a few weird emails and instagram pics but don't believe in global warning that has mounds of vast substantiated scientific data?

              Titus Frost claims to used a hacker to find Child Porn on a member's only section of Comet's website which he turned over to the DC police and has the reciept proof.  It's more than a few weird emails and disgusting Instagram pics.

              I understand the upcoming CLIMATE march what I don't understand is this supposed non partisan (except very much NOT) SCIENCE march.  Too many focusus.  As broad as the women's march. No real goals.

               "Claims" IS the key word. IMO that was a huge hoax. Titus Frost was just trying to draw internet traffic to his You Tube and was one of many "researchers" trying to profit off of Pizzagate. Any child with Photoshop could have designed the log in/files page that he released. Why not censor it and release the contents of those files to the public??? It might not be admissible in court but it would be enough to red pill the entire country. It seems like anyone can come forward with "evidence" and the PG community will just take their word for it because there is so much emotion involved. Titus Frost, David Seaman, Alex Jones, Ryan(pizzagate gear) and a couple others are all guilty of stirring the pot in an attempt to profit. Plus, the march has had a political bias BC no other president in their right mind would give such massive cuts to crucial organizations.

            I was in DC for the inauguration and witnessed the Womens March Jan 21, and I can say from first hand experience, the majority of the people marching are members of the Pizzagate cult (or species, as I call them). It put into focus exactly how large this group of people is and what we're up against.
           </p>
           <p>
            So it's not that these people don't know or are unaware, they just want us to think that, because ITS THEM.

             You're fucking joking right? Are you actually contending that the majority of all of the thousands and thousands and thousands of women and men who marched around the country in the women's march are pedophiles, support pedophilia and Satanic ritualistic abuse?

             I doubt most of the marchers are satanic pedophiles. But they're leftists who believe Pizzagate is an attack on their people, Podesta and Hillary.

            A group of people going to the NYT to tell them the news...is it any wonder how they responded?  They're not even near the FAKE MSM level of red pilling.  Like trying to teach eye hand coordination to an Antifatard.
