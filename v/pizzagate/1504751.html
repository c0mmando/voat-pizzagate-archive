<p>Gavin Newsom isn\'t someone that I haven\'t seen mentioned. He was the Mayor of San Francisco and is the Lieutenant Governor of California. Does he directly tie to pizzagate? Not as yet, but there are all these little hints that he\'s part of this cabal. Like the donation from JA. </p>

<p>Yes, the donation is minimal, but minimal donations were also made to HRC so it fits JA\'s pattern. And Newsom does have that link to Washington and the Podestas. His book Citizenville was given a launch signing party at the Jefferson Hotel that was attended by Heather Podesta.

<p>Newsom hits all the PC notes in being pro-Sanctuary City, anti-guns, and HRC policies, but hints of why he\'s dirty? They\'re there. For one, plagiarism: </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/NFgTp">http://archive.is/NFgTp</a> </p>
<p>And a pretty bad scandal that got mopped up fast (dirty sex scandal spill in aisle 9!!!) </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/FTFtt">http://archive.is/FTFtt</a></p>
<p>The alcoholism is a huge red flag because it makes him very vulnerable to blackmail when they cover up another instance of ill-advised behavior. </p>
<p>Finally, there\'s the enormous effort used to prop this guy up and get him elected Governor. We can see this in Jerry Brown getting involved in ensuring him a victory. </p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/iVlK7">http://archive.is/iVlK7</a></p>
<p>&quot;On his way out of office due to term limits, Brown anointed Gavin Newsom as his heir apparent. When Newsom’s campaign was faltering in the face of the remarkable grassroots surge for Matt Gonzalez, Brown called a meeting of African-American pastors where he called Gonzalez “a racist.” But he knew that race was not the issue.&quot; </p>
<p>Those are my two nominees. Eryn really needs to get under that microscope as does Newsom. Too much effort has gone into propping him up and making sure he\'s in position in California and I\'d like to know why.</p>
<p>Edit: I\'m adding this. It\'s about SF being a leading center of human trafficking. Is this why they\'re fighting so hard to keep control?

            EDIT: Who is Instragram cisjenner? They comment to joshuaryanv "delete this" on a pizza-related image, and then he responds, "delete your life".
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe it's this instagram account:
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cisjenner">
             https://www.instagram.com/cisjenner
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            They have no posts (probably deleted them), 6 followers, and their name is now "gtfo". Does anybody have this instagram archived?

             You are good to post this. I had not seen some and am sickened all over again. Why is J Voigt's pic in there?  Is a pedo?  Remember A Jolie was involved in Spirit Cooking. She could have been abused. They were estranged for years.
