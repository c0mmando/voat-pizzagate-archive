            every person he mentions i.e. duncon ofinnian, cathy obrian, max spiers, james casbolt, etc are all personalities who got their accliam through one of two alternative media platforms.  1.) project camelot, or 2.) coast to coast fm radio.  both organizatiopns are funded by the rockefeller and tide foundations and fuel conspiracies to confuse people.  so i am hesitant when i see new people in this clique.
           </p>
           <p>
            see link below to see the connections:
this clique conviently includes alfred lambremont webre whose brother (septime webre) can be seen fundraising with james alefantis and david brock.  Stanford reasarch institute also connected to these oddballs.

            Didn't watch, but seems interesting.
           </p>

            Yes of course we're living in a 3D projection of a multi-dimensional universe. Demonic energies live in higher dimensions, i.e. their flicker rate, or frequency is so high, that they are moving so fast, we cannot see them. Similar to microwave light. It obviously exists and interacts with us in a very real way, but seeing it or hearing it is near impossible. Demons and Angels live in a higher, faster frequency, dimension.
           </p>
           <p>
            The devil worshippers are possessed, and have been for a long long time. The higher frequency beings cannot enter this plane of existence for very long, so they must take over the EGO or Psyche of hapless victims. Since semites have a genetic defect, Jews and Muslims have an easier time being taken over by Demonic energies.
           </p>
           <p>
            They have NO actual free will. They think they do. But in reality they are puppets for the higher dimensional beings. The demonic energies hate humans as we are able to live freely in this dimensional plane, AND have access to the higher dimensions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sins of the flesh. Demons can't handle the emotions that come with having a physical body. Hunger, lust, thirst, greed, desire, they have zero control over. They cannot control their snake brain, their impulses. So... add a demonic possession, ritualistic abuse, child sacrifice, all done by 4th Dimension Demonic energies that wish to exist on this plane of reality, but cannot due to the frequency at which they operate and bam. Luciferian death cult.
           </p>
           <p>
            How to defeat them? Invoke the power of "Good" higher dimensional beings such as angels and saints. Imbue yourself with the power of righteousness and good and you'll gain the ability to see demonic entities and fight them. Good luck!

             Have you read Carlos Casteneda? He speaks about "flyers", beings that operate just out of human sight that feed off energy.  They desire turnenergy of children before puberty. Every indigenous people on the planet speak of interdimensional beings that harvest human low vibration energy.  Ever notice the amount of fear porn on TV and the media? Almost every spiritual practice talks about how fear kills the human spirit. It's right here in front of our faces, but somehow churches are into this prosperity preaching now a days.. our grandparents of all ethnicities knew all about this shit.  Good thing for the controllers sonmany of themnjave Alzheimer's now. We need these old timers wisdom.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, the abuse at foster and child care places. Back in the days grandparents helped with the kids. Now we have them stuck in nursing homes due to health deterioration.

            I believe he's sincere in what he's saying. However. I was raised Gnostic Christian and was open to the ideas of Demiurge, Archons and so on since I was a child (40's now), none of this is new to me. I've had years to reconcile these new age ideas with classic Gnostic texts and teachings. I don't believe this stuff, it's parody. I do believe he sincerely believes it to be true, I also believe there is and are trans-dimesonal beings that interfere with human evolution. But I still think he's wrong. It's like Montalk.net, before it was owned by the current guy.

            As much as I hate to say this, this vid ties in everything I have come across in researching  and some things I have wondered and questioned over the years. This red pill is too much to swallow.  maybe I can break it down in my subconscious . I should have been thoroughly confused with what he was saying, but have read too much on MK ultra and Monarch, seen too many vids with people and their glitches. Damn this is a BIG ugly pill if true, and something tells me it is.  This alien stuff ties in with what I have read about RH negative blood and am really wondering how many of us have negative blood now. We don't seem to fall in line with the majority.  I gonna be thinking on this for awhile

               This is very real and people higher up in the echelon now it. I remember reading a report on a Madonna tour where they listed her "Diva requests" and one of them was that her dressing room was sterilised professionally of any DNA  of hers that could remain on the room after she was done with it. They now the possibility of being cloned exists. Here's the article:

               Exactly.  When the 23andMe first came out I was interested at first but then read the disclaimer that said they could do whatever they wanted with the DNA sample, it was theirs after u submit it to them. Think about that, a pharma company owning your DNA and so many people are doing this madness. They've hooked up with ancestry.com on commercials now to further pull people into it. I never did it and very glad I didn't.

              Maybe that is how they find possible matches for organs?  Wonder if there are any deaths from people who used that site?

               I know. I discussed this in another thread a while back and I believe it to be true. They would know everything, blood type, organs, health, relatives, address, the list goes on. Also talked about was the Freemasons and their child identification program, same type of thing. Sad.

                This is something that deserves more attention I believe, I would like to see if any of the people that sent in their dna have been used for their organs?

             Agreed. We've been wondering why this hasn't gotten much attention, but what government-run control program would. I only listened to the first 20-30 minutes and need to go back to it, but it's eerily reminiscent of Max Spier's story already. It was hard to believe it having only heard it from one person. This guy gives a list of people, I need to find them if they're out there, and see if they have talked about it. It gets easier to believe with each authentic testimony, and it's definitely beyond any definition of red pill.
