            I think she's right and it's couragous of her to talk about these things openly. Most old ladies wouldn't , because of their education.
And I think she mentions something that I also notice when I try to talk to some of my friends about things like pizzagate:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "Second, decent people don’t want to believe this kind of thing happens. It seems too horrible to be real."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Absolutely true! Not just in the families, where it's happening, but  also in the whole society! People turn their heads away. They don't WANT  to know. They cannot believe. Seems the average citizen likes to trust the elites. Although they might be criticizing the politicians, it seems most people cannot stand information, which is turning their whole world upside down.

            I don't think people think that pedophilia is anything new. I think people think it's horrific to discover we have pedophiles, protected, compromised, and/or satanic running the country and perhaps the world, that these psychopaths are in positions of power, abusing, raping, murdering, and even eating children, who have no hope of rescue or justice because the predators control the government and pick and choose who they prosecute. While these children are their primary victims, we are all victims of these psychopaths who use their power to harm and control us. They are importing those who would kill us, dumbing us down via schools that indoctrinate rather than teach and a lying media, poisoning us via chemicals in our foods, water, and vaccines, making us chronically ill so they can sell us medications and medical care, which they control and profit from, and they are trying to corral us into a one-world government, under which we would have no say in how we live and no way out.

             An abuser was very likely abused themselves = Sociopath. Psychopathy on the other hand is genetic. According to research there is no correlation between Psychopathy and Paedophilia.

            Lots of terrible things have always been done - but this is the first time in human history that average people have the Internet to communicate with each other and try and stop it without being jailed or killed.  They can't stop all of us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe we were all put here at this time in human history to stop this, to break apart these horrific systems that exist in the highest parts of our governments and elite society.  We might win, we might lose, but we can never go back to seeing the world the same again.

            I wonder if this old woman might have any german/jewish/polish roots, the influx of the pedophilia 'disease' that was used as an inculcation tool in nazi germany made it's way like a pandemic to several countries thanks to the vatican ratlines and project paperclip, as Fionna Barnett will testify.

             If Jews are guilty they will be called out. Paedophilia comes in all races, religions, genders, social status, income levels, political parties, and occupations. Some of the biggest busts have been on Jews, and no we wont shut up about any paedo Jew or not. Ok?

             Who is blaming them but at the same time, why is it off topic conversation? To think ANY religion is not involved is being blind. It is happening across all "religions", political parties and nations. One protest at the WH this year that NO #MSM covered was Jews against Zionists. So I guess Jews even know the evils of Zionists.

               Maybe it's because Zionism and pedophilia have no clear relationship. And maybe it's unfortunate that the anti-zionist sentiment's of many are pandered to by trolls who attempt to make our forum look idiotic by turning legitimate threads into political witch hunts and false rabbit holes.

                 You evidently don't understand the meaning of the word Zionism if you think you just offered some evidence. Furthermore, if i'm not mistaken, the talmud is bunch of religous scholars' writings, not the torah. If it's babylonian it just demonstrates that it's an antiquated practice that some rabbis a few thousand years ago pulled. i wouldn't indict every member of a faith for it, as the vast majority of jews have never so much as glanced at the talmud.

            This is something we should all remind ourselves of.  It's always been going on!  Although we can and will, eventually bring down the Kingpins, it's naive to think we can stop it from happening again.  It's a part of the human pathological maleficence which could be regarded as a malfunction/imbalance in Nature.  Now why and how it grows to such proportions is a question I don't think anyone can answer.  I would like to hear more from previous generations to understand what their observations and suspicions of this sickness were.

             i think it's a cycle of generations, people who were abused themselves become the abusers and since one abuser tends to abuse more then one it grows exponentially sadly, i think we can break these cycles by finding and giving victims the mental help they need

              Possibly generational abuse can continue, but not always. It takes a special kind of person to continue it. The hard part is, how do you know who is going to be a paedophile or not? There arent any indicators, as these people are very, very good at hiding their desires because they know how inappropriate they are. They are the best decievers of them all. Until they slip up, no one would suspect them, ever. The children are trained to not tell, and the wives are too ashamed to tell, especially if they are dependent on the man, or abused as well.  Some wives/mothers refuse to accept it and blame the children, so its rarely spoken of. Getting these ppl to treatment, would be futile anyway. This disorder has no treatment, like psychopathy, it has no cure. Treatment rarely helps at all. Paedophiles are addicted to fantasies of sex with children, its a strong desire not out of love, but pure erotic selfish pleasure. Very few can resist acting upon those fantasies if given the chance. It seems a very large percentage of men hold such fantasies, which is shocking to me. Every female in my family has been sexually abused in some way growing up. I spoke with a local detective about the incidence of molestation in my area, and she told me a shocking 72% of ALL children, particularly little girls are being molested according to reports over a 6 yr period. Most by family members.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why arent these perverts arrested? No one will tell on them unless its an emergency, and by then many of the children are dead. Treatment wont stop these perversions, only jail for life or death. Thats just how it is. This is a spiritual illness, and its getting worse.

             The crimes of murder and theft, are generally incidental at the individual level. What she is talking about is organized institutionalized pedophilia that crosses all spectrums of society - that isn't something people generally know to having been going on throughout the Age. Furthermore murder is usually a crime of revenge for wrongdoing - a form of vigilante justice. Theft is a vice yet is different from the vice of pedophilia. Pedophilia is really a signature low-point of morality that extends beyond the boundary line of redeemability. If someone steals someone elses property, they are not necessarily deemed to be "EVIL", when someone defiles a child they are usually deemed to be "EVIL". EVIL being a general mental state that is beyond the societal boundaries of acceptance/tolerance.

             [J]ewish? I wouldn't be surprised if she were, I think its interesting how the compartmentalized trauma based mind control begins to break down in old age. I hope she continues to post what she knows about it.

              Yes.  She is Jewish.  As I said, I knew before I got to the end.  The clues were obvious.  (I am a victim.)

               I think it's rampant in the Jewish community, on the Orthodox side many Talmudic verses espouse condonement/acceptance of child abuse. I live in the Poconos, and there are a huge number of Orthodox run Jewish sleepaway camps - I suppose in ~50 years some portion will start to recall things. I wish there were a way to speed up the process of breaking out those memories. When I was 16 felt like I was living in one area of my brain, I then had a sudden premonition on what to do, I closed my eyes and took the back of my finger knuckle (right index) then gently pressed it into the center of my forehead. I slowly moved it around my head "living in" the area of the brain where the pressure was and made a circle all the way around and then on angles all the way around. My mind suddenly opened up and I felt superhuman after that, like there was nothing that could stop me from whatever I wanted to accomplish. Maybe you can try it sometime, if you do and it works for you let me know.

                My father once told me a story before i was born about a prominent Jewish doctor he worked for and cleaned his office every weekend. 
Once he went to the office and the doctor was alone with a young boy.
Of course the doctor was upset he was disturbed and said some nasty things to my father whom quit on the spot. He didn't call police because he didnt see anything suspicious except that heres a doctor all by himself with a young boy and no parent around.  I guess he never put two and two together.

             Can't figure out how to message you on this from my phone but had wanted to ask again about Joseph Campbell being disinfo? Think it was you? Would it have to do with an overall effort to cloud spiritual truth? Just curious :) had quite a few red pills recently and trying to gather more info
