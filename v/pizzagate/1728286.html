Creepy daycare in Salt Lake City possibly involved in child trafficking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150129141807/http://i.imgur.com/8lGhBoo.pngPNG">https://web.archive.org/web/20150129141807/http://i.imgur.com/8lGhBoo.pngPNG</a>
Fundamental Financial Corp/North South Capital, LLC- Chicagoland Fun with Phonics, California. Funland Jumpers, Oregon Funcrest Bait shop, Iowa.   5 companies, including the day care in the OP, are all named on a bill of lading for a shipping container from China with 1,100KG of ‘plastic jewelry’ and 6,825KG of ‘football &amp; soccerballs’. Shipment of container was facilitated by a company with a password protected merchandise catalog who employs as an executive an ex-defense contractor formerly responsible for sales of ‘operational merchandise’.

So they shipped to 4 places other than Salt Lake City the plastic jewelry
. Oregon, Iowa, Chicago, and California. Each place had the exact same weight of product shipped to them (1100kg) <a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=38000261&amp;year=2013&amp;consignee=funland-jumpers">http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=38000261&amp;year=2013&amp;consignee=funland-jumpers</a>[1] <a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=27299049&amp;year=2013&amp;consignee=fun-with-phonics">http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=27299049&amp;year=2013&amp;consignee=fun-with-phonics</a>[2] <a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=32762087&amp;year=2013&amp;consignee=fundamental-financial-group">http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=32762087&amp;year=2013&amp;consignee=fundamental-financial-group</a>[3] <a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=33759053&amp;year=2013&amp;consignee=funcrest-bait-shop">http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=33759053&amp;year=2013&amp;consignee=funcrest-bait-shop</a>[4]   Funcrest Bait shop, note the address of the company: <a href="http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=33759053&amp;year=2013&amp;consignee=funcrest-bait-shop">http://fonroid.com/canonical.jsp?id=33759053&amp;year=2013&amp;consignee=funcrest-bait-shop</a>

Adams, Ste 2230 Chicago, IL 60606   Same address as on BL, however <a href="http://businessprofiles.com/details/fundamental-financial-group-llc/IL-01860488">http://businessprofiles.com/details/fundamental-financial-group-llc/IL-01860488</a> The company on the BL is registered to the same guy, but in a town ~40miles away All are listed on the same BL for the container facilitated by: <a href="http://www.funstuffinc.net/">http://www.funstuffinc.net/</a> A profile of one of their execs:   <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-%22soup%22-campbell/33/ba9/369">https://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-%22soup%22-campbell/33/ba9/369</a>
the blurb was posted on reddit about the company he worked for. This guy facilitated the transfer of the container from china to the US   The address for Fun Time Bait shop, is the same address for a registered sex offender. Not the owner of the business mind you, but we now have a legit tie-in to pedo and these chinese shipments. So, that’s, something? The Fundamental Financial Group shipment: a search for the name on the BL brings up a gentleman in the chicagoland area, currently working at two places; Fundamental and North South Capital, LLC. The address on the BL is actually the address for North South even though the company listed is Fundamental, Fundamental is registered at a totally different location about 40-50 min away. Smells like some shell-corp antics afoot all over this thing.
So it seems one of the executives, based on his linked-in profile, at Fun Stuff Inc (facilitator of the chinese shipment) used to work for a short time with another company Regional Account Manager servicing the Defense Industry with Tactical Equipment, Operational Gear, MRO, Fire and Emergency Services, Expeditionary, Medical, and simplified logistic solutions.
ADS has developed procedures that shorten the “logistics pipeline” to provide rapid response and the best possible pricing to our customers worldwide. ADS specializes in working with defense and security contractors as well as protective services organizations. No matter what uniform you wear, our mission is to provide the specialized equipment and related services you need to complete your mission at home, in theater, or around the globe. and the company he works for now is the one who has their current merchandise behind password protection. Look at their site again, why that is necessary. Can’t seem to find much about the Fun With Phonics company, other than a lawsuit with Leapfrog. this is a company with almost 1 mil in annual revenue. What are they doing in bed with these other 4 companies and shell corps?

            , can you please edit the formatting of your post so it is easier to read? A couple of tips:
           </p>
           <p>
            To get a new paragraph, you need to hit return twice.
There a bunch of buttons that will allow you to format your post with subheads (the "H" button), horizontal lines, bulleted lists, tables, etc. You may not be able to see them (right next to the comment count) on mobile -- go to your browser settings pulldown menu and select "view desktop site". Most of these work best if you select the text you want to format, and then click the button, rather than clicking it and then typing the text.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the buttons (#3, looks like a chain) allows you to highlight any bit of your text and add an invisible hyperlink that turns the text blue. Highlight the text, click the button, paste the url in the little box that opens, and click the "create link" button next to it.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is great research! Thanks for sharing it.

             Under funstuff : profile of one of their execs: Campbell is his name his linked in has him as a Coach at a couple of different places.  Probably what he does for "fun".  If you look lower he is involved in different baseball sites.  So he may be volunteering to work with kids? Don't know. Just found this.

             Or just link to the original reference(s). You can tell its a copy pasta by the formatting and by the 'pngPNG' string in the link title which happens when someone copies a png link that has a png tag.

             For it to show up in the name like that it has to be a straight up copy and paste.
