            This is so Eerie! In certain ways this case is much like that of JonBenet Ramsey.  was this crime perpetrated by an elite pedo ring and/or Perhaps the parents are also complicit .

            The authorities found out that Gerry was not Maddy's father. When they sought to find out from Kate who the real father was, she refused to provide answers.  Maddie was conceived via sperm donor.   This begs the question: who was the father and for what purpose was Maddie bred?

            I seem to remember there was talk that Madeline had a rare condition that caused her right eye's pupil to leak out. As the story went, this was a sought after condition by the Finders, somehow it was a sign of an adrenal system overworking (adrenochrome rich). Perhaps also just having a unique eye deformity would be valued by the cult (all-seeing eye worshipers). Anyone aware of this angle?

            No one knows. As an Englishman I followed the story when she first disappeared. The cadaver dogs bring compelling evidence that her body was disposed of by the parents without any outside agents. I'm still unsure what happened. Amaral is sure the parents alone are complicit especially Kate McCann. The Gasper statement is still a glaring discrepancy to the whole 'it was just Kate' theory.

            It is curious that high profile paedophiles like Clement Freud and Dr. Ray Wyre came out in defence of the McCanns.  It is curious that the detectives of Operation Grange never questioned either Gerry McCann about his name being in the CATS system (British Police's computerised child abuse registry) or Tapas 7 member David Payne regarding the Gaspar statement on his sexually inappropriate remarks/gestures about Madeleine.  It is curious that the British Home Office would refuse to give the Portuguese authorities Madeleine's medical records or the McCanns' credit card/phone records on the grounds of 'national security'.  And it is most curious that Kate McCann, a woman who by her own admission went out boozing with her friends six nights in a row while leaving three children under the age of four all alone in an (unlocked on the night of Madeleine's reported disappearance) apartment, should be made an ambassador for missing people!

             The Metropolitan Police intelligence unit, in an e-mail, stated:'Intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in Belgium made an order for a young girl three days before Madeleine McCann was taken.
            </p>
            <p>
             She could have been taken to just sell off for a large amount of money OR someone of great importance had the ring steal her for himself or for someone even more important.  There has been some writing about TB having a liking for her.  Idk if he did but the fact that there is such a huge cover up there is some truth imo, that a high level elite figure is involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jerry has a checkered history when it comes to child porn etc.  so he must have all the wrong connections.  I have read an account before of a story from a woman living in the flat below the McCanns.  She claims she had heard quite a commotion of a Child crying for hours for her Daddy.  Wondering why no one met her needs, she later found that the McCanns were out when she heard them enter and go up to their flat.  Where were they and why was the Child alone?  Was someone allowed certain liberties with Madeline? Would not be surprised as we have known that many we have researched have sold off their Children for money or power.
            </p>
            <p>
             Either way, there are some powerful people involved in this horrible tail of intrigue involving the disappearance of Poor Little Madeleine.

             So, from what I just watched, how accurate is it to suspect the parents of Madeleine are involved with pedophile elite in some way? Why if they were involved, did they do this? Did they get a payoff? Did they sell their child to a sex cult? I'm still not sure what is going on with this case.

              I read they received a lot of money and used it to pay off their house.  Idk if that is true but they are as sneaky and smarmy as they come.  Would not put it past them to profit from something that nasty.  When you hang with the perverted pedos, something sick has to rub off.

               I watched the mother talking to the press and watched the father.  I was picking up on some very deceptive body language and portrayal as well, it seemed like she talked about Madeleine like it was over, final. The body language of the father looked even more deceptive. It just felt all wrong.

                Thinking about those two as parents is frightening. We had posts that reported that Gerry had a policeman friend that scrubbed his computer of child porn. I get the feeling that the two of them are completely cold. They have completely written her off imo.

                 Right. If it was my daughter I would be holding out for her to return, I would be in a panic and barely able to control my turmoil and anguish. I see none of that with this couple.

                  I sometimes think that if the demand for truth gets to a fever pitch, that they will pass off some other Child as Madeleine to placate us.  There are many to protect in this horrid criminal coverup.I have a feeling there are some very well known names connected to it, at least names recognized by us.  Freud having lunch with the McCanns is beyond outrageous.  Something really sick on his part and a real joke, considering that Kate cried out They have taken her.  They?  A group of people?  Possibly the people that arranged for someone to have their way with Madeleine the daughter they keep saying they seriously miss and love.  Vomit inducing really.  This case may never be solved and that is so sad that the world is not crying FOUL.
