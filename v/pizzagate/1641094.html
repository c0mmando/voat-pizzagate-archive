<p><strong>Abel Danger Snuff Film Allegations about the Elite and Government:</strong></p>
<p>Field McConnell and David Hawkins have been reporting on government-facilitated and -produced snuff films for years, under the name Abel Danger.</p>
<p>They allege high level people, including Hillary Clinton, along with McConnell\'s sister <a href="http://archive.is/sapI9">Kristine Marcy, </a>members of the Department Of Justice, etc., arrange <strong>victim torture, and death betting &quot;games&quot; over private government &quot;bridge servers&quot; that live stream murders.</strong> (Children and adults.)  The crimes are allegedly streamed through SCIF\'s, or Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities, and the death time recorded in military &quot;Zulu&quot; time, or Greenwich Mean Time.  Abel Danger claims death betting by the &quot;elites&quot; has been going on for centuries, only now is it live streamed.  A lot of illicit income and blackmail material is generated this way.</p>
<p>AD alleges the betting parties, or as <a href="https://voat.co/user/StellarCorpse">@StellarCorpse</a> wrote, possibly &quot;pizza parties,&quot; often take place in luxury hotel suites.</p>
<p>Also, I found that <a href="http://archive.is/KApsW">one slang term for a <em>private server</em> is <strong>pizza slice</strong> </a>according to Urban Dictionary in 2010.  Original link:  <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pizza%20Slice">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Pizza%20Slice</a> A <a href="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3757/32481940850_56e9db9f9b_o.png">screen capture</a></p>
<p>(I sent the Urban Dictionary link to Abel Danger, and to Infowars mentioning AD\'s info, back in November.  I\'m not sure if the Wikileaks/pedo culture pizza code is sometimes used to refer to a private server, but I tried to put it out there in case.)</p>
<p>If anyone hasn\'t heard of Abel Danger\'s work and wants to look into these allegations, searching Abel Danger death betting, or anything similar, returns multiple articles.  Also AD makes YouTube videos.  People write up information from their videos at <a href="http://www.abeldanger.net">http://www.abeldanger.net</a> and <a href="http://www.abeldanger.org">http://www.abeldanger.org</a></p>

<p><strong>Stellarcorpse\'s thread:  &quot;What if Cheese Pizza is Live Child Porn?&quot;   <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1639622">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1639622</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if this is all centered around LIVE child porn/ child rape films? (in addition to and or in place of CT) And those pizza parties these elites in the Podesta emails are so obsessed with are CP LIVE filming parties? Not sure about DC, but these do occur among some perverse wealthy, well connected elites in Hollywood where I live. Satanic Cults almost always film their ritual abuse as well. Also a thing in Tinseltown. (they don\'t call it Hollywood Babylon for nothing.) Sometimes, no, I would say most often, these two are combined in a grisly Eyes Wide Shut kind of production. But you have to be \'in the club\' to watch or partake in it. I understand it\'s also a thing in Germany. Though of course all these parties are very, very underground and from my understanding very expensive to attend. Disgusting depravity that knows no bounds. To stand or sit beside your friends and colleagues whilst watching the torture and abuse of an innocent child. Think about it. Wouldn\'t they go to great lengths to keep these fetishes secret?</p>
<p>The famous Pegasus Museum may be a place where film production/parties takes place. Hence the freak out by Alefantis at the pizzagategear guy.</p>
<p>When you reread the Podesta emails with this context it mind it is interesting. Not at all downplaying the CT aspect or pedo aspect.( I BELIEVE THEY ARE ALL PEDOS.) We already have proof that many of those words used in emails are code for. But just adding a different perspective &amp; possibility.</p>
<p>I am linking this other users new subverse as it is related.</p>
<p>Those hidden files of Comet Ping Pong always bothered me. Not sure if this is true or not but someone is claiming they hacked into files/file and found CP in one of them.</p>

           (I sent the Urban Dictionary link to Abel Danger, and to Infowars mentioning AD's info, back in November.  I'm not sure if the Wikileaks/pedo culture pizza code is sometimes used to refer to a private server, but I tried to put it out there in case.)

           If anyone hasn't heard of Abel Danger's work and wants to look into these allegations, searching Abel Danger death betting, or anything similar, returns multiple articles.  Also AD makes YouTube videos.  People write up information from their videos at

            What if this is all centered around LIVE child porn/ child rape films? (in addition to and or in place of CT) And those pizza parties these elites in the Podesta emails are so obsessed with are CP LIVE filming parties? Not sure about DC, but these do occur among some perverse wealthy, well connected elites in Hollywood where I live. Satanic Cults almost always film their ritual abuse as well. Also a thing in Tinseltown. (they don't call it Hollywood Babylon for nothing.) Sometimes, no, I would say most often, these two are combined in a grisly Eyes Wide Shut kind of production. But you have to be 'in the club' to watch or partake in it. I understand it's also a thing in Germany. Though of course all these parties are very, very underground and from my understanding very expensive to attend. Disgusting depravity that knows no bounds. To stand or sit beside your friends and colleagues whilst watching the torture and abuse of an innocent child. Think about it. Wouldn't they go to great lengths to keep these fetishes secret?
           </p>
           <p>
            The famous Pegasus Museum may be a place where film production/parties takes place. Hence the freak out by Alefantis at the pizzagategear guy.
           </p>
           <p>
            When you reread the Podesta emails with this context it mind it is interesting. Not at all downplaying the CT aspect or pedo aspect.( I BELIEVE THEY ARE ALL PEDOS.) We already have proof that many of those words used in emails are code for. But just adding a different perspective &amp; possibility.

            Those hidden files of Comet Ping Pong always bothered me. Not sure if this is true or not but someone is claiming they hacked into files/file and found CP in one of them.

            I personally think that if those online ISIS Red Rooms are in existence they are likely being operated by the MOSSAD. It has their signature style-forensics - their word choice, their semantics, their thought processes (E.g. the way they say: "I had a horrorpasta thought of what if they are actually killing US troops and it is ISIS running the Red Rooms" - as if it matters who it is, that is a Jewish mindset on display, they think themselves as having souls and everyone else as being GOYIM who have no soul for them to do whatever they please with).
           </p>
           <p>
            I think most people if given the choice of empowering themselves with decency vs. thievery would choose decency, but they are presented with being empowered by evil only and they are mostly choosing being empowered+thievery vs. not being empowered+decency. So most are probably not going to make it out of here and survive.

            The Hostel movies are based in Slovenia, yet the redroom site has the word AKAUNT which is Bulgarian. I'm thinking this type of crap may be real, not sure if this particular site is or not - but it would make sense supposing their local Eastern bloc satanic mafia's are running these shows, how else are you going to maximize profit? If you don't put it online for people to sign up and send in directives - like online sex shows where the users can tell the girl what toys to use. Except in this case its torture and murder?

              You just can't help yourself can you. Do you realize following me around to specifically respond to my posts places you on a watched list. I am one of the good guys here with the connections and info to blow things wide open. There are others but you are clueless. We are just trying to break it to the masses of what is to come. Your own stupidly has been well documented not just by me but moderators and others. You might want to curb your attacks on this account you are not going to like the end when it is all exposed...just sayin
