            The eight-pointed star appears in cultures around the globe. It can be found within national flags, and even religious iconography. With it carries various meaning inclusive of each culture.The roots of the eight-pointed stat symbolize the four corners of space. The eight lines are symbolic of north, south, east, and west; and time as well with the two solstices and two equinoxes.
The first cross is the intersection of the Galactic Equator with the ecliptic and the axis perpendicular to this intersection. When the Earth Cross and the Galactic Cross are superimposed they form an eight-pointed cross. The two separate crosses become conjunct and form a single 4 pointed cross during the moments of a Great Celestial Conjunction. After the individual crosses separate again and form an eight-pointed cross again.
The Bible warns us of using astrological sorceryâ€¦another form of this is the astrological signs such as Leo, etc. GOD made the firmament and stars but not for idolizing and the secret here is it takes GOD out of the picture and places the planets and stars as the creator.

            Dating back to 2000 BC, the eight-pointed star was discovered as a seal within the ruins of the ancient city of Ur. There it was the symbol of the Goddess Inanna, the Sumerian queen of the heavens, and later the symbol of Ishtar, who was revered in Babylon as the Light Bringer - with the eight pointed star, enclosed in a circle being the symbol of the sun god. As such it offers us a powerful, ancient connection to the Goddess and the light and warmth that she provides.

            For the Sumerians the eight point star (the octagram) represented the goddess Inanna (Ishtar in Babylon). Eight years is also the length of a full cycle of Venus.

            I made this thread to explore the role of "Finders"  in fictional Hollywood films.  I was thinking about the movie Hostel, and how they use a shared symbol to identify fellow killers and elite club members, much like the Pedo symbols we've been researching, and then that led me to the killer in the movie Midnight Meat Train.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Ring the Killer in Midnight Meat Train wears is the same symbol from one of the Elite club member's home in Eyes Wide Shut.
           </p>
           <p>
            This grabbed me, because in Midnight Meat Train, the killer, or "Finder"  takes his victims through long forgotten subway tunnels, and feeds them to horrifying reptile-like beasts. When people try to go to the police to turn the killer in, certain high ranking officers have the same symbol on their lapels, and the cops try to misdirect them, and ultimately they inform the killers that people are on to them, and the cops, train conductor, and killer all use the same symbol to identify who's in on the killings for the elite.
           </p>
           <p>
            That same symbol appears in Eyes Wide Shut, another movie featuring "Finders" and secret cults of the elite, where they fuck, and apparently, kill, as part of their rituals, as Tom Cruise's character finds out the hard way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another prominent use of "Finders" in a film, are the Hostel film series. In it, "Finders" lure in young men and women into drinking, partying, sex, etc. and then capture and transport the victims to the Elite, and in this film's case, the Elite are a part of a secret club called Elite Hunting.  To be a member, you must first pay to get in, second, they tattoo the symbol of the bloodhound on your body, marking you so that you  and fellow members can recognize one another, and lastly, you are REQUIRED to kill the victim you paid for, and they do this, so that no one can walk away and grow a conscience. You HAVE to kill, so that everyone's hands are dirty, thus no one can turn someone else in without first turning themselves in as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are there other examples of elite using secret clubs and symbols to covertly take human lives in other Hollywood films?  What do these symbols and clubs represent?  Is this Hollywood revealing the truth through fictional means to give us a clue, or is this just their nodding to the elite who participate in these hideous acts in real life?
