<p>Here\'s my question to you:</p>
<p>Where is the Reddit thread that explained, in detail, what the FBI Twitter tweets were about? There was a massive, extremely helpful thread on Reddit (The_Donald, I believe) that went tweet by tweet by tweet, explaining what the tweets were about. It spelled out an entire narrative about how Donald Trump was basically deputized by the FBI, as a kind of left behind agent in occupied territory, to bring justice against the Clinton Foundation.</p>
<p>I can no longer find that Reddit thread on google. If you have a copy of it, know the name of it, know where the cache is, etc., I will be very grateful. I think it will be important in trying to understand what is going on within the FBI over the next 20 days.</p>
<p>My working theory is that intelligence people, within the FBI and elsewhere, worked with Wikileaks to leak the Podesta emails. They were planning on an even-more-massive leak (stage 3), and it was called off at the last minute. This stage 3 leak would have gone into child trafficking, Madeleine McCann, and similar things. They aborted this last leak, probably because their internal figures showed that Trump would win the election (and they could dump the leak if he lost). Nevertheless, they did not abort the revelations about the Clinton Foundation investation. All of these events happened on/around October 30: the FBI twitter account goes crazy, an FBI director announces it on CNN, and the Wall St. Journal announces it (the next day I believe). They wanted to leak enough to make sure that HRC did not become President, but they didn\'t want to leak so much that it caused mass protests, or civil war, like in South Korea.</p>',

            I thought the same. I believe there were some deals made and that's why they didn't release the 3rd dump. A little more patience is needed, we have to see what develops after the inauguration.

            Steve Pieczenik had a few videos he put out between nov1st and nov 4th.
Essentially, the intelligence community staged a counter coup against Clinton and whether she won the election or not, they intended on removing her from power.
           </p>

           </p>
           <p>
            It would also explain why the Intelligence community (outside from Brennan and Clapper) have refused to comment on the Russian hacking stuff, and many ex intelligence officials have come out to dispute the claims that it was Russians, and Wikileaks has had numerous people state that it was a leak and not a hack.

            Back then I thought it was the reverse order as what was in the Reddit thread you linked to. If we have to find the smoking gun, if they don't already have it, even without the FBIs resources, I think we are at a loss. We can request more info through FOIA, although we have to be very specific about a topic though, and not be so autistic and spam the form by the thousands.  I think we are here to find in groups more than what they can find, like by our number of participants, or to push the narrative that this shit is true and need as much attention as we can help with..

             Someone on 4Chan found this before me, but take a look at the firearms collection policy document. Now notice on Page 1, 6. Authorities. It references Executive Order 13058 as their authority on this matter. The problem is that EO 13058 was an executive about workplace tobacco smoke. So why would an EO about tobacco smoke be in a document about firearms? It's the smoking gun. FBI is telling us that they have it and hopefully will release it.

             In a stay-behind operation, a country places secret operatives or organisations in its own territory, for use in the event that an enemy occupy that territory. If this occurs, the operatives would then form the basis of a resistance movement or act as spies from behind enemy lines.

            I also agree with this theory.  It does seem that the 3rd nuke was imminent.  However, I think the election was thrown to Trump.  With all party's agreeing to the terms.  Remember the tweet that stated '...drop out within 24 hours or else...'.  How could the polls be so off?  The 3 rd nuke is going to be released.  The keys were hacked.  I think waiting for after inaugration day.

             Yes. My working theory is:

            <ol>
             <li>
              Wikileaks was not compromised.
             </li>
             <li>
              Trump is a good person.
             </li>
             <li>
              They are waiting until after inauguration to clean house.
             </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
             I could be wrong about all of that. Smart people like Engdahl disagree with me. We will see.

               He has done tons of videos and podcast interviews on YouTube.  I recommend watching 1-3. He basically independently confirms a lot of what George Webb says about hillary using ISIS to take over Libya and Syria for oil and plunder. He says that Huma Abedin is clearly some kind of agent or supporter of the Muslim brotherhood.  He believes there is basically an emerging new world order that wants to rule the entire globe under fascism and totalitarianism.

            i thinks pizzagate its pretty easy to understand: there's people inside cia/fbi/nsa that knows about it and want to help, but all those organizations are compromised. That's why they leaked it so it could turns into a public investigation. I want to believe that there are good people inside.

             There are definitely good people inside. I've read a few books by ex-dea, cia, fbi, the authors seemed like patriotic, idealistic, able people who wanted to make the world a better place, and wanted America to be the nation who pulled the world out of its strife, only to find out their masters were capitalising on the strife to get rich and maintain power. They often talked of vendettas launched against them when they complained or tried to change things.

            You Folks are Awesome. I get my mind blown everyday when I look at this page. The investigative skills and the motivations of the posters -- just awesome. When this happened I heard that Comey had also been staring at a pile of resignations sitting on his desk. It is a great hope that the rank and file of the FBI and LE in general have had enough of this abomination.

               Pick one subject that seems spicy and dig the fuck in. I've found very important things that haven't been uncovered just by picking one thing and obsessing over it for a week or so. These people are so sloppy it seems that something always pops up. Don't try to cover everything, just one thing and dig like crazy

            This is really data point number 4.

           <p>
            FWI, the first time I heard about Pieczenik, I thought he was crazy because he said that 9/11 was an inside job. Now I think that 9/11 was probably Mossad/CIA/Clinton/Bush/Soros.

             Same here. He's said Sandy hook was a false flag as well. Me and my friends thought he was a nut job. We've ALL changed our minds about him now.  If this is a troll/misinfo campaign, it's a damn successful one because it's completely changed my perception of the world

              He is adamant that 9/11 was some kind of inside job. Now I think he was probably right about all of it. Sent me down a big fucking rabbit hole of sloppy sniper, MK Ultra, nano-thermite, WTC 7 demolition, etc.

               I also did a lot of research on 9/11 after this all started happening.
              </p>
              <p>
               NRUN65 on youtube has an amazing documentary that lays out the case, and then asks questions which the debunkers have so far refused to answer.
              </p>
              <p>
               While there are many varying degrees of claims regarding the 9/11 conspiracy, from "the official story is not 100% correct" to "9/11 was an inside job and bush knew and helped cover it up".. At the bare minimum, I don't think anyone can watch all those and not at LEAST agree that the officially story is incorrect.

                Just reading the missing 29 pages of the 9/11 commission report will give a reasonable reader the strong impression that Saudi intelligence was involved.
               </p>
               <p>
                The problem is that, if you dig far enough, you start to realize that Mossad may have been involved as well. Mossad agents were caught in Hollywood, Florida monitoring 9/11 hijackers, and were caught celebrity with cameras on 9/11. FBIanon said that 9/11 was Mossad. Steve Pieczenik said 9/11 was some kind of inside job.

               <p>
                This is not a conspiracy theory that I ever wanted to believe in.

               <p>
                I find the evidence for demolition of building 7 and widespread nanothermite residue to be highly compelling.

               look in to the DC capitol hill renovations. being done by the same company that rigged the WTC's. im so goddamn afraid that theyll pull something biblical on inauguration day, like blowing up the whole capitol dome along with everyone in a 5 mile radius.

                Webb is worried that they will try to assassinate Trump, perhaps with La Raza shooting Stinger missiles at his plane.

                I have no idea. It is so terrifying that I try to just ignore it and hope and pray.

               <p>
                The most reassuring sign is that Trump must be well informed, and he seems very happy and calm. We'll see.

              It's not inciting if nothing happens.  And as far as linking that action to my random internet comment, I'll take a jury trial.  If they actually considered me a threat though, it wouldn't be processed through the legal system anyhow, they'd just assassinate me first.  That's the kind of people they are.

               Theres likely a minority in the NSA on our side, but the leadership is chosen by those in power, and anyone who wants to get anywhere in the NSA must prove themselves.

             Yeah, the explanation doesn't really make sense. First, if it was a backlog, we would expect random information. Instead, we have a sequence of ~20 tweets that are all related to Clinton, Trump, investigations, and getting new FBI agents. Second, CNN and Wall St. Journal announced FBI investigation onto the Clinton Foundation on the same day.

            I don't know the link you're looking for, but the conjecture i've heard which seems credible is that when Comey announced he was dropping the 'investigation' he was only referring to one of something like 17 separate investigations into Clinton and the Foundation. The twitterspam is alleged to have come from a rogue FBI agent who wasnt confidant how the internal FBI war would play out and their message was to instruct the public to do the investigation and raise the awareness.

            As ive said all along, the good faction of the FBI doesnt have the political cover to make arrests, it needs the public to make enough of a furore to make a lack of arrests utterly untenable
           </p>
           <p>
            My strong suggestion to the FBI is to arrest Mark Taylor, CEO of the NYT who covered up Jimmy Saville's crimes for 3 decades. HIS arrest will do more damage to the fake news propaganda device than anything else.   Because otherwise the media is so in the clinton camp that just to arrest clinton/podesta will be made to seem like the fbi has become 'politicised', and an unfortunately large part of the GP will swallow it

             And what would the charge(s) be?  Fox News already won the lawsuit to make clear that the media lying isn't illegal, so that's out.

              i stand korrected.
Im assuming between American and UK intelligence they have evidence of Thompson's participation in this ring (notwithstanding the report to the British parliament that a massive cache of saville-related evidence was destroyed).

The FBI can only recommend cases to the DOJ - who has at least 3 heads implicated as potential paedophile mafia.
No justice can come of the FBI moving at this juncture

             I agree with you analysis on the good FBI versus the bad FBI.

             There are actually 100 different ways to blow this investigation wide open. The best would be to find smoking gun evidence that the Podestas were at Freud's house on May 3, 2007.

            Yes that post existed.  It seemed to prove the original FBI anon was a true poster.  FBI released Tesla files, and those files mentioned FBI investigator Fred Trump, Don's uncle.  The tweets were supposedly all FOIA suddenly working, and seemed to suggest FBI investigators had their hands tied but they were able to respond and act on public information, even when they couldn't pursue covert investigation.

             Do you know if there have been any results from those FOIA requests? I was following that and people said they were pooling money together on
             <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald">
              /r/the_donald
             </a>
             to make them (if I recall, they were like $1k per request). They were making requests for pretty much about anything major and minor they could think of.

              I haven't seen any follow-up on the FOIA requests that came out of that thread, though I do know people were structuring their requests to include language essentially asking for the fee to be waived because the request was for the greater public interest.

            George Webb answered my question on Youtube with his explanation:
           </p>
           <p>
            No disrespect, but I don't think even polling people are very good at polling. I think the explanation is simple. Hillary wanted to take the fight to Comey, and Comey reminded her of the Marc Rich file and released it to the vault.
