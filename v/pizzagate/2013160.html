            KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOL - OBAMA CONNECTION !!!!!!!! Ex-Kamehameha Schools leader to serve on president’s panel
           </p>
           <p>
            "Former Kamehameha Schools leader Dee Jay Mailer took the oath of office Tuesday to serve on the President’s Advisory Commission on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders." "President Barack Obama appointed the members of the commission, which advises the federal government on ways to improve the health, education and economic status of Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders." "“The theme ‘I Am Beyond’ recognizes how Asian Pacific Americans have a rich, complex and inspirational American story,” said Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center Director Konrad Ng, a former University of Hawaii professor who is married to Obama’s sister Maya Soetoro-Ng. “ link:

            Umm...this is old news. Kamehameha Schools is under such tight scrutiny for their being a 501c nonprofit and only allowing native Hawaiians that they would never allow something like this to take place. Most recently a speech coach there was busted for filming students showering using hidden cameras. But it all seems very isolated and not organized or widespread. As for the magical Hot Dog Stand in Hawaii, has anyone run recon on that home in Hawaii Kai?

            Question that comes to mind is WHY so many doctors associated with these schools, orgs that are involved in "human trafficking", and States DHS departments. AND why so many "attorneys" around the kids?  Even in our town DHS is associated with biotech firms and doctors that specialize in biotech, genetics, and nano techology.

            Theory: These schools are the "hot dog stands".
           </p>
           <p>
            Reasoning: If hot dog is code word for underage males, then the stand must refer to a location predominately consisting of underage males that is in league with the pedo rings.
           </p>
           <p>
            An all male boarding school is the perfect candidate for the phrase "hot dog stand".
           </p>
           <p>
            Given some of the Obama connections, this is further fuel to the fire.

             Thanks for commenting on the post i made 2 days ago, and saying to folks" get in here!". i totally appreciate it!!! I'm new here, but i  know this subject matter well. There is something way wrong about that school, i believe it's a center for Pedos-Satanists. when these crimes come to light in the media .the school does what to can to cover them up. I now see that post i did , fading fast, sinking past the first pages of interest, the comments have maxed out the views have reached a ceiling to. i will dig deeper and find more. Any help in promoting this topic is greatly appreciated, thanks and God bless!

              This thread caused something to click inside my head. All the early stuff about code words made me realize that this is the lead we've been looking for.
             </p>
             <p>
              I recommend a new "support" thread connecting the "hot dog stands" to these schools.
             </p>
             <p>
              Maybe that outage for a few hours was because of this thread. Maybe the recent forum sliding too. They now might know that we know what hot dog stands means.

               "I recommend a new "support" thread connecting the "hot dog stands" to these schools." - YES!!! I agree. i got NEW INTEL on this KamehaMeha post from a few days ago. Hint: we are correct about that 'code'.  That School has many more cases i've found, EACH CASE, that school suppresses the investigation, withholds from HPD,etc.= coverup! . That school has the means to scrub the net, you have to go about the search in a complex way to find INTEL on them. LOOK &gt;

               ATTENTION:
 " In all, some 150 people have filed complaints in the four years since the Aloha State suspended the statute of limitations on noncriminal proceedings against sex offenders.
     The lawsuits involve various parties as defendants, including the Roman Catholic Church of Hawaii, Kamehameha Schools, Boy Scouts of America, medical facilities, and state agencies. One case names the State Child Protective Services, which the plaintiff says removed him from an abusive home environment only to deliver him into the hands of a predatory foster father." -

             "An all male boarding school is the perfect candidate for the phrase "hot dog stand".- I think you're on to something.. Kamehameha school is listed as one of the defendants in this lawsuit, so is Saint Francis Medical Center (SFMC), and Kuakini Health System (KHS), formerly known as Kuakini Medical Center.Are these places, code for 'stands'? He took these students off campus to drug &amp; rape at his house&gt;" in his home in Manoa for weekend sleep-overs where he drugged and committed further sexual abuse against the Plaintiffs and other KAMEHAMEHA SCHOOLS students (“Home Sessions”).” -

            Chech Obama school history in Hawaii. He was placed in private school by grandparents. Is this the same private school?
           </p>
           <p>
            I realize he has stated he was moved back to Hawaii at age 10 I believe from Indonesia but nothing about his life has been truthful. Posted below are photos of him in third grade and kindergarten at an entirely different school in Hawaii when he stated he was in Indonesia and has provided school pictures of the same.

             I believe he is connected to it.  That place is steeped in sexual abuse history and it is disgusting.  I believe that Obama appointed a former principal to some post or gave him some award.  I bet he knows where the hot dog stand is.  There is a ton of stuff to look up in Hawaii. This is one of them.  I did quite a bit of research on this a while back.
