Donna is a proven lying cheater, who gave CNN debate questions to Hillary during the democrat primary.  I bet she is helpful to him trying to pin this on the Russians.

             I just wrote I think yesterday, that I am suspicious of this guy and the students.  They will be another "go to" for those that are just worn out and want answers fast, but the answers will benefit the DNC and not us.  Here we go again also with the Russian Theme, God are we not just sick of that?  Donna Brazile too.  She has been mouthing the propaganda of the DNC, MSM and the Clintons since she came on the scene.  Something did not sit right with me since this Burkman first came out of the goodness of his heart.  Yeah, like any politician is going to have goodness in his heart.  I would say there are maybe one or two of those, and Burkman is not one of them.
