            It's well written. I think your ideas are all compatible with the Esoteric stuff - anyway if you accept that stuff could be true, the "grain of salt" aspect is built in as some of it is ridiculous on its face given what the knowledge that the public currently has. Money is definitely the root of all evil, literally. I agree that we need to give ourselves more credit, as this is how we evolve "human nature" in the long run by nurturing the positive drives that we naturally have to further the species by serving others. I think money can be a part of that system, but everyone would have to be trained from birth that excessive (don't ask me to define that just yet) accumulation of wealth/property = death as I believe that simple rule could change the world we live in today. Not that people should be put to death, but just establishing an understanding of the extreme negative long term consequences of agglomerated wealth.

            I absolutely agree with your sentiment.  Also, understand that there are many many good people in law enforcement, elected office (dare I say), and the alphabet agencies.  It's rough for these guys and probably easy for them to feel isolated and alone, even if that's not really the case. Its just a deception that evil tries force onto good people.  We need to let these people understand that we will support them 100%.  We need to help build them up and let them know we have their back so they have the strength and courage to make the right decisions.  These are the people who will be putting there lives, careers, and reputatons on the line to stand up against this evil.

            "They can't stop us" probably true, but "we" can stop our selfs and this is what usually happens. People lose interest while most denied all evidence to begin with and nothing will change.
           </p>
           <p>
            People are so indoctrinated they will argue with you why this all can not be true without having done any research.
"WE" will fight for them while they lean back and enjoy the show.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unless we have something like video proof of hc and obama actually raping children (unlikely to happen) nothing will happen and sheeple keep defending our masters and the system they invented to controll us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sorry for being negative. I am here and willing to fight, but I don't have much hope.
It's not the first time something like this is uncovered only to be forgotten again.
           </p>
           <p>
            And even if we get all of them out of buisness, the global monetary capitalistic money system still stands as a tool for the next group of crazys to controll the world with. 
And this is where I see the real problem. You can't put people in a scenario where one person could earn all the power over the world and  then hope that nobody wants to actually get this power in order to feel and act like a god who can do what ever he wants.
           </p>
           <p>
            You don't even need sardistic monsters to begin with. Just let this destructive inhuman system do its work on normal people and you will soon get all the horror you see now on earth. But I'm probably just an indoctrinated communist.

             You should read Montalk's book Fringe ideas for Beginners... it explains the larger system this is all a part of. you can't deny, you KNOW that there has been a lot of awareness raised because of this. There's no reason to try and smash the system, just raise awareness little by little and it will dissolve as people decide not to contribute to this anymore...
