<p>The European Union financed and owns the Human Brain Project which developed neuro brain computer interface technologies and was founded by Henry Markram. Henry Markram is a professor at Ecole Polytechnique Federale in Switzerland and was educated at Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. The President of Weizman Institute is the Belgian-Israeli Daniel Zajfman who has been a Director at Max Planck Society the reformed Nazi Kaiser Wilhelm Society and Henry Markram was also a member. The Israeli scientist Daniel Zajfman runs a renamed Nazi founded scientific institute. The electronic grid has been weaponized and programmed with the General Neural Simulation System also called Genesis to enable frequencies to hack into the brain and physiology. Genesis was developed by the Jesuit educated James Mason Bower. </p>
<p>he electronic grid and especially computers and smart phones are programmed with neuro brain interface programs that radiate electromagnetic frequencies designed to hack into the human brain and physiology. Other brain hacking systems include NEURON, NEST (software), and Brian (software). It is like an artificial intelligence radiated out of the electronic grid designed to covertly target the minds and physiologies of people in society. They can target individuals or target groups. Targeting can be subtle or it can be increased and extremely violent and torturous. Targeting consists of invasive and foreign thoughts and targeting of the physiology can cause pain, itching, spasms, pressure, irritation, fatigue and other attacks. The European Union which owns the Human Brain Project is based on the Treaty of Rome and the EU was signed in Rome at Capitoline Hill. The Black Nobility of Rome are leading in this scientific terrorism and have full access to these technologies..... </p>

<p>The Human Brain Project moved to Campus Biotech, Geneva in 2014.

<p>The founding members of the Campus Biotech are the Ecole polytechnique fédérale de LAUSANNE, the University of Geneva, the Bertarelli Family and Hansjörg Wyss. </p>

             I see.  I'll move the post. Though we know that Junkermann married into the Italian aristocracy, the group known as the Black Nobility and Epstein targeted neuroscientists. Also it has been speculated that  the ICE station OTTO could be part of a HAARP grid.  Something to keep in mind perhaps.

            "First on President Barack Obama’s tour of scientific marvels in Pitt’s Alumni Hall at this month’s White House Frontiers Conference was a stop to shake Nathan Copeland’s hand.  Or rather, the robotic hand that Copeland controls through two tiny brain implants in his motor cortex.  A second pair, implanted in his sensory cortex, allowed Copeland to feel the squeeze."

              have you clicked through the links to the YT video where the remarks about the Roman Black Nobility were posted

            <p>
             The remarks on the Webb video were deleted. Of course, because no links were given with the text I thought about disinfo, At the same time, this was posted long before Epstein-Junkermann.

              Good luck finding anything regarding the Black Nobility. They are VERY well hidden and super hard to find any information on.
             </p>
             <p>
              Known about them (and their family names) for years. Most of them are Italian and Spanish families.
             </p>
             <p>
              They are the absolute top of the global satanic power structure.

            Nice dig.  I've said for a long time that "hacking the human brain" has long been a sought goal of the Deep State.  In modern context, this started with Freud and his contemporaries, continued on with the Nazis, and was taken over by the CIA (Dr. Gottleib) and eventually merged in with the tech industry.
