<p>A. In a manner of speaking. We leak, so that the people may have a just outrage and demand a just result. The People outnumber the Government 300 to 1. It’s a numbers game.  We expected high level arrests to happen weeks ago, but discovered the bee keepers had interfered at the highest levels. There is an internal war within our Government, as many know.

            Podesta videos have to be released maybe by the White House if Bannon has any guts he will do this. Trump could do it but don't hold your breath. Bannon has to get a clear video of Podesta torturing kids and raping kids and it has to go up on Breitbart and be Headlined on Drudge Report. That is the only way it gets mainstream media attention they can't ignore it if Drudge blasts it with a flashing siren.

            Remember that mother who camped outside the White House or the mother who camped outside G.W.'s ranch? Do you think that if a small crowd with some very provocative signage started  doing this outside the White House the MSM could ignore it? Occupy Wall St. made some waves, right? Just a thought...looks like we might need boots on the ground.

            <p>
             If the FBI is so corrupt it can just shut down Trump from exposing another watergate, it is GAME OVER. We actually need those people to take this country back, rather than away from us. With the FBI, CIA, and NSA as our enemy, as well as the judicial branch and other agencies like the EPA and DHS, and the police departments unilaterally standing down during riots rather than defending the people they are supposed to protect and serve, the writing is on the wall. It is GAME OVER, Trump WILL be flushed out now, and we are going straight to hell.

           </p>
           <p>
            Anyone can bring a lawsuit against a government contractor under Qui Tam if they use government contract money for fraud or illegal purposes.

            I do think the original anon was legit.  But I did see some mention yesterday that the 5/3 anon could possibly be Steele, and trying to give disinfo and steer researchers in one way to avoid other things going on.   Just want to put it out there; think it's worth it to keep in mind.

            To FBIAnon: this is the ultimate test whether you are a patriot or an imposter. Leak incriminating evidence. Peaceful marches and protests are not an adequate response when dealing with absolute evil. Pedo-elites won’t go down peacefully. This is a battle for humanity. It’s either them or us.

            This insider clearly has an agenda and am reading so much that is anti-Israel in what is coming from them. Perhaps Israel tried to exploit some of this but the pedo stuff is the pedo stuff. I believe there is truth and lie with these folks.

            This.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Q. So was Trump wiretapped as our DHS insider and Robert Steele suggest
A. Yes.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This anonymous FBI source is quoting Steele? And when did Steele suggest this? I'm really worried that Trump is getting bad intel. I hope to God Trump got this info from someone like Sessions who would actually be able to confirm an order to wiretape and wasn't provoked into dong this by bad intel. The way the media is reporting, the dems are all saying it didn't happen. It would be a completely untenable position to take if they did wiretap. Yes, they could be playing the game that Trump was wiretapped, but the ex-POTUS had nothing to do with it, but I'm worried about the reports that the request was made and turned down. That would mean what Trump just tweeted out is wrong ... and that's not good.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the phones were wiretapped, I'm glad the POTUS came out and said it, but if this is bad intel? Trump has to hold back on airing everything before checking it out two or three times. I don't trust any of what is going on, and the best card the dems could play is provoking a public meltdown over something that didn't happen. Just thinking out loud. It just seems odd that the dems are stonewalling this rather than offering an excuse. That's not effective strategy. The only way it would be is if the justice department did it. Then they would be technically right that Obama did not order it as suggested. Either way, this putting allegatons out there without proof (if that's what happened) has got to stop. He has a lot of people depending on him (US!) to right the wrongs committed over the past few years (probably longer), so he has to make sure his statements are impenetrable. The worst thing that could happen is being put in a corner where he has to issue an apology to Obama over accusing him of something he didn't do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fingers crossed that this is true. If it isn't, Trump: you're being given bad intel and listening to the wrong sources. Stop it and rely only on very trusted men/women that are close to you. Even then, triple check because they may have been fed the wrong intel.

             Some are claiming the server in Trump Tower was part of a Trump criminal op - probably to have a cover when it is proved that there was a Court Approved tap.

              As long as it's true that he was wiretapped, I'm fine with it. It would be the best thing ever if there were a wiretap that yielded nothing. With all these claims of complicity with the Russians and wrongdoings, having nothing to show would be great. I'm sure they used a pretext. The justice department needs to be of something before it approves a request.

            I can understand the need for support from the people.  But then, why don't the good guys who have access to ample actual smoking gun evidence like videos, wiretaps, etc. leak just a few to prove that it's real?  As long as we only have circumstantial evidence we will not get the moral outrage response from the people.  The more we reiterate over the same material, the more watered-down and it loses its mojo over time.  If they want support they have to do something like release the 650K emails.

            We've practiced on the marginal stuff, we've read enough, seen enough InstaGrams to get the idea, stepped somewhat into the totally unacceptable, but barely discernible with Skippy (and some of us have happened on far worse, starring bit players),  now the real stuff should be leaked. That Skippy vid has had a huge impact and is a crowbar that opens up people's minds to more. Gathering together select, totally abominable material that would implicate people that could be networked, the way networking has snared so many so far, might take it to the next level. Also, I believe in the power of prayer/focus/meditation, whatever you want to call it. If a time could be picked for anyone interested to concentrate on the idea of this being brought to light, the way certain groups pray for peace on a regular schedule, I would certainly tune in.

            Agree with below..one leaked video of Clinton, Obama, or others raping a child and this will all be over...release the videos...lots of people aware...just like with Trump campaign they are quite...if you want "bees swarming" very easy to accomplish...release videos...

             You are so correct.  Pizzagate was made possible by Podesta's arrogance, having "password" as a password, otherwise, we would still not see links, imagine the beast, only hear rumors of how connected and vast this is.  And we would still disbelieve it.

             Another Anon "FBI source" said if all the info gets out, it could take down our government and others.  After watching what the Deep State is doing to stop Trump, that might be our only option.  They want to wage a "soft coup?" Then we need to wage a "soft revolution."

            First, that wasn't written by whomever claimed to be FBI ANON on 4chan. (Who was also a larper, incidentally.) Huge grammar gap. The person has never worked at the FBI, doesn't know the right details.. And, also, oh golly gee, what are the chances that the site owner and "FBI Anon" make all the same stupid spelling errors?

            Hey FBI? Risk your pensions and comfy lifestyle for the good of humanity. We know that's what's going on. Sibel's co-worker waited years sitting on this info, living his comfy life while more  and more children were raped and killed. It's in this vid, sorry no timestamp, most of you have seen it anyway

            so fucking release it. I don't know how you can live with yourselves knowing this happens and not doing anything just because of the fucking money. Have you ever thought about your afterlife? I don't think God will look  favorably on an accessory to crimes such as these.

            The fact that we did 9/11 ourselves should have started a revolution but nothing happened. Years later people are still either asleep or just waking up because of this. Americans have proven to be soft comfortable people whose minds have been controlled so long that they are all neutered. And the enemy knows this.

            Bait and switch. So all their reports of "imminent arrest" are garbage, nothing is being done, and they expect us to storm the streets and do something? Sounds like a trap to me. And if this is true, it is an admitance that Trump and Sessions are worthless and waiting for us to do their job. I really tire of this game. In other words, hints and inuendo, but in reality this is status quo. 300-1 does not matter when they have the police and military. They are asking us to riot. Even then, the media will twish it against us. Bunch of bullshit.

             Precisely. It's an insult. They are the cops.. The alleged FBI wants our ass on the line? 
Too stupid. 
Why don't the FBI petition McCabe and march to his office demanding arrests and resignations.

            If hard evidence (video etc) is leaked it will be very hard for the liberals to ignore it.. I hear ya all.. im pissed off.. Marching and protesting wont do shit! we know how they censored Trumps inauguration and made it look like hardly anyone turned up. 
Heck im in New Zealand, they posted a photo on the front page of the fucking newspaper and first News Item on the 6 o'clock news basically laughing at Trump for a small turnout (which was total BS as we know).. They used the same tactic during elections..
            <br/>
            Making it look like many turned up to Hillary's speeches when hardly anyone did.
They have full spectrum control over the MSM.. thats one of the biggest problems we face..
But over time I do believe we are seeing more and more wake up to the truth.. Ive been contacting my friends in MSM and sending emails to journos I trust in the system.. None of them will touch this.. and this is in New Zealand.. even this far away they are scared to step out of line..
its pathetic..  right now the biggest stories in the newspapers in NZ is how well is Lourdes new album been doing? One of our top Netballers died recently and its front page news, coverage of her funeral etc etc.. God its pathetic.. All the true Heros are not even known.. 
people are risking lives to bring PG out and all out fucking pathetic media can talk about is sporting heros and fucking pop music!
Fuck em!!!
But to get back to the subject.. HEY FBI-ANON!!! Are you here? Are you reading this? We need some fucking action!
Release the real dirt, the real evidence..  as others have said WEVE DONE OUR JOB.. weve dug deep.. 
Its up to you pencil pushing nice salary FBI keyboard whistleblowers to do SOMETHING CONCRETE instead of just talking to us!!!

             sup fellow kiwi. NZ is a joke when it comes to neo-liberalism, MSM sources here (fairfax, mediaworks) are heavily influenced by open society sponsors, they are binding to copy all their foreign news from CNN/MSNBC, so you will be trying to bleed a stone trying to get NZ reporters to look at this.
            </p>
            <p>
             And yes the news here is shit, state funded media has bought every outlet there is, and nobody listens to independent reporters here. Ive been told by a friend in the press that New Zealand is a 1984 experiment, "free" country controlled by the "ministry of truth"
            </p>
            <p>
             Hold up though, all this trump propaganda is stop people voting for winston and vote for english/little 2017 since the two are circlejerking each other and keep the machine running, we need a strong leader but the powers that be want to keep us controlled while we send our wealth to multinationals. But ohnoo we have a "rockstar economy"

             Dont lose hope though, I'm working on a piece which ties in JK/rotary club/70's state care abuse/oldschool nats in an old abuse network ,,, JK is a very crooked man, everything from him and BE's involvement in Mossack Fonseca, laundering tax payers money through Clinton Foundation and how he was controlled opposition by the Saudi's, (think sheep deal, ally jordanian fighters etc) , real reasons he went after kimdotcom, more cameron slater paid bias, chinese 14K triad and negligence to ephedrine imports. The list goes on

             We have our own villains in NZ.  Mainly useful idiots, but I am sure there are Kiwi pedo/satanist/cannibals at the top of the power structure.  If you have any clues, there is plenty of work to be done here.

              NZ is funny, not heavily structured like the US. Hint is you wont find pedo politicians as much, but the mates at the golf course are the ones worth looking into.

             Exactly. They are already discredited. But they feed off of your desperate hope. All the while they clowned many into posting these "imminent arrest" links on their social media pages and made fools of themselves. Victurus Libertas is disinfo.

             They just want to keep their pensions. I remember Sibel Edmunds saying exactly that in one of her videos. Some FBI guy she worked with knew everything but waited for years to spill it because he didn't want to risk his precious pension.

            George Webb keeps giving them more and more. Some is on pedos, and some is just plain ole human trafficking, some organ harvesting, lots of hacking and espionage and where to look to find the proof.

             Webb is not a private citizen, as I see it. No way. 
But he's doing a good job, And has the right idea on the proper Activism. 
Targetted Tweets.

            <p>
             After we do Targetted Tweets for a while. We might be ready for a Petition.

             Fools. They want Civil War, that's the script. 
Then "Homeland" can come in, and Zombie Public? - they will think it's great. 
And go right along. 
Think "Nazi Germany" when they came for neighbors and neighbors just sat back and watched.

             They can't keep their lies straight. There are no white hats. Remember that. All spooks are trash.. If ex spooks come out of the woodwork to advise you, don't believe them. They are simply trying to keep you confused, stretch this out until we are used to talking about it for years and nothing gets done. Just like 9/11. Wake up, your country has been taken over and they are not in the business of giving it back and arresting themselves. Remove them yourselves or get run in circles. The insiders are bullshit, admit they were wrong, and start spinning new webs. You have all been had.

              This is the truth we don't want to face.  We don't want to remove them ourselves.  Truly we are caught in between; we inherited this set up where we entrust agencies to carry out investigations, trial and punishment.  But these agencies are not working for the people.  So how do we transition from a specialist society to a do-it-yourself society?

            Think "A Tale of Two Cities".  Tricoteuses were ghoulish women who knitted while watching victims being conveyed to the guillotine and beheaded during the French Revolution.

            The research has been done, the redpilling continues at a modest rate- not big enough.  We need some leaking, some arrests, something.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you continue to sit on your hands while the window is closing, then what else can we do?  We cannot do enough, we need your next move to be a significant one.

             No, he's got a link. Also, the critical discussion of the link source and the Anon it quotes is highly relevant and good innoculation against confirmation bias. The disinfo is getting thick these days. We want everyone putting everything to the test. This type of debate is the whole point of this subverse.

            Can we have taxpayer funds to protest like the globalists/leftists? (Not really, but it shows how absurd the situation is.) It's time take realize these punks have been on a war footing for decades. Time to punch them in the noses.

            Curious, in what way can this evidence be methodically leaked and spread? It is so heinous...what if the media blacks it all out?  I guess it could be speed on the Chans, but if the posters got found out they could get in trouble.  Somehow it's gotta get leaked anonymously.  I'm just not sure how to make a campaign out of the sick hard evidence...and I don't see how public outrage ensues wo hard evidence. Catch 22?

             I think that's what the indsiders who wanted / want this to come down have been hard at work trying to figure out.

             One thing : If your plan fails to work in theory, it will fail in the real world.

             You wait until the Head of Beast shows, and then you pull on it. And that is what has happened.

             I fail to see why people claim "Nothing has been done" just because the unfolding hasn't gone according to their script.

              Maybe it all comes down to empowering the FBI to move...what that will take, I'm not sure.  But I think we know the DOJ is ready to go.  I just wonder how much 'detail/evidence' will be leaked to the public?  This may have to occur if the elites start saying the FBI/DOJ is compromised or that this is a purge.

              Even if all the ducks are in a row to arrest/prosecute, I think another factor they may be considering is how to handle taking it all down if it is so wide spread that congress effectively becomes incapacitated and Wall Street gets turned on its head (I could care less if the MSM all gets taken out and shot, that can only have a positive effect).
              <br/>
              Does the constitution have some kind of contingency if 30% of Congress goes to prison?  Can Trump stabilize the economy if they try to murder/suicide the country?  I do believe and am praying Trump can really do this!

             There is no catch 22. You put the damming evidence out there anonymously. They can't explain away, only try to cover it up. And that is that. Everybody needs to cut the bullshit. Our typing just makes us feel better, it has never changed anything, ever. Remember 9/11?

              It's absolutley untrue - And Propagnada the shills love to push, that Information does nothing.

              They want you to think that.

              If it did nothing they would not be attempting to shut it down and they would not be paying good money for armies of disinfor operations to troll and goon "enforcer" types to intimidate .. And they wouldn't be fucking killing researchers/ investigators #monicapeterson.

              That's not true.. Alex Jones blocked the info on 9/11 and drove it down a blind alley. That was what he was meant to do.

             They ignore their phone calls/  Waste of energy.

            <p>
             I know from long experience , where millions called - Anti - War; They just ignore it. 
They are hired to do a job. And one of those jobs is to ignore and even laugh at, your phone calls.

             The targetted Twitter idea is good.

             A phone call not answered goes down the "Memory Hole "

            Total fucking bullshit. Do you realize there's no way to even know if FBIanon will lead to any arrests? Everyone already knew the Clinton foundation was the focus.  The podestas would otherwise not have had recognition with spirit cooking or wirhout

              His name is Clif High - he uses complex algorithms to make predictions based on language relationships he sees on the internet. I posted about it his Pizzagate predictions in 2017 here:

               Cliff High is correct to often for my taste. I have nothing on him, but I don't rule out that he is somehow clued in and is using this "webot" as the reason he keeps predicting things. How could we know either way? Still, I always take a peek at what he is saying.

              It's fucking Cliff High, most likely a Mossad asset as the only place I've seen his shit shilled is at glp aka tav1st0ck. He had nothing new to add and had an embarrassing lack of knowledge about details that any true  digger would know. Fuck him, he's looking to mine us for new audience/clicks. Soemone posted a vid of his yesterday with zero description and a bunch of shills started ooohinh and ahhing over it and saying how brilliant he is, send money. It wasn't and he's pure disinfo.

               I think he does 'False Hope" plus trying to sell Gold. So I didn't have time to listen. 
He could be right, but he could be brandishing False Hope to get people pissed and discouraged when it doesn't materialize.

            March 25 will go a long way toward making this happen. When people show up en masse to demand action, it's hard to ignore. As long as it stays peaceful, msm can't spin it to fit their narrative.

              Be sure before you do something, for your own "feel good" reasons, that it doesn't make things worse.

              It is a trap, they will bring out anti gay signs, act violent and crazy and discredit the protest. This is the way the enemy works. Expect to be angry after the protest. I predicted the hoax shooter going to CPP and warned everybody that the late night comedians would be attacking them daily. I knew this from experience following the truth movement. The media will cruicify this protest and agents of the enemy will infiltrate the crowd  and that is who will be covered.

               So true. Look what happened to Stickman, arrested on serious charges for protecting people. Too risky. And those old people that were hurt and maced. Marching is silly and will be twisted against us.

                 There is not the time to prepare, even if such action is advised.

                <p>
                 Also, There should be a purpose. i.e. Petitioning the Government - It shouldn't be just MARCHING in circles.

                 A MARCH is 100% ; their playbook.. Start a boycott instead, and enroll people. Bigger the numbers.

             yes ---  via one of these posts, I read about this same thing happening in Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
             The gov't did a few things to resolve it but once the masses calmed down / protests stopped, so did the Govt. action.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a ground swell now.  They may make a couple of arrests so people think something is getting done and then not follow through when people stop hammering.
            </p>
            <p>
             From what I have been reading, this cover up started before Nebraska and has only grown.  It seems large, entrenched and possibly growing.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is no way to root it out completely without really disrupting our govt  and others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Granted, Trump is potus - but still, one person; and potentially surrounded by many who are against the resolution.
            </p>

             On top of that, he is being pulled in a zillion directions.   Very difficult situation.

              We are used to POTUS doing nothing. So the 5 weeks of lack of top arrests triggers fear this will go on forever, as it has.
             </p>
             <p>
              Trump's only been in power 5 Weeks and has had to fight off massive opposition.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now he's angry and he's going to fight back this week. Trump is in a position to actually do something.
             </p>
             <p>
              A March in support of TRUMP - ? - That would swell ranks, Does he need our help and support..? Likely now.
             </p>
             <p>
              However I am against all Marches.. Espeically ones without an actual purpose , i.e. Petition ..
             </p>
             <p>
              Otherwise you can just boycott. And then of course you don't have all the WOKE people gathered together , so conveniently, for counter - measures.

            The left is so entrenched in their hatred for Trump and his supporters that no matter what happens or what gets leaked they will still protect and fight for their pedophile masters. They will cry foul no matter what happens I have no doubt of this it's gonna get uglier the more the net closes in on them.

              I fucking hope so. From whet I've seen on fb they project every ounce of this back on to the right. The Milo reference is a classic. They scatter when real information starts being brought forth unless they stick around long enough to scoff at the source and say they want footnotes and 3 references per claim all kinds of other stupid shit it's insane

The po po won't do shit to us for blasting it out on social media without answering for the contents of the video and arent they arressting those motherfuckers who are on video doing this wicked shit. The media will have no choice. They can't cover that shit up.

            After that if nothing happens, then we know it fucking time to take hammer to DC and do some solid demolition work. Spare Potus Trump. Level everthing else. No pedo fuckers will never touch another kid.

             It must be thrown out in the open and distributed big-time.The important part here is
             <strong>
              building the global unified truth
             </strong>
             . When this happens, and names are out, while people remain lawful, refusing to procecute then becomes a first-degree evil, unconstitutional act. That hands the right of strike to any righteous law enforcement. For example, a judge willfully dismissing charges for any of these evil deeds proven through evidence, no matter the medium (video, emails) won't be out for long. Release damning info about Obama, Hillary, Huma, Podesta the whole darn 9 yards. It will put the right to action in the hands of both The People and truthful, righteous law enforcement, because it then makes
             <em>
              them
             </em>
             the effin proven perps to the Majority, with no where to hide for those evil fucks.

             How about we take a play out of the play books. The Arab Spring was brought about by email, social media, etc.. If we get real incriminating photos, videos, email that prove these things beyond a shadow of a doubt and put together summary PDFs. we could amass an army and everyone could plaster it on all their own Social Media pages and send it out to all their contacts. It would be like a mass email, Social Media barrage, going nuclear. We could have a message included for others to join the army and resend or repost everything. We could have a day, a week, or even a month. Maybe have multiple types of attachments so everything gets circulated around, and around. I'd like to see how the MSM could or would react to so many angry Americans. Their complicity of course would be part of the information. I believe some of them are involved. For the one who aren't, they remind me of the many Germans who stood by and let Hitler cause mass murder. I realize there are  unfriendlies lurking and reading this, so we could take it underground to organize and have code words to throw them off for when this would happen. Like the pedophiles do with their codes. But remember, the good guys can do the same. Remember D-Day when they threw the Nazis off of where and when the Allies would land. We could even forge alliances and take this worldwide. These scrum bags will have no rock to hide under once the outrage starts to brew and erupt. We could even direct our news sites to provide "incrimination info packages" for others who hear about but haven't received an email so the can do the same.
Anyway, it's a thought and would be so much easier than organizing a march, in my opinion.

             This. If these "insiders" want to help, dump the damaging footage online and cut this bullshit sharade short. We can't give material to the cops or FBI, they are complicit or in on it. So these insider either leak the smoking gun, or shut up and go away. We will handle it from here. They have no credibility at this point.

             They can't just release it all. It's 12D chess. The public needs to be drawn into it slowly otherwise they won't digest it properly and it will be dismissed as Russian CGI.

Anyone who believes they can win against the State - with Arms or Anarchy? is an idiot.

             Exactly--there is no suitable outlet for the rage I feel against these monsters. They'll sneer at a demonstration too. I will go if I can get transportation--I think people marching en masse at least sends a message, but will anyone be watching/caring? The truth is--people don't want to believe that this stuff is actually happening

              Not sure why your need for a "suitable outlet" for your rage is more important than doing something that can be foreseen to actually help.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's about more than your personal rage or feelings of anger. 
I've spent my life marching for causes. Yes, they are feel good events for particiapants, and do nothing but discourage when afterward everything is the same.

              The media controls what people see and the control the commentary when they do allow them to see it. These insiders are bogus. Dump your material all over the web or get lost.

               Right I had the same question : THE FBI is telling people to take to the streets and march!
              </p>
              <p>
               Why doesn't the FBI do that - that's their job?
              </p>
              <p>
               If marching did anything we wouldn't be where we are now.
              </p>
              <p>
               What they do is - that don't cover it ; and they lie about numbers ; as everyone saw at the Inauguration.
              </p>
              <p>
               Next : It puts all the Red -Pilled people in one place at one time.
              </p>
              <p>
               That is very tempting for them; What do you think all the chemical warfare , germ war is for? Middle Eastern "Terrorists"
              </p>
              <p>
               No it's not. In case you were wondering.
              </p>
              <p>
               We already saw this at an large anti - War demo many years ago, people came down with Rabbit flu - which is rare unless you roll yourself around in a barnyard.. At the same time the chemical war sensors were triggered right on the MALL where all the demoonstraters were.
              </p>
              <p>
               The March advise is total Social Engneering. .Does NOTHING.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the Internet Age - there are better tactics. Even fliers, books and talking to people at a booth / stand in your local neighborhood - to get people who will stick.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you March they will send Provacatuers to make you look bad and make people fear you.
              </p>
              <p>
               Remember the Fake Attack on the Pizza Joint dive?
              </p>
              <p>
               People think that "So Something" no matter what. Reality is: It's just a feel - good move for the Participants.. To make them feel as though they are "doing something" when they really are not, and maybe making it worse.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is a reason people are being led to a "March" especially on the Spring Equinox. !
Who suggested it? Was there a discussion here about tactics or was it just assumed that it was a good thing.
              </p>
              <p>
               Right the FBI want us to do their work for them.. phst. Really?

             I have redpilled 3 people this week. It went well....I think people know and are more ready than you realize.....especially if you keep it non partisan and even. Fact based..,,no one has said STFU. All have said....I am not surprised. Perhaps we are projecting too much? We expect it....I have been pleasantly surprised. Onward!

            Short of vigilante style justice, or an all out civil war, I'm not sure what further actions can be taken besides keeping our endurance.

            The fact is, these so-called anons need to leak the actual stuff, not talk in general terms.

              Public lacks any power to do anything.
             </p>
             <p>
              By Constitution we are allowed to "Petition"
             </p>
             <p>
              So drafting a petition and delivering it to Congress and the FBI, NSA, Homeland Security is a role for the public.
             </p>
             <p>
              Being police or vigilante ? We lack the means.
             </p>
             <p>
              Outgunned especially with the Mass Media owned by them.
             </p>
             <p>
              A petition to the Mass Media organization?. Presidents of Networks.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not sure they have to even receive it or make a show of listening, since they are privately owned / funded.
             </p>
             <p>
              No one notices the Media's role; for years now. One is laughed at for mentioning it. Usually.
             </p>
             <p>
              However Media is the key to their power and their Protector, Enabler, also runs the "We are just doing our job for the Good"
             </p>
             <p>
              Boycott the Mass Media and their sponsors is the way..
             </p>
             <p>
              However, at this time, do we even have to numbers to make that thing bite? 
First have to get our numbers up..
             </p>
             <p>
              To think you will high-jack Mass Media for your own cause is massive delusion / false hope.
             </p>
             <p>
              I boycott Pizza and it angers some friends.. I will not eat it. The associations are too disgusting. If people can't handle that, too bad.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, remember the rebellion against England, centered around the resistance to a TAX - the Stamp Act.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is the kind of thing which draws their attention,, Not a March where we play "sitting duck" And gather all our best people there to "SHOW THEM " - but instead to be targets for their latest testing of crowd weapons/ germ - chemical warfare.
             </p>
             <p>
              No that does not "Show Them " phst. Been there, Done that. Total Fail.

              There is enough evidence in podestas email alone to warrant official investigation. When this march happens the focus should be on the DC police, not comet ping pong. Go to the police stations with banners 'If the police do not act, the people will HAVE to #Pizzagate'
             </p>
             <p>
              That shows a) being reasonable b) showing our patience will not be unlimited and that our faith in the Law is not inexhaustable c) cannot be used by the media to be made out to be partisan or loony or harassing a private citizen who thy think is innocent
             </p>
             <p>
              its just a much better strategy than staking out comet ping-pong where the media will try to reinforce you as crazies

             If he is real, and pedo/torture/snuff videos are the small stuff.  At what point don't you say fuck it, I'm a human, and leak some solid god damn evidence.  I'm starting to feel trolled
