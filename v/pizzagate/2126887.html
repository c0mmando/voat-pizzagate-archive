            whats with all the cloak and dagger with the Pakistani boogeymen...?
I searched for a mug shot and the Dulles arrest, and there's nothing... never has been... just some cartoons of court proceedings..... and one or two pictures of swarthy dudes.
Remember the district this is being played out in....
Its a who's who of well placed criminals with a long history of lying, killing, blaming, and cheating.... most relevant; they get away with it.
Something about this whole story from the start has given me the squirms.

             Exactly.  This was first the Luke baby that I recall, then the GW baby since early this year.  GW is definitely an operative of some sort.  No way to deny that if you've followed all the bumps along the way with G and his brother, etc.  Luke works for Daily Caller, who participated in the selling of the Charlottesville fakery, an act of treason against Americans.

             Add the rest of the characters in this bunch..dish, spidey, as well as their critics, or one time friends turned critics... and it's a swampy mix, you have to admit.  I don't believe these are your heroes.

             I know Rep Andre Carson is on the list without looking. His district is downtown Indianapolis.
Link him, Jesters, and Electric Pence together and you have your noose.
Also duckduckgo Carson's mother (first AA woman in congress) and 'pea shake houses'.
             <br/>
             Gov Mitch Daniels (Indiana, now prez of Purdue U)did not run for president in 2008 because of his marital issues (I think he's squeaky clean though) coming out.
Also pastor Jeffrey Johnson (Eastern Star Baptist, friends with Sharpton and Jesse Jackson) and Bishop T. Garrett Benjamin (Light Of The World Christian Church). Those two clergy are cash heavy and I've heard 'talk'.
Sorry, crumbs is all I have.

            How many of you saw those two douchebags from Daily Caller walking around the fake car crash scene in Charlottesville, asking stupid questions and pretending to be very careful not to show too much gore?  Some of the most awful acting in the history of false flags, but I really think it's not an accident.  Each new shitshow becomes more and more easily debunkable, anyone awake loses their minds each time.  Ha.  That's no coincidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            After you see any media outlets involved in these traitorous hoaxes, why give them another second of your attention?  You know they lie, that's enough already.  As far as I'm concerned, they even threw Luke Rosiak, and others I liked, in the same shit pile when you know their outfit is involved in hoaxing America along with the rest of the controlled media.  I followed GW all along with the Awans, until about a month ago when he was in Florida, outside the Pulse, talking about how real it was and how 50 people died, and another episode where he was saying he met Stevie Steve's barber, blah blah.
           </p>
           <p>
            I believe you can find a handful of honest researchers and journalists within these sites.  Internet autists may be our only hope.  Anything remotely mainstream, any frigging press passes..any media like that..is controlled treasonous propaganda on one level or another.  Throw away your tv, radio, newspaper, cable, all mainstream internet, and hollywood entertainment.  They can't even produce a frigging movie, they can't produce a cartoon these days, that ain't screwed up 10 ways to Sunday.
           </p>
           <p>
            Daily Caller, you got a minimum of 2 terrorists working for you.  One fat one, and one with sunglasses and a little goatee.. with only a few brain cells to rub together.  And the terrorists' bosses at DC.  Weed them out before you go after DWS and Awans, etc.  It's much easier and they are every bit as treasonous as any gov't player, you have to think of it that way.

             I'm not praising anyone. I'm just submitting a story that seems credible. If it's not credible, now that I would be sorry about! As for GW, I'm a major critic and not a fan. Everyone on Voat knows that, so it's all about the story this time.

              Haven't yet read this whole thread. However at GLP thread titled "Little Birdie Told Me . . . you'll see how this all ties in to the murder of brave investigators, Michael Hastings, the 2 famous musicians re Linkin Park, and yes, the Sandy Hook planned attack to cover up CT massive corruption. Used as a total distraction." I haven't finished reading all of the details but it's shocking &amp; inclusive.

             Nobody is saying it's only dems involved, but for purposes of this story, Awan was DWS' bitch. The DNC was where he worked. All 45 congressional members of dems. More importantly, Seth Rich was working at the DNC.

            This explains SO MUCH. They could blackmail at least 45 members of congress! This is by far bigger than Watergate. But the crimes the mainstream media always focus on, is this ridiculous accusation against Trump/Russia.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Data was also backed up to Dropbox in huge quantities, the official said. Congressional offices are prohibited from using Dropbox, so an unofficial account was used, meaning Awan could have still had access to the data even though he was banned from the congressional network.
            </p>
            <p>
             Awan had access to all emails and office computer files of 45 members of Congress who are listed below. Fear among members that Awan could release embarrassing information if they cooperated with prosecutors could explain why the Democrats have refused to acknowledge the cybersecurity breach publicly or criticize the suspects.

             I read a new poll today that blew the pollsters out of the water. The young kids believe far less than the older people when it comes to MSM. The MSM is besides themselves. This one-sided bullshit has turned the kids and some adults from believing them especially, on FB where they get most their news. Even if they label it "Fake News", the kids don't believe it is fake. I, personally, am loving this.

              Me too. But now they are starting to teach them in schools what is fake news and what is not. So they can brainwash them with that like everything else.

             He couldn't have gone rogue. He had to have people covering for him to get into this position of power, but think about it. Blackmail has been at the heart of pizzagate all along. The dems NEED blackmail on their own party members! Remember all those passages of bills or wonky voting? Blackmail is what they use to turn the screws.

             This is HUGE!!!! If we actually had a media in this country, they'd be all over this! The fact they're not even covering this tells you how corrupt they really are.

              Thats how they are keeping them in check. Chuck Shumer, Nancy Pelosi and Maxine waters seem extremely paranoid to me. I bet so many of them are freaking out now LOL. I love it!

               Yes! And remember Pelosi is from that strange dem party that was described as "cultlike" Complete loyalty was demanded. It was at the same time that Jim Jones was a member.

                      RFK assassin was programmed, a little off topic but here (below) you can see the LAPD try to change a witness's story, it's spooky. The whole (very long) documentary gets into Jonestown after this particular part. Maybe you've heard of it (the documentary).

                      There's a book out now about all this "The Girl In The Polka Dot Dress" I think is the title. I've no time to read it, just too much to look into in so many matters. But this interrogation in the clip shows just how corrupt people can be, and are, and just how bogus the RFK investigation was. But I'm preaching to the choir.

                       I've watched a lot of true crime documentaries. They use these kinds of tactics and sometimes people will admit to things they didn't even do. They would keep them for hours and hours and wear them down. It's so wrong.

                       There was such an excellent documentary done on the JFK investigation. It was done right after the murder. The people the police talked to were in it, including the man that insisted Harvey was in his store ... or walked by his store. I don't remember. I saw it on TV and I've never seen it again so I don't know what the title was. Then there's John Kennedy, Jr. Another murder. That's my opinion. And Pierre Salinger was harassed and made to look like a "conspiracy theorist". Yes, the mainstream news was corrupt even back then.

              Great write up.  I too am waiting for what is coming.  The one thing I have had problems getting out of my mind is Debbie and Imran in the Sack.   Someone mentioned the other day "Ringlets bounding up and down".  I cannot get rid of it.  Help!

               Now you've got me thinking about it!

              <p>
               Ew! That's all I can say. But please read my reply re: blackmail. These scumsuckers need to get blackmail on their own party members. It's the only way they can control them. Not everyone is a pizza eater or spirit cooker. They'd like us to believe that to help normalize the bizarre crimes they're involved with, but they're not! So how to get blackmail? This way -- through Imran!!!!

                I just hope they really get real on this arrest.  I know there is no way we will find out all the particulars, but GEE WHIZ, I hope some of the truth is told.  I want names to be released.  Yeah.

                 My fondest wish is that someone got sloppy and that they can identify who put the hit on Seth Rich. You know someone did. And arrogant people are sloppy because they never learn.

                  Well, we know they were sloppy with Seth Rich, and JP having such a stupid password, there is hope for more sloppiness.  Where Dumbo Debbie is concerned we have hope!

                    Not really knowing who is really compromised is what makes this all so up in the air.  WE are always left out of the loop and hoping that we will get one crumb, and ending up disappointed.  I hope to God this time is different :)

               Yes, let our representatives know what we think. Also the POTUS and Sessions. Keep the pressure on and let everyone know that We the People want a working judicial system. We also want the scumbags out of government.
