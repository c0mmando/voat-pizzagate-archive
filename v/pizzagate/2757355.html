<li><strong>Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole:</strong> &quot;No one wants to believe the cult story.  The TV people cut it out.  The writers don\'t write about it.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>-Henry Lee Lucas</p>
<p>Henry Lee Lucas and Ottis Toole were serial murder partners whose crimes spanned 3 decades, from 1960 - 1983.  Lucas was eventually convicted of the murder of 11 people while Toole was convicted of murdering 6, although they claimed to have murdered many more, their tally of murders running as high as 300-600 by some (including their own) accounts, though such a number may have been braggadocio on their part, not to mention an attempt by police to clear the books of troublesome, unsolved murders.</p>
<p>Both Lucas and Toole had horrifically abusive childhoods.  Toole\'s upbringing had all the hallmarks of Satanic Ritual Abuse.  He was, as author Joel Norris put it, &quot;raised as the Devil\'s child by his Satanist grandmother&quot;, who lived with Toole\'s father as husband and wife, though they were actually mother and son.  He was raped by his father, stepfather, his stepfather\'s friends and his older sister.  He had urine poured on him and was forced to eat dog meat.  He received his requisite \'blooding\', or desensitisation to violence through being made to watch cats fight to the death while their blood dripped down on him.  His grandmother would take him grave-robbing to steal bones for use in Satanic rituals.  And he was frequently dosed with barbiturates.</p>
<p>Lucas\'s childhood was no less horrendous.  He received frequent severe beatings from his prostitute mother.  One one occasion, he slipped into a coma for a day after a particularly brutal beating.  Through a combination of abuse and neglect, Lucas lost one of his eyes.  His mother frequently entertained her clients in young Henry\'s presence, which he was compelled to watch.  She also dressed him as a girl for the first 7 years of his life and pimped him out to her clients (Toole also spoke of being dressed up as a girl).  It seems Lucas\'s mother was deadly serious when she told her son, &quot;I\'m going to teach you the beauty of pain and you\'re going to be my slave for the rest of your life.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucas told a sympathetic author, Max Call, who recounted his story in <em>The Hand of Death: The Henry Lee Lucas Story</em> that he was inducted into a nationwide Satanic cult known as the Hand of Death.  He claimed he was trained in the ways of murder, arson and abduction by the cult in a mobile paramilitary training camp in the Florida Everglades.  They were apparently so impressed with Lucas\'s skill with a knife that he was allowed to serve as an instructor.  Following his training, Henry claimed that he served the cult in various ways, including as a contract killer and as an abductor of children, whom he delivered to a ranch in Mexico near Juarez. Once there, they were used in the production of child pornography and for ritual sacrifices.  He said that the Hand of Death\'s operations were based in Texas and included trafficking in children and drugs, as well as other illegal pursuits (contract murder as well, presumably) and that the cult counted among its members socially prominent individuals, including high level politicians.</p>
<p>Such connections may explain why mass murderer Lucas had his death sentence commuted in 1998 by the normally execution happy then Governor of Texas, George W. Bush.  Indeed, Lucas was the only person spared by Bush.  It may also explain why his partner Ottis Toole, had his death sentence in the state of Florida commuted to life by then Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush.  Were the Bushes members of the cult, or associated with members?  Certainly, it wasn\'t the first time Lucas had received unwarranted leniency from the criminal justice system.  In 1970, he was released from prison after serving 10 years of a 20-40 year sentence for the murder of his mother, despite telling the parole board in no uncertain terms that he would kill again if freed.  Within a year of being released, he was back in jail for the attempted abduction of a young girl.  This time, despite his criminal record, he served only 4 years before being released.</p>
<p>In 1989, a ranch in Matamoros in Mexico, which is just south of Brownsville, Texas was excavated and the bodies of 15 victims of ritual sacrifice found.  The Matamoros case so closely paralleled the stories told years before by Lucas that authorities decided to take a closer look at Lucas\'s professed cult connections.  In fact, Williamson County Sheriff, Jim Boutwell told a reporter that investigators had verified that Luca was indeed involved in cult activities.  In the wake of the Matamoros case, Ottis Toole said that, while Matamoros was not the specific ranch which he and Lucas were associated with, it was but one of many interconnected operations along the Texas-Mexico border.  A decade later, in 1999, another excavation was begun at a ranch in Juarez located precisely where Lucas had said the Hand of Death ranch was.  Early reports indicated that authorities anticipated finding between 100-300 bodies buried in mass graves, including 22 missing U.S. citizens and a number of former FBI and DEA informants.  The final body count is unknown, however, as U.S. authorities took control of the case and hushed the matter up, and the compliant legacy media ceased coverage almost immediately thereafter.</p>
<p>&quot;They think I\'m stupid, but before all this is over everyone will know who\'s really stupid.  And we\'ll see who the real criminals are.&quot;

            This is horrifying to think about. We have seen judicial leniency for violence against children over and over and over again. The courts are absolutely in on it. Someone is in charge of recruiting and grooming pedophiles for positions of power. How do we effect change on this?

            I would not be surprised if it was his own dog and they made him kill they dog himself.  this is what they do, how they start and escalate from bad to very bad and then to worse.  I know of a Victim/Survivor who on her 1st visit to her place of SRA was told to bring her pet cat. She was 9 yrs. old and they skinned the cat alive right in front of her.  This is horrid stuff and things that some people won't believe.  This is how they are allowed to continue, since it is so heinous many just don't want to believe the truth.

            I am very troubled after reading such graphic and brutal details😨  I know it is up to each of us not to look away if we hope to end these monstrous criminal acts, but a trigger warning would be helpful.

             I can certainly appreciate how a heads up/warning type of notice might be appreciated by many, yet the cold blooded horror of these types of activities needs to be disseminated as widely and forcefully as possible if effective action is to take place to stop this shit.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have personally heard - first hand - of several dozens of men who either committed many of these kinds of abominations, experienced it themselves as youths, or - frequently - both.
            </p>
            <p>
             I mention this in an ongoing attempt to validate the truthfulness, the all too crushing reality that so many of these extremely bizarre, horrific events can and DO occur.
            </p>
            <p>
             Stories like Fiona Barret's,  Cathy O'Brien's,  Brice Taylor's and so many others should not be dismissed simply because we do NOT want to believe them to be true.
            </p>
            <p>
             A 10 minute viewing of the  Paul Bonacci video being interviewed by Gary Cardori puts an in-your-face perspective of what we are fighting against on this site.
            </p>
            <p>
             Definitely not for the squeamish, but I'm certain the abused 5 and 8 year olds felt the same way.

              I agree it is important for people to learn the scope and depth of what this horrific abuse looks like, and I said as much.  You seem to ignore my polite, perhaps too subtle suggestion that a heads-up trigger warning would be appreciated.  Do you not understand that this material could re-injure someone who has PTSD from abuse?
