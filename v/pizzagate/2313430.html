Trump Proclaims January 2018 as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month</a></p>
<p>During National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, we recommit ourselves to eradicating the evil of enslavement.  Human trafficking is a modern form of the oldest and most barbaric type of exploitation.  It has no place in our world.  This month we do not simply reflect on this appalling reality.  We also pledge to do all in our power to end the horrific practice of human trafficking that plagues innocent victims around the world.</p>
<p>Human trafficking is a sickening crime at odds with our very humanity.  An estimated 25 million people are currently victims of human trafficking for both sex and labor.  Human traffickers prey on their victims by promising a life of hope and greater opportunity, while delivering only enslavement.  Instead of delivering people to better lives, traffickers unjustifiably profit from the labor and toil of their victims, who they force — through violence and intimidation — to work in brothels and factories, on farms and fishing vessels, in private homes, and in countless industries.</p>
<p>My Administration continues to work to drive out the darkness human traffickers cast upon our world.  In February, I signed an Executive Order to dismantle transnational criminal organizations, including those that perpetuate the crime of human trafficking.  My Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons has enhanced collaboration with other nations, businesses, civil society organizations, and survivors of human trafficking.  The Department of Health and Human Services has established a new national training and technical assistance center to strengthen our healthcare industry’s anti-trafficking response.  The Department of State has contributed $25 million to the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery, because of the critical need for cross-nation collaborative action to counter human trafficking.  The Department of Labor has released an innovative, business-focused mobile app that supports private-sector efforts to eradicate forced labor from global supply chains.  And this month, I will sign into law S. 1536, the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act and S. 1532, the No Human Trafficking on Our Roads Act.  These bills will keep those who commit trafficking offenses from operating commercial vehicles, improve anti-human trafficking coordination within Federal agencies and across State and local governments, and improve efforts to recognize, prevent, and report human trafficking.</p>
<p>In addition to these governmental actions, Americans must learn how to identify and combat the evil of enslavement.  This is especially important for those who are most likely to encounter the perpetrators of slavery and their victims, including healthcare providers, educators, law enforcement officials, and social services professionals.  Through the Department of Homeland Security’s Blue Campaign, all Americans can learn to recognize the signs of human trafficking and how to report suspected instances.  By taking steps to become familiar with the telltale signs of traffickers or the signals of their victims, Americans can save innocent lives.</p>
<p>Our Nation is and will forever be a place that values and protects human life and dignity.  This month, let us redouble our efforts to ensure that modern day slavery comes to its long overdue end.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 2018 as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, culminating in the annual celebration of National Freedom Day on February 1, 2018.  I call upon industry associations, law enforcement, private businesses, faith-based and other organizations of civil society, schools, families, and all Americans to recognize our vital roles in ending all forms of modern slavery and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities aimed at ending and preventing all forms of human trafficking.</p>
<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.</p>
<p>DONALD J. TRUMP</p>

            I hate to be a downer but this has been going on every January since 2010........if something really major does not happen this month I am about ready to throw in the towel on anything ever happening, they have got to open some of these indictments soon, they opened Manaforts why not others! If just one major arrest would happen it would go a long way in lifting my hopes others are not far behind.

             Seeings as late he mentioned this shit, yeah this is pretty fucking gay.

             When it was at the height of its breaking point he has stayed quite until people started to see he's entirely full of shit so he pulls out this handy little trick to pull people back to believe he's not in bed with the establishment. Politics is the game.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's why the politics recently came before the "my prayers are with the victims of the train derailment"

             Edit: You can downvote me but you know his charm has worn off and if he was serious about stopping any sort of trafficking he would have done it outright if it was important to him, not create a shitty breast history month for it.

             They have only arrested low hanging fruit, or fruit that's been on the ground rotten for ages now. There's no fucking trail they follow to find the tops of these rings. They just cut off the weakest links at the bottom. But it still continues, maybe even better now that the weakest links are gone anyway.

            BRING IT THE FUCK ON. Very sick of this all staying in the shadows; a forthright declaration of war on these sick individuals is appropriate and called for (although this would have been appropriate// [hopefully] preventative had this been decreed decades ago).

            Yeah, let’s have a month and maybe a pretty colored ribbon and a hashtag and turn it into a marketing tool 🙄.   If this is what Americans need to care about child trafficking, fuck it.  Just fuck this whole entire country.

             No one is going to do that, at least not us here on vote.  We are not for turning this into a Carnival Event.  It is being done to draw attention to the horrors of human trafficking.  It is that simple.

              I know that carmencita.  I’ve been on and off Voat because as a victim of CSA myself, it gets too hard sometimes to deal with the complicit.  Plus some of the shills running this place.  But I recognize your user name, and I believe you to be a real person on here who truly cares.  I’m just discouraged right now.  I can’t even get my own family and friends to care right now, and I don’t have a lot of hope that the masses are gonna stop posting cat videos and being hypnotized by the complete garbage they program us with.

              We could do this if people woke up, but like Nietzsche said, “Sometimes people don’t want to hear the truth because they don’t want their illusions destroyed.”

               You are correct, but nietzsche isn’t the last word. Something bigger than is here. It will seem to be happening too slowly at first, but it’s happening. That’s new. Hang in there.

               And Big Hugs Back At You.  I get that feeling once in a while too, but I will not let these evil vile vermin perverts win.  No way.  Granted you have had a lot more in your life to discourage you than I have.  I have not  experienced the horrors that you have, but I am doing this for a very special reason too, other than I just love my fellow man and women but most of all our innocent beautiful children.  The more I stay away from the cat video people the better.  Believe me I know what you mean.  But today I had a beautiful surprise.  While out to lunch with some people, we discussed the new Alexa products by Amazon (very invading of your privacy) and they all were on the Right Page!  I was amazed that they all knew that they were able to see into your homes and that they all taped over the eye on all their electronic products.  Believe me this is a Shock.  Most people are not on to this.  They are oblivious.  I have now had a new outlook and that there is some hope.  There is always a little glimmer of hope somewhere.  Do not get discouraged, We will win this fight.  Happy New Year and Peace :)

                Surprisingly, as much as my mom has dismissed and disregarded me over the last year, she did send me the new Taco Bell commercial with obvious Illuminati/Eyes Wide Shut programming.  Maybe she is starting to get it that the TV is subliminally programming people into satanism.  It did give me a bit of hope tonight.  Thank you for all your kind words.  I wish to be strong and fear no evil, and I’m ready for these sick fucks when the time comes.

                 I have heard of this commercial but have not seen it.  Now I am going to look it up and find it.  I know what you are talking about.  There is a lot of slipping in of Evil into our tv and movies.  Unfortunately adults seem as oblivious to this as children.  But if you read the comments on articles and to the twitter feeds, you will see that many are waking to this as well.  When we had the Elsa Gate video news on here, I was shocked to see news of this on my local news!  So little by little it is waking people if they will only listen.  I too, like you, am afraid that by the time they really get it, it will be too late.  That is why I am not giving up.  That is why many of us on here are still going strong.  Some come and go and that is OK, but there are Die Hards that will never stop.  Remember that it is hard for your Mother to admit that the world that she knew is not the way it really was.  Some of us are strong enough to see it and some are not.  (Deep Sigh).  You evidently are much stronger than you think, so that is something you should celebrate.  It is a New Year and a I am Hopeful for New Awakenings.  Happy New Year.

                  For the Taco Bell thing, I found 2 official commercials, but I also follow this channel if you want to check him out:  He’s called “A Call for an Uprising 2.”

                  Honestly, I will warn you that he does have a touch of that Alex Jones thing where his anger kind of oozes out and starts effecting how listeners feel.  I do believe this guy’s anger is justified, and I think he’s right, but I do avoid him sometimes now because I believe what he is saying is true, which again leads me to being angry and sad.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But I will say my serenity prayer and try to accept the things I cannot change, have the courage to change the things I can, and try to have the wisdom to know the difference.

                 <p>
                  More hugs to you girl.  Happy New Year.   Sending lots of peace and prayer and serenity to you.  💜

               Sorry to hear that Rebekah. We care here .. and have read and seen things that given us nightmares so we can only buy try and understand if you ever want to share. Carmencita has a very big heart I'm sure she is there to listen too. Sending you love for being so brave being here and so strong. Ignore the shills .. it means we are winning. Meditate. You can feel the energy .. it's coming.

               Your Nietzsche quote is the sad realization that confronts my daily observations.  Programming on other levels is so intense to the point that observably folks are    addicts walking around - addicted to various shit that passes for shinola.
              </p>
              <p>
               Many of us  folks are dealing with the financial slavery system, and not well I might add.  It makes me wonder if the human trafficking slavery is throwing   the dog a bone to shut it up while that dog keeps its head down in many other forms of financial-life slavery.
              </p>
              <p>
               Even those who claim to be enlightening folks are presenting videos or articles that  keep the world programmed in the name of  awakening them with information.
               <br/>
               But it all boils down to your Nietzche line;  people don't want their  game destroyed.  They throw the dog a bone, or a cat video.

             The DoJ IG's report is expected to come out on January 15.  I expect it to be the public battle-cry for much of the behind-the-scenes work that has been going on for the past year (like Sessions' two secret investigations into Clinton and the politicized FBI that he casually mentioned in December had been going on for 11 months {AKA "about as soon as he took office"}).
            </p>
            <p>
             Heck, when FBIAnon and QAnon talked about the charges against the Pizzagate/Pedogate criminals, they always said that human trafficking would be the main crime they got charged with, simply because it is so much easier to prove than pedophilia or rape and carries a similar tough sentence.

                Ok whatever.  What does the age of my account have to do with my statement?  I'm just pointing out the fact that Obama released a very similar EO at this exact time last year, so this might not be the great reckoning that everyone might be hoping for.

             Obama was good at declaring but never enforced or put money into his proclamations.  A Paper Tiger.  I voted for him twice and he was one of the worst presidents ever.  You joined 1.4 hrs. ago just to tell us that?  Save your breath.  We know all about what Obama did and did not do.

            Whenever the topic of Trump and human trafficking arises, his naysayers are quick to mention his "support" of Eastern European models, and that angle of trafficking. That's a hindrance to red pilling the masses.

             If the people themselves are adults (or are being chaperoned by a legal guardian, or are traveling between closely-related adult family members), consent to the travel, aren't abused during the travel, and make their way here legally, then I don't see much wrong with them basically just, at the absolute worst, "choosing your preferred way to get to the same destination".  If any of those guidelines are broken, then the odds are that there has been a law broken somewhere along the line, and someone needs to face judgement for their actions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like with a lot of our other laws dealing with interactions between big groups of people, the central issue is "consent".

                 Research human anatomy and the differences between men and women, eye brow ridges, shoulder to hip ratios, skull shapes.  It’s honestly not hard to tell.  Then go check out Barbara Bush and pretend she doesn’t have makeup or jewelry on.  Then pretend the same for Queen Elizabeth.  Then look back at pictures of all the “First Ladies” and even current wives of politicians.  This country is run by satanic sickos who love to invert things, including gender.  If Pizzagaters can’t grasp the possibility and don’t care to do their research, that’s pretty disappointing.

                   If Trump is also a satanic sicko who likes to invert things, then his “awareness month” doesn’t mean shit.  He ran the most materialistic disgusting “pageant” show I can think of, the Miss USA and Miss TEEN USA pageants.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   PizzaGate ends by chopping off the entire top of that satanic Illuminati pyramid.  Jesus is our savior.  Until then, we have to stop being deceived by these lying puppet pieces of shit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Yes, I did believe in Trump, I voted for him, but this entire system is fucked up, and I think people are crazy not to realize he’s involved.

                  <p>
                   If you’re high government or military, you don’t announce you’re gonna prosecute pedophiles in a few weeks for a month.  You fix that shit immediately.  And once you find a pedophile, you check his black book and the money trail too, but that never happens.

                    You make a good point.  I did not vote for him but am hoping and willing to give him a chance.  But the rope is short.

                     Hi again Carmencita.   I just wanted to share these 2 videos with you if you were interested in some ideas about the “First Lady” tranny topic..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I don’t agree with everything these people say, but I do see a lot of truth:

                     With programs like “I Am Cait” with Bruce/Catelyn Jenner and YouTube channels of admitted transgenders and how they deceive people, I think they are giving away all their secrets, and it’s making the famous ones super obvious now..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Personally, I do know trans people at my work who are great, and my best friend is a gay guy, but my BFF was raped as a child, and I don’t believe Lady Gaga when she says people were “Born This Way.”   I believe these types of things are caused by trauma, especially sexual trauma in childhood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I don’t mean to offend anyone when exposing the trannies, but I do think we are being brainwashed by a deception, and it should be exposed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     “Michelle” Obama was supposed to be a role model for children, but girls CAN NOT obtain the same physique as “Michelle,” because men and women are different.  Which means they are putting unrealistic expectations on children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     How many of our young women are bulemic and anorexic because they are trying to attain a body that is
                     <em>
                      impossble
                     </em>
                     for them to obtain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Men have large shoulders and smaller hips.  Women are an hourglass.  But look at the “high fashion” models and all the trannies they program women with to effect what they believe is beautiful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     They program women with men in drag who have no hips, then call women who have hips fat.  I am even extremely skinny women are angry and disappointed in themselves and starving themselves because they are trying to obtain a physical look that they are
                     <em>
                      physically incapable
                     </em>

                      I admit that there are some very strange things going on with the "teaching" of our children regarding the sexes.  They are "creating"  people in hollywood that are not natural and children that are not theirs, etc.  It goes on and on.  It really scares the He77 out of me, to be sure.  I agree with your assessment.

                      Great video.   “A Black Child Production” does an awesome job exposing the deceptions.  So glad I found that channel.  Thanks for sharing.

                       Yes and "Mr. E" does a good job of sifting out the trannies, except it seems that there are far more than we could ever imagine!  His latest one on Attorney Generals is revealing and good for a laugh, except I'm seeing it's true!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I agree that his presidency has been planned for decades.  Every other president from time immemorial has been a plant, why not Trump?  I just don't think people realize how deep all of this deception goes and it's been going for centuries.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       One of the hardest things to do in life is to admit you might be wrong.  Just saying that for those who want to have faith in someone and finally realize it's not Trump.  I've been duped for years and years and years to believe what I see is truth, but I'm finding out most of it isn't.  It pisses me off to no end.  Who then, can one place their hopes in when they find out the truth of Trump?  Its too frightening to go there for most.
I think Trump was put in to create a huge division, which it did, around the world.  Create more hatred and mistrust so "their" agenda can move forward just like they want.  If it wasn't so despicable, deceptive and evil, I might say the plan has been brilliant.

                        I don’t fully agree with this channel, but she found some pretty old pics/paintings of “First Ladies,” and I think it’s worth taking a look at for anyone interested:

                        Oh, and for sure Janet Reno is a trans, lol.  I always knew something looked wrong about “her.”   We have been deceived on such an enormous level.  It’s crazy.

                        There’s a channel called Conspiracies by Hans, and he exposes trannies as well as a lot of other deceptions I can now recognize.   Unfortunately, I don’t think we can put anyone on a pedestal, as any and all of them could turn on us on a dime, like has happened to so many truthers.  It’s like they were either a shill from the beginning trying to gain our trust, or bought off at some point, or honestly I think many could be killed and replaced by doubles or recreated using technology like Snapchat, just adding the person’s face onto anyone.  It’s scary to me that some people I’ve seen on TV might never have even been real in the first place.

                        But luckily God gave me a critical thinking brain, and I question everything, and I do my best with the knowledge I have at the time.

                        It’s not just the victims of PizzaGate that makes me sad.  It’s all the truthers who have lost their lives or their freedoms trying to expose the satanic system most people don’t even realize we are living in..

                  His initials are SB, so it's a good bet he's ShareBlue which means his name will leak with all the other shills eventually.
