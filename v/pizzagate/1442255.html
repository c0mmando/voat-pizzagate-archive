            Flyers and posters are a great idea but you need to bear in mind that it's not always legal. Fly-posting can certainly be a tricky area, so my best advice here would be to go into pubs, cafes and the likes, dumping a load of small leaflets on tables without even bothering to ask if it's okay. The problem here is that it'll take a lot of prints - 4 per sheet of A4 means 400 leaflets would cost at least Â£5 here, probably more, and a lot of those are going to be binned before people get to read them. Thus, they need to be handed out if anything. As for posters, my advice there would be to tape leaflets to cash machines, that way people are at least forced to look at them. Just be careful because it could technically be littering and cash machines routinely have dedicated CCTV. Another idea is to tape them to bus and train windows or the back of seats. I was doing some of this stuff in 2003 just before the Iraq War, it can be really effective.

            So far as a march is concerned there are three options and each will depend on local policing: either the police agree in advance for one to occur, they don't agree but it goes ahead anyway, or they are not informed at all. In England they have the power to disperse and in this case I don't reckon they'd allow such a march and would therefore exercise that power if one went ahead.
           </p>
           <p>
            I may well draft a 4x4 poster for A4 and put it on my website. I might also speak to the police about the possibility of organising a demonstration.

            True, Christmas Day would be a logical disaster. It couldn't possibly happen in four weeks, it'd take at least 6 months to organise for that day. Strikes might get a point across. Walk out of work, walk out of school... when people ask you why you're doing it, just say "Pizzagate".

             Ideally we'd be looking at our governments reigning in those responsible, and appropriately dealing with them. But that's just it, they're either deeply involved in it or are too cowardly to confront it. Fact of the matter is, our existence is on the line here.
