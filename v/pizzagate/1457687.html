            Maybe Adrenochrome is Walnut Sauce.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seriously, though, look at this from a commodity perspective. Human trafficking has turned humans into a commodity, just like cattle. Each buyer wants a specific piece of the cow. Some want the cow to plow their fields (child labour), some want the cow to get their rocks off (sexual abuse)  Some want to fatten the cow and take it to shows (pornography) some want to butcher the cow (ritual abuse) eat the cow (cannibalism) some only want hormones from the cow (adrenochrome).
           </p>
           <p>
            I get your point - this could be about adrenochrome, but that's not all this is about. My point is that we need to look at the big picture and see this in terms of a supply chain with multiple buyers and sellers, each with a different type of interest in human trafficking.

            well if you drained someones blood while you where causing them tremendous terror I'm guessing that blood would be chock full of Adrenalin,,, I get where you are coming from though. Pondered it myself. Could you extract Adrenalin from blood or would consuming the blood itself have desired effect. Honestly hadn't over thought it yet but if the dark web price for adrenochrome is mega I just might lol

            From the Wikipedia page: Author Hunter S. Thompson mentions adrenochrome in his book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The adrenochrome scene also appears in the novel's film adaptation. In the DVD commentary, director Terry Gilliam admits that his and Thompson's portrayal is a fictional exaggeration. In fact, Gilliam insists that the drug is entirely fictional and seems unaware of the existence of a substance with even a similar name.

            People don't get high off of adrenochrome like in Leaving las Vegas.  It has little or no affect on humans.
           </p>
           <p>
            Conspiro thoery which has been around for decades is that the ALIENS are the ones who use this for a drug.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other disturbing fact is that CHILDRENS blood is known to be far superior to adult blood for transfusions (people actually feel younger).

            I think it's:
           </p>
           <p>
            Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Illusion of Power - lowest level
           </p>
           <p>
            Pedo Blackmail, Money &amp; Power - middle tier
           </p>
           <p>
            Adrenachrome, Power &amp; Crowley Magic - at the top
           </p>
           <p>
            imho
           </p>
           <p>
            but that's why pizzagate needs a charlie sheen or mcauly culkin to be our snitch,, even some of the mid level abusers are really victims deep down.... we need to start forgiving the people who have pedo blackmail on them or we'll never get to the [?royal?] families at the heart of this..

             I can't pin exactly why, but this makes a lot of sense to me.  It's almost like a multi level marketing scheme.  Money and power are the enticement, and psychopaths that can handle advancement move up.  But at any level, you can't get out because of failsafes ranging from humiliation and defamation to death of loved ones or self.

              this whole global elite pedo thing is deffo a pyramid style ponzi scheme. The creatures at the top are most likely going to be the 'families' that hold loooong term power. I think Sheen would be the perfect snitch, 10 to 1 he was fiddled as a kid and saw some shit,,, 10 to 1 he's the guy Corey was on about. That guy could turncoat for us. It's the right profile,, i think the pizzagate crowd would forgive someone who was institutionalized from an early age, plus I bet he was at some of the hardcore events with people who rule nations....

            You can't go wrong wherever you look, one will always lead to the other.....The ones on a massive scale have to hide the money somewhere, they have to make it clean money......Where is that going?

            I highly doubt this ends with just sex trafficking. Bill Clinton has long been suspected of being involved in the Iran Contra affair by allowing drugs to be smuggled out of Mena Arkansas when he was governor.

           <p>
            Illegal activity like this is how the government funds it's secret black projects. I think what we are seeing is that the funding source for Americas covert operations has grown so huge it has completely overtaken the entire government.
