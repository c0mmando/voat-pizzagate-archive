putting together something Bernie Sanders said in a CBNC interview
published this morning:</p>

<p>Then this reference to Bernie using the word <strong>hustle</strong>. 
 Now it may be that they didn\'t appreciate Hillary being associated with \'hustiling\', but why the reference to Snoop?  I could not find news of Snoop endorsing Hlillary until May, 2015.  This email was in March. Maybe, they just knew ahead of time Snoop would endorse her?</p>

<p>I realize it  seems a stretch until you <strong>search WikiLeaks for Snoop Dogg and find him in the Global Intelligence files</strong>.  Why?  Here are some examples</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rapper Snoop Dogg has been arrested by Swedish police after a concert in
Stockholm.The musician was released after questioning and drug tests by officers who
suspected him of using illegal narcotics. Police said he was going to a party after the concert when the car he was
riding in was stopped at around 1.30am.Spokesman Matts Brannlund said Snoop Dogg and a female companion showed
signs of drug use and were taken to a police station.&quot;He was deemed to be under the influence of narcotics,&quot; Mr Brannlund said.
A small amount of narcotics was also found in the car but police could not specify which kind of drug or whether it belonged to Snoop Dogg. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/62/6253_snoop-dogg-arrested-in-stockholm-on-drug-charges-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/62/6253_snoop-dogg-arrested-in-stockholm-on-drug-charges-.html</a></p>
<p>Nate Dogg Dead at 41. Nathaniel D. Hale, a hip-hop artist known by the stage name Nate Dogg,
died on Tuesday, his family said. The cause of death was not yet known, but Hale, 41, had suffered strokes
in 2007 and 2008, according to the Long Beach Press-Telegram. Hale, who most notably sang the hook on Warren G.\'s &quot;Regulate&quot; and Snoop Dogg\'s &quot;Ain\'t No Fun (If the Homies Can\'t Have None),&quot; was part of an extended family of rappers known as the Dogg Pound Gangsta Crips (DPGC), a group that also includes Snoop Dogg and Daz Dillinger a** both of whom
responded to news of Hale\'s death with tribute messages on Twitter. <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/16/1660846_re-it-ain-t-no-fuuuuuuun-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/16/1660846_re-it-ain-t-no-fuuuuuuun-.html</a></p>
<p>The only mud that momentarily stuck was criticism (white and black alike)
concerning Obama\'s alleged &quot;inauthenticty,&quot; as compared to such sterling
examples of &quot;genuine&quot; blackness as Al Sharpton and Snoop Dogg. Speaking as

<blockquote>
<p>On Monday February 27th, 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing The Global Intelligence Files, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered &quot;global intelligence&quot; company Stratfor. The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal\'s Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor\'s web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</p>

               I never denied my age. I told your Equineluvr persona. How am I vain? It's humorous to know how you come up with these opinions. Was there a study done on women who aren't pushed around by an online faggot?
