              I agree that the CIA is tied to pizzagate deeply, but unless Wikileaks are revealing pedos with Vault 7, that release has nothing to do with pizzagate itself. The CIA is evil and should be splintered etc, but - not every single thing the CIA does or is exposed doing is pizzagate.
             </p>
             <p>
              Analogy:
             </p>
             <p>
              Hillary is central to pizzagate, but spamming threads about her emails here is the definition of the current slide threads.
             </p>
             <p>
              Until or unless something remotely related to the actual subject of child abuse or spirit cooking etc comes up.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are different subs for CIA malware and Hillary's RICO type violations. If there is the slightest connection in Hillary's emails or V7 tied to child abuse then by all means have at it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm not the only one that feels like this, either. Quote from another user earlier:
             </p>

                The time waster slide threads have gotten terrible. Every day its a page full of Hillary's fucking email posts. This may as well be fucking CNN now.

               Yea ture, not related to Pizzagate. I think that when 'splintered' was mentioned, the more optimistic among us thought they had something so damning, so terrible, that action would have to be taken. Thought the only thing that fits is pedosexual blackmail. Assassinations mightn't be enough. Anyway, agreed, fairly irrelevant.

            If Snowden and Zuckerberg are related...then the ENTIRE assange/wiki thing is a BS

             @cia
            </a>
            op.  I originally calculated vault 7 to be a section of the airgapped computer system in CO (as alluded to by FBIAnon)..but now think that is BS.  If they had the videos and transcripts we are all looking for, and they were about REALLY doing the right thing and not stringing us along..they would have released them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Listen..we live in an evil world and evil wins..regardless of the Disney movies you have watched.  ANYTHING from this world that is designed to scare you, make you uncomfortable emotionally, or panic you..is EVIL.  MSM=Evil  DC=evil demVSrep=evil and so would stringing you along with data dumps.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look inside for answers...we can change this world, but we have to from the inside out...and that ain't no Disney movie...

             That is the first I have heard that Snowden and Zuckerberg are related.  Where did that come from?  I am open to believing just about anything now.  I went to see the Snowden movie just out of curiosity.  But afterwards it just left me with the same feeling as before.  No answer or proof that it was all real.  It still left me up in the air.  I guess I believe he is baloney too, but part of me just wants it to be real because just about everything is fake now.  I feel like I am living in their movie.

              Agree!  Zuckerburg and Snowden but have different names..they are cousins..alledgedly..I'm like you..who knows anymore.  Trust my gut though and it would not surprise me if all these folks were related...

               Ugh money or no money there is no way I would want to be in that family.  I am not in the soup line, but as most of us, one catastrophic event and I just might be .  Still want to stay right where I am at.  I have to admit though I am way to old for Snowden he is a hot bundle.

            They keep releasing stuff, its just all not that interesting. Pretty much just showing programs of how the government spies on you, really no surprises. The first dump was the most shocking, showing how they could take control of airplanes or smart cars, and that they could hack pretty much any video device in your house.

            I'm convinced that Wikileaks is a CIA limited hangout.
           </p>
           <p>
            That's why Julian Assange says that 9/11 is a "fake conspiracy theory," and why he says that the most provocative email in HRC's emails is the one saying that Saudi Arabia finances terrorism - something everybody already knows or suspects.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, it is pretty clear that Julian Assange was a victim of MK-ULTRA mind control, as he grew up within the "family" cult, taking LSD.

            A good video series on this is:

             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2WSI_M15-k
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I've found Richard Hall to be one of the most reliable voices in the alternative media.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Wikileaks is a limited hangout (it is), then:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             it's consistent with FBIanon saying that none of the intelligence services wanting HRC to win the election (was she selling out the USA to Israel through the Clinton Foundation/Awan scandal, and then the CIA/NSA found out?)
            </li>
            <li>
             it makes you wonder which Podesta emails they didn't release. I doubt that we got everything. I bet they cherry picked, right around the time that Madeleine McCann went missing.
            </li>
            <li>
             it's amazing that Assange is as intelligent and articulate as he is, for a mind control victim. He's been dropping lots of truth bombs on the new regressive left and identity politics on Twitter.

             The USA and Israel and the European Union sponsor terrorism. Controled opposition always try to deflet to the Saudis. The MSM blames the Muslims. It is the cabal as always. Assange is limited hangout. CIA/ Mossad did 9/11 and our entire government is complicit to trason, as is the MSM and our judicial system. Assange slit his own throat as far as credibility goes by making such comments about 9/11.

              What about t the release of the Huma emails that said that there was a deal made between Mook and Sanders?  Wikileaks (Assange) intimated there was something nefarious in that deal.  I don't believe it because there are too many reasons that they want to take Sanders down.  They are afraid of his running again (which I believe he will) and want him out of the way so they will do whatever they can to dirty him to his supporters on both sides.  CIA does not care who wins next time around because both candidates will be controlled.  If Trump is not with them already, he will be by then or they will dirty him really bad.  Do I think they would assassinate him?  I hope to God not, but I put nothing past them, although it would be a bad idea because there are too many people that don't trust them and are on to them.   I shudder to think of the violence that will come from that.   This is another time than 1963.

             This is refreshing to read as I also believe and have stated here numerous times that WL and JA are cointelpro.  I wish people would stop clinging on to false hope and allowing confirmation bias to cloud their judgement as this gets us exactly nowhere.  If you just look at the evidence as stated above including other FACTS such as the involvement of Cass Sunstein in the early days of WL and the legal counsel of Alan Dershowitz, it's irrational to believe that WL &amp; JA could be anything more than a high profile limited hangout.  On top of this they have received so much airtime and public promotion that it beggers belief how they haven't yet been called out.

            Homepage... 4 programs were unveiled in August alone. No media coverage. Nothing outside of posts on Reddit/Wikileaks:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Today, August 31st 2017, WikiLeaks publishes documents from the Angelfire project of the CIA. Angelfire is an implant comprised of five components: Solartime, Wolfcreek, Keystone (previously MagicWand), BadMFS, and the Windows Transitory File system. Like previously published CIA projects (Grasshopper and AfterMidnight) in the Vault7 series, it is a persistent framework that can load and execute custom implants on target computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system (XP or Win7).
            </p>
            <p>
             Solartime modifies the partition boot sector so that when Windows loads boot time device drivers, it also loads and executes the Wolfcreek implant, that once executed, can load and run other Angelfire implants. According to the documents, the loading of additional implants creates memory leaks that can be possibly detected on infected machines.
            </p>
            <p>
             Keystone is part of the Wolfcreek implant and responsible for starting malicious user applications. Loaded implants never touch the file system, so there is very little forensic evidence that the process was ever ran. It always disguises as "C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe" and can thus be detected in the Windows task manager, if the operating system is installed on another partition or in a different path.
            </p>
            <p>
             BadMFS is a library that implements a covert file system that is created at the end of the active partition (or in a file on disk in later versions). It is used to store all drivers and implants that Wolfcreek will start. All files are both encrypted and obfuscated to avoid string or PE header scanning. Some versions of BadMFS can be detected because the reference to the covert file system is stored in a file named "zf".
            </p>
            <p>
             The Windows Transitory File system is the new method of installing AngelFire. Rather than lay independent components on disk, the system allows an operator to create transitory files for specific actions including installation, adding files to AngelFire, removing files from AngelFire, etc. Transitory files are added to the 'UserInstallApp'.
            </p>
           </blockquote>

            Holy shit.

            Yes, and everybody is just ignoring everything they released.  Piling on all kinds of Apps and I see people taking pics in stores with their phones.  I keep mine shut off in the stores, no monitoring of me, no way.  Makes me wonder who is really running Wikileaks.

             It's amazing how nothing sticks. I think that could have been a barometer test to see how much they can get away with. They told the world that every device we have is designed to spy on us and is spying on us and the majority of people just drooled and went "eh". The Project Veritas videos alone should have sunk the msm by now, but nope. I actually am surprised how resilient the msm has been so far and how many people they are still fooling. As for WikiLeaks it probably is controlled opp at the end of the day, which is just another head fuck.

              I agree with everything.  Although it is not funny, I had to laugh at your "eh".  I can imagine people I know yes, doing just that.  I am so sick of all of them.  They are so stupid.  Every once in a while I get fooled by one of those posts about Assange, and then I remember Vault 7.  I think, is that true or did they just make that up to fool us.  To test us.  Yep.  That was proof that they can put anything on msm and they will believe it. More Drivel.  I can't wait for the Big Ballyhoo when he "appears" in Virginia.  Is this gonna be  another bit of Tom Foolery. actually I can't wait to see this one.

              Jimmy Wales contradicts the rest of the Internet
             </p>
             <p>
              Guess which company is marked as the registrant organization of all of the following domain names?
             </p>
             <pre><code>WikiLeaks.com
WikiLeaks.net
WikiLeaks.us
WikiLeaks.mobi
WikiLeaks.biz
</code></pre>
             <p>
              That's right -- Wikia! Thanks to Wikia, Inc.'s chief operating officer, Michael Davis, all five of those WikiLeaks domains are registered to Wikia, Inc., which is ultimately presided over by its co-founder Jimmy Wales -- the guy who says he has "absolutely nothing to do with WikiLeaks". Also, Michael Davis used to sit on the board of trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, alongside Jimbo Wales.
