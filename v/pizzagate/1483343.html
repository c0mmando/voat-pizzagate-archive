<p>James Alefantis’ life is rather revealing. He was the romantic partner of David Brock, ex-right-wing journalist-hatchet man turned Hillary hatchet man, founder of such tax exempt nonprofits as the liberal watchdog group Media Matters and Control the Record as well as a former Bitcoin director. Time Magazine describes Brock as “one of the most influential operatives in the Democratic Party.” The illegal activities that Brock’s been hiding for years provided a spurned former lover to accuse Brock of “financial malfeasance,” cooking the books of his Control the Record Hillary Super PAC with a blatant money laundering scheme. As a result, Brock had to sell his Delaware home in order to pay off his ex with $850,000 in hush money that Brock himself calls “blackmail payment.” It’s also speculated that Bitcoin is conveniently used as an untraceable financial mechanism that’s enabled human trafficking rings in recent years to flourish under the legal radar.</p>
<hr />
<p>Is the reason that <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">/v/pizzagate</a> was created by David Brock was to have James Alefantis murdered by the ALT-RIGHT?</p>
<p>We know that King-Kong(MOD) &amp; MF, ... et-al are CTR.</p>
<p>They focus only on Alefantis, who Brock had to pay off $800k,</p>
<p>Pizzagate is real ( 8 million missing children ), but but it appears that the hit on Alefantis is 1st degree murder orchestrated hit.</p>
<p>Note that just a week ago alt-right wing-nut went nuts with an AR-15 went  into CPP looking for children, and most likely to KILL Alefantis who was NOT there.</p>
<p>Had Alefantis died the &quot;INTERNET&quot; would have been blamed, and not one iota of evidence would have passed back to brock.</p>
<p>Note also that we are NEVER allowed to discuss SAUDI, KLINE, BROCK, on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate">/v/pizzagate</a>.</p>
<p>The only people we are allowed to discuss is PODESTA &amp; ALEFANTIS, its clear that Brock also wants to destroy Podesta, which makes sense that it was BROCK ( RNC  just like Clinton ) that released the Podesta Emails.</p>

            Brock’s bitter legal battle with Grey, who is described in a Sept. 14, 2010, police report obtained by FoxNews.com as his domestic partner of more than 10 years, began after Brock began dating Washington, D.C., restaurant impresario James Alefantis about five years ago. For the next three years, Brock and Grey traded angry accusations, which were documented in the police report and were the foundation of a pitched legal battle replete with charges of blackmail, theft and financial malfeasance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis was also named as a defendant in Grey's lawsuit.

             The only people we are allowed to discuss is PODESTA &amp; ALEFANTIS, its clear that Brock also wants to destroy Podesta, which makes sense that it was BROCK ( RNC just like Clinton ) that released the Podesta Emails.

            None of that is even remotely true. I've seen countless posts about all of these people/things.

            Blatant lying and exageration. There are crazy people all over the world. But the person that entered the building was confirmed by police as never firing a shot (because they said a gun wasn't even found) In fact, witness accounts from the cashier in the pizza place said they didn't even see a gun.

             Not necessarily true. Plenty of things get upvoated that are irrelevant/not worth the front page. Though this is a spam account.
