<blockquote>
<p>Now, days in, the case is attracting a lot of interest in the city, given it harks back to events that took place at the time of the Financial Crisis. The latest is that Roger Jenkins reportedly claims that it was not Staveley, but his glamorous Bosnian wife Diana Jenkins (pictured below) who secretly negotiated a deal with Middle Eastern royalty to save the bank in 2018. Jenkins said that it was Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim who had been responsible for the introduction and said that his wife’s friendship with Sheikh Hamad’s wife had also been underplayed in the dealings. Emails have emerged from 2018 that suggest this, as reported by the Times, ‘Diana teed up Hamad thru his wife that’s how it began,’ he wrote. ‘His wife wanted to be Diana’s circle.’ He added: ‘We Diana and I built great trust . . .

            Hi MB2, the first imgur link you posted in the body of your submission is blank for me, and i don't have an archive of it. Would you mind checking to see if it is the correct link?

             LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s financial regulators are probing links between Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley and the U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein..
            </p>
            <p>
             Barclays disclosed earlier in the day that its board had looked into media reports on Staley’s relationship with Epstein, and probed the chief executive’s characterization of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             U.K. regulators launched their investigations into links between Staley and Epstein after JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co’s provided them with emails the two exchanged when Staley was the head of JPMorgan’s private bank, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.
            </p>
            <p>
             Barclays confirmed the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority were now investigating the matter. The bank did not give further details on the probe.

            Too bad more people inside wouldn’t talk about Diana’s sex trafficking and blackmail. She’s like the female Jeffrey Epstein, everyone knows her and her charity work is all a bullshit cover. No morals so you know she deals with kids, especially with her Saudi clientele.

              The J/P Haitian Relief Organization is a registered non-profit charitable foundation established to help the people of Haiti recover from the devastating January 12, 2010 earthquake. In April 2010, J/P HRO was appointed camp manager of the Pétionville IDP camp by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). In December 2010 J/P HRO added Cite Maxo, a smaller IDP camp near Pétionville, to the camp management roster-raising the number of IDP’s under J/P HRO camp management to around 55,000. As of September 2011, because of our relocation program of camp residents, the population of the camp has shrunk to approx. 23,000.

             <p>
              The day after the catastrophic earthquake struck Haiti in January, Diana Jenkins, a former Bosnian refugee now married to one of Britain’s wealthiest financiers, ran into Sean Penn at a friend’s house in Malibu. The two had met years earlier, at Dennis Hopper’s birthday party in Cannes, and remained close. Hearing Penn talk about his desire to do something for the quake victims, Jenkins offered her support. Beyond her $1 million infusion of funds into what became the Jenkins-Penn Haitian Relief Organization, she recruited doctors and nurses, ordered water filters and medical supplies, and chartered a cargo plane. Within five days Jenkins and Penn were in Haiti, sleeping in tents as they changed bandages and dispensed aid. “Because it was my own money, we were very agile,” she says. “But it doesn’t matter how fast the world reacts. You’re always five minutes too late for somebody.”
             </p>
             <p>
              ..It’s Diana—named for the goddess of the hunt—who holidays in Hawaii with Elton John and his partner, David Furnish; throws fundraisers that draw Bono and George Clooney; and recently launched a line of health drinks with such names as NeuroTrim and NeuroGasm.
             </p>
             <p>
              “She’s a master seducer,” says Jimmy Choo founder Tamara Mellon, who calls Jenkins her “wingman” on the circuit. “She’s extraordinarily beautiful, and you get kind of mesmerized by her. But when you’re in her clutches, it’s great. It’s the most fun I’ve ever had in my life.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Even to Furnish, no stranger to the social swirl, Diana’s ability to navigate multiple orbits is striking. “She’s like the pied piper,” says Furnish, who met her when she attended the Elton John AIDS Foundation’s White Tie and Tiara Ball seven years ago. Describing the week he spent a year or two ago on the yacht Jenkins charters in Cannes in May, he says, “She’ll go to a club and find the coolest and most interesting people to hang with, and then everybody comes back to the boat, and she’ll have a DJ spinning, and the atmosphere just clicks. Suddenly there’s Bono, and there’s Sean Penn; there’s Julian Schnabel. And the next thing you know, it’s six o’clock in the morning, and Diana’s closest friends are all in the galley eating grilled cheese sandwiches.”
