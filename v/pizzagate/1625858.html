<p>I revisited this angle because of <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1625204">this post</a> which led <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1428757">here</a> (goes to show revisiting old clues can be very fruitful). For some reason Alefantis\' letter is unavailable, but <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/835134-kloman-letters.html">many others are</a> - many from well-known DC power players.</p>
<p>Most famous is Ken Starr, who of course also defended Jeffrey Epstein. But among <a href="http://archive.is/H903O">Kloman\'s defenders</a> are also ABC News anchor Charlie Gibson, a former aide to Laura Bush, a former GOP congressman, and a powerful partner at the insider law firm Akin Gump.</p>
<p>So why would such a powerful group of people appeal to a judge in the case of a retired teacher who estimated that he molested girls ‘<a href="http://archive.is/KzWzW">less than 10 times</a>’” from 1966 to 1985, sometimes by luring them to a isolated location under the guise of helping them with homework?</p>
<p>Well it turns out Kloman has many connections to institutions very familiar to pizzagate researchers. As Starr himself wrote: &quot;I personally have known Mr. Kleman (sic) since 1982, as we both served on the <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1566852">Claude Moore Colonial Farm Board</a> in Mclean for thirty years together.&quot; </p>
<p>Apparently Kloman has been Claude Moore Farm since before it changed its name from <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1443931">Turkey Run Farm</a> - you know, where John Podesta took up his hobby of slaughtering pigs.</p>
<p>Another familiar name returning tie and again in the letters of support is <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1619493">Habitat for Humanity</a>. &quot;Chris has been a steadfast member of the Northern Virginia Habitat for Humanity team, working there three days a week building affordable homes and making home repairs for those less fortunate among us. Knowing what we now know about his past, we believe that Chris began his repentance journey years ago in working tirelessly for his church and for the homeless at Habitat for Humanity&quot;. Thus wrote Dabney and Dick Schmitt.</p>

<p>Gary C. Olson wrote: &quot;I learned Chris headed the organization that oversaw the Claude Moore Colonial Farm located along the George Washington Parkway. Particularly impressive, was his leadership in raising money and helping to build a mission church for Habitat in the Dominican Republic&quot;.</p>
<p>But raising money wasn\'t all that Kloman did for Habitat in the DR. Wrote James R. Stirn: &quot;He served for several years as an energetic member of the Missions Committee at St. John\'s Episcopal Church in Mclean, during which time he made trips to the Dominican Republic and helped with construction of a trade school there being sponsored by the church.&quot;</p>
<p>That school <a href="http://www.stjohnsmclean.org/get-inv/midd/">would be</a> the Bob and Ellen Snow Episcopal School. There are only a couple mentions of Kloman\'s trips to the DR, mostly to underscore his charity, commitment etc. But one writer seems a little less than certain about those: &quot;I was not on the trips to Consuelo, but I am very sure that Chris flew to there to help with this&quot;, said Margaret Whitehead.</p>
<p>The same woman writes about another of Kloman\'s community activities, <a href="https://thealternativehouse.org/about.htm">Alternative House</a>, a charitable house for school-age children without parents in Fairfax County, even if she somewhat conspiucuously mentions she has not been there in person: </p>
<p>&quot;Though I have contributed to it, I have not been there. But he has. After a workday there that he most likely organized himself, that is a day to act as a cleaning staff for the House, I asked him, &quot;How did it go Chris.&quot; Emphatically, and with a big smile and great joy, he said, &quot;AWESOME!&quot; I had expected him to say, &quot;We got the job done,&quot; or &quot;What a mess we found,&quot; or, perhaps smiling, &quot;Cleaning up after teenagers is something!&quot; But he said, &quot;AWESOME.&quot; He clearly loved it.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah I bet he did. Runaway youth, teen mothers, at-risk children. We all know the drill by now. These pedos and child rapists are all attracted to the same \'charities\'. Out of contrition of course.</p>
<p>Well I don\'t believe in repeated rapists who repent. In this case, just a year after his sentencing and mass elite support, <a href="http://archive.is/Hqb4L">new evidence emerged</a> of much wider spread abuse than previously thought, with 26 more molested students coming forward. </p>
<p>These cases were all from before the mid-80s. I believe Kloman did not repent after that - as even his 2013 confession proved a sham - but was embedded in the elite pedo-ring of McLean/DC, where via their familiar institutions he could more safely access young victims - at Claude Moore Farm, Habitat for Humanity, Alternative House and of course, the Dominican Republic.</p>',

            I have a related comment. There is a video based on a 4Chan thread which claims arrests for high level pedophiles will begin within a week of the confirmation of the nomination of Jeff Sessions as AG.
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DAsUTZBM2U">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DAsUTZBM2U
            </a>
            In this video they claim that one of those to be arrested is a former mentor to Anthony Weiner.
If you Google Anthony Weiner + mentor , I guarantee you will be amazed at the result.
If the resulting arrests are even half as widespread as claimed, the pedophiles will lose their immunity from prosecution.

            It has become very obvious by now that "the farm" is a CIA operation whatever name it is given. Also these charities, orphanages, or whatever they call them are simply fronts for the CIA black budget ops and the elites perversions

            If this guy can be prosecuted for decades old molestation, then why can't Hastert be prosecuted? Didn't they say the statute of limitations ran out so they could only prosecute him for hiding money or some such thing?

            Robert K. Huffman?
I am wondering if the Reddit CEO, who brags about eating human flesh and therefore "being enlighted" with the same name, is a relative?

            "Apparently Kloman has been at Claude Moore Farm since before it changed its name from Turkey Run Farm - you know, where John Podesta took up his hobby of slaughtering pigs."

            This is absolutely incredible!

            It becomes more and more obvious to me, that pizzagate is only the tip of the iceberg, with the iceberg being a GLOBAL BLACKMAILING NETWORK! Blackmail as the ultimate backbone of shadow government!
Everything begins to make sense. It's much more than perverts or satanists. It's huge. It's global. It ensures power over governements, states, central banks, economy, companies!
Therefore also the CIA is in the boat!
Therefore often visitor of the Buckingham Palace and therefore background checked Jimmy Savile, was known to the MI5 to be a necrophile child molester!
           </p>
           <p>
            A king is good.
What is better?
A blackmailed king!

            So proud of people on here. It has been years now for me, that when someone is putting forth some public persona of being a do good-er, being affiliated with some charity involving children, that they are in fact dirty, yet the general public would dismiss such claims and argue that they were doing all this good work The classic small town example is the boy scout leader who is abusing young boys. Yup, people here now are not so gullible.

            Good info. I also just put together some info sparked by these letters of support for Kloman in an older post about this. One letter of support came from the CEO of
            <em>
             The Love Companies
            </em>
            , a finance and real estate firm with a few ties that could be worth digging in to further.

             Years ago a friend convinced me to stop thinking of Jimmy Carter as a bad guy. He cited Carter's association with Habitat for Humanity. Anyone who travels to an impoverished place to pick up a hammer and help people can't be all that bad, right? In light of recent information I'm back to being suspicious.

              Carter is extremely hateful to the Jews. For that reason alone he's always been on my sh*t-list.

            I remember when this piece of evidence first came out in the early days of Pizzagate. The letter itself WAS available and it's since gone...there's even a couple sites that no longer list Susan A. as one of the people who wrote to the judge. Another point-- although a few sites say Susan is James' sister...the first time I saw this it had Susan as James'  mother. The only reason I put some more credibility in that is because it was before anything started being censored (but who knows). Interesting that Ken Starr keeps popping up too. From this past August: Ken Starr, the former Baylor University president and chancellor who was demoted for his mishandling of rampant accusations of sexual assault on campus, will leave his position as a faculty member in the law school.
