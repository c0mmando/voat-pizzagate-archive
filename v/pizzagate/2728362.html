            It is one thing when the mob is involved in human trafficking. It is disgusting, but you expect it. What you don't usually expect is nation state sponsored human trafficking. It is exactly what is going on now and one of the countries involved is actually breeding children strictly for this practice. Some they groom to be shipped off as tweens, but for the most part, when children are born they sell them to one of the countries in this Bloc and the kids are given a new set of identity documents and sold abroad.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the architects of this whole thing is this foreign born former A- list mostly movie actor who has been in this space before for his abused of minors. Apparently he found people who shared a common interest and decided he could make a buck off it. His only problem is that he quickly ran out of kids in orphanages to sell and needed a new supply. So, he found a bunch of kids that were kidnapped from their parents in the Middle East. That was expensive and didn't lead to all that many children. The kidnappers wanted them to fight or be used by their own people rather than sold. One of his best friends, who is a former A+ list mostly movie actor suggested a meeting with representatives from an Asian country. He heard rumors they were selling children on the open market. It runs out this was true, and they wanted an easier way to sell the children. Our foreign born actor and his actor best friend went to their mutual A+ list foreign born celebrity and asked for permission to bring them through a certain country. Permission was granted. Now, the kids are just shipped via a land crossing directly to the middlemen who then farm the kids out all over the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            The children sell for well into six figures and no one really knows what happens to them after they are shipped off. This is a no questions asked kind of operation.
