<p>To summarize: a huge discovery was made of tunnels running beneath the Tenderloin District of San Francisco. Seems these were used by gay men to hide and use to frequent speakeasies during Prohibition. It started a chain of my thinking that secret tunnels aren’t all that outlandish. I mean, if someone told me that gay men used their own tunnels to have a drink, I would have been in disbelief, but, nonetheless, there it is. And they went undiscovered for so long. </p>
<p>I got inspired and really started “digging”. I was freaking amazed to run across secret tunnels in Washington, DC! No, these don’t have to do with the already well-established tunnels in the DuPont Circle, BUT they are in that exact same vicinity! How about that? </p>
<p>It seems a Harrison G. Dyar took it upon himself to excavate and create huge underground tunnels for “exercise”. The article mentions the tunnels being in the neighborhood of V Street and P Street. But another article I found says – and this is IMPORTANT – THAT THEY LEAD TO ROCK CREEK PARK!!!

<p>I think the interesting thing is that these tunnels were never fully investigated.

<p>This discovery of tunnels and the use of those words admitting that JA &amp; Co have a place on P Street lead to me believe that they’re using this underground labyrinth to get to Rock Creek Park and back. They could do whatever they want underground, or in the park since they\'re traveling unnoticed.  And they could drop evidence anywhere they want!

            There is at least one known historical pedo-ring using tunnels to transport children: the McMartin Preschool Case. Tunnels were discovered by a former Hermosa Beach police officer named Paul Bynum, who had been hired by the parents of victims as a private investigator, turned up dead on the eve of his scheduled testimony as well. His death by gunshot was ruled a suicide, though those close to Bynum dispute that finding. Among other things, Bynum may have testified about his examination of the tunnel excavation project conducted at the school site. This was, of course, the object of much derision by the media. The fact that the children repeatedly told stories of tunnels under the property by which they could be secretly transported to and from the school, and in which they were subjected to horrific abuse in a secret room, was frequently cited as ‘proof’ that the children's stories were fabrications. It was universally accepted that the tunnels did not actually exist, that being the consensus view of the media and law enforcement authorities. Nevertheless, while it is true that the investigation commissioned by the District Attorney's office found no evidence of tunnels, another investigation, ignored by the media, certainly did.

             All true .. all factual. And tunnels and underground dwellings have been used in numerous serial killings. Son of Sam and The Zodiac definitely used them. Not sure what people aren't getting in why using underground passageways is so effective.

                I don't know if you saw the line of investigation into the transportation of children to the Norway pedo ring with high level sickos. I don't have enough 'cred' to start a thread or I would post it. But I noticed the Obama-Norwegian Air International trade deal that allows the airline to employ Bangkok-based flight crews under short-term Singaporean or Thai employment contracts.

                Southeast Asia of course has a huge sex-trade industry, including the prostitution of children for pedophiles. Although Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam have tried to crack down on child sex abuse, kids are still easy prey. In Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh, for instance, the airport is plastered with posters warning against pedophilia....Source:

                Is there a high-level Norwegian connection to this? Well, yes there is. This researcher has compiled a list of convicted pedophiles Pattaya, Thailand. This list included Jimmy Seville's chauffeur and Norwegian  Mr. Oystein Larsen. Source:

                Although not connected to the airline and Thailand pilot link at this point, it could be a link to the overseas shipping of children. However, what is even more interesting, there is a Mr. Oystein Larsen

                 My thoughts is nobody has credibility before they have it. And posters get credibility by posting credible stuff. I definitely think this deserves it's own thread. I don't know if you're copying from someone else, or put this together, but it you are borrowing info, then do some digging and find some more things that round this out. It's more than valid.

                  I compiled that right  myself actually. I thought there might have been a link between the airline transportation stuff based upon Obama's trade deal with Norwegian airlines. I didn't think it would evolve into a high profile Norwegian pedo and his possible links to the pizzagate topic or spin-offs.

            <strong>
             tunnels
            </strong>

             Thanks for the info. I did see your thread and read through it. I don't know about JA and whether he's a descendant, but what I do know is that he's always been close to Chris Lynch. Chris Lynch (along with partner Jim Ball) opened "L'Enfant Cafe". There is a whole story there in regards to them seizing control of another agency giving them problems. It seems to be an MO. As for the Society of Cincinnati residing in the house next door to Dyar, that is super interesting. And I agree. There is no doubt that Dyar had help ... and some of that was information regarding existing tunnels. He may well have dug to connect them into a new pattern. The Rock Creek part again makes my ears perk up and tingle. Definitely think there's a tunnel there. Perhaps Dyar connected everything together. Interesting stuff.

            what is the  metal under the bird?
            <br/>
            It's partly covered in dirt, but it could be  either a ritual symbol of some type or maybe a type of man-hole covering?
           </p>
           <p>
            Is the bird, blood death ritual  marking the entrance spot?
           </p>
           <p>
            Marking doors,  to either open or close doors,  has been an ancient ritual among many groups.
           </p>

            ETA:   I posted this before I read the comments and saw  intheknow posted about a man-hole cover too.  May be something to look into.

            Another Rock Creek Park "event"  - Chandra Levy disappeared May 1, 2001. FBI looked at her laptop and the last thing she did on it was search for the location of a "Pierce-Klingle Mansion", a historic house in Rock Creek Her decomposed body was found about one mile (1.6 km) north of the Pierce-Klingle Mansion and about four miles (6 km) from Levy's apartment. Hers shin bone had wire around it
           </p>
           <p>
            so her last act was to -by coincidence- google the location where her body would be found? seems fishy

            We need someone to research Dyer's kids and grandkids. Find out where they live. See if they've had any run-ins with the law. What circles they hang in. etc. They would know if he dug any other tunnels. If he was a pedophile himself, they might have been abused and become abusers. He wasn't exactly flying on the straight and narrow.

            There should be investigation into missing children from this park or near it. I have a feeling the tunnels are an important factor. If not then I truly feel there is some connection to Rock Creek Park and some of the residents living nearby.

             Definitely. They could spirit young kids out of the area with no one being the wiser. Really scary to think about.

            From JA Instagram account.  Could be an entrance.  I definitely think there are secret tunnels below ground.  Great JOB!!

             That makes me think Stranger Things. Not only does the captive girl "11" escape through a tunnel exactly like that, but there are a lot of references to MKUltra, kidnapping, and even telling the mother her child was stillborn and secretly raising the child themselves. I feel like it's a commentary at this point, since there are so many parallels between this reality in pizzagate and the Netflix show.

               There looks to be sediment deposit at the bottom of the mouth of the pipe. The sediment colour and visual consistency does not match the surroundings, something definitely comes out of here.

             There is a twitter or IG pic from JA's friends that shows a creepy cement cellar door/entrance that looks old as fuck and could be an entrance to a tunnel system. I can't be the only one who knows the pic I am talking about. Someone find it please.

              This photo could be in an underground tunnel. The chains are hinting at something very very disturbing.

             I just spent over an hour looking at all those photos. This backup is precious but it might get deleted DMCA. What I find annoying is that none of the photos are dated or in order. That sucks.

             Oh, nice! I wonder if it is an entrance. Wish I lived near there. And, no, I wouldn't go alone. I'd take a few hundred people with me ... all with cameras! But Jabbaroos saying, "Our Place", is also definitely a clue. Must be somewher on P Street they hang around ... or underneath.

            This really freaks me out because I use to spend a lot of time hanging out in these very neighborhoods. Honestly, I've personally never heard or witnessed any of these things going on. Not even hints of it. Do not perceive that as me disputing any of these claims. I'm not doing that at all. Just pointing out mostly at how well this stuff is hiding in plain sight.

            I knew there were plenty of tunnels in DC as well as other old East Coast cities, as well as all the way up to the hills of West Virginia, but they were always based on the lore of old as well as secret government installation leaks. Guess if this scum has access to any of them, they'll take advantage of them for their own purposes.

             I know what you mean. There's lots of talk of underground places where I live, too. I think every place has the rumors. I think the most freaked out I got was reading Maury Terry's book about the part they placed in the Son of Sam case. I'd be almost positive they were utilized in the Zodiac Killings as well. I definitely think it's protected info. I mean, most of us don't know about to enter these subterranean places, and don't want to know ... except where it comes to solving what's going on.

            Well leaving evidence of a homicidal crime - committed on or near January 20th 2016 -  in a public park, only to be found by one of the perpetrators when the snow melted, and then post the fact on Instagram - that just seems stupid beyond belief even for these people.

            I think either Community__Outreach or Artis has a place on Perry Street, Mt Rainier. Seems a more likely place.

             Really? You think it's stupid? Look at what else they were posting? I'd call it overconfidence. Why would he say #goodtimes? And I think the whole thing of leavng a souvenir away from the place of the actual murder is pretty clever. No dna like you find at the crime scene. Just a hacked off piece of scalp.

               No, there would be pretty much zero dna ... except for the victim's. I doubt it was a one-on-one killing. If the police found this at the crime scene, there would be footprints, evidence of how many were involved, perhaps blood from where one of the attacker's was clawed or bloodied. Dropping a souvenir of the victim on a sidewalk or in the bushes miles from where it happened? Sorry. If you don't believe me, ask a cop.

             FREAKIN' A!!!  How in the heck did you find this article?  Did you do a search across the US for such similar strange incidents? 
Reminds me of how occasionally farmers would find their cattle with all blood drained... cant recall where, saw it on cable...

               Cattle mutilation was huge in the early 90s. Art Bell used to have Linda Multon Howe on his radio show every Thursday to talk about it.

So i knew what to look for....just googled rock creek park and sacrifice. No clue if it's related to Pizzagate or what...just remembered a bunch of ppl discussing it/remembered the name of the park

             Rock Creek Park is right behind Kolorama. BO will live there soon two doors down from Tony P. This needs to be looked into. I am not too good at that. I am convinced there is a reason they will both be there. Also I believe there was some news on here about BO extending some tunnel to Camp David. Someone please look into this. Thanks.

               David Brock and Alefantis were also neighboors of Tony Podesta. I made a thread about that, both bought their houses at the same time.
Don't know where Alefantis is living today.

               Yes. He and Michelle were still paying off loans (if we can believe them). Now 8 yrs later he can pay 22K per mo. to rent it. Look it up. They will both be living in Kolorama. There is a picture.

                I've seen the picture.. wonder how tall the wall will be? :-) 
Im just totally blown away of the ability to afford this place AND then to find out who his neighbor is... wow.

                 There was a woman...she was a trafficked child that was beautiful so they kept her as a model and used her for the elites only. She claimed that she and others would be invited to very special WH dinners where only high roller elites were invited and they had to pay a large fee for the girls and the President got to keep this money. She said Presidents could make as much as 100M a yr. 
That is why they are willing to go through those horrible grueling campaigns. I read this on here but cannot remember her name.
