<p>YAHRARGUL KILELD PODESTA IN THE METHOD OF RAPING CRUCIYING CHIDLREN USING 921938213 BASEMENTS <a href="https://ibb.co/kySmra">https://ibb.co/kySmra</a> <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/5d0506">https://mobile.twitter.com/5d0506</a></p>
<p>I could go on making connections, but it spans across many social media sites, I am trying to keep this short and simple.</p>
<hr />
<p>THE SECOND VIDEO WITH CAILLOU</p>
<p>Chris Chandler aka Liquid Chris aka Silvagunner is using the same Caillou abuse clip in his video. (I believe this is half arg like he says.) (ARG- Alternate reality game)</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxz0p_4wXDAYouTube">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxz0p_4wXDAYouTube</a></p>
<p>So this &quot;story&quot; begins with liquid Chris. He is kidnapped and taken to a desert and raped as a young boy. He makes it back home. He develops a character called &quot;Sonichu.&quot; <a href="https://sonichu.com/cwcki/Liquid_Chris">https://sonichu.com/cwcki/Liquid_Chris</a> (Early Depliction of mk ultra art from an abuse victim possibly)</p>
<p>The videos of Sonichu are quite sexualized. I did see a little code in the comments, In some of the videos it actually sounds like they\'re explaining videos like Elsagate, and toy freaks in an indirect way. This video does give warning that its not for children on screen, although there is nothing stopping them from watching this.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/0tV7xsAIAsIYouTube">https://youtu.be/0tV7xsAIAsIYouTube</a> </p>
<p>There is a lot of homosexual innuendos and @ 7 minutes in they have a button, they can push for pizza. The narrator says, &quot;It will make sense in due time.&quot;</p>
<p>More here: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/results?q=sonichu&amp;sm=3">https://m.youtube.com/results?q=sonichu&amp;sm=3</a></p>
<p>I feel these videos were made as a clue to tip us off. Is this the way they attract a generation just a little older? How many more could there be? There is many, all different kinds, for all different ages, it\'s absurd. There is even channels out there teaching young children cyptonology.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7_17l0swMYYouTube">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7_17l0swMYYouTube</a></p>
<hr />
<p>There is just one more, character to add to all of this:</p>
<p>Solid Chris.</p>
<p><a href="https://sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Solid_Chris&amp;redirect=no">https://sonichu.com/w/index.php?title=Solid_Chris&amp;redirect=no</a></p>
<p>Solid Chris tries to steal Liquid Chris\'s Sonichu character. Solid Chris goes to college, and he is involved with the College radio station. It is unclear but something happens to him there, his girlfriend splits. He then has multiple personalities and identities, finally becoming a feminist tranny. So I think! I gave up after 10 or 15 wacky profiles. (mk ultra)</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/CWCSonichu?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">https://mobile.twitter.com/CWCSonichu?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor</a></p>
<hr />
<p>So we have liquid Chris who used Antoninus <a href="https://ibb.co/nLNNEv">https://ibb.co/nLNNEv</a> as a profile pic, then Solid Chris who is a Tranny. Does that remind you of anyone we know? Sure does Jimmy Comet <a href="https://ibb.co/ds1Sga">https://ibb.co/ds1Sga</a> and also sometimes known as Majestic Ape <a href="https://ibb.co/gbo3Ma">https://ibb.co/gbo3Ma</a> and yes, I think its him, sometimes.</p>
<p>These are all WorldCorp Enterprise youtube channels.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/results?q=worldcorp+enterprises&amp;search_type=search_users&amp;uploaded=">https://m.youtube.com/results?q=worldcorp+enterprises&amp;search_type=search_users&amp;uploaded=</a></p>
<p>LHOHQ.info and Synt.us had shared imagery with World Corpo. They to have information, spread across different social media sites and blogs. It\'s a puzzle, cicada 3301, leaking real info, and you can not understand one, without the other. So I believe World Corpo is real footage, and Chris\'s video is half ARG, half of an act, to show the truth. The photo id\'s they\'ve posted are clearly fake.</p>
<p>L.H.O.H.Q video\'s on youtube, and it\'s main site  show you the locations, in an informal way. Look past the people. At 14 minutes there is a scene with leaves. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/M6i9fbqNw_A">https://youtu.be/M6i9fbqNw_A</a></p>
<p>Again just like the Podesta art: 
<a href="https://ibb.co/kd9wUv">https://ibb.co/kd9wUv</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Just to dig a little further THE MEANING OF CORPO:</p>
<p>Corpo Galician Edit</p>
<p>Etymology Edit From Old Portuguese corpo, from Latin corpus.</p>
<p>Noun Edit corpo m (plural corpos)</p>
<p>BODY, or CORPORATION</p>
<p>I found this site seperately which uses the word &quot;Corpo&quot; The images are disturbing and I am pretty sure it\'s not &quot;corporation&quot; they mean. Should be (cult)</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/788N5">http://archive.is/788N5</a></p>
<p><a href="http://hemisphericinstitute.org/hemi/fr/enc13-performances/item/2004-enc-13-pocha-corpo-insurrecto">http://hemisphericinstitute.org/hemi/fr/enc13-performances/item/2004-enc-13-pocha-corpo-insurrecto</a></p>
<p>So I searched the words Corpo, and Cult together and there was quite a few returns. This one stood out the most: The Art and the Relic Cult of St. Antoninus in Renaissance Florence <a href="https://ibb.co/eyA8Ma">https://ibb.co/eyA8Ma</a></p>
<p>So in conclusion, I think WORLD CORPO is part of the Phoenix program, based on only seeing males, and listening to Max Spiers interviews.  As well as a reboot/remake/regeneration of the Finders cult.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6VID7Mo13cAYouTubeYouTube">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6VID7Mo13cAYouTubeYouTube</a></p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/stream/MonarchTheNewPhoenixProgram_441/Monarch_djvu.txt">https://archive.org/stream/MonarchTheNewPhoenixProgram_441/Monarch_djvu.txt</a></p>
<p>I haven\'t always been correct this is all new I can admit that.</p>
<p>So I decided to go back check and recheck my theory, about the Phoenix program.</p>
<p>The littlest things sometimes bring it all together. </p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1881388">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1881388</a></p>
<p>In this post I shared  a video of a young girl twerking, with a pizza screen in the background. The video\'s name is &quot;worldc&quot;. This youtube channel includes copies of all the WorldCorpo video\'s which is why I focused on it. Little did I know the answer was right there all along, and it is the final assurance for me. There was only one comment, in the comments section. <a href="https://ibb.co/jOh2xF">https://ibb.co/jOh2xF</a></p>
<p>I do not believe for 1 minute trolls spent this much money, effort or time on a larp. The people who made this started many years ago, I have found things in these puzzles dating back to 2004.</p>',

          <p>
           So this "story" begins with liquid Chris. He is kidnapped and taken to a desert and raped as a young boy. He makes it back home. He develops a character called "Sonichu."

           There is a lot of homosexual innuendos and @ 7 minutes in they have a button, they can push for pizza. The narrator says, "It will make sense in due time."

           I feel these videos were made as a clue to tip us off. Is this the way they attract a generation just a little older? How many more could there be?

           L.H.O.H.Q video's on youtube, and it's main site  show you the locations, in an informal way. Look past the people. At 14 minutes there is a scene with leaves.

           Just to dig a little further THE MEANING OF CORPO:
          </p>
          <p>
           Corpo Galician Edit
          </p>
          <p>
           Etymology Edit From Old Portuguese corpo, from Latin corpus.
          </p>
          <p>
           Noun Edit corpo m (plural corpos)
          </p>
          <p>
           BODY, or CORPORATION
          </p>
          <p>
           I found this site seperately which uses the word "Corpo" The images are disturbing and I am pretty sure it's not "corporation" they mean. Should be (cult)
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://archive.is/788N5">

           <a href="http://hemisphericinstitute.org/hemi/fr/enc13-performances/item/2004-enc-13-pocha-corpo-insurrecto">
            http://hemisphericinstitute.org/hemi/fr/enc13-performances/item/2004-enc-13-pocha-corpo-insurrecto
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           So I searched the words Corpo, and Cult together and there was quite a few returns. This one stood out the most: The Art and the Relic Cult of St. Antoninus in Renaissance Florence
           <a href="https://ibb.co/eyA8Ma">
            https://ibb.co/eyA8Ma
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           So in conclusion, I think WORLD CORPO is part of the Phoenix program, based on only seeing males, and listening to Max Spiers interviews.  As well as a reboot/remake/regeneration of the Finders cult.

           So I decided to go back check and recheck my theory, about the Phoenix program.

           In this post I shared  a video of a young girl twerking, with a pizza screen in the background. The video's name is "worldc". This youtube channel includes copies of all the WorldCorpo video's which is why I focused on it. Little did I know the answer was right there all along, and it is the final assurance for me. There was only one comment, in the comments section.

           I do not believe for 1 minute trolls spent this much money, effort or time on a larp. The people who made this started many years ago, I have found things in these puzzles dating back to 2004.

            no, no, no..... you may be onto something with phoenix, but you are all wrong about the chris chan story... their saga is irrelevant anyways, but you have it all wrong. liquid chris may indeed be playing around with some of this but it is NOT related to the original saga of chris chan which occurred several years ago.
           </p>
           <p>
            solid chris is original chris chan/ christian chandler ... an autistic individual who made a lot of videos of themselves, they also wrote/drew the Sonichu comics based on Sonic hedgehog characters. trolls and mean people found these eventually and harassed chrischan constantly, eventually resulting in 'liquid chris' "stealing" his identity as a joke, which enraged the real chris and everyone thought it was funny. they actually did video singing battles to prove who was real, etc. ....
           </p>
           <p>
            later, after this time, the real chris did indeed transistion to female. ( side note: gender fluidity and transgender traits are more common in the autism/aspergers community - look it up)....
           </p>
           <p>
            good work on the phoenix stuff though- upvoating you for that!!

              i understand, it's confusing, but no- the autistic christian chandler is the original. the tech savvy weird video maker liquid chris is the troll/parody, they even tricked him into talking to fictional girls- who he believed really liked him, in order to laugh at him and watch him respond in his crazy videos.
             </p>
             <p>
              at one point the poser referred to real chris as 'solid chris', he also renamed real chris with the name 'ian brandon anderson' and referred to him this way. this was all to enrage the real autistic chrischan, because he would post response videos going crazy and screaming-  ( side note: autistics often have difficulty with lies and deceptive or mean behavior).

                I don't think an actor would barge into a Gamestop, of all places, and mace an employee. Certainly not one whose stated motivation is flipping out over the design of a children's video game character.
               </p>
               <p>
                All the evidence points toward Chris being an unstable individual.
               </p>
               <p>
                This same evidence is thanks to the same crowd (4chan-goers among them) that provided much of the information we use in the Pizzagate movement today. I wouldn't dismiss their insight so quickly.

                 I didn't dismiss anyone, I gave an opinion. 
Ok so answer these 2 questions please.
On December 27th, 2014, Christian Weston Chandler goes into a gamestop in the Cwcville mall and assaults an employee with mace.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What city and state or country is this mall located?
                </p>
                <p>
                 Why is there no arrest record for anyone named Christain Chandler on this day, anywhere in this country? Yes I had a detective in my family run the name and all of the information he made public, their is nothing. Someone just happened to have a camera and knew who Christain was, sorry not buying it.

                  many youtubers stage events or set up things to video, obviously- not sure i would call that "acting"- though i do think this one is real.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  also, many many people video others' crazy behavior in stores- just search "redneck losing it in a store" or any similar phrase! 
there are tons of videos, this one is funny but again- irrelevant.

                  Chris lives in Ruckersville, Virginia. It's a suburban area on the outskirts of Charlottesville, where (to my understanding) the Gamestop is located.

                  Not sure if anyone managed to obtain the actual arrest records themselves (at least, to add to the Chris Chan info collection I use), but here is a recording of a jail employee's testimony regarding the event:

                  And, as for his later release on bond...

                   There is no mall named that anywhere.
There is no arrest record.
The youtube video proves nothing, and the link to the bond is broken and its on "Kiwifarms?"

                     I did not say you named the mall. I already knew the name,  from when I had my detective relative look for the arrest record months ago. I find it really odd the mall is using his intials to. What are the chances of that?

                      No it doesn't. "Charlottesville Fashion Square" is CFS, not CWC.

                        The employee testimony "proves nothing," yet the fact that you provide a few vaguely related YouTube videos (one of which just so happens to involve one of Chris's trolls years after the fact) that happen to have the Caillou song, and are "creepy" (a subjective opinion) as "evidence" demonstrates a level of hypocrisy on your part.

                        Your ignorance on the "Solid vs. Liquid Chris" situation. You claim that the one nicknamed Liquid was the one whose name was "stolen," yet refused to update your original post when
                        <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/star_boi">
                         @star_boi
                        </a>
                        corrected your error. You also seem entirely oblivious that the nicknames themselves are Metal Gear Solid references, which should have clued you in to who did what.

                     <p>
                      Anyway, you said the link to the bond is "broken." How so? If you downright can't use it, is it any worse than your using sonichu.com, which I can't even get to due to 502 errors?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Also, a quick explainer on "Kiwi Farms:" they are a forum that collects information on the Internet's less savory individuals (called "lolcows," because they are "milked" for lulz), for the sake at laughing at their antics. In this regard, they have served an invaluable role in gathering information on Chris Chan, a well-known lolcow, and the fact that you haven't even come across the website's name once or twice (as a cited source on sonichu.com, which I frequented before the 502 errors) during your research is odd.

                        Well, if you're interested in counterpoints, I'm not sure if I can help you at this point.

                       <p>
                        However, I'd suggest setting up an account on Kiwi Farms yourself to ask on the Christian Weston Chandler subforum for proof (by creating a new thread) that Chris was arrested. Those people will provide plenty of information to help you (although they can seem a bit rude at times; they're trolls, after all, so they don't really mean it).
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Setting up an account involves answering an odd question or two (nothing Pizzagate-related there, it's just their trollish sense of humor).

                          Wouldn't asking them for proof (which they have) help resolve the drama, though? Going by their evidence, it's not as bad as you think.

                           No thank you. I had someone in WorldCorpo named DD tell me they would zap my head, after he called me gayguy, and then I called him decimaldick, so I prefer to stay away from trolls, which you just told me will be on that site. I will take your word for it.

                       The links I posted were not broken when I posted them.  I did state above it is confusing, however I know what I watched. The mall stuff I knew prior, but yesterday I quickly copied the text from Kiwi farms, so that to changed.

            I want to say the current Phoenix program is highly based on mathmatics. I see the word quantum alot to.  There is some very interesting stuff in this Flicker account. You don't need an account just hit play.

            Wow that lhohq was quite a psychadelic ride.  Whoo.  All kinds of messages about Everybody Loves Raymond  CNN   and Rupert Murdoch etc. and plenty of constant flashing.  Don't look too long like I did.  I feel a little dizzy.  Strange.  I looked at this stuff when it was first brought here and not that much of an effect.  Beware.

              No worry. No need to apologize.  I was not scared, just wanted to warn others.  I have looked at others before, don't know why this one had a strange effect on me.

             "Mkultra all of you" yes I know if I ever see a Narwhal I will probably become "triggered" 😊 and the msm does it all day long to the masses.
