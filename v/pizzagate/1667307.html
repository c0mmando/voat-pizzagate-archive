            If the amazing  woman that created this video is reading  this,  my hat is off to you!  Much respect.  Thank you for all you have done!  Hopefully we can get an update to anything new that has happened in the last month since the video was made. I reported a pedophile I found on Facebook to the Guatemalan authorities and he is currently in jail. I thought that was the end of it but I was just contacted by the prosecution Division and they're trying to get me to go to the Washington DC Embassy of Guatemala to make an official statement and release my archives in person.  I think it is complete b******* what they're trying to put the researchers through that are just trying to do a good job for humanity!

             It appears they have all they need from me.  Why drag me into it further  right?  I really hope the lady that made this video gets more answers and it's really disturbing that it takes so much effort to get anything done with these heinous crimes

            So here's a question...since many of us know where confirmed CP exists, why hasn't anyone put up a github with ever updating databases of sha512 hashes of each video/image/whatever?
           </p>
           <p>
            Likewise we could store keywords and such specific to these things and then potentially automate the task of finding this without having to force humans to even look at it.

              Ooh...seems that PhotoDNA has some clients out there...so we could probably find a way to use it...could even autoscan suspected CP pages etc?

             <p>
              Thing is I'm not sure if the API allows for determining if the image is flagged as CP/not.

              I forget where but I also read that Bing's reporting system even tries to automatically blur out the really awful parts of such images so that age verification can be made without having a person be exposed to CP or bestiality.

              I'm a programmer and know how to build something like this, but don't really want to build and host an app that lets people upload CP for hashing :P
             </p>
             <p>
              I guess if there were a tool to hash known cp, and then submit that value to a central DB, that could work. Perhaps require 3 confirmations from a community or something...of course initially each one would require human viewers.
             </p>
             <p>
              Likewise, with AI, it would be smart to take it further and use something like google image search or tineye to find images that appear similar so that different sizes and cropped versions can be located and reported to the feds, too.

               I don't think we should be getting involved with that end of things.  That's a jail sentence waiting to happen.  In any case, as HoneyBee in the video is pointing out, who are we supposed to report our findings to if the system is corrupted ?  Isn't that the real issue here?  CP is being allowed to proliferate - that's what it looks like to me anyway.  Perhaps we should be considering where are the weak points, in terms of publicity and public pressure, to effect systemic change.  Looking at Podesta's recent interview, seeing how information is sometimes scrubbed from the web once it's been discovered and reported in forums like this, and the courting of our population by the public faces within the alt community should indicate that we do have some impact.

                Well, since people such as Honeybee already are (on purpose or not), and since I find that even when I'm browsing normal adult content that I run into things that are very likely cp...
               </p>
               <p>
                I know that bing/ms and google are very responsive to user reports in taking cp out of their results, the source sites often don't go down though (Russian and Commie bloc ones especially - I guess some of them could be FBI honeypots too?), but I do think that NCMEC is ineffective at contacting hosts, getting sites taken down, and getting people arrested.
               </p>
               <p>
                That said when we encounter this nasty stuff it would be nice if at the least MS and Google could provide a place for "potential CP content" sites so that they then can spider them and take appropriate action if necessary. Furthermore since they already have this database I hope that these companies report these directly to the FBI in the future instead of NCMEC because NCMEC just sits on their hands (or is jerking off to the CP if the theories about it being run by pedos is true).
               </p>
               <p>
                Likewise I wish that the anons out there who regularly hunt pedos for the good it does and for the sport of it could have a place to report the exploitation images and videos in an effort to further mitigate them in the future.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think MS provides this service for low cost/free sometims so these photo sites really have no excuse for not using it to at least block such images from their users.

                Even then, though, open source devs could develop similar software for free - it's use wouldn't be strictly for detecing CP as it could be used for tineye like searches and such, too.

                 You have a good point.  I agree, it is clear that NCMEC is ineffective. And we need to make it clear to the sleeping public how bad the problem actually is. I don't know though anything about systems like PhotoDNA.

                  I wonder if Microsoft would consider putting up a portal or out a tool for researchers to use for adding to the CP db, and also a way of reporting to the FBI directly because they and local police are the only ones who seem to care.

                      Thorn doesn’t just sell products to “help” combat child trafficking though, they also facilitate a meeting of various companies’ tech advisors in what is known as the Thorn Tech Task Force. Members of the Task Force include Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Dropbox, Yahoo, Instagram, Tumblr, Imgur and Pinterest (many of whom were caught favoring the Clintons in the recent election). Officially, Thorn merely provides this guideline for the Task Force and doesn’t take an official role.

                      Once the various representatives in the task force go back to work, they collaborate closely with the NCMEC. And they are working with the very hash system that got the NCMEC in hot water for Fourth Amendment violations.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Again, when their hash sharing system catches an image, it is shared only between the companies and the NCMEC. And the recent lawsuit the NCMEC is embroiled in indicates that the companies don’t even look at flagged images themselves. Think about how this could absolve them of liability while also ensuring that no one other than the NCMEC was able to view or access the flagged images.

                     <p>
                      The NCMEC, ICMEC and Thorn all need to be placed under more intense scrutiny and investigation given Thorn’s work with the NCMEC and the NCMEC’s association with AlertSense (where Silsby works) and Koons, who has associations with David Brock and his partner James Alefantis.

            Why is a private organisation involved in this chain ?  It means that they do not have to be transparent.  They are not obligated to respond to genuine public inquiries or provide audited data.  People need to make a lot of noise about this.

             Absolutely! The tax money that's spent on private company's and ngo's who are non-transparent and unaccountable, is something there should be a proper 'public outcry' about. Outsourcing this particular area to the private sector is absolutely outrageous. Who tf

            Excellent work!. TheHoneyBee has brought out another problem - reporting this stuff and getting it to someone who will really investigate. The Brian Podesta connection is also interesting.

             Not surprised she's feeling overwhelmed.  I think she is highlighting a very serious problem here.  The problem we face is systemic and that's really where we should be focusing our efforts.
