<p>He owned a couple of houses with David Brock, opened a 501C3 animal shelter in DE, went to court with Brock AND Alefantis. He\'s been mentioned in several articles - including working with a guy named Bob Harrison for the animal shelter, but that leads to nowhere that I can find. I checked Bob\'s FB (didn\'t find his) and his partner Neil\'s FB - can\'t find a thing about Grey.</p>
<p>This is why I think this guy may be crucial - BECAUSE THERE IS NO PHOTO OF HIM ANYWHERE. He threatened blackmail if David and John didn\'t pay up ($850k). He threatened to call of the right people in media and govt if they didn\'t pay soon. Brock had to sell their house in DE to pay up. When they sold the house, it was ripped completely down and started over again.</p>

<p>And then there is the picture showing Alefantis with Brock in 2002 at Camp Rehoboth (a gay community thing) but Brock was supposed to be with Grey at that time. I don\'t know... </p>
<p>I just have a feeling that between the threats, including contacting the media and Biden, the house they shared being demolished (it sold in 2013 for nearly 2 Million, then it was demolished (WHY??), rebuilt with just a few more sqr feet and was bought again in 2016 for $20k more than it was bought in 2013 - and the last time, it wasn\'t officially listed).</p>

            he doesn't look that old at all in that picture, looks maybe mid-late 20s, and thats 2005, so he can't be older than 40, and that age is in the digital era.

            What a tangled web.  Didn't Grey sue Brock &amp; Alefantis for $170,000 or the return of certain furnishings once shared but owned by Grey? Was this after he got the $850,000 "settlement". How did that suit go? Is it true that Brock is now sueing Grey to get the $850,000 back? Brock could easily be nailed for money laundering and tax evasion -- that he proceeded so confidently means he holds many blackmail cards. Hopefully they will be Trumped.
