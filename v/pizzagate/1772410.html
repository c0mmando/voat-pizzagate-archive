            Part of the $ puzzle?  "Master LL Quant Dual is the name of a UBS client which shared the same postal address as LMR’s office but had a different and unusual name. I discovered trade contracts in the name of Master LL Quant Dual, counterparty UBS bank, in the scans folder of the shared drive, signed by Shane Cullinane. Therefore the claim that Shane Cullinane was not familiar with this entity is clearly a deliberate false statement. I strongly suspect that these contracts are not legitimate trades but may be US dollar payments disguised as trades in exotic currency derivatives, specifically “Non Deliverable Forward” contracts. The existence of all the trading in these instruments was kept secret from me during my time at the firm and these contracts contributed to our profits whilst not being factored into the risk and positions. I know this absolutely for certain as I wrote the bespoke system (referred to elsewhere in the proceedings as Risk Ninja) that calculated all of these. For these trades to exist in secret from me was a strong indication that they were not legitimate. When I investigated the contractual terms and how the market operated in great detail, I became quite convinced that these signed scans were evidence of money laundering on a large scale. There were dozens of these trade contracts in the scans folder with the contracts signed by Shane Cullinane; some on behalf of Master LL Quant Dual and others on behalf of LMR. 160. I was asked to represent a list of the currencies associated with these trades as US dollar in our bespoke system formerly known as Risk Ninja. The system calculated P&amp;L, positions and risk at a position level and across trading books. I can say with total certainty that the currency positions created by the trades in Non Deliverable Forward contributed to the profits, but were not accounted for in positions (they showed up as USD cash) or in the risk, where they were also treated as USD cash. At the time I was told that the repeated appearance of obscure currency positions, for example in Korean Won, was due to a bug in the upstream Sophis system and that actually these should be shown as being US dollars. I do not mean that a currency conversion took place at a conversion rate between the two currencies; I mean that a position of 1 million KRW from the upstream system would be treated as 1 million USD by Risk Ninja. To users of the system they would never see these positions except as USD cash. This was the case for all the currencies that were being traded in these contracts, but the existence of this trading was kept entirely secret from me. I do not believe that the trades that I have seen would make sense in the strategies that they were being booked in, and it is impossible that any legitimate trading should have been kept secret from me given that my bespoke system needed to model all our positions in all instrument types."

            I can say that she is 100% legit, not 99.9% but 100% - and guys I don't think I ever gave 100% to anybody. She is in it for the truth and for the children. She has my backing! 
Craig Sawyer on Alex Jones show was ambivalent regarding the subject of elite pedophile rings but he did a short video not long ago where he did call out the elite satanic cult. That said, after the stunt he pulled I would not trust Alex to tell me the time in a room full of clocks. As with Saywer, he reminds me of Jesse Ventura, ie Navy Seal, Rambo, A big Show a la Ventura's Conspiracy Theory.

            I also trust honeybee, and if you do look up her videos in the new restricted mode they do not pop up. That has been a method for me to weed out the shills from the real people.   Some have really surprised me. I was nervous about Craig Sawyer he was a little bit too good to be true and I am with her on that one. What really got me was how he kept focusing on making a documentary he was so Enthusiastic about shooting it . His focus and Enthustiam really should be on saving the children.

             I have to agree. That is exactly what stuck with me when I watched him speak.  I would have much rather heard about his plan of action, process, target area maybe... but a hell of a lot more than all the crap about the web site that decided to nix the fundraising just before it had reached 50k!

              It's a new option YouTube has introduced. For all people who are sensitive to contradictional" channels,  have now with the option to go to their settings and turn on the street come out that pretty much weeds out all the truth channels. Just another way to censor YouTube

            Honeybee is the real deal.  One by one they're falling --from AJ to Cernovich and maybe JPW--either with bribery, blackmail or threats.  I hope Honeybee stays true.

            NCMEC blocked pretty much anyone tweeting about pizzagate, didn't even have to tweet to NCMEC or mention them. If you've spoke out about pizzagate on Twitter you're probably blocked by them too.

            My take on Craig Sawyer is Jones is looking to replace to role of Joe "Rambo" Biggs.  I am starting to see InfoWars just like CNN. Figureheads reading talking points scripted.from our CIA Project Mockingbird. They are just the alt CNN.  Pedo/pizzagate is white hot.  Thus the new Navy Seal rescues kids Sawyer.  Yeah off the bus with Jones too.

             Too early to castigate Jones and certainly too early too early to judge Sawyer.  My take is the shift away from 'PizzaGate' (as in the MSM definition) - is to protect against MSM attacks and legal threats. They are instead concentrating their efforts on what they CAN prove - actual pedo busts and what is already known and/or provable.
            </p>
            <p>
             I see the lurch to throw Jones under a bus because he has taken a strategic decision as absurd, considering he has done more to expose political compromisation via paedophilia blackmail - over decades - than every one of the members of this forum, added together.

              Yep, none of us should dismiss any talking heads that are in the limelight.  As long as they stay within the course, their methods of approach to target should not matter as long as it furthers the movement of putting a stop to violations of children!

               i don't, but i am not running a massive truth organisation which the Globalists are itching to use any excuse to shut down as a precedent to take down all alt media. If Jones has to pick his battles and swerve CPP but focus on the wider PedoGate - much as it pisses me off - so be it. We all play our part. Nobody can deny Jones has done more to wake people up than just about anyone, and he's been covering elite pedo blackmail rings since long before 90% of this community were even aware of it

                I always look at the timing. This was a coordinated effort. Jones is a pied piper, takes us round and round leading us nowhere. He was anti police, suddenly he is pro police (pedo enabllers), he was exposing false flags, it's back to Islamic 'terrort', he was exposing the fallacy of tge left-right paradigm - he sold out completely to one side - and now his hero Trump has launched an attack on a sovereign Nation of Syria based on an idiotic hoax - exactly what Hillary would have done.
