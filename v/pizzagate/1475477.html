<p><strong>So I\'m just gonna stick to posting single facts.</strong></p>
<p>Here\'s a fact for you guys.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So Mrs L, is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5b7rzo/sick_tamera_luzzatto_offering_her_children_to/">here</a>uld like to)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mrs. L, Owns a moving company that doesn\'t seem to exist..
<a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/wa/delighter-moving-services-inc.html">Here</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>More sources in a second... Settle down. I just feel inclined to hammer the point that my source was accurate in my last post too, and I\'m still pissed at the top voted comment that says we should listen to arkansas.gov site instead.</em></p>
<p>Well I should Clarify, It\'s actually Mrs L\'s Husband. Mr. LE<br />
<a href="http://www.mlstrategies.com/professionals/david-leiter.htm">here</a></p>
<p>Oh, And for those that didn\'t know. House of Cards Was based on Mrs L, and MR LE, despite the many assumptions in was shill n bill.</p>
<p>And If You\'re gonna say: 
<em>SO what, what does owning a moving company have to do with anything.</em>  
</p>
<p>Or the Better <em>yeah but still</em> </p>
<p>Nah, This is another Company they\'d prefer you to not know about it... And AGAIN. Just as I showed In my last few posts, There is No record of the Packing company that shill bill, and frank run.</p>
<p><strong>Here are my sources. Multiple, since When I talked about The moving company that the Clinton run In my past post.  Some people said My info was wrong, and the .GOVarkansas site, was the only site that mattered. So since the Presidents home state said &quot;Nope, no sketch companies for the Clinton.</strong></p>
<p>But Yeah, I proved my sources were most likely more accurate than the site that bill and hillary have ties to, and most likely knows everyone who controls that website... And again, It was only 3 cf filings in question... Out of the DOZENS But here\'s multiple sources.</p>
<p>This is the source I used In my first post, and will continue to use, Because it has not been wrong about any information it\'s provided.  It did provide different Information than the STATE of Arkansas Though... but only around a few sketch companies. I made a long post actually detailing proof that they are wrong, But decided against posting in since I feel like most people know .gov is worthless but like I said... the few cunts get to me.[here]</p>
