            Dahmer had a victim escape mid torture and run to the police who returned a 15 year old boy bloody and in his underwear to his murderer after begging them for help. We cant expect these freemason scum to police themselves. It wont happen. Day of rope is the only solution. A final solution if you will...

            "Police missed a string of opportunities over a period of four years to stop the rock star Ian Watkins from committing depraved sex attacks on children and babies, a watchdog has concluded.
           </p>
           <p>
            Six people came forward to make allegations against Watkins, the lead singer of Lostprophets, before he was finally arrested and jailed for 35 years, the report from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found.
           </p>
           <p>
            On one occasion a simple check of a mobile phone owned by one of Watkins’s ex-girlfriends when she made a complaint about him would have revealed a message that spelled out his interest in sex with children, the IPCC said."
           </p>
           <p>
            Wales cops, like English cops and Irish cops -- and ALL cops worldwide -- are chock full of Freemasons.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also a pedo freak but more renown for his serial killing, Jeffrey Dahmer had "allegations" made against him over a 15-year period. He was processed by multiple different local and state agencies and always given a pass or a light tap on the wrist.  Later they claimed that he "flew under the radar," which is an outright LIE.  He was alphabet trained (CIA), as were MANY musicians (see Laurel Canyon) like Ian Watkins.. Maybe Watkins is Tavistock / MI5/6.
