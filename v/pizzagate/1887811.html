<p>Great summary. I have been on it since the Wikileak emails and  Daily Mail 2010 article about Larua Silsby smuggling kids out of Haiti from the very orphanage that was run by Comet Ping Pong Owner James Alifantis\' lawyer Max Maccoby and his father Micheal Maccoby. (What are the odds). Just recently Seth Rich\'s parents hired a private detective and already on Fox 5 news broke that the Police officer Robninson who was at the scene of the murder went in fact to Georgetown University where Podesta taught and, Robinson\'s sister worked for HRC! Seth Rich was the one who leaked the pedo-gate emails. Trump fired Comey because he was compromised (evidence that Comey was also one of Jeffrey Epstein\'s occasional visitors).  As for the Russians, who know, if they have the evidence on the US politicians, that will be the end of American\'s dominance. Time for Trump to drain the swamp. Since his election, there had been over 4000 arrests, during 2014 (Obama) only 400 for the entire year. So fingers crossed, those monsters may face justice after all. Absolute degeneracy. Great video, very compact encapsulating the whole picture, very succinct.&quot;</p>',
