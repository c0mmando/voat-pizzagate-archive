<p>but the story and connections go deeper than only the Fugees rapper Pras Michel being indicted for funneling $21.6M in illegal foreign donations to Barry Soetoro. The money was allegedly/apparently first paid to him by Jho Low, a Chinese businessman and scam artist ... either that or an identical amount mysteriously was given to Michel who gave the exact same amount to Soetoro. If we follow that logic, right after that chain of events, another random act took place which was the awarding of a forty-year lease to second largest port in Long Beach by the Soetoro administration to this same gentlemen. </p>
<p>Voat has long been all over shipping containers and their many uses for hiding things that some people in this society want shipped. So it\'s very disturbing to find out about this and that Soetoro\'s administration was giving suspect businessmen these types of open-ended situations to do with what they liked. And since we need to back claims, here\'s one such submission to Voat about shipping containers and the tie-in with human trafficking: </p>

<p>With that out of the way, let\'s begin at the first claim which is about the indictment of Michel Pras: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://davidharrisjr.com/politics/rapper-indicted-for-funneling-21-6-million-in-illegal-foreign-donations-to-obama-in-2012/">https://davidharrisjr.com/politics/rapper-indicted-for-funneling-21-6-million-in-illegal-foreign-donations-to-obama-in-2012/</a></p>
<p>As you are probably aware, foreigners and foreign companies are forbidden by law to contribute to political campaigns. They are especially not allowed to funnel 21.6 million dollars from foreign donors to a campaign. The feds indicted Pras Michel, a rapper for the group ‘The Fugees’ on Friday for funneling tens of millions of dollars to the 2012 Obama reelection fund. Jho Low was indicted last year on conspiracy charges related to a scam from which he will be facing charges that he bilked investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars. Low provided the money to Pras Michel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This pretty well documents the summary of what took place. But there is a more in-depth look on the second claim which is that the forty-year lease was awarded to this alleged scam artist: </p>

<p>Before I start this article, I want to make one thing clear. I am not accusing anyone of wrongdoing, although the facts I am laying out should be investigated just to make sure there wasn’t any wrongdoing. In 2012, the Obama administration okayed a forty year lease for a Chinese company to take over America’s second largest automated container port in Long Beach, California. Coincidentally or not, that very same year Chinese Businessman Jho Low provided 21.6 million dollars to rapper, Pras Michel of The Fugees, which he was then in turn supposed to funnel into Obama’s reelection campaign. Michel has been indicted for that crime and Low is still at large.</p>

<p>So there we have it. Either we believe these were random and unrelated ... coincidental ... serendipitous ... at this point is in the eye of the beholder. But it is curious. What is more curious is a pic that appeared. It was posted by Q. This is NOT a Q post. I am decidedly up in the air about the validity of him and am not a fan, but I did remember something about a pic of Long Beach. I did a search and sure enough: </p>

<p>Could this pic have been posted for the above reason? Let everyone know they were onto what was going on? And in terms of Long Beach, it has been targeted as a port of drug trafficking and human/sex trafficking that includes minors. To prove that, I\'ll post a pic of the Long Beach Task Force FB page and a pic taken from it: </p>

<p>Well, I\'d say that\'s pretty clear. And since there\'s supposed to be eight degrees of separation, in this particular case, there\'s only one. Seems the producer of a Fugee\'s video is a convicted pedophile. Yup, scum that impregnated his own daughters. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>In case you haven\'t noticed, the ages of his children are nowhere to be found in the article. Because this is pizzagate and because this is about child/sexual abuse, I went in search of what ages his children were. What I found out was that at least one was EIGHT YEARS OLD. </p>

<ul>
<li>Aziza Kibibi was 8-years-old when her father, Aswad Ayinde, started sexually abusing her</li>
<li>Ayinde, also known as Charles McGill, won an MTV award for directing The Fugees\' \'Killing Me Softly\'</li>
<li>Ayinde was recently sentenced to a combined 90 years in prison for sexually abusing Kibibi and another one of his daughters</li>
<li>During his years abusing Kibibi she had five children out of incest</li>
<li>Kibibi was eventually able to escape and now lives with her husband in East Orange, New Jersey where she runs her own baking business </li>
</ul>
<p>Now the Doomsday scenario is getting commonplace amongst this cabal. So commonplace that one would suspect that he would have talked to someone about this, wouldn\'t you think? Like maybe discuss it on the set of .... oh, say ... a video, maybe? You know that downtime invites chatter about what people have been up to lately. </p>
<p>But I do believe this port in Long Beach could be a huge lead. Find out who\'s connected to it and you might get info on who\'s involved. Maybe even keep track of the arrests. That would be a pretty good way of tracking things also. </p>
<p>I hope to get my next post up shortly. It\'s involved with a very strange item about Satanism that the press has not picked up on. I wonder why?</p>',

           Now the Doomsday scenario is getting commonplace amongst this cabal. So commonplace that one would suspect that he would have talked to someone about this, wouldn't you think? Like maybe discuss it on the set of .... oh, say ... a video, maybe? You know that downtime invites chatter about what people have been up to lately.

           But I do believe this port in Long Beach could be a huge lead. Find out who's connected to it and you might get info on who's involved. Maybe even keep track of the arrests. That would be a pretty good way of tracking things also.

           I hope to get my next post up shortly. It's involved with a very strange item about Satanism that the press has not picked up on. I wonder why?

             Obama Didnt Even Pick His Cabinet, CITIBANK DID
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In a John Podesta email revealed by Wikileaks, one month before the Presidential election of 2008, the Wall Street giant Citibank submitted to the Obama campaign a list of its preferred candidates for cabinet positions in an Obama administration. This list corresponds almost exactly to the eventual composition of Barack Obama’s cabinet.
            </p>
            <p>
             The email was written by Michael Froman, who was then an executive with Citigroup and currently serves as US trade representative.

            That's interesting because I started all of this because I was looking further into the Obama, Fugees, shipping containers and Haiti ... more to come..

             Thanks for putting in so much time on this. I get overwhelmed and don't seem to be able to scrape together the time I need to really investigate what I'd like. I'm going to try this weekend. There are a couple of things that keep buzzing around that I would like to dig into and see if they pan out. One I just stumbled across in looking for something else and concerns The Fugees.
            </p>

             Thanks again.

               Yeah, after watching the Project Veritas video, I'm not sure what the search means.

               It could be that the ML Unfairness didn't want you to get results from "Acorn Logistics" and diverted it to a "fair" search that no one uses.

           <pre><code>Maersk and IBM aim to get 10 million shipping containers onto global supply blockchain by year-end
</code></pre>
           <p>
            'In carrying out a test case using avocados from Mombasa to Rotterdam, IBM calculated the cost of the movement of the shipping container itself was about $2000. '
           </p>
           <p>
            'Of the 70 million containers shipped each year, the goal is get 10 million of them on this blockchain by year-end, said IBM. Container shipping equals about half the value of all maritime trade – a large chunk of global GDP. IBM reckons that going entirely digital could save shipping carriers about $38bn per year. '

            Yikes.   avocados and I remember something about guac (which has a nasty connotation I believe).  Block chains I do not get.  Just FYI.

            Been following this acct for awhile and saw this info being dumped. Lots of names as well. Something about Gov using “gifted and talented kids” in experiments. Very bizarre stuff to dig thru
           </p>
           <p>
            The reason for that post has been scrubbed.  The link is gone but there is very valuable info in the comments by Commoner etc.  about trafficking and shipping containers.  There must be some serious trafficking crimes going on in Long Beach if the info is scrubbed.  Also some Big Honchos involved.    There is the name of Steven Kessler a producer mentioned by Commoner.

            </p>
            <p>
             This is scary stuff. I tell you, I'm never so happy that our POTUS is in office as when I read info like this. Gives me shivers and shakes. What in God's name are they doing? Who are the victims and why is law enforcement not stopping this. I absolutely believe our POTUS is trying. He is not perfect, but he is not a child torturer either. He is not a member of the elite cabal although people have tried to smear him with that label.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, many thanks for your digging. I'll try to add this to the OP. It deserves to be seen.

              The reason LE (law enforcement) doesn't stop this is because many of them have been bought off or are guilty themselves.  Yes, the ones that we tell Our Children to go to when in trouble, Officer Friendly.  Sad and Sick.

            December 27, 2018 - A few days before Christmas, the container ship “SM Shanghai” was steaming toward California’s Port of Long Beach. Just ahead and coming to the end of an 11-day journey from China, the “Ever Lucent” was headed for the nearby Port of Los Angeles, where the “Thomas Jefferson” was preparing to sail in the opposite direction for Xiamen.
           </p>
           <p>
            The global economy, in other words, was chugging along nicely on one of the world’s busiest sea lanes.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, President Donald Trump’s assault on globalization has had a paradoxical effect on world trade flows. A rush to get ahead of new and higher tariffs, particularly on U.S. imports from China, has motivated retailers and other American companies to increase orders, which has helped boost volumes at the country’s ports.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The warehouse and distribution centers are full in southern California,” said Phillip Sanfield, a Port of Los Angeles spokesman. “We’re experiencing some logistical issues at the San Pedro ports just because there’s so much cargo in play here.”

            US security concerns force Cosco-owned Orient Overseas to sell Long Beach port in California
           </p>
           <p>
            A Hong Kong-based company has been forced to sell its American container port after the US government raised security concerns about its parent being a Chinese state-owned shipping giant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Orient Overseas (International), which is majority-owned by Cosco Shipping Holdings, will sell off its entire interest in Long Beach Container Terminal in California for US$1.78 billion (HK$13.97 billion) in cash, according to a stock exchange filing on Tuesday morning.
           </p>
           <p>
            But its sale to Cosco in July 2017 for HK$49.23 billion raised a red flag with US security agencies, which were unhappy with the idea of a state-owned firm taking indirect ownership of a major port. Cosco now owns 75 per cent of OOIL.
           </p>
           <p>
            After lengthy negotiations, OOIL and Cosco signed the agreement with the US Departments of Homeland Security and jJustice, promising to sell the terminals to “a suitable, unrelated third party” deemed “acceptable” to the US department.
           </p>
           <p>
            The second largest port by volume, Long Beach imported 6.8 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units) in 2016, more than New York and second only to Los Angeles, according to data from the World Shipping Council.
           </p>
           <p>
            The buyer was identified on Tuesday as an unlisted North American fund called Macquarie Infrastructure Partners (MIP).
           </p>
           <p>
            MIP is managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, one of the world’s biggest asset managers with A$185.9 billion (US$130.91 billion) assets in infrastructure, real estate, agriculture and energy. It is part of the Sydney-headquartered financial conglomerate Macquarie Group.

           </p>
           <p>
            OOIL’s share price rose 3.5 per cent to close at HK$53 on Tuesday after the deal was announced in the morning, while its controlling shareholder Cosco Shipping gained 1.1 per cent to close at HK$3.65. The broader Hang Seng Index fell by 0.7 per cent.
           </p>
           <p>
            “The announcement of the buyer for the Long Beach Terminal is positive to both OOIL and Cosco Shipping as it removes the uncertainties about who will buy the assets,” said Jeffrey Chan, a founding partner of Hong Kong-based Oriental Patron Financial Group. “The deal also provides cash for the company to do other expansion of ports or its shipping businesses.”

            Every once in awhile we hear about people trying to move groups of people illegally between countries in shipping containers. Some even go so far as to set up a 40’container like a small apartment in an attempt to bring someone in to the United States illegally. Others just try to cross through boarder crossings as if a standard international shipment. Either way, it is not only illegal, but dangerous to national security as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other instances can include smuggling people in that would not normally be allowed through US borders. Maybe they are drug and arms dealers or maybe they are wanted on a terrorist list and are a threat to national security. People have been found as stowaways on container ships as well as in the backs of drayage trucks moving from the ports.

            13 people suffocate in Libya shipping container tied to human traffickers: aid group
           </p>
           <p>
            The locked container was transported from the central town of Bani Walid to Khoms in western Libya, from where the migrants were to be taken across the Mediterranean.
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is happening in Libya, it is happening on the shores of Long Beach one of the largest ports.

             Thanks for this. Lots of names to track down. Looks like our POTUS has targeted where the problems are. And with this port shut down, the options for the elite cabal grow slimmer.

             I wonder if this is one of the reasons I didn't get Q. I mean, it would seem he was taunting Soetoro. That could be the reason why I never know WTH he's talking about or referring to. I'm not meant to know at the time, it's meant to unnerve the elite. 
I'll have to think about that.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks again. Stellar work.

             PetroSaudi Has Lost $130 Million Venezuela Dispute - After UK Court Cited 'Fraudulent Actions' !
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             PetroSaudi’s evident financial problems go back to accusations of malpractice by the Government of Venezuela, which is refusing to pay for oil extracted by the company pending arbitration on this issue, Sarawak Report can confirm.
            </p>
            <p>
             The company, which had launched operations in Venezuela thanks to a huge cash input from Malaysia’s 1MDB development fund, attempted to by-pass these accusations by exacting a stand-by letter of credit from a Venezuelan Bank, which cited that the government must pay the company, whether or not there were disputes to be settled.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, when the matter came before the UK High Court (which had jurisdiction over the credit agreement) the Judge ruled against PetroSaudi Oil Services (POS) on grounds of fraud by its then Director and Legal Counsel, none other than the ex-White &amp; Case lawyer Tim Buckland, who helped mastermind the 1MDB heist by Jho Low.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is a devastating indictment of Buckland, who appears to have resigned all his directorships in July of 2015 (although owing to the company’s overdue filings of its accounts this cannot be confirmed).
            </p>
            <p>
             It also means that PetroSaudi was not able to extract the $130 million that it was hoping to get out of the Venezuelan Novo Bank, despite its dispute with the authorities in that country. This would seem to explain the group’s warning in belated accounts that it might not be able to service the $16.3 millions dollars in debts owed by one of its** London subsidiaries PetroSaudi Energy &amp; Trading (UK) Ltd, which has ceased trading.**

            PETALING JAYA: The Kleptocrats, a documentary on the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) scandal, has made its debut this week at the 2018 Doc NYC, an annual documentary festival.
           </p>
           <p>
            Directed by Britons Sam Hobkinson and Havana Marking, the 86-minute documentary tells the story of the scandal and those connected to it, including former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, businessman and now fugitive Jho Taek Low, and Hollywood celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
           </p>
           <p>
            It also follows the investigations conducted by journalists from publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Hollywood Reporter, who worked to uncover the scandal.
           </p>
           <p>
            In a review on Screendaily, film critic Allan Hunter wrote that “interviews with (then-opposition) politician Tony Pua, political cartoonist Zunar and activist (now MP) Maria Chin Abdullah remind us that a great story was also a national tragedy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The executive producers of the documentary include Alex Soros, the son of billionaire George Soros.

             Is the documentary meant to distance Soros and pals from the stink, or is it's purpose to throw some under the bus while creating a narrative spin? Both? Guess we will have to wait until it is available to the public.

             Soros is the man behind the curtain. Has his hands in all this propaganda. It just leaves me to wonder why this propaganda was crafted? What disinfo was meant to get out and deceive?

             This is about controlling the narrative.  The scandal was and is HUGE.. and now it's been touted as 'money laundering'... it's about far more than that as my link to the other post tries to point out.

             Sure they did.  People were picking up the story on international websites while it was being downplayed in the US.. When they could no longer contain the story up step our intrepid left media to 'come to the rescue'.  Note that Jho Low was allowed to get away.

            <p>
             THIS IS ABOUT FAR MORE THAN MONEY LAUNDERING.

               There are formidable interests hoping to do business on the island if the challenge fails. The Hollywood actor Robert De Niro has a stake in a company, Paradise Found Nobu Resort, that plans to build a large luxury tourist resort there...The $250m (£192m) De Niro resort has the backing of the Antigua and Barbuda government, but local organisations have already voiced their anger at the prospective construction.

               Tavistock Institute from Hell
The Tavistock Institute was fincanced by the Rockefeller Foundation and is a research program involved in human behavior, social sciences, and psychology. What it really does is implement psychological torment on those who expose corruption in society. Today the Tavistock Institute is covertly involved with social networking sites, alternative media, and conspiracy forums. The USAF and DARPA run covert programs on the internet using research developed from the Tavistock Institute. Their goal is mass manipulation of society through social networking and psychological torture on those researching "conspiracy" or on those opposing the criminals running society. The word "Conspiracy Theorist" is a term these criminals created as a form of neuro-linguistic programming to automatically discredit those that research or investigate criminality. The Tavistock Clinic is stationed in London and is directly involved with the British government and the House of Windsor. The United States Department of Defense and intelligence agencies are infiltrated by British Crown knights and Freemasons working for the British Crown. Usually mentioning the word "Tavistock" on a conspiracy website will get you banned immediately. The websites Conspiracy Outpost, Godlike Productions, and Lunatic Outpost are entirely Tavistock operations. The moderators Cinnamon and UKshep on Conspiracy Outpost are highly trained Tavistock agents and extremely sadistic. Cinnamon is a psychotic child murdering Amazon-feminist and electronic gang stalker. Craig Oxley is a high level member of the Tavistock Institute which was financed by the Rockefeller Foundation and one of his agents is Ed from Outer Light. There is a statue of Prometheus at Rockefeller Plaza. Craig Oxley's site states on its header "Support the Promethians." David Rockefeller Jr. and the Rockefeller Foundation are involved in financing Tavistock's agendas. Rockefeller Jr. is pure evil and he needs to be hunted down and executed. The Russell, Parsons, Carnegie, and Spencer families in the United Kingdom are also covert managers of the Tavistock Institute. The Carnegies created the Carnegie Mellon University which is involved in technologies including human-computer interaction and cognitive sciences. The Carnegies develop electronic torture systems. John D Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie were both friends and rivals. The Carnegies are currently a British nobility headed up by David Carnegie the 4th Duke of Fife and his sons Charles Duff Carnegie the Earl of Southesk, George William Carnegie, and Hugh Alexander Carnegie. The Carnegies are ruthless and evil.

               Andrew Russell the 15th Duke of Bedford and Marquess of Tavistock is the top overseer of the Tavistock Institute and he is worth over 500 million. Andrew Russell is one of the most evil beings on the planet. The Russell family also co-founded Yale University and Skull and Bones which is a military death cult that uses electronic weapons like voice to skull torture. The Bush family are top members of Skull and Bones and work with the Tavistock Institute and command the use of voice to skull torment technologies. Its not all electronic. This has been going on for thousands of years before electronics existed. The Tavistock Group is an international investment firm headquartered in the British Crown's commonwealth of the Bahamas. Tavistock Group is owned by the Lewis family with Joe Lewis and they also have a charitable foundation connected with their investment firm. Joe Lewis is worth about 5 billion and was a business associate of George Soros and they both made billions on Black Wednesday. They use their billions to finance criminal agendas like Tavistock's psychological torture programs or social mind control programs. Charities are often used as a disguise for criminal pay offs. The Tavistock Institute is pure evil and involved with ruthless mind control and has the entire internet running brain reading software developed by DARPA. Dr Eliat Aram, Robert Branagh, Joel Featherman, Joanna Hill, Julie Newlan, Christopher Warhurst, Alice Long, and Cliff Oswick are all Council members of the Tavistock Institute and also lawless criminals. Major "Alternative Media" outlets are part of the FBI's COINTELPRO operation or similar agencies and programs intended to infiltrate political organizations in order to disrupt, subvert, and radicalize them. Some start out legitimate and later become compromised. They operate as fishing nets drawing in opposition. The entire inter-net is used like a net and managed by criminal hacking groups connected with military and intelligence agencies. Anonymous is a COINTELPRO group created by the CIA and NSA. The legitimate opposition that they cannot manipulate are targeted and persecuted. The government works with privatized organizations like Stratfor Intelligence which gather information on the legitimate opposition. Infowars uses Stratfor.
              </p>
              <p>
               These groups are then connected with secret societies which covertly carry out persecution for payment. Secret Societies use criminal style initiations to incorporate its members so that they can blackmail members if they try to turn against them. Secret Societies are organized crime groups and include Jesuits, Freemasons, Knights of Columbus, Chabad, fraternities, sororities and they work with less organized and unofficial groups like Wiccan cults, and New Age cults. Facebook and smart devices use Tavistock brain reading software as part of their social engineering program. Organized religion is also involved including Christian Churches and especially the Church of Latter Day Saints. Freemasons and Jesuit agents at the Department of Defense work with the British Tavistock Institute and run COINTELPRO like operations based on psychological programs developed by the Tavistock Institute. The Tavistock Institute works with MI6 headed up by Alex Younger and MI5 headed up by Andrew Parker. These agencies work with the CIA and USAF. They are involved with most of the major alternative media outlets like Godlike Productions, Lunatic Outpost, Conspiracy Outpost, David Icke Forum, Infowars, Reddit Conspiracy, and DiscloseTV. Alternative media channels like these use brain reading software along with disinformation agents that gather intel on people who speak out. American Intelligence Media is a very evil Cointelpro-Tavistock alternative media operation. They hire commenters to dictate the narrative and gatekeepers to target people who disrupt their programs. Their goal is to understand and control the minds of their opposition. They are also involved in electronic harassment. They develop Alternative Media programs or themes like QAnon which are intended to distract, undermine, and misdirect the opposition against corruption. The ones involved in these Tavistock operations are ruthless sadists and all out criminals.

               The ‘psycho-electronic’ type of mind control I’m discussing here is the covert, around the clock harassment of innocent citizens living in their homes and communities, and is currently world wide in scope. This harassment includes electronic mind/body attacks, street harassment skits, destruction of family and other relationships and destruction of careers.
              </p>
              <p>
               One especially invasive attack method in the arena of ‘psycho-electronic’ mind control is ‘voice to skull’. Voice to skull is the transmission of voice, or any other audible or subliminal sound, directly into the hearing sense of the mind control victim. This is sometimes done around the clock and can be one of the severest forms of torture. Voice to skull technology is sometimes referred to as “synthetic telepathy”.

                 re: rockefellers funding Tavistock. They probably have, but the foundation was created by the British military/Government Psychologists in the 1920's to study hypnosis and PTSD in soldiers. Idk if Rockefellers are "financing" Tavistock, or one of many channels by which money is funneled to the foundation

                   In part I &amp; II ...We looked at a brief history of how they were developed for the purpose of helping soldiers that suffered shell shock (PTSD) after WWI. When they learned how successful trauma was for molding individuals, they went right to work. Dr. Karl Lewin, who was the head of OSS, the precursor to the CIA, headed up things in the US. This trauma based mind control philosophy is partly attributable to Theodor Adorno's, Authoritarian Personality, although there are other influences as well. The key to their control technique is trauma followed by very subtle psychological influences. Using Freudian psychotherapy to induce a permanent state of mental illness the identity of the subject is effectively erased. Once the mind is "opened" up, the web of Tavistock driven organizations go to work. Before we look into how Tavistock works in more detail and how it relates to almost everything that happens (even Pizzagate), we should look at who exactly the Tavistock actors in America are.

                    It is axiomatic that no organization works without funding, so in addition to the American taxpayer footing most of the bill, there are other financial interests at work here also. One of the biggest contributors is the Rockefeller Foundation. Also, George Soros and his friend and business partner in the Tavistock Group, Joe Lewis. The Tavistock Group is an investment front based in the Bahamas that, along with Soros, made a fortune crashing the British Pound.

                  <p>
                   Gregory Bateson (9 May 1904 – 4 July 1980) was an English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, visual anthropologist, semiotician, and cyberneticist whose work intersected that of many other fields. In the 1940s, he helped extend systems theory and cybernetics to the social and behavioral sciences. He spent the last decade of his life developing a "meta-science" of epistemology to bring together the various early forms of systems theory developing in different fields of science.[2] His writings include Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1972) and Mind and Nature (1979). Angels Fear (published posthumously in 1987) was co-authored by his daughter Mary Catherine Bateson.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   ..Although initially reluctant to join the intelligence services, Bateson served in OSS during World War II along with dozens of other anthropologists.[20] He was stationed in the same offices as Julia Child (then Julia McWilliams), Paul Cushing Child, and others.[21] He spent much of the war designing 'black propaganda' radio broadcasts. He was deployed on covert operations in Burma and Thailand, and worked in China, India, and Ceylon as well.

             Is this a counter narrative, or is this Malaysia thing a justification for regime change?

             <p>
              Roland Fong
AUGUST 15, 2017 AT 4:20 AM
I am somewhat surprised that an institution such as Yale would risk its reputation by publishing such an article which has no foundation in the truth. It repeats allegations which the DoJ under a discredited administration (under Hillary Clinton and Obama) pursued on behalf of the Clinton Global Initiative and George Soros’s open societies Regime Change initiative of which Bersih and others like them in Malaysia are recipients of their generous funding.
             </p>
             <p>
              Firstly and most important of all the allegations is the allegation of money laundering and its nexus to the prime minister and other Malaysian officials in charge of the 1MDB fund. Why would they have to launder the money if they are so powerful and ready to abuse that power? Could they not have simply issued invoices for investments fictitious or real against 1MDb and then taken the money against those invoices.
             </p>
             <p>
              Money laundering at this level does not require any sophisticated plan. It is off the shelf stuff that many including the US Central Intelligence Agency often uses in order to shift money throughout the world for their clandestine operations.
             </p>
             <p>
              Stranger still, the US using the over reach in international law supported by their military might, appears to appropriate to itself the jurisdiction of a country whose government refused to kow tow to the ambitious Clinton Global Initiative and its coffers to elect a failed HIllary Clinton into the US presidency.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thus far apart from its far reaching powers domestically to seize the assets of anyone without proof of wrong doing, the DoJ has showed no admissible evidence of any wrong doing by the Malaysian government which could trigger its rights under any law other than the kleptocracy initiative (not applicable in Malaysia) to do anything other than to pillage the assets of a sovereign nation.
             </p>
             <p>
              Perhaps we ought to wait till a competent court within the USA has the courage to bring Hillary and people like Loretta Lynch to justice. Then we will truly know why the swamp needs to be drained.

              you think this Richard fong is attempting to control the narrative as well?
             </p>
             <p>
              the points about the Obama DOJ (lynch) beginning the investigation/first seizing the assets is confusing.
             </p>
             <p>
              why would Obama's doj initiate an investigation that would later implicate him?

               <p>
                Since 2007, Bersih, an association of NGOs calling itself the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections, staged three street protests in which thousands of yellow-clad demonstrators took to the streets in Kuala Lumpur demanding electoral reform. After coming under heavy scrutiny for obfuscating funding sources, Bersih coalition leader Ambiga Sreenevasan admitted that her organization receives funding from the National Democratic Institute and the Open Society Institute. Sreenevasan herself has been the recipient of the US State Department’s Award for International Women of Courage, and was present in Washington DC in 2009 to receive the award directly from the hands of Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. While Sreenevasan’s organization claimed to be non-partisan and apolitical, members of Malaysia’s political opposition openly endorsed the movement, and some were even present at the demonstrations.

Well represented on voat.pizzagate. Fascists are polar opposite to liberals. And being liberal has nothing to do with the democratic party or clintons.

               Fascists are NOT of the right. They are actually of the authoritarian LEFT. Don’t fall for the gaslighting.
              </p>
              <p>
               Fascism aka National Socialism is actually a sub type of SOCIALISM. The idea was created by a man named Giovanni Gentille. One of the man’s chief influences was KARL MARX. Note the leftist rhetoric of throwing away individual rights for the sake of the state.

               The post is there. If you like it fine. If you don't, that's fine also. As far as everything else, I don't do personal attacks. I just block people because the name calling is fairly ridiculous. So you've said whatever it is you said. Anymore, and I block. It's your call.

              It's an EXAMPLE, WOMAN.  There's almost TEN MILLION PEOPLE in LA County. There's every kind of trafficking you can imagine but they're not pizzagate-related, even if they arrived on water in the vicinity of a JewAnon picture.  I don't know how much simpler I can explain this.

             The question for me is whether Soetoro was still receiving payments from Low. In other words, were profits from this port being funneled in some way? That's the number one question I'd want answered.

              Possibly the profits were if Lo has vanished. You know that port was sold like last week. It is now under US control.
