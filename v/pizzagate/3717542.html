<p>Madonna just tweeted a Food-Code video.</p>

<p>WTF Madonna? &quot;Pasta&quot; reminded me of this email which helped launch Pizzagate 4 years ago:</p>

<p>So I searched John Podesta\'s emails on Wikileaks for &quot;Fried Fish&quot;...</p>

<p>Notable Mentions: James Alefantis, Fried Fish, Edible Academy, Ed\'s Fish and Pizza</p>
<blockquote>
<p>YOU are headlining a finance event in support of Hillary for America at the home of Tony Podesta. Tony was the driving force behind this event. The purpose of the event is to raise money from Tony’s network and engage a different set of supporters involved in the Washington, DC metro area food scene. This event is expected to raise $75,000.</p>
<p>Tony was very interested in hosting a cooking fundraising event <em>similar to the event he hosted last October with <strong>Chef James Alefantis</strong></em>, Chef Amy Brandwein and Chef Massimo Fabbri. Carla Hall is a personal friend of Frank and Sylvia White.  They brought her on board to help him host a food-focused fundraiser. </p>
<p>Carla Hall and I speculate that churchyards might indeed be the ultimate origin of this seemingly odd triumvirate of food. Fish frys have long been popular as a tasty and affordable meal for large gatherings. Logistically it can be prepared and served fresh out of the fryer in large batches, and it\'s easier and quicker than something such as fried chicken or barbecue. Spaghetti, too, is cheap and easy, and slaw, well, that just has to go on everything in the South.</p>
<p>Add some pickles, mustard (because ketchup would be gross), onions and hot sauce and it\'s a done deal. Fried fish may be a pan-Southern dish, and versions like this have been found as far away as South Carolina, but this particular amalgamation is rooted deeply in Nashville. </p>
<p>We get back in the car and head over to Ed\'s Fish and Pizza, arguably the oldest established fish sandwich joint in town, open since 1972. At 3 p.m. on a Friday it\'s busy, with cars snaking around back to the window and a steady pilgrimage through the front door. Loyalty, like grease, hangs in the air. To a person, they all declare Ed\'s &quot;the best.&quot;Owner Anthony Drumwright avoids questions and points me to a customer sitting at the small counter, saying, &quot;These people are repeaters.&quot;</p>

            I read a few of the Podesta emails when they were first revealed and thought that if they weren't coded instructions they were some sort of fey (precious or campy) British writing from 100 years ago, full of sly in-jokes.

           <p>
            Unless this is now standard bureaucratese in DC, the email above from Milia Fisher reads like instructions for a state dinner for His Satanic Majesty: "At precisely 00:00:00 hours YOU will draw YOUR dagger and plunge it deep into the heart of the spaghetti. Raise the spaghetti above your head and present it to His Majesty (who will be seated one meter away and 45 degrees to YOUR left) with a deep bow, which YOU will hold for three seconds.

             Madonna was born Catholic and I believe is wearing a crucifix in that awful video put out on Friday. Catholics, mindful of the suffering Jesus bore in his flesh on Good Friday, fast from meat on Fridays during Lent. This is a worldwide practice that has been in practice since the very earliest days of the Church in the First Century. So yes, it does make sense in context.

             There is a possibility the Hollyweirdos are speaking in code. Madonna has been writing gibberish on a Corona typewriter, and Tom Hanks also made several odd tweets last week, including one referencing working on a Corona typewriter. Meanwhile Ellen posted a video of herself on a phone call where she told a friend she's been "doing her magic." She had very creepy art reminiscent of Spirit Cooking on the wall in the same room. It made me kind of wonder if they are "doing magic", if typing on "Corona" typewriters is meant to somehow worsen the pestilence currently wracking the world.

             On Twitter, there was speculation that Fish Fry = False Flag.
            </p>
            <p>
             There's also the logical explanation that these aging narcissists are behaving cryptically because their narcissistic supply has been cut off and they are starved for attention. :-)
