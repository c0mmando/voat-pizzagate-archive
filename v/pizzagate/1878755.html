<p>Wilfred Bion\'s &quot;basic assumption&quot; theories are the basis of systems psychodynamics. His words illuminate his point of view.</p>

<p>One of the early studies of note, in this field, was conducted by the US Air Force and by the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, titled &quot;Some Principles of Mass Persuasion.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12336576">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12336576</a></p>
<p>Mass persuasion is broken down into three simple steps; 1) build a cognitive structure 2) build a motivational structure 3) call to action or inaction.</p>
<p>Mass media is either confirming or assaulting your basic assumptions as part of a wider agenda, building a cognitive structure for the populace. When the narrative is strong enough, informational outliers are disregarded my the average person, which is why Pizzagate has never taken hold in the mass media. The details of Pizzagate require connecting the dots outside of the mainstream narrative and that requires a certain type of person.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of this that are really difficult for the average person to get heir head around.</p>
<p>First, &quot;The Infiltrators&quot; are the most powerful people on earth. It doesn\'t have to be any particular type. Whichever group is best at infiltrating organizations is the group that will maintain power across multiple organizations. War is theater. Real power is taken by infiltration. Can you think of any organizations that are professional infiltrators? Imagine they, themselves, have been infiltrated. Imagine religions, governments, news agencies... everything.</p>
<p>The Tavistock Archives give a glimpse into some of these ideas. The &quot;Matrix of Power&quot; informs us on the strategy of infiltrators. By compromising and acquiring people in certain points of influence that are cross organizational, infiltrators are able to control many organizations with very few people. For example, a retired police chief who is a chair of an NGO that also holds political office.</p>
<p>Second, are &quot;The Suggestibles.&quot; This is most people. The Infiltrators keep repeating a narrative across as many mediums as possible, and most people accept it. For everyone else, there is controlled opposition. Example: You finally realize CNN is full of it, so you go to Infowars, who tells you Pizzagate isn\'t real, but a lot of other crazy conspiracy theories are. Infowars, then, builds a cognitive structure for those who eschewed mainstream media.</p>
<p>Operation Mockingbird is the real world application of grassroots campaigns to mainstream media being controlled by the government.</p>
<p>If you\'ve managed to think your way out of the first and second paper bags, there are plenty of astroturf organizations that are designed to appear to be in line with your cognitive structure. but are really there to bring you back around to two central money makers.</p>
<p>War and slavery.</p>
<p>The news, the government, the shills on the Internet and the Suggestibles who follow them are all trying to sell you on authoritarianism in order to perpetuate war and slavery.</p>
<p>The whole mind control things gets worse when you take into account experiments with drugs like scopolamine, where a victim will willingly empty out their ATM or participate in their own rape.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2143584/Scopolamine-Powerful-drug-growing-forests-Colombia-ELIMINATES-free-will.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2143584/Scopolamine-Powerful-drug-growing-forests-Colombia-ELIMINATES-free-will.html</a></p>
<p>There is evidence that suggests the cocktail has become more advanced. Something made of scopolamine, valium and an antiseizure medication that allows victims to perform complex tasks and not remember them.</p>
<p>But, there is always good old fashion torture to make a slave. Providing a child with a loving home life and then stealing them away every night to be tortured by masked figures creates a dissociative split that sometimes results in an eidetic memory. Being locked in coffins with spiders, electric shocks, drugs, stinging nettles, being tied down... everything you\'ve seen in a lot of ritual abuse cases.</p>
<p>MK Ultra is an early example of this type of mind control and it is exactly why the CIA wants to be able to do torture. It is the easiest way to create a slave who will do your bidding, regardless of whether or not they suffered a personality split. Donald Trump said it, himself. &quot;Torture works.&quot;</p>
<p>Chemical and biological forms of mind control and mass persuasion are unreliable when compared to what torture can accomplish.</p>
<p>This is why The Infiltrators are more powerful than ever, have infiltrated more organizations than ever and wield more technology than ever. Their loyalties and beliefs don\'t matter. Whatever infiltrators are in power are merely a replacement for the last evil men who decided they get to control your fate.</p>
<p>The scary thing about systems psychodynamics is that there isn\'t really any defense against it. You kind of have to create your own cognitive structure and motivational system, but you will still be using fire to fight fire.</p>
<p>Still, we can do something about it in three easy parts.</p>
<p>1) Push for transparency of government. Use social media and word of mouth to push this political agenda, because it is the only thing that allows accountability for evil men and the ability of the people to fix the problems we find as a result of that transparency.</p>
<p>2) Oppose any and all war. You have a voice. Use it.</p>
<p>3) Oppose any and all slavery. It is a complex issue, but the obvious examples are easy targets. Mauritius. Saudi Arabia. A lot of countries have legalized slavery and you should use the media available to you to oppose it.</p>
<p>Pop off a few tweets. Volunteer at a non-profit. Become an infiltrator.</p>
<p>Whether you believe Pizzagate is real, or not, the facts are clear that systems psychodynamics and more specific mind control techniques have been pursued an implemented by the professional infiltrators to support an agenda that is contrary to your own personal interests. They stand in the way of justice. They stand in the way of social and scientific progress.</p>
<p>Whether they are OTO, disciples of Nietzsche, or both... oppose war and slavery while pushing for transparency.</p>',

            Nice post !  Just a point about Infowars (and I'm not a shill for them or whoever else, that is)... Infowars aknowledged «Pizzagate» as being a trap laid at first by the mediawhores (the shooter hoax being the consequential money shot, for them=failed one at that), to squeeze reserchers into a corner, while the overall pedogate thing is still happening.  Infowars is wrongfully critiqued about this issue, I think..  The only thing that bugged me is the excuse video to J.A, surely to avoid legal issues, even though we all know how deep this is all still connected.

            Why is opposing any and all war necessary?
Isn't war occasionally necessary such as stopping ISIS?
           </p>
           <p>
            If country leaders opposed all war then the first country to not oppose war would steamroll the rest.

             Cutting off their money and weapons can be done without directly engaging them. Social engineering can take their power from them, as well. Eliminating corruption is the best way to stabilize any region.

            This is an excellent post.  Social engineering seems to be at the base of almost all "conspiracies."  They are targeting children in public schools (and also charter &amp; Catholic schools) to make them less educated and more easily directed with common core (and many practices that get pushed with or without the common core name).

            However, what's with the attack on Nietzsche at the end?  Does anyone really think Nietzsche followers are behind this?  Nietzsche's works had to be altered to support nazism.  He was largely anti-state.  He strongly promoted not following the herd - the very thing you point out is the only way to prevent being manipulated.
           </p>
           <p>
            This stuff goes back before Nietzsche.  I can see how some of his writing (especially out of context) can be seen to support elites, but if you read him in depth, I think you'll find he would hate the free-loaders who are corrupting people's minds and damaging the species just to stay in control.

             Mostly referring to Uber me school and the will to power above all, stuff. Knowledge and ideas are neutral. Just depends on what you do with that knowledge. How you act upon ideals.
