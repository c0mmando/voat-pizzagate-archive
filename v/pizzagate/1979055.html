             After their oldest son was killed in a car accident, Terri Welch, a nurse, wanted to give back to those who had tried to save him, and she became a volunteer firefighter.

              except I find it strange that the brother has no obit or any articles about the accident at all, so no other confirmation except mother's statement. EMW would be 8 in 1997,  can't imagine losing an older brother at that age.

               Now I need to find out what happened to Martha Elizabeth Welch

              <p>
               can't even find obit on her, but I do know .... Preceding him in death was an infant child, Martha Elizabeth Welch, who died May 3, 1984. So she must be Charles Welch's daughter?

            Recall from Kathy's story that she was offered up after her fathers arrest for trading pornographic pictures of her.  He got off, she became a slave.  Use the same logic here...would guess either Welch or Daddy Welch got into trouble.  They got their "get out of jail free" card.  That card was "called in" when someone had to go down for CPP.  We (voaters) have the data from the server, we have the name of the DC cop this was given to, we have a clear and clean record of passing the information to the FBI and the AG offices (not saying me..I know this all exists...).  We have Welch who did/did not fire a weapon inside CPP.  The DC police (or FBI for that matter) would not need frickin' Mickey the Wonder Dog to solve this one...but, regretably, these CHOADS are all influenced by bigger CHOADS..so the beat goes on...and we are MADE FOOLS OF AGAIN...cant you just see rooms of them laughing at us?

            Here is another issue - I can find no record of a "DR ARNOLD ANGELESI" I've also tried "Angeles".   No medical license ever held, that I can determine, in OH or NC.  Is it a fair assumption that if you are being determined to be mentally stable, that any treating/attending physicians should be licensed in OH?

             I guess the use of quotation marks around the phrase "smoking gun" or the use of "almost" doesn't count for anything?  Downvoat for you for being illiterate.

              Yeah and how does this qualify as an "almost 'smoking gun?'"
             </p>
             <p>
              You seem to be talking about the odds of this being the same guy.
              <br/>
              I'm asking if it is the same guy, then what?
              <br/>
              Even if you prove its the same guy and the odds are it's not.   Then what?  What do you think this shows?  That is what I am asking.

               That EMW comes from a long, pedigreed line of pedos, was likely both a victim and perpetrator himself (Haiti), which is an additional piece of evidence which can be levied against James Alefantis in both the court of public opinion as well as in the legal system.  It fits a publicly documented pattern of association and coercion and therefore can be submitted as evidence.

                submitted as evidence to whom?   Who are you trying to kid?  This still gets you zero inches closer to evidence of a false flag.

                IF, and that's a big IF, his father is the guy in another state you are talking about it, there's a simpler reading of this.    Father and son are criminals.  You still have no connection to anyone in Washington DC, let alone Alefantis.

             I wouldn't say "salivating" over the "thought of violence".  In fact, if you recall, my comments were in regards to psychological operations and information warfare.  All non-kinetic activities.  How is this condoning physical violence?

"Worked in broadcasting for 25 years. Enjoyed writing and wrote for several magazines before meeting a screenwriter (Baywatch) who encouraged me to "try it, you'll like it". I did and he was correct."
HE WORKED on BAYWATCH. Connection, then, to Pamela Anderson, connected to Spirit Cooking and thus to Julian Assange's disappearance/death.

            rape: amount owed 44.00
Our justice system is a joke.  A simple possesion charge would have landed a fine 100x greater.

            looks like dad wasn't rapest, he was awarded Father of the year by church in 1997. But this was the same year the brother died so I wonder how that happened

             1)  6/29/1994 DEFT SENTENCED TO LORAIN CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION 8-25 YEARS FOR RAPE..
2) 11/04/1996 IT IS ORDERED THAT DEFT IS PERMITTED TO BE RELEASED FROM THE CUSTODY AND CONTROL OF ROSS CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION TO BE RELEASED TO HIS WIFE.

             It appears he was successful in a 'Motion for shock probation'. (How the f*** that should work for Rape, iwnk). But it's completely possible considering other 'lacking' sentences commonly seen for sexual crimes involving Juveniles . So in all probability he certainly qualifies time-wise for the churches "Father of the F***ing Year" award, even with a Rape conviction and death of a son the year before (maybe that helped him qualify??).

             actually I'm finding a lot of Harry Welch Jrs. I'm going to keep looking.  And also trying to find cause of brothers death, born 81 died in 1997. sorry if I put that wrong in earlier comment.

            I think that was old news.  There may be some solid leads to dig on in here as well.  The lawyer, the judge, etc.  There has to be some news articles relating to the case.

            this works out so long as EMW is older than 23. 
So I wonder what happened to this part of the family??
