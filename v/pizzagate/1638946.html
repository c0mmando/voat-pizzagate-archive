            I found their google plus page - they had some weird
            <a href="https://imgtc.com/HHq8kka">
             poll
            </a>
            using

             this photo
            </a>
            and when I saved it the title was myroom. I'm going through the profiles of people who voted on it, or anyone connected to this page.
Edit: I found
            <a href="https://imgtc.com/JuJR9lT">
             the janitor.
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            BIG EDIT
Found an old
            <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/x/thread/18412786/">
             thread
            </a>
            which there is a comment saying they had an old tumblr "scatfreak99" "their tumblr tends to reference disgusting sex acts with minors, but looks relatively troll-ish in nature "
           </p>
           <p>
            I feel like every weird site we have found around this shit is always like that. Like the ice cream videos, always weird videos and weird circle that plays off because of it being some type of weird "art"

              I didn't know it was troll - this was the first time I had looked at it. I didn't make a post and only left it as a comment since it isn't like it felt like it was something real. I was curious about the tumblr though since it was from 2015 and we don't know how old or how long it had been around. I just thought it was strange, also finding that janitorial is a term for sex trafficking.

               yeah it's a troll. pretty easy to spot if you know what you're looking at. You shouldn't automatically assume every site is part of the "conspiracy". You SHOULD be suspicious of absolutely everything. Misdirection is popping up everywhere. Some obvious clues that it was fake versus real KP,  is that real KP is not obscure. The videos contain no KP, the videos are un-provenanced and could literally be anything from real but edited child torture or even scenes from obscure horror movie. The hint is in the lack of content. Even a troll is careful not to pass KP on the Internet. They just wanted people to think they were.
              </p>
              <p>
               We're being hit with so much of that crap now it's really important to not pass anything "suspicious" it's all been designed to be suspicious. For example, TwitterGate was not "suspicious" it was KP right out in the open. Not obscured mysterious videos, actual videos. YouTube hosts actual videos of child abuse/torture. Not some shady "well it sounds scary so it must be" shit. When you see real KP you KNOW it. There's no mistaking a 2 year old being anally raped by a stick and tortured with clamps on his body parts. Not shadows, not screaming, actual KP where a 2 year old little boy is being tortured on camera.
              </p>
              <p>
               See, that's KP. Not even hiding it. Why on earth would someone attempt to claim that website hosted KP? There was literally no KP on it. Bad rap, videos using 1960s stranger danger clips...but the clues on in what clips. The "candy" is an old meme. I don't know what kind of laughing they're doing but I can imagine that dyingdad is enjoying any emails he may be getting :D

               Ok, here's the link to the OP, my analysis is in the thread. I didn't put too much energy into making it pretty because SRSLY it's bull.

               AND here is the typical disclaimer "I didn't look"

              <blockquote>
               <p>
                I havent watched any of the videos because I just dont have it in me right now and Im in no position to take any actions right now short of sharing them with you. Please investigate, archive and share. Trump or Podesta's twitter acccounts might be good places.

               I think I didn't write to "the audience" forgetting that there are a lot of people on here who don't know what the anon globe is...etc.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's why the whole thing is fake.
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                Hotlinks. There is a rather lengthy video index as you will note in my rather lengthy analysis. Only TWO videos are hotlinked. One is at the top (father) the other nearer the middle called "OOOPs" . Only two of the entire index is hotlinked from the index and oddly those are the two most disturbing videos if you're a newb. Now anyone seeing those is never going to risk looking at the rest because you have to download them. If you download them to watch them you don't know what the content is before you do it and ...see the trap. The fear kept people from looking closer.  operation going as planned.
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               The logic is this...how did those two videos get hotlinked? How would anyone know which two videos were "shareable" versus needing downloading?  (forgetting some might not know what hotlinks are) Who would know which two videos are hotlinks? IF someone didn't go through the entire index and download and look at each one, how would they know which ones were hotlinked? They wouldn't. WHO would just download what they believe is KP? No one. So basically no one but the maker of the site or aids would know which two videos were sharable and would for certain head off many from looking at the rest for fear of DL KP!
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                Aiming it at John Podesta. The thread title says his name...instead of "does this sound like anyone we've heard before" ...people brave enough to play the FATHER clip all heard John. I'm like WTF the kid's not saying John...but I'm trained to do these things. After hearing the hotlink video and realizing the "implant" I had zero fear downloading and watching each video because I knew there was no way it was real. It wasn't. The videos are literally what I said they are. And I wrote that when I was "chillin" .
               </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
               People can make something out of nothing if they're looking too hard.
              </p>
              <p>
               What do they want me to believe and why do they want me to believe it. No one serious about exposing KP would do that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also i warn not to open the first link as it is exe and even I'm not that stupid.
