<p>&quot;<strong>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate directly with Advanced Bioscience Resources (ABR) Inc. and no solicitation will be issued.</strong> The objective is to acquire Tissue for Humanized Mice. ABR is the only company that can provide the human fetal tissue needed to continue the ongoing research being led by the FDA. Fresh human tissues are required for implantation into severely immune-compromised mice to create chimeric animals that have a human immune system. This human immune system allows us to test biological drug products for safety and efficacy.&quot;</p>

           <p>
            Worcester, MA, August 17, 2015 (OperationRescue) – A loss in court and increased public outrage over fetal parts trafficking has prompted StemExpress, to sever its ties with Planned Parenthood and recalibrate its public profile to one that is “predominately” focused — at least outwardly — on adult blood and tissue procurement.
           </p>
           <p>
            This news came in the same week that Operation Rescue obtained purchase orders that show the University of Massachusetts Medical School paid StemExpress a total of $29,000 for human fetal cadaverous tissue, (presumably harvested from Planned Parenthood abortions), for the purpose of creating “humanized” mice.
           </p>
           <p>
            StemExpress is a biotech company in Placerville, California, that has been featured in video exposés released by the Center for Medical Progress, which show the company partnering with Planned Parenthood to harvest and profit from the sale of aborted baby parts.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is more to this article that exposes Planned Parenthood and also a video which I would warn is surely NSFW.

              I don't think you could call them cross breeds. It probably works the same way Leukemia treatment via bone marrow transplant works: you wipe out the subject's own immune system by killing all the fastest growing cells, and then transplant the cells from a donor's immune system. Except the subjects here are mice, and the donors don't have any choice in the matter. :-(

              As I recall, it was supposed Christian Republican G.W. Bush who first condoned research with fetal cells.
