<p>&quot;Working with artists is always an intense experience and there is always two sides to every story. <strong>I happen to know Carole\'s side and it would make those dining on the new food choke and feel nauseous</strong>. I will only say that if they knew what really happened, they like me would no longer dine at either establishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carole is the real deal. A real artist with moods and feelings just like all of you. She is a real talent and we were fortunate enough to have her cook for us for a long while in DC.</p>
<p>Continue the rabid dialogue and we will continue to lose our deep talent to the superficial, rabid, uninformed fodder.</p>
<p>Good job City Paper for lowering the bar a little more on DC culture.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also read this: could be what was going on.This information was posted by on a forum after pizzagate broke by someone who claims to have close ties with Carole Greenwood\'s family. Carole Greenwood\'s son worked there. This part is totally unverified information.</p>

              Feroce d'avocat (fierce avocado) is a French Caribbean avocado dip but also translates to fierce lawyer. I don't know what the relevance is, but the whole damn thing is crazy. What I can decipher: 
-all the people that the author named have been paid to turn against Stewart Lupton. 
-the author is very condescending towards Stewart's faith and religion. 
-the author also seems to have love/hate feelings toward Carole greenwood. 
-The author claims he paid a drunk doctor to  enter Stewart's apartment while he was sleeping, chloroform him, and remove his septum.
- Additionally, by his own admission, "they" ( he and a co-author? Or he and the paid off turncoat friends?)  performed a smear and fake propaganda campaign of very harmful lies against Stewart in NYC and DC. 
-This all seems to be motivated by musical band rivalry. He says " now people will know that the Walkmen were the real thing." 
I don't know if this is important or just a distraction, but I'm really curious to know if Stewart can still sing due to his allegedly missing septum. This vindictive propaganda smear campaign by a lawyer with a food name makes me think alefantis/Brock collaboration, but I don't think that's the case. Probably interesting but not important to the real investigation. Just thought I'd share.

              weird comment starts here  ------------&gt;"Mrs. Carole Wagner Greenwood, whenever he speaks of Mr. Stewart Lupto, she is a woman scorned and crazy. whenever Mrs. Carole is referenced against Mr. Stewart Lupton, she is a woman scorned and crazy.

OH STEW, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH YOU!!!?!?!?!?!? 
we thought we'd give you a little reminder of what an asshole you were, so we 'outsourced' some of your oldest and bestest friends, Hamilton Leithuaser, Walter Martin, Ian Svenious, and two of your ex's that hate you; the lovely psycho bitch Carole Wagner Greenwood, and the dangerous sociopathic beauty Jennifer Kuca , and oh so many more members of your 'spiritual family" who wish to remain anonymous but are closer than you think. You might want to give these folks a phone call and ask them what off shore account they're putting the money we gave them . ( HA!!!!!! SHe's always hated your mom, it turns out! We thought it would be hard to find anyone to ruin your life, seeing as your oh so popular and have so much 'street cred,' but a little money and a lot of propaganda goes a long way) You see, we got some 'investors,' f.y.i. … and instead of making the new Walkmen record , the record that you'll never make due to the slander we spread around d.c. and n.y.c. clubs and promoters., we used the money to give you a little present. We just wanted you to know what a shitty singer and even shittier person you ARE, sooo nasally and sooooo pretentious, sooooo handsome, sooooo 'poetic' so we thought we'd slander you and spread libel like herpes around d.c. and new york…so this is what we did…..

                  definitely someone who feels wronged and belittled and wants to take some kind of personal psychological revenge.  Carole def knows her fair share of drama queens to say the least, it seems.

                   If they're gayelles (affectionately used of course) the one's I've known are always about drama..invent that drama sometimes, participate in other drama. The queens do throw fits that remind me of something Axl Rose would do. Divas. Not all, but there's some that make a bad name for good people.

            The Alefantis victim told me that Carole walked into the kitchen to see Alefantis having sex with her teenaged son. He also told me that the employee who reported it was fired. I reached out to the person he said reported it but she hasn't gotten back to me.

            I think the party posters were pretty disturbing, we need more information on those and videos or what goes on at those parties. I find it highly likely that some form of sexual activity might go down at those "parties".
