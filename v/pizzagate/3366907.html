            Duke of Wellington's daughter makes Rich List after marrying billionaire
           </p>
           <p>
            Her Father is the 9th Duke of Wellington, she is a descendant of Queen Victoria and she has access to a family estate worth tens of millions of pounds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lady Charlotte, however, married Alejandro Santo Domingo, a 40-year-old Colombian-American businessman with a degree from Harvard and shares in one of the world’s largest breweries, in a ceremony in Spain last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            The couple, who debuted at number 29, are described as having accumulated their estimated fortune of £3,682million through “inheritance, brewing and investment”.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr Santo Domingo is at the helm of his family’s conglomerate, the Santo Domingo Group. He is also the managing director of a New York-based investment advisory firm and was elected to the Board of Trustees at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2009.
           </p>
           <p>
            He was linked to heiress Amanda Hearst and model Eugenia Silva before meeting Lady Charlotte, whose ancestor the 1st Duke of Wellington defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815. The Oxford graduate, who studied archaeology and anthropology, now works with photographer Mario

           </p>
           <p>
            He is a director of Colombia's Endeavor, an international non-profit development organization that aims to find and support high-impact entrepreneurs in emerging markets and is member of the Latin America Conservation Council of The Nature Conservancy. He is a director of DKMS Americas, a non-profit organization and the largest bone marrow donor center in the world. With over 3.6 million registered donors, DKMS is leading the fight against blood cancer by empowering people to take action, give bone marrow, and save lives. [6] He is active in the family’s foundation, which is a major player in helping Colombia’s poor. He is also a generous donor and has championed ecological and conservancy causes.

            Michele Anthony grew up in the music industry as her father, Dee Anthony, managed artists ranging from Tony Bennett to Peter Frampton. She began working in his office at age 12[11] and by 14 she was on the road with Joe Cocker. "It was a unique childhood that really gave me an education in the music industry," Anthony told Gillian G. Gaar in She's a Rebel: The History of Women in Rock &amp; Roll.[12] She graduated from George Washington University, and also holds a J.D. from the University of Southern California. In an interview with Billboard, she named her father and Gloria Steinem as the two biggest influences in her life and credits her mother for her work ethic.
