The game was first reported on YouTube channel Obscure Horror Corner on June 15, 2015. He posted gameplay on YouTube. It is very disturbing. The game is being claimed that it comes from the Dark Web. You hear recorded conversations and audio and see images of people throughout. I can\'t find these recording online.</p>

<p>&quot;Sad Satan is a PC game built with the Terror Engine, first reported on the YouTube channel Obscure Horror Corner on June 15, 2015.Following initial reviews, the channel\'s video of the game was picked by a number of English-language publications and later internationally&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The title is a reference to the Led Zeppelin song &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; Allegedly, when the song is played backwards, disturbing and Satanic lyrics can be heard. One of the lines from the supposedly backmasked lyrics is &quot;There was a little tool shed where he made us suffer, sad Satan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The original game posted by Obscure Horror Corner features walking down monochromatic corridors while various audio samples are played and looped over each other. Audio in the game leans heavily on recordings of interviews with various murderers, such as Charles Manson. The game also depends heavily on distorted or reversed audio of such interviews or musical clips, such as &quot;Wo Ai Beijing Tiananmen&quot;, played in the beginning. Reversed clips from the Swedish Rhapsody numbers station can also be heard. While the player controls their character through the hallways, images may intermittently display, taking up the entire screen and preventing the player from progressing any further until the image automatically closes a few seconds later. Most of the images seem to reference child abuse, especially people indicted in Operation Yewtree, such as images of Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris. Other images revolve around crime, and include people convicted or accused of murder, such as Japanese murderer Tsutomu Miyazaki, photographs of Lady Justice statues, and political figures such as former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Images of accident victims and murder victims are also shown, including the aftermath of a person struck by a truck, and a beheading. The only other &quot;characters&quot; in the game are children who simply stand in one place and do not move or interact with the player at all. In the final video posted by Obscure Horror Corner, one of these children does begin to follow the player, causing &quot;contact damage&quot;. Since the player has no means of self-defense or any ability to heal damage, the player will inevitably die at this point in the game.&quot;</p>
<p>Video Game magazine Kotaku did an interview with the channel creator and admitted it is actually from the Dark Web.</p>

<p>Than tried to take it back quickly in an editors update.</p>
<p>&quot;Update 7/7 1:45 PM : Fans of Sad Satan have spent a good deal of time analyzing the game, its references, and potential origins. The search has produced some interesting insights, many of which reinforce the idea that the game is about child abuse. You can read about that here. Along the way, another question has popped up: scary as it might be, was the game truly found in the deep web, as the YouTube uploader claimed? People sent me a variety of rationales for and against the possibility that Sad Satan came from the deep web, some valid, others not.</p>
<p>What stood out to me was the allegation that the deep web link provided in the YouTube description for the initial video contained the number “9,” which is a number that is unlikely to be found in Onion links. I contacted Jamie, the proprietor of Obscure Horror Corner, to ask what was going on with the link. He now says he gave people the wrong link because the real one had, he claims, also included “gore pictures” and child pornography along with the game. “I didn’t feel comfortable giving out a link for something like that.” He did not share that link with me. Unfortunately, that makes it harder for me to put as much credence into the rest of his account, even though he maintains it is true. Sad Satan remains interesting and worth covering given how effective it is despite its crudeness, but its clear now that I should have presented the tale of its discovery with more skepticism. I apologize for that. While the original article admits that the game exists in a more mythical state than a tangible one, it could have gone farther to make clear what was concrete about Jamie’s tale and what wasn’t.&quot;</p>

His crimes included vampirism and preservation of body parts as trophies.&quot;</p>

His crimes included vampirism and preservation of body parts as trophies."

Silent Hill, with its first title released in 1999, is one of the most influential of the horror video game series. Perron situates the games within the survival horror genre, both by looking at the history of the genre and by comparing Silent Hill with such important forerunners as Alone in the Dark and Resident Evil.

              I didn't write that the game having malware proves it has been debunked.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is some discussion as to whether the game actually came from the Dark Web.  Read through the 4chan thread link I provided.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, I'm not sure what you are really driving at with this post. If you read through the undergraduate's dissertation on the game you will see that this fits into the horror genre of gaming.  I'm not clear what this post has to do with pizzagate.

               The question is why the child abuse stuff was put into the game - to normalize it? To give people a thrill? To paint pedos like Savile and Harris as heroes?

            I think there's something in the audio that can cause nausea because I recall watching Mutahar from the 'Someordinarygamers' YouTube channel playing this game as part of his long running dark web series and he became physically ill at one point.

             low frequency sounds.They use them in horror movies; you can't hear them but they still have physical effects on you.Check out "the sound the sun makes".
