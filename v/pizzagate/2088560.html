&quot;<strong>The State’s Role—Covering Up Abuse at Both Homes</strong></p>
<p>The conditions for children at these group homes could only be described as torture. Boys displaced from their birth families were subject to physical and sexual abuses—not to mention ongoing mental and emotional torment—that were so pervasive that they became routine. The number of boys irreparably scarred by their time in the Kiwanis homes will never be known.</p>
<p>Both the homes and the DSHS failed these boys at every level. The dangerous combination of money from powerful donors, politics, and cronyism prevented anyone from acting to protect these children. In just one example, a local man who donated property worth $20,000 to the OKBR was “recognized” for his contribution by being allowed weekend visits from the resident boys. He was later convicted of molesting those boys.</p>
<p>The state was directly complicit in these abuses. In a state audit conducted at the OKBR in 1989, the home failed to meet 8 of the 10 minimum requirements for state licensing. The auditor’s report was ignored, and the home was re-licensed without any substantial changes. The state’s deputy secretary intervened to prevent license revocation in 1991, ordering his staff to “work it out.”</p>
<p>These continual, catastrophic, systematic failures persisted the entire time both homes were open. Criminal activity among the staff and the boys was often ignored, violating mandatory reporting laws. Sexual violence was dismissed without investigation, with staff members claiming that “boys will be boys.”</p>
<p>Worse, the politically connected Kiwanians in charge of both homes had their own ways of evading consequences. According to the Seattle Times, the police eventually sought criminal charges against the administration at the OKBR. However, the Thurston County prosecutor declined to file any such charges. That prosecutor was the president-elect of the home’s parent organization, the Olympia Kiwanis Club.</p>
<p>The Washington DSHS knew of the abuse for at least five years before shutting these homes down. That’s why the state is now being held accountable for its part in this devastating tragedy.&quot;</p>

            As a teen I was a Kiwanis Cheerleader and thought it so very nice that one of the men took a boy "under his wing" to mentor him. I had a crush on the boy so I knew that he had no father in his life and mother was busy with other kids. Little did I know. Amazing how you look back years later and see things through opened eyes.

            Kiwanis, Lions Club, and Rotary Club (International) are all JEWISH orgs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Rotary Club is a direct offshoot of the Jew N.
