            Pazuzu is a statue that appears at many places around Kong Studios, like in Murdoc's old Winnebago, outside the studios, on t-shirts and in the Rock it video. Pazuzu is a Sumerian-babylonian demon god. He's revered by Murdoc. Murdoc has a scepter with the head of Pazuzu.
           </p>
           <p>
            Murdoc Niccals is the offical bass player of Gorillaz. He was born in Stoke-On-Trent on June 6th 1966.
           </p>
           <p>
            He became a satanist after making deals with the devil and aquired his bass guitar "El Diablo" in the process. His middle name was changed from "Alphonce" to "Faust."
           </p>
           <p>
            Background
           </p>
           <p>
            He was dumped on his father's doorstep in infancy and went on to a very abusive childhood. It has been proposed that his many addictions and his sour attitude were due to his abusive childhood. Sebastian Jacob Niccals, (or Jacob Sebastian Niccals, depending on who's asking) was a spiteful drunk of a man who often verbally abused and exploited his sons.
           </p>
           <p>
            The local pub had a routine talent show that Murdoc was often forced to participate in so he could win his father's drinking money. The performances arranged by his father were always humiliating song and dance numbers, usually with feathered costumes and tap shoes, including one performance in which Murdoc was forcibly dressed up as Pinocchio and sang "I've Got No Strings". It was here that Murdoc decided to become a musician. He would never again take the stage under someone else's direction. He would wreak his havoc on this world of buffoons.

            Wondering if this 'bands' creator new something about international child sex trafficking rings, blackmail and extortion at our top echelon's of government?

            Gorillaz
           </p>
           <p>
            Gorillaz are an English virtual band created in 1998 by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett. The band consists of four animated members: 2D (lead vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboard, and backing vocals) and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These members are completely fictional and are not personas of any "real life" musicians involved in the project.[4] Their fictional universe is explored through the band's website and music videos, as well as a number of other media, such as short cartoons. The music is a collaboration between various musicians, with Albarn being the only permanent musical contributor. Writers and critics have described their music as alternative rock,[5] Britpop,[6] trip hop,[7] hip hop,[8] electronica, indie, dub, reggae and pop.
           </p>
           <p>
            The idea to create Gorillaz came about when the two were watching MTV. Hewlett said, "If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell â€“ there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that."

            Saturnz Barz. Really?? That couldn't be more obvious if you've followed David Icke's work, he talks in depth about how Saturn is being used by advanced technology as one of the tools of control of humanity. Just google David Icke Saturn matrix black cube.
