<p>This \'all seeing eye\' was created by trendy pop artist Peter Blake who co-created the Beatle\'s album cover Sgt. Pepper.  Well, we all know about the occult references on that one and others.  Even Aleister Crowley was included.</p>

<p>Peter Blake and Graham Ovenden worked together on a number of projects and were even together in a collective of artists known as the Brotherhood of Ruralists. <em>Why would Tony Blair\'s new Supreme Court chose such an artist?</em></p>

<p>One of those images I found a little \'odd\' and looked up the artist Isobel Williams.

            Seemingly unmoved, Judge Roscoe pressed on. “Some of the poses,” she said in her judgment, “appear to be sexually provocative.  Some, whether overtly or not, evoke poses by adult women that are intended to be sexually alluring.”  Evidently Ovenden thinks he should get special treatment because of his "standing" as an artist.  Artist, actor, CEO, whatever, none of them deserve any consideration when they are "diddling" with our children.  He got in a tub with a little girl and asked her to touch his genitals.  Sick Perverted Piece of Vermin.

It was something about him being the mysterious buyer of some erotic art, I think it was a photographic collection. There was a link, that took you to the artist, Graham Ovenden
