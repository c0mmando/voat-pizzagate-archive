            Google later said the barges were supposed to be interactive technology showrooms. According to the Wall Street Journal (
            <a href="http://archive.is/7PkRN">
             http://archive.is/7PkRN)
            </a>
            ), the Coast Guard said the barges were a fire hazard, so Google abandoned its plan, parked one barge in Stockton, and had at least one of the other three barges dismantled for scrap metal.
           </p>
           <p>
            This bit stands out: "Google wooed government officials, including organizing field trips. 'The good folks at Google want to give us a tour of the barge that is currently under construction (it’s almost done) at Treasure Island,' wrote Rich Hillis, executive director of the nonprofit Fort Mason Center to National Park Service managers on Aug. 19, 2013. 'They can pick us up in a special Google speed boat.'"

            According to this article, Portland, Maine collected $400,000 in property taxes while the barge sat in its harbor.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It’s unclear why Google abandoned the project. The company did not reply to an email inquiry sent to its press office Thursday.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The 250-foot barge, registration number 'BAL 0011,' has some real value. It would cost $4 million new, according to C&amp;C Marine in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, which built both barges in 2011.
           </p>
           <p>
            "The building on the barge would have been expensive to assemble, said Chad Walton, owner of SnapSpace Solutions Inc. in Brewer, which converts shipping containers into modular buildings.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It’s hard to imagine selling it all for scrap, Walton said. 'It must have cost a fortune to put together a thing like that,' he said.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Meanwhile, the container in California, which in March was towed from San Francisco to Stockton, remains untouched, according to port director Richard Aschieris. He said By And Large LLC, the company that owns the barge and until recently owned the barge in Portland, is paid up on its $10,000 monthly dock fees through October."

             The whole project had a cost of 35 million that I read.
Are we supposed to believe Google wasted 35 million on a floating private showroom?
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm guessing they had a smooth operation going, since you don't have to declare the function of the installations for a barge as you do on real estate.
That is, up to the point they had to dispose of a body, because suddenly you have the coast guard on your ass and the logistics become a problem.
Also, to transport children in boats is more suspect than having them take a uber or having daycare vans driving them around (which potentially explains all the childless daycares we found).

            Former Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt wanted to be an "outside advisor" to Hillary's campaign.

            "In previously leaked emails written by Teddy Goff, a former Obama campaign Digital Director now working for the Clinton campaign, 'Working relationships with Google, Facebook, Apple, and other technology companies' were discussed.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Throughout the memo, Goff repeatedly refers to 'Eric Schmidt’s group,' at one point saying, 'I have been kept apprised of the work being done by Eric Schmidt’s group and others working directly and indirectly with your team. On the whole, I am comfortable with where we stand and confident in our roadmap to launch day and beyond.'
           </p>
           <p>
            "Google as a company has also been accused of working with the Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange claimed that Google as a company was 'directly engaged' in the campaign. Specifically, Assange claimed, 'The chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, set up a company to run the digital component of Hillary Clinton’s campaign.'
           </p>
           <p>
            "Eric Schmidt did in fact create a company in the last quarter of 2015 called The Groundwork whose website is empty except for a single placeholder logo. Breitbart has previously reported on The Groundwork and how it was reportedly developed to install Clinton in the Oval Office."

           <p>
            "The Groundwork is one of the Clinton campaign’s biggest vendors, billing it for more than $177,000 in the second quarter of 2015, according to federal filings. Yet many political operatives know little about it. Its website consists entirely of a grey-on-black triangle logo that suggests 'the digital roots of change' while also looking vaguely like the Illuminati symbol...
           </p>
           <p>
            "[Michael Slaby, who runs the Groundwork] explained that the Groundwork and its parent company, Chicago-based Timshel—which according to its website is named for a Hebrew word meaning 'you may' and is devoted to 'helping humanity solve our most difficult social, civic, and humanitarian challenges'—are 'all one project, with the same backers,' whom he declined to name.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Schmidt did not respond to several requests for comment. But several Democratic political operatives and technologists, who would only speak anonymously to avoid offending Schmidt and the Clinton campaign, confirmed that the Groundwork is funded at least in part by the Alphabet chairman [Schmidt]."

            "While the exact Schmidt-backed group is not named within the memo, Schmidt has provided funding to a tech startup called The Groundwork, which is paid by Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Michael Slaby, the former chief integration and innovation officer for the Obama campaign, developed The Groundwork through a company he co-founded called Timshel. Slaby has been tight-lipped about details of its partnership with the Clinton campaign. The group has been paid nearly $600,000 from Hillary for America since its inception.
           </p>
