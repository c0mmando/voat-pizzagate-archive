<p>Well from this voat post : <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2589860"> The Clintons are Connected to Top Donors to Southwest Key -- Which Owns the Former Texas Walmart Filled With Children That Denied Entry to Senator Merkley</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Senator Jeff Merkley was barred from visiting a former Walmart that houses immigrant children in Brownsville, Texas on June 3rd. The building is both owned and operated by Southwest Key Programs. According to a 2015 study,* Southwest Key Programs receives 98% of their revenue through government contracts, and millions in private donations. The private donations are not huge, but five of the six top private funders have easily found Clinton ties, listed in the next section.</p>

<p>Including Annie E. Casey Foundation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.) <strong>Annie E. Casey Foundation: connections to the Clintons, concrete, and more</strong></p>
<p><strong>I got a shock when I looked up the Annie E. Casey Foundation (AECF). It was started by the founder of shipping company United Parcel Service, James E. Casey.</strong></p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of UPS employees and leadership are surely innocent, yet we all have a feeling babies and children are sometimes shipped in boxes.  AECF and the Clinton Foundation: AECF has many partnerships with the CF. These include a ready mix concrete truck driving program and a co-partnership with Soros’ Open Society Foundations.</p>
<p>Further: AECF donated to JP\'s Center for American Progress, which is funded by Soros. The fact that they are entrusted to provide the world with the “Kids Count Data Book” smells like CIA to me, not sure why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AECF is one of the dominant organizations in child welfare issues in the U.S…..famed for its publication of U.S. child welfare data….KIDS COUNT Data Book – the most widely used reference on the subject….The AECF has had a long connection with foster care services, [previously] owning two such agencies.

             ARK itself is getting funding to
support this programme from
‘Execution Ltd’ who ‘felt that this programme
fitted in well with the Trust’s
focus’. Another organisation, ‘The
Dream Mill’, researches the behaviour
change of the participants in the associated
‘Teens &amp; Toddlers’ programme -
the names themselves should give most
parents nightmares.
Our research has undercovered a trail of
worrying “new initiatives” in schools,
particularly those associated with the
new NuLabour ‘Academy’ schools programme.
Initiatives range from regular
‘counselling’, to unspecified ends, to
the sexualisation of children.
In the background, the UK Column is
finding reference to The ‘No Outsiders’
project, being run by Dr Elizabeth Atkinson
at Sunderland University. This
is about ‘challenging homophobia’ and
‘challenging heteronormativity’. For
those readers unsure of this ‘psychobabble’,
to challenge heteronormativity
is to challenge heterosexual activity
as the norm for society.

            Comes in useful here, Rehoboth Definition and Meaning - Bible Dictionary
Probably, however, the words "rehoboth'ir" are to be translated as in the Vulgate and the margin of A.V., "the streets of the city," or rather "the public square of the city", i.e., of Nineveh. These dictionary topics are from M.G. Easton M.A., D.D., Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Third Edition, published by Thomas Nelson, 1897.

             he One Thing No One Is Mentioning In Their Barney Frank Tributes: The Prostitutes "In 1989 it was discovered that Barney Frank's boyfriend, Stephen Gobie, whom Frank had once hired as a male prostitute, was running a male-brothel out of the Congressman's home. Frank claimed he did not know about the prostitution ring in his home, but he did use the power of his office to "fix" 33 tickets for Gobie. And he knowingly wrote a misleading letter to Gobie's probation officer in Virginia. Frank received a "reprimand" for fixing the tickets. Gobie maintained that Frank knew about the prostitution ring operation in his home."

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Gobie's dream has come true. His accusation that Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) knew that Gobie had operated a prostitution service out of Frank's Capitol Hill apartment became national news after it was first reported Friday by the Washington Times.
             </p>
             <p>
              Frank, one of two openly gay members of Congress, confirmed Friday that he paid Gobie for sex, hired him with personal funds as an aide and wrote letters on congressional stationery on his behalf to Virginia probation officials, but Frank said he fired Gobie when he learned that clients were visiting the apartment.
             </p>
             <p>
              Gobie's craving for public attention also has produced an uproar in Montgomery County. Gobie said he maintained a relationship with
              <strong>
               Gabriel A. Massaro, the principal of Chevy Chase Elementary School
              </strong>
              , and used an office at the school in late 1987 to make telephone calls and have one client meet a prostitute.

Following his stint in the White House and his graduation from Georgetown University, he led a number of political campaigns advocating for or against various California ballot initiatives, as well as a number of fundraising efforts for political candidates, such as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
             </p>
             <p>
              In 2012, Griffin was appointed president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBT rights organization in the United States.

             Michelle and Barack Obama are expected to make SoCal a post-White House home
            </a>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             According to reports, the Obamas may have purchased a home in Rancho Mirage. It has no doubt been a long and stressful eight years for Barack and Michelle Obama, so a West Coast house adjacent to extensive golf courses and other relaxing amenities makes sense.
            </p>
            <p>
             Rancho Mirage comes with presidential precedent. It was the post-White House home of Gerald Ford, as well. And, according to the New York Post, the rumored Obama property won’t be too far from the famed Annenberg estate known as Sunnylands that has served as an occasional California getaway for President Obama and seven of his predecessors.
            </p>
            <p>
             If this is in fact happening, which the First Family has yet to officially confirm, the assumption is that the house will be furnished and decorated by interior designer Michael S. Smith. Smith has his own place in Rancho Mirage that the Obamas have visited and he was their choice to update the White House décor when they moved in. The L.A.-based designer’s partner James Costos was also President Obama’s appointment to serve as U.S. ambassador to Spain and Andorra, so they’re probably all pretty close friends.

            <p>
             The two-story, 30,000-square-foot Wallis Annenberg PetSpace is slated to open next summer in Playa Vista. The high-tech Silicon Beach complex will be much more than just an adoption center, with spaces for educational classes and training workshops as well as a full-fledged research facility. Between 25 and 30 full-time employees will care for the resident animals, with room for volunteers as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the research side, the on-site Leadership Institute, a human-animal studies center, will pull in experts from the University of Oxford, University of Nottingham and Loyola Marymount University’s Center for Urban Resilience. PetSpace will also be partnering with the California Science Center for a traveling exhibition about the science of dogs, due to open in 2018.

            Those stolen guns...
           </p>
           <p>
            This absolutely STINKS of a false flag being plotted.
           </p>
           <p>
            Weapons trafficking heist. Similar crime to the one in December of last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Very similar to a set up for the attempted Super Bowl false flag last January.
           </p>
           <p>
            Large number of guns stolen suggests a LARGE number of culprits (think shooting massacre worse in scope than Vegas).
           </p>
           <p>
            If this is like the Super Bowl, then the target of the false flag will be a major sports venue....like say the World Series.
           </p>
           <p>
            World Series takes place on the week before Halloween with game 7 being on Halloween itself. The week before Halloween is also on a FULL MOON.
           </p>
           <p>
            Week of Halloween is a known time for fuckery in the Satanic Calader as are Full Moons.

            , what are you saying is the relationship here between the guns stolen from UPS, and pizzagate, other than these people all know each other and are part of the same web of slime? We need a tl;dr. Are you saying the arrests point to gun-running and child trafficking in plain sight by the owners of UPS?

             To do a tl;dr would be difficult as I cannot say that the guns stolen were indicative of gun-running and child trafficking. I'm compiling the connections we have between UPS and pizzagate. I did find the timing of the story interesting.   I can see now how my title for this could be confusing.

             We still don't know whether Sotheby's is actually shipping to embassies overseas for FAPE or whether FAPE's arrangement with them is still ongoing.

            UPVoat!  What a compilation of connections connecting to the CF and their possible arms and child trafficking connections.  We need to now work on getting closer to UPS and their many containers they use for shipping.  Remember when we used to research shipping containers?  Do they pick up things at ports?  Some other co. gets it to the port and UPS pick up complies.  Or do they have a Port PU Service?  Hmm.

            LOOK at this UPS Location in Louisville KY.   Right nr. the Ohio River  Easy Waterfront PU.  That is their address.

             Last Thursday night, the American Museum of Natural History hosted their largest annual benefit dinner with more than 700 guests attending. The evening was hosted by Seth Meyers, with a dinner menu designed by Mario Batali, and a performance by Michael Buble. Lorna Kelly of Paddles8 conducted an auction that raised more than $500,000, which was matched by an anonymous donor, bringing the evening’s total funds raised to over $3.5 million.

              While at Sotheby’s Lorna was inspired to travel to India to work with Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity tending to the poorest of the poor on the streets of Calcutta.

             <p>
              Those three weeks led to a close personal relationship with Mother Teresa and Lorna served as a witness for her beatification.

              Oh how sad to see Hillary Clinton and Mother Teresa in the same sentence. There goes another one of the most admired women (Mother Teresa I mean) down the tubes into depravity. After learning so much evil that has been going on under our noses, I don't think I will ever take anyone's word for something being a "charitable organization".

             Bingo!  There you go.  You have found another hidden cover up to their method of madness.  They will stop at nothing.  I have said to my husband all along, this is a Contrived Plot.

             It smacks of the Roy Moore accusations that I still believe were a Contrived Plot as well.  II can't bring this up anywhere, I get the Most Bazarro looks.  You have 3 heads look.

                Yeah and they've identified the nigger who worked there and stole them and his accomplice is in custody.  If they are trafficking children through a ups facility they aren't going to do it in a cardboard box where the $12/hr nigger with a ged is handling it. They'd ship it with special handling instructions in a wooden box like it was something fragile and expensive.
               </p>
               <p>
                If any laborers at the facility are in on it then it would be the shift managers and the union stewards. Ups is a publicly traded company and has to disclose all kinds of shit, you should be looking into the teamsters union. Unions are secretive as fuck and have a long history of corruption.

            So basically UPS, founded by Casey, who also runs AECF is connected to Arms Trafficking and Child Trafficking and connected to CF.  WOW. Not surprised that Brock and Soros are in the mix. Rehoboth has been on here before.  Biden visits there to an Ice Cream Shop and it is touted as a very well known Gay Magnet.

              That whole area seems to be one of those Controlled Areas. I agree with the Gay Mafia connection as well.    I wonder if Beau's death was somehow mixed up in all of this.  People have said that his cancer was caused by some kind of chemical probs in Iraq, but I wonder if we will ever know the real truth.  Not saying that couldn't have happened, but with their track record, who really knows.

            I don't know why but that Judge's name sounded familiar and up pops Beau Biden's name.  This is added to the mix.  As if we need more.......
