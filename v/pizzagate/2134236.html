            So we know Becerra lied / gave false evidence regarding the server awan was using and we know his deputy is a pedo.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Becerra is also a pedo Awan could quite possibly have proof / blackmail.
           </p>
           <p>
            With the Awan wife coming back and the possability of a plea deal with Imran we could snag our first big pizzagate arrest (or if the deputy rolls over on Becerra).

            yournewswire not trustworthy be careful, have suspicions about Breitbart. The alt right websites are covering up Pizzagate too.
Call me paranoid but hey that's my view. Apologies, cannot keep up with all this stuff but I don't trust Breitbart regarding Pizzagate.

             The problem is the Deep State has it's attack dogs to go after anyone in the right.  O'Reilly danced around the subject - gone.  Ailes probably decided to let some of the anchors run with stories - he dies after falling down stairs.  Bolling, an outspoken opponent of the DS - his son "commits suicide" immediately after he was forced out due to "lewd photos" (remember, these creatures can plant evidence).  And don't forget about the original one to call out Podesta specifically for being a pedo - Breitbart.  And look what happened to them.
            </p>
            <p>
             We can only hope that the white hats pay some attention here and listen to what we say - Inflict the same level of violence upon their people using the national level assets under Trump's control.  It's time to start getting rid of enemies of the state.  Yes, it is justified.

            Awan seems smart enough to have his own secret hard drive, not connected to anything. Hopefully he's smart enough to have shared it with others and it gets leaked. I want to believe this is going to get real interesting through the proper channels, then I remember Weiner's laptop and the life insurance file. Where is that laptop now? Thanks for sharing, I've been super busy lately and probably would have missed this.

             It is all linked. The servers were even being run out one of Awans 12 homes he owned. That is right an IT specialist (normally make 49 to 60 grand owned 12 homes in Virginia after making at least 4 million of US taxpayer money in the past few years. All while fraudulently took out at least 7 loans so far from DCCC credit union and wiring money to Pakistan.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Awans are Anthony Weiners trusted staff that were ordered by HRC to deliver blackberries to whom she wanted. Blackberries were "doped" or set to synchronize with HRC home server, &amp; Anthony laptop. On these laptops are an estimated 650,009 emails with 19 state department and executive branch Obama administration. All emails not on secure state department servers but configured to Awan/Clinton/DNC servers.
