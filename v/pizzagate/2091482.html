<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r1l9QsxH4I&amp;t=1031s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r1l9QsxH4I&amp;t=1031s</a> </p>
<p>11:00 </p>
<p>Morty comes up to woman at the bar after his High School crush thought he was being a weirdo. </p>
<p>Morty sees woman at the bar. </p>
<p>Morty: Ok here we go the evening continues</p>
<p>He approaches the woman and says &quot;Ma\'am Im afraid I got some bad news for you your money is no good here. Ill get the next round sir! (to bartender)</p>
<p>Woman: Aren\'t you a child?</p>
<p>Morty: Only in the ways that matter! I\'m Morty</p>
<p>Woman:sigh Stacey</p>
<p>Morty:Ive been watching you drink Stacey. I get the feeling you have a hard job. I wonder what it takes to please you? Part time full time be good at it bad at it! I want to be promoted, fired, corner office, hostile work place accident. I\'m on my knees Stacey, prayin! worshiping whatever you want!</p>
<p>Stacey: Ok fuck it</p>
<p>Next scene they get into a taxi and are shown making out. A 14 year old with an adult. </p>
<p>So standard plot goes on they ended up not having sex due to her getting stuck in a machine an evil Rick made.</p>
<p>Skip to 20:50. Morty through that same machine has become confident enough to somehow land a Wall Street job and is dating another adult women. More plot occurs when his high school crush and rick come to save him from the Space spas machine effects.. He decides to tell the women Jacqueline what happened. </p>
<p>Morty:Jacqueline I\'m not who I said I was</p>
<p>Jacqueline:You weren\'t a 14 year old boy from the Midwest who ran away from his family and capitalized on his lack of conscious by becoming a stock broker?</p>
<p>Morty: Oh. I guess I was up front about that</p>
<p>Jacqueline:You were up front about anything. You were my soulmate...</p>
<p>What the fuck. I was one of Rick and Morty\'s biggest fans am I the only one not seeing the blatant pedophile overtones? When I made a thread on Rick and Morty before people said Dan Harmon believed Pizzagate and was on our side. <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2076692">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2076692</a><br />
Then I see stuff like this the past cartoon short he made Unbelievable Tales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpejckQgpeg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpejckQgpeg</a></p>
<p>In it a man shits in a childs mouth at 1:35. In the same clip Mr.Jelleybean comes home at 2:33 and has two kids tied up in the house. He tells the crying tied up kids &quot;I want to let you go! I really really do! The time has come for me to dispose of you. I\'ve had my sexual fill and I can\'t let allow your presence to distract me from my job as headwriter and host of the television show Unbelievable Tales! God forgive me! He is then shown murdering the children by cutting off their faces and wearing the flesh on his face. At 3:36 A boy sees a man playing with a yoyo and approaches him saying wow thats walk the dog! The man says You got it! You rugrats sure love these yoyo tricks! You want to see a new trick I made myself? I promise I wont stick my dick in you. The boy says ok mister. The man then stabs the boy and rapes him through the hold in his chest. The whole time creepy offbeat children\'s music is playing.</p>
<p>This is all the other Mr.Jellybean clips in one of the Rick and Morty episodes. He\'s the King who rapes many of the villages children and tries to rape Morty</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdTUnCShXPc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdTUnCShXPc</a></p>
<p>As someone who once loved the show fuck Rick and Morty and fuck Dan Harmon. People were saying he was on our side and believed in Pizzagate yet his show and past shorts are filled with child rape and murder and pedophilia</p>',

            GTFO with this. Having Morty bang chicks and one swirl in a tripping scene doesn't mean the show writers are pro pedo.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also should stop pretending that consensual sex between teenagers and adults is equal to people molesting little kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not defending it, but it's different. Half our Grandmothers were married and pregnant at 14, and most of our grandfathers are older than grandmothers.
           </p>
           <p>
            You going to tell me that I support pedos if I don't condemn my grandparents?

            I heard that Dan Harmond said that 29 percent of Americans were Nazis.  I think it is amusing that Romney's 47 percent comment was supposedly super offensive while now Hillary gets to call all Trump supporters Nazis and the media cares not a whit.  The show also had tons of miscreants like Colbert and John Oliver as guests. Really isn't too surprising that they would go full degenerate.

            It's gonna get real boring after the perverts compromise everything and we have to stare at the carpet for entertainment.

            Oh, who am I kidding? People here are far too stoic for entertainment. The carpet is probably pretty standard fare.

            I understand the several references to pedophilia in Rick and Morty, but please post this on the other subreddit.
           </p>
           <p>
            This show clearly has some weird concepts in it and I believe they want the public to just take it as comedy, but they def have an agenda such as their topics range from hating God, to pedophilia, and constant murder.

            Let's please remember that there is a new woman I believe that is cowriting this season. Money talks or maybe Dan had to do whatever he could to continue the show.. he may actually have little say in the making of this season. What about Time Warner, one of Hillary Clinton's biggest supporters? Correct me if I'm wrong but they seem to run a lot of adult swim content.
Also to note I'm a big fan of the show and I haven't seen any of season 3..

             Like I said I was a huge a fan to. I loved seasons 1 and 2. I thought they were some of most genius, funniest dark humor I had ever seen. Rick Potion #9 had me in hysterics. Season 3 has been the downturn. If you do get a chance to watch the news episodes and read the comments. Many hate the new season.

            <p>
             Now that they have included demonic shit like Baphomet Adam and Eve with the eye of horus (all seeing eye), scenes of Rick on top of Jerry both naked with Rick looking like he is going to sodomize Jerry and what strangely looks to be the pedo little boy lover symbol Rick, Jerry, and the alien are all laying on naked in the previous episode

             Now this episode filled with pedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             The demonic and pedophile content shows somewhere along the line this show was hijacked. Dan Harmon destroyed his own show.
