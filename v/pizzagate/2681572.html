<p>America First Media Group reported yesterday that an inside source with knowledge of what occurred at the hospital on the early morning of 07/10/16, has revealed that former DNC Chairperson Donna Brazile and DC Mayor Muriel Bowser arrived shortly after EMT\'s had delivered Seth Rich for emergency treatment of two gunshot wounds to the torso.  Rich, age 27 at the time, was expected to survive his injuries but died during surgery.</p>
<p>American Media claims that with little information released publicly about the homicide by DC Metropolitan Police, America Media investigators had confirmed last year the hospital was, in fact, Medstar Hospital. and the surgeon who had started the operation on Rich and ultimately pronounced him as deceased, was Dr. Christine Trankiem.</p>

<p>The investigation now reveals the unexpected presence of the two prominent political figures shortly after the victim\'s arrival at the hospital.

<p>A quick recap on Donna Brazile - At the time of Seth Rich\'s death, she was the former Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman who also served as a CNN contributor and a Hillary for America donor who was caught providing HRC with questions that would later be asked of Clinton at a televised CNN town hall.  Brazile resigned as a CNN contributor after it was revealed in hacked e-mails from John Podesta\'s account that she leaked the questions to Clinton\'s campaign before CNN-sponsored events with the candidates.  
</p>
<p>Back to Seth Rich\'s death - Brazile not only had involvement the night Rich was shot but followed-up with the family afterwards.<br />
The latter is old news, but needs to be rehashed.  It was alleged that Brazile called the police and Seth Rich\'s family after the murder and demanded to know why a private investigator was snooping into his death.  This info was revealed by a veteran homicide detective, Rod Wheeler, who was hired by Rich\'s family to find the murderer.</p>
<p>Stated Wheeler to a media news outlet:  &quot;The high-ranking DNC official that called the police after I inquired about Rich\'s case was Donna Brazile.  Why shouldn\'t I reveal who it was?&quot;</p>
<p>Wheeler was eventually fired by the Rich family.  A spokesman for the family repeatedly critiicized Wheeler for not ruling out the possibility that Rich may have leaked DNC emails to WikiLeaks.  The Rich family wound up sending Wheeler a cease and desist order to stop his investigation into the murder. </p>
<p>Rich was pronounced dead on 07/10/16.  12 days after his death, 07/22/16, and days before the Democratic Party Convention in Philadelphia, WikiLeaks released 20,000 emails from DNC officials.</p>
<p>Wheeler had said in several inteviews that a federal investigator with elaborate details about Rich\'s connection to WikiLeaks was the credible source.  Wheeler initially refrained from revealing the identity of tahe DNC official who called the Rich family to inquire about the detective\'s snooping, but he said he felt less compelled to stay quiet about Brazile\'s identity after what he believed to be an unrelenting assassination of his character by the Rich family\'s spokesman.</p>
<p>That spokesman was Democratic political crisis consultant Brad Bauman, who ripped into Wheeler for not eliminating the possibility that Rich leaked e-mails and acsused the veteran detective of fabricating his claims in a desperate attempt for media attention.    About Seth Rich, Bauer stated that anyone who believes Rich may have leaked DNC e-mails &quot;deserve(s) a place in hell.&quot;</p>
<p>Brazile, on the other hand, called the possibility that Rich leaked DNC emails &quot;shameful...Seth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American.  This desire to scar Seth\'s legacy to his country and party is shameful.&quot;</p>

<p>Following Seth;s murder, Fox News was supporting the fact that the leaks came from an unamed FBI official and inside the DNC - not  &quot;Russian hackers&quot; as we were all being told to believe back then.  Fox further reported that the Democrats might have been connected to Rich\'s death and that a cover-up had thwarted the initial investigation.  Fox relied heavily on Wheeler.  But Fox was denounced heavily.  Within hours, Wheeler told other news outlets that Fox News had put words in his mouth.  Fox retracted their story saying the reporting process failed to live up to its standards.</p>
<p>But it\'s far from over.  Fox News was slapped with a lawsuit last summer by none other than Rod Wheeler who was also a longtime paid commentator for the network.  Wheeler alleged that Fox and a wealthy Trump supporter intended to deflect public attention from growing concern about the administration\'s ties to to the Russian government.  His suit charged that a Fox News reporter created quotations out of thin air and attributed them to him to propel a reporter\'s story.  Wheeler just want to remain not dead.</p>

<p>And last but not least, the Rich family filed a lawsuit agains Fox News in March of this year claiming that the network\'s coverage helped fuel damaging rumors about their son.</p>

            Donna Brazile is getting into it with Matt Couch on Twitter
            <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/donna-brazile-matt-couch-seth-rich/">
             https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/donna-brazile-matt-couch-seth-rich/
            </a>
            She sent a cease and desist letter to Matt Couch last week for defamation, and claims to have been in Seattle, but that was the day before.
           </p>
           <p>
            Donna Brazile "@RealMattCouch 
You should be ashamed of yourself. In addition to your deceitful lies about Mr Seth Rich, you have once again published a bogus claim. It’s time you focus on protecting our democracy and publish falsehoods."
            <a href="https://twitter.com/donnabrazile/status/1031535794241134592">
             https://twitter.com/donnabrazile/status/1031535794241134592
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            She feels that Couch should be ashamed of himself for suggesting that Seth Rich could have been the source of the DNC leak to WikiLeaks.
           </p>
           <p>
            She also feels that Couch should "protect our democracy", probably from Trump, by "publishing falsehoods", likely wanting him to link WikiLeaks to Trump or some baloney like that. Or maybe it's just a Freudian slip.

             , that is wierd.  First of all, that does not look like legitimate law firm letterhead.  There is always additional info on it, and there is no closing signature.
            </p>
            <p>
             Secondly, I cannot even find a "Marvin PV" firm.  There's a Marvin P.C. in Grand Rapids MI that primarily deal with immigration law.  And there's a Marvin and Marvin PLLC firm with offices in Pawling and Rhinebeck, NY.

              Betsy Marvin, an attorney, is Donna Brazile's best friend who Brazile famously hired just in case there was a lawsuit stemming from the DNC allowing Clinton to completely take over the party's finances, even before Hellary was officially the nominee.
             </p>
             <p>
              What's bizarre about the letter is the accusation of defamation.  Saying DB was at the hospital is not defamation.
             </p>
             <p>
              ETA I found the source for this fact, it's from DB herself:
Brazile Hired An Attorney To Represent Her Personally Because She Was Concerned That The Agreement Between The DNC And The Clinton Campaign Giving The Campaign Control Of DNC Finances Before She Was The Nominee Was "Shady Enough That It Might Produce A Lawsuit." "I hired my best friend, Betsy Marvin, to represent me personally in my capacity as the interim chair because I had become uncomfortable with some of the agreements that were consummated before I took on that role. Namely, the agreement that gave the Clinton campaign control over the party's finances before Clinton was the party's nominee. To me this seemed shady enough that it might produce a lawsuit and I wanted to be fully protected." (Donna Brazile, Hacks: The Inside Story Of The Break-Ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump In The White House , 2017, p. 224)

               I paid probably too close attention. I mean, shit was fascinating.  A whole network of personalities, complete with foes, foes that of course refrain from speaking certain details about each other, and story arcs, came out of the blue and was just there moving its growing audience between each other. Meanwhile, cnn was talking about russian pinterest memes, pokemon go, and free self defense courses for black males through meetup.

            Bear with me. If Donna Brazille- DB, and Muriel Bowser- MB, went to the hospital after Seth Rich-SR was shot, so what? That could happen anyway right? or at least a case could be made.
            <em>
             But why so quickly? and why so secretly?
            </em>
            but what I'm really suspicious about and don't understand is why they didnt come out for a photo op and take advantage?, why not address the press and capitalize on the situation? Why wasn't there the kind of gun confiscation speil?, "we must fight crime"  with "a war on crime" or some other bollocks DB and MB side by side for much
            <em>
             OPTICS
            </em>
            . DB is no stranger to capitalizing on SR's death. How well did DB's book do? didn't it
            <em>
             sellout
            </em>
            ? The fact she dedicated a book to him makes all the more sense now, I wonder if the "fear of her life" has subsided or been
            <em>
             subsidized
            </em>
            by the selling of her $30 "book". just a thought.

             <p>
              I haven't been able to definitively link Sava to Seth. I did discover a link on the_donald to an OANN report on youtube except when I followed it the video had been nuked. There was also a

              shortly after an anon posted proof he worked at the hospital and an OANN reporter wanted to interview him. Also I discovered several other links (mostly emanating from reddit) that are now defunct. Very fucking curious. Seems like this has been scrubbed hard.

              Needs more digging. Gotta be something out there. That Dr and his wife were HUGE hillshills.

              I don't doubt that Seth was killed by these guys, I'm talking about having proof of these two being at the hospital. It seems a little too far fetched to me, and as I said in another thread, there's a lot of nonsense, hyped build-up and begging/selling in the Matt Couch video. If he shows us proof then great, but what he's done so far amounts to squat, just the same old begging bowl out for the people hanging on this stuff.

             this is so easy to prove or disprove that people going out on a real limb to claim it are more likely than not to be telling the truth (unless they're jews).

             the next proper step is to ASK these two women if they were there and if so, why.
