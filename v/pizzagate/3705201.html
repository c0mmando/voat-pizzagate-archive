            High Profile Gay Mafia Victims

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Michael S. Ovitz
            </p>
            <p>
             One man described in the 80's and 90s as one of the most powerful men in tinseltown was Michael S. Ovitz. Co Founder of Creative Artists Agency, President of the Walt Disney Company - fired by Gay Mafia mogul
             <a href="https://kids.britannica.com/students/assembly/view/164890">
              Michael Eisner
             </a>
             in 1997 and replaced by a promoter of homosexuality Robert Iger, Iger in turn promoted more gay mafioso - such as openly gay propagandist Rich Ross as chairman of Walt Disney Studios.
            </p>
            <p>
             Former Ovitz employees who had infiltrated his once highly successful organization were suspected of actually being killer Dillers - Gay Mafioso. Bryan Lourd is one of these back stabbers. Lourd got his start as a talent agent working for Michael Ovitz, Ovitz refused to play ball with Gay gangsters and was blacklisted, which is when Lourd split from his organization and basically worked overtime to destroy it, it is theorized under the direction of Barry Diller.  He began by stealing clients away from his mentor, the hand that fed him, and his attempts , orchestrated by The Gay Godfather no doubt, have continued unabated , leaving Lourds with an estimated net worth of $35 million and Michael S. Ovitz a ruined man.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lourds now works for InterActiveCorp . InterActiveCorp is an online media company controlled by Barry Diller which openly promotes Gay Causes and panders to the Gay Community.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kevin Huvane is another Ovitz associate who joined with the Killer Dillers to help bring down Ovitz. Openly gay , Huvane is a close friend of Barry Diller , he was once a partner of Ovitz , but turned on him like a rabid dog when the timing was right.

             <em>
              The original co-conspirators, the core group of this media mob, are believed to be Barry Diller, Jann Wenner, and Sandy Gallen, powerful associates not solidly entrenched in the entertainment Industry included Calvin Klein, Truman Capote, Andy Warhol, Roy Halston. This was the core from which this societal decay can be traced to. They are perverts that congregated at Studio 54, engaged in their sadomasochistic and homosexual orgies and plotted the suppression of all who found their demented world view distasteful, as well as the advancement of all who would help promote their perverted agenda. They sought to elevate friends and destroy enemies.

            <p>
             Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Iger has scaled the mountain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Through a series of sure-footed moves, Iger has worked tirelessly to position Disney as the world’s preeminent entertainment company. Now he is closer to realizing his vision as the Burbank giant late Tuesday finalized its $71.3-billion purchase of much of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox.
            </p>
            <p>
             The acquisition is the boldest — and riskiest — of Iger’s 14-year stewardship of Disney. It’s the culmination of an expansionist strategy that has guided Iger as he has transformed the storied company through a series of takeovers that made Disney the home of “Star Wars,” “Black Panther” and “Incredibles 2.”

             The Mob is organized labor. Think Union Bosses. Our own Italian Mob lords became empowered thanks to a political party that ran on the Collective Labor skull fuckery. Collective Industry more like it. Throw in rigid price controls and we can't blame the mob for taking over trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
             All happened thanks to the Vatican bank sponsoring Benito and his Italian Warlords (old world mob) into the oldest and only Fascist government since 1922. This was only nine years after the Federal Reserve was sponsored by the same fucking Bank.
            </p>
            <p>
             To any who think the Vatican did not play both sides of every bloody conflict in Europe has not idea how the Roman Catholic Church operates as the oldest Military Intelligence on Earth. The Jesuits are the assassins and enforcers of both the Church and their Masters at the Vatican.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Vatican was the richest Bank after the first world war looting. By the second war they became rich enough to Blackmail world leaders to let Israel form. They were smart enough to control the fairy tail on Mossad, so they are not stupid.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hell, the Jesuits could whack a sitting President and not even bat an eye. Now that is the true power of Pedo-Blackmail.
            </p>
            <p>
             Fucking Vatican Pedovores have been in the War Orphan biz since before Mohammad was born. They taught the Pedophile Prophet how to be successful just so they could use Islam to stroke fear in the Appeasements to fight a manufactured cause for centuries now.

              Very interesting! Have read that the vatican demanded control over Germany's schools in return for their financing hitler....and the jesuits were so brutal in some of their torture , they shocked even the nazis. ........also have read and believe that the vatican controlled the world through the city of london.............................. they are all being quietly taken down now though. Complete restructuring of the true power players. ..............oh..Kevin Annette says pope's job is to keep the pedophiles out of prison. His third in command was over treasury and money laundering ........had to go to prison for pedophilia. ......resulting in pope being  in lots of trouble so is pope in name only.

               The Pope is a figurehead truth be told. While they have lost prestige and political clout they have a vast military intelligence. The same military savvy that showed the OSS how to use blackmail and extortion to win WWII. This is why the Fascist stayed in power after the war.
