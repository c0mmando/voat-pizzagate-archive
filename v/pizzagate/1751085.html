<p><strong>Boys and Girls Club of West AL president accused of child porn possession</strong></p>
<p>TUSCALOOSA, AL — The president of the Boys and Girls Club of West Alabama, Anthony Bush, is accused of possession of child porn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Northport Police Chief Carpenter says evidence was found on Bush\'s phone as a result of an unrelated assault case. On March 22, search warrants were executed at the Boys and Girls Club of West Alabama and Bush\'s residence. The next day, the electronic task force provided evidence, and the computer he used at work was obtained.</p>
<p>According to Northport police, no images involve any child at the Boys and Girls Club.</p>
<p>Anthony Bush is being held on a $200,000 bond.</p>
<p>&quot;I never would\'ve imagined something like this actually happening,&quot; said Irie Reed.</p>
<p>A disturbing discovery for most workers here at the boys and girls club.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever he does reflect on us and people know we work here. So i don\'t want anyone thinking we follow that type of behavior,&quot; said Precious Miller.</p>
<p>Assistant police chief Keith carpenter with Northpoint Police Department said the investigation for Bush started early march for an unrelated charge.</p>
<p>&quot;During that investigation, evidence were found on his personal cellphone that indicated that he was in some possible possession of child pornography,&quot; said Chief Carpenter.</p>
<p>Because of Bush\'s position with the Boys and Girls Club search warrants were issued.</p>
<p>On march 22nd warrants were issued to the boys and girls club and his residence, where more electronic devices were found with enough evidence to lead to his arrest.</p>
<p>&quot;None of those subjects that were found were related to anybody who attended the boys and girls club of west Alabama,&quot; said Carpenter.</p>
<p>Both Reed and Precious tutor at the Boys and Girls Club.</p>
<p>Reed said after having a few encounters with Bush, this is something he never suspected.</p>
<p>&quot;He seemed like a normal guy,&quot; said Reed.</p>
<p>In a statement provided by the Boys and Girls Club, they are aware of the allegations and want to assure that the safety and protection of young people are first priority. And they will alert parents once the process is complete.</p>',
