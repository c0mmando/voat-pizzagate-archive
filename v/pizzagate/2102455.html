<p><a href="https://steemit.com/news/@whitedeer9217/media-south-african-woman-raped-and-eaten-by-5-cannibals">This post discusses cannibalism in South Africa which occured recently</a>. </p>
<p>It is related to pizzagate because cannibalism founded the subject. Unlike many other aspects of pizzagate which are admittedly speculative, the spiritcooking and cannibalism references which helped spark this movement are undeniable and verified. </p>
<p>However, many have forgotten this aspect of the subject because it is incomprehensible to them. </p>
<p>It is easier to understand run-of-the-mill pedophile rings and child pornographers. As despicable as those acts are, John Podesta has been much more enthusiastic about eating people than about molesting children. </p>
<p>For example. </p>

<p>Here are undeniable images of the <a href="http://archive.is/WtRN4">Rothschilds</a> with mannequins \'for dinner.\' </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPI-mRFEIH0">Cannibalism is also the subject of Katy Perry\'s Bon Apetit video</a></p>
<p>The reason this ties specifically to pizzagate is that these modern groups - Podesta, Abramovic, The Rothschilds - are not only interested in cannibalism, they are also obsessed with native shamanic cultures which ALSO have histories of cannibalism. </p>
<p>This is evident in the disappearance of Michael Rockefeller, who went missing while &quot;studying&quot; a cannibalistic tribe in New Guinea. </p>
<p>A woman\'s death in South Africa may sounds distant from pizzagate, but it is not. It is part of the most legitimate area of pizzagate which has largely been ignored because it is so deeply bizarre that most people cannot understand that it exists despite the evidence. It was quickly forgotten, again, despite its veracity, in favor of other less verifiable specualation which is why this scandal was so easily dismissed by the press, in addition to that conveniently timed false flag. </p>

<p>Of important note is the mention of the killing having taken place as part of Muti Murder, which is associated with Witch Doctors specifically.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.imgtc.com/3ArST2j.png">https://i.imgtc.com/3ArST2j.png</a></p>
<p>Muti Murder is a shamanic, native ritualistic practice which has much interested those who are members of ritual abuse groups. </p>
<p>Ritual abuse is not only about pedophilic activities, it is about cannibalism, and torture, and the worst acts imaginable which many will never be able to comprehend - but the incomprehensible nature of the events also makes it easy to slip most people\'s attention, and to be very blatant about it in plain site, as we also see with Podesta and those associated with the pizzagate scandal. </p>
<p>The CIA, Tavistock and OSS were interested in trauma based mind control, so, by veiling their interest in shamanic societies under the cover of hippydom, they were able to study such cultures and implement some of their practices in the creation of Dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality disorder). This is why ritual abuse groups are almost always tied to intel agencies. They are virtually never separated; but their interest in shamanic traditions may be less spiritual than pragmatically motivated in studying the induction of altered states and ritual trauma.</p>
<p>As I explained in my <a href="https://steemit.com/news/@whitedeer9217/ra-anon-esalen-ring-pedophilia-tied-to-hai-global-harbin">RA Anon</a> series, especially in the posts relating to <a href="https://steemit.com/pizzagate/@whitedeer9217/ra-anon-esalen-pt-1">Esalen</a>, the ritualized cannibalism practiced historically and currently in many native prehistoric cultures is of particular interest to modern globalist and pedophile-tied ritual abuse groups. NGO\'s like Esalen are backed by the CIA, and were founded in connection to the OSS and Tavistock.</p>

            At the "core" of cannibalism is the need to control the souls of others and to nourish your own through ritualistic murder and consumption.   Sounds like the DNC and their RINO friends.

              The spirit cooking type ceremonies are a symbolic (only, we hope) form of cannibalism.

              John Podesta is a big fan of cannibalism. He bought a condo in CA yards from where the Donner Pass party cannibalized each other. His statue resembles photos of Dahmer victims.

               These don't exist.  Spirit cooking was a performance art piece and a "recipe book" of poems from the mid 1990's.
              </p>
              <p>
               Then the title of "spirit cooking" was reused for some fundrasing dinners.

               That's his brother, Tony's artwork.  And that statue had nothing to do with Jeffrey Dahmer.  The artist started working on that series of artworks years before Dahmer was arrested and even longer before the crime scene photos leaked.

            Yes, people who have grown up in our American bubble experience cognitive dissonance when confronted by stuff this extreme.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, this stuff is extremely ancient. And it's been kept alive, not just for centuries, but for milleniums. But people just dissociate when confronted with evidence that shit this horrible is still going on in our day.

            Something out of history that has always interested me is the fact that in ancient times, one of the reasons the Romans were disgusted by the Carthaginians and determined to wipe them off the map was because of the Carthaginian's mass sacrificing of children to a god called Cronus by Roman writers (called Baal Harmon by the Carthaginians, or Moloch by Biblical writers.)
           </p>
           <p>
            The historian Diodorus wrote that the Carthaginians once sacrificed 300 children in a double-down attempt to placate the angry gods.

            There's an interesting quote in the article about cognitive dissonance:
           </p>
           <p>
            "
            <em>
             colleagues, when they asked what I was working on, reacted in horror and said, 'Oh no, that's simply not possible, you must have got it wrong
            </em>
            .'"
           </p>
           <p>
            "
            <em>
             We like to think that we're quite close to the ancient world, that they were really just like us – the truth is, I'm afraid, that they really weren't
            </em>
            ."
           </p>
           <p>
            To which I would add: "
            <strong>
             We like to think that we're quite close to the power elites in the modern world, that they are really just like us - the truth is, I'm afraid, that they really aren't
