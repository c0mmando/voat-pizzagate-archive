<p>The writer of the article, Rochelle Keyhan, has an interesting bio (more info on that at the end). She is a former Philadelphia prosecutor and has been involved with a number of anti-trafficking organizations.</p>
<p>She offers some valuable insider insights into <strong>how the fight against human trafficking is falling short,</strong> and provides some <strong>suggestions on how it  should be improved.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sex traffickers snag some 200,000 young people born and raised in the U.S.</strong> A good percentage are in Texas. <strong>Yet</strong> across all 18,000 U.S. cities with police departments, <strong>only 800 human trafficking cases are initiated each year,</strong> according to the 2019 State Department U.S. Trafficking in Persons Report.</p>
<p><strong>Few prosecutions of sex traffickers occur because traffickers jump state lines and there is no national human trafficking database.</strong> Most police departments lack the inter-state data that can identify a trafficking case versus the lesser crime of promoting prostitution in one’s own city.</p>
<p>Sadly, <strong>there is little oversight of victims even if they reach out for help.</strong> Last year the federal National Human Trafficking Hotline logged 14,000 calls from victims. <strong>Many callers were referred to agencies</strong> that potentially could help, but <strong>we have no data that confirms they did.</strong> The hotline has no follow-through component, no feedback loop that makes sure a social worker checks on the caller after a referral, and no check-ins with agencies to see if the caller was indeed served.</p>
<p>Many referral agencies are overwhelmed and understaffed. Was their line busy when the victim called? Was a bed available for the caller, or for more than one paid night in a hotel as a transitional escape? Did the caller leave a name? <strong>Few callers have a home address or a phone that isn’t monitored by the trafficker.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then offers some suggestions to improve the ability to go after traffickers and follow through with assistance for victims.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Add feedback loops to the national hotline that checks on whether a referral resulted in help.</strong> Circle back to the caller, if possible, to see what more is needed to escape the trafficker. It takes courage to make the call, and often at great risk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable collaborative data among police departments that can help prosecutors convict traffickers that work across state lines.</strong> I share my prosecutorial experience with 204 city police departments across 37 U.S. states. <strong>Sharing data in a national databank needs to be part of a federally funded effort.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Allocate resources to keep impoverished young women and men</strong> from succumbing to traffickers by providing more safe housing for runaways. If we can quickly build extra testing and hospitals for a virus threat, <strong>surely we can build more safe housing for victims of sex traffickers seeking escape.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Encourage far better oversight of foster homes. Traffickers sometimes place their young victims in a foster home to recruit other kids in the house, so it’s important to have trained social workers interview placements.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
