            “Latinamilk” is really “thirdworldangel” Rachina Miruku. Looks like she may have seen the posting as she now only has four pics up. On the other hand, Doyle Mills is and has been a lifelong creep, read the comments on the other posts to understand. Do any of you remember BBianka the European Canibal or whatever name she went by? I hope she has broken away from her satanic family and is getting help.

              I do see how this would stop someone. Financially. They simply couldn't afford to do this. I can understand this would be an incredible obstacle for some.

              <p>
               The same thing can be said for anyone who has a loved one die. So you expect me to feel sorry for someone who is murdering their own baby because murdering your child is too expensive? And do you really think that the cost of an abortion should be low and affordable, so everyone can go get one? Last time I checked, free stuff is not a right in this country... abortion is not an entitlement benefit.
              </p>
              <p>
               According to this though, it's the medical providers who are required to ensure proper disposal so assuming that they pass that cost onto the "consumer" it's $450 - $1000.
               <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-fetal-burial-rule-days-costs-implementation-remain/story?id=44163663">
                https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-fetal-burial-rule-days-costs-implementation-remain/story?id=44163663
               </a>
               That's less than the cost of raising a child (I have 7) so they should probably just be thankful that they can still murder their child.
              </p>
              <p>
               I would bet anything that if you were to look into the connections this judge has to the black market baby parts industry you might eventually find something there. He's a Reagan appointee and he is from Hawaii. Possibly not a good person, based on this ruling I'd say it's very likely he's not a good person.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is not about women's rights, it's about protecting Planned Parenthoods so they can keep profiting off selling the parts. You know Texas instituted this to fight the black market baby parts industry and not to impede abortions, right? A Houston Grand Jury tried to indict Center for Medical Progress activists for presenting false ID rather than indicting Planned Parenthood for violating the body parts laws on a huge scale.

                Yeah, I get it. Why do you think I'm here?

               <p>
                I disagree in that poor/disadvantaged women don't need to be punished be Planned Parenthood is a smoke screen. It's the equivalent of The Clinton Foundation helping Haiti.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think there should be abortions ... and I think Planned Parenthood needs to be dismantled. I for one would fine it difficult to believe they've done nothing to deserve being investigated and charged.

                 Well a poor or disadvantaged woman has 12 weeks in TX to come up with the money and it is certainly cheaper than diapers, formula, losing your job, etc. Or she can also take a $50 morning after pill. There are endless possibilities for ways to murder your child - she could even start taking a bunch of herbs to have a miscarriage at home. Usually the father or someone in her family pays for it anyway. I've never had an abortion and never would. And I have no sympathy for baby killers.
                </p>
                <p>
                 After 12 weeks the cost of an abortion probably goes up, but I've seen plenty of people walk into an abortion clinic 30 weeks pregnant. Nothing will stop someone determined to get an abortion.

           <p>
            Is this in reference to their belief in survival of the fittest, the fittest being the adepts and the luciferians who will be the ultimate winners and all the good people will become their plebs?

            , can you please include a link showing this person has some connection to pedophelia. It is not clear whether she is a minor, or not. Flairing per Rules 1 and 2. Thanks for editing to show this is directly related to child sex abuse by the elite.

              Thanks for editing. Between her drawings and threat against Woody, I'd say this is probably related to child sex abuse. I will remove the flair.

              Dental chairs feature heavily with these people.  This year's Gucci runway show featured medical gurneys in an operating room environment. PVC on the walls and floors, fire doors with panic-bars, LED lamps, and plastic chairs like those in a waiting room.

             <p>
              The designer said it was all about 'the act of cutting, splicing and reconstructing'.  From the medical gurneys, clearly it's about cutting, splicing and reconstructing humans.

            had on his thread  that Mills resided in Reston Va. for a while.  Training?  You mentioned the connection of Scientology with CIA and now Mills is trying to unite all religions?  Could this be what he is doing with the CIA's blessing?

             He's been doing that Pave the Way thing for years going back way farther than I've known him. It doesn't seem he's making progress uniting all religions since most people think Scientology is stupid AF. I think most of what he does is screw around with those fiber optic cables he works with, probably surveillance, and also harassment programs, and possibly child finding. In my humble opinion Scientology is a cover and their entire organization is an intelligence branch of the U.S. Govt.

             He's a nice guy at first, but eventually the pedo factor makes itself known, and the frotteurism is too much, and the creepiness comes out becomes very apparent. That's how pedos get people to trust them - through friendliness.

              I remember we were researching him and we noticed he made quite a few trips back and forth from Tampa to Texas and back and forth, etc.  Some of us thought he was finding children and taking them down to Texas and dropping them to someone.  I think there was even a pic of the Airline ticket.  God this is sick stuff.  Yes, that's how they get into people's good graces, by Grooming Tricks.  Especially single moms.  Women that like to get flirty with a guy and before you know it they are babysitting their kids.  Scary.
