            Racine is known as a main ratline from Chicago to Canada with a history linked to the Underground Railroad. On a related note one such victim of trafficking from Canada died in Racine after being tortured for a long period of time. She is known as Racine County Jane Doe. The case was unsolved, and there have been many other trafficking and satanic related murders in Racine over the years. Wisconsin is known as a place of great Evil and spiritual power. Look into ancient discoveries in Wisconsin, Man Mound, Mound Cemetery, underground tunnels, secret societies, and systems of trafficking and abuse.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lincoln Park in Racine is at a major hub along the Root River that leads to the Great Lakes. It has historic significance. They do extensive testing there, and if you research experiments in Racine and Flint, Michigan you will find out what the tests revealed. Then look at infant mortality rates in Racine, particularly for minorities. We also know that Podestas, Clintons, Ashton Kutcher, Anthony Weiner, and Tom DeLonge have connections with Racine, and we know Racine is a major hub for trafficking and global corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lincoln Park is also the place that Judge Dennis Barry was "suicided" in the Root River with a shotgun in something of a ritualistic manner. It was covered up by the corrupt examiner and police who were in the same secret societies as him. It happened right after he abruptly resigned from the Rotary club and other groups amid allegations of drug and drinking habits, abuse, deep corruption, and a possible divorce that may have revealed many darker secrets. Now others who were involved in secret society corruption and crimes that know what really happened to Judge Dennis Barry hold a country club golf outing in his name. They are all closely connected with the power players in Racine who are involved in brazen levels of criminal corruption, racketeering and other crimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are also involved in starting a corrupt organization called the Racine Anti-Trafficking Coalition, also known as the  Fight to End Exploitation, also known as the I-94 Project. Look at the partners and sponsors.
           </p>
           <p>
            Whether Linkin Park is tied to Lincoln Park in Racine through the Podestas remains to be seen, but one thing is certain. Racine is the "Root" and model to the entire system and real Agenda of Global Enslavement and the Mark of the Beast.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is a nice quote from Tony about how he initially got started in Racine from a 2002 interview -
           </p>
           <p>
            DN:    What did you do after the New Hampshire campaign?
           </p>
           <p>
            TP:    I went off, you know, I sort of called in to headquarters and said, “What do I do now?” and we were, we sort of went off.  I was sent off to Wisconsin and arrived in Milwaukee a couple of days, you know, on Thursday or something, it was like two weeks later was the Wisconsin primary.  The Illinois primary was in between, I had handed that off to Jim Johnson in the meantime.  And so I went to Wisconsin and Harold Ickes was in charge of Wisconsin, who later went on to be deputy chief of staff to President Clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            And Harold said, you know, a bunch of people started funneling in from various places around the country because we were doing poorly and we, you know, it made no sense to have people working in California for the June primary, kind of like everybody started trying to build a firewall in Wisconsin.  Wisconsin was heavily Polish, heavily Catholic and moderate and, you know, Clem Zablocki was the congressman.  And it was sort of, people thought it was the kind of place we should be able to do okay in.  And so I went off to Kenosha and Racine, the first congressional district where Les Aspen, who was the sort of, about to be running for, I think it was, I don't know if he was running the first time or running for, or was a freshman congressman running for reelection.  It was right around the time he ran the first time; we worked a lot with him. But I got a list of the people who were for Muskie from Harold at the headquarters in Milwaukee and went down and started calling them up in Kenosha and Racine. "

             , okay so you know by now that I live close to Racine but on the IL side. Know of anyone from Lake Forest, Winnetka, or any of the other uber wealthy suburbs connected to it in any way Pizza related?? Just cause there's soooo much old money families around here that there has to be.

              Yes that area is full of connections. Have you seen the hospital campuses expanding? That is to handle more transfusions, transplants and harvesting. You do know the Podestas are linked to Lake Forest? Tony was a professor at Barat College in Lake Forest (he never finished at MIT). There are also links in the area to Michael Aquino and the Snake Lady.

              Jeffrey Epstein is going to hell for rape and abuse. He should be in jail for trafficking. he has been so busy at the Lake Forest Train Stations in IL , especially in 2009-2010. Ghislaine Maxwell hung out with her pedophile ex bf. Jeffrey Epstein allegedly "procuring" the young girls to him . she also love sandy weill and hangs out with him at the One andONly Club in the Bahamas– spring 2012 to be exact .
I made a thread for it here:

             <p>
              Lake Forest is a very wealthy town, Tony Podesta once worked there as Admissions Director of the now closed Barat College a Catholic women's school*, there was a rash of teen suicides by train, and there's a rail connection to Racine, Wisconsin.

Many movies and books have included Lake Forest as it is a beautiful town with lovely architecture, but these three films stuck out a little:
Damien: Omen II: Lake Forest Academy was used as the Thorn Mansion, home to Damien the to-be Antichrist.
The Unborn: Barat College was used as the setting for a Jewish "exorcism" to remove an evil spirit which was the result of a Nazi experiment
The Fury: A Lake Forest home was used as the facility for a CIA black ops to turn kidnapped people into weapons

              The founder of Rotary was from Racine and they are celebrating 100 years by taking over the main park and hall on Lake Michigan in a corrupt back room racketeering deal while they build a hockey arena for billionaires in another kickback scheme and rigged development deal. Rotary, and other service clubs and groups including Lions, Kiwanis, United Way, Red Cross, Salvation Army, and others are involved in global corruption with links to trafficking networks and the agenda for Global Enslavement and Population Control. Specifically Rotary is involved in virus and vaccination programs, and with privatized control of public resources including community policing and education reform for a pipeline of slave labor from cradle to grave.

            There are more sources including some direct testimony. It is deeply hidden. There is record of this being an actual CIA base involved in MK Ultra. I will post more as I get it. Just posted for others to start searching and adding.

            Good lead - The Shit the CIA did in Canada is not as widely known as it should be - and even though I knew about Lincoln Park I never thought to connect it with Linkin Park... Fuck
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are a few more resources with regards to the experiments in Canada - I would like to see this lead get a few more sources.

            While I personally don't discount stories like this... and there is a TON of information on the MKUltra project(s) out there, I feel like these accounts are almost always missing concrete information. Even a video/audio testimony would be helpful in solidifying these claims.

            Being sourced from a blog that has no sources listed is dubious at best.

            The connection to Lincoln Park = Linkin Park is certainly an interesting concept in light of Bennington's death.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, super interested in this and the potential connection, just wish there was something concrete to sink our teeth into.

             He is a Tavistock scientist who wrote a book on this stuff, was Dr Cameron's counterpart and writes candidly and casually of using cult behavior, interrogation methods, torture... blanking people's minds with sensory deprivation... it is very, very real.

              I can't imagine with all we know about Allan Dulles and the CIA and the evil they have done in secret to undermine our nation and in acts of treason that anyone could question MKULTRA's victims. 
Again, as in most cases, the criminals have the evidence and Richard Helms on his retirement made sure that the records from Monarch were destroyed because he feared this information getting out.

              "Listen to the children" .... listen to the victims.  They are the ones to be trusted.

              Thank you!

              PS:  Also included use of LSD ...
but I just want to comment on how phenomenal the human mind is.
Many of the MKULTRA victims through their own wisdom and the power of the mind 
have regained full memory.
              <br/>
              In fact, it's been mentioned that even when still being victimized, by the age of about 30
the mind begins to try to pull itself together, to regain full knowledge.
At that point, it is said that these victims become a danger for those carrying out these
programs and they are in danger of being murdered when this happens.
