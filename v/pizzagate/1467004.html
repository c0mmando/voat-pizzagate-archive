<p>Which do you find more persuasive, overstatement or understatement?</p>
<p>Personally, when I hear an overstatement, I hear a plea for attention, but I also feel resistance inside myself. I want to correct, to downplay, to minimize. Conversely, when I hear understatement, I first find myself agreeing with the unarguable substance of the statement, then recognizing that it is an understatement.

<p>What we <strong>know</strong> about &quot;pizzagate&quot; is that the Podesta\'s are weirdos, that JimmyComment has a sick sense of humor, and there is something very odd going on. We have questions about the topics and the language used in the Podesta emails, about the art that Tony Podesta loves, and about the decor and the bands at Comet Ping Pong. In fact, we have questions about that whole block.</p>
<p>I could list all day about the things we now know, but more to the point is what we <strong>don\'t</strong> know. Specifically, we don\'t know that any of these people actually abuse kids. We certainly don\'t know that any kids are hidden anywhere in D.C., much less that trafficked children have ever been anywhere near Comet Ping Pong. Yes, we can speculate and discuss the possibilities, but these speculations should be clearly marked as such. Yes, I know you\'re smart enough to know what\'s fact and what\'s speculation, but perhaps not everybody reading these posts is as smart as you.</p>
<p>Please consider what I\'m saying here. Don\'t stop, if you have what it takes to keep going... but please, speculate with caution, and <strong>understate</strong> your conclusions. You might be wrong... and if you are wrong, even a tiny bit wrong, the forces opposed to you will jump all over your error to discredit everything you and this effort has found.</p>
<p>IMO. FWIW.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>',
