<p>Award-winning filmmaker Carlos Carvalho died after an accident while shooting the ITV series Wild at Heart. He was tragically killed when a giraffe attacked him while he was getting a shot of the animal.</p>
<p>Carvalho had been working on the majority of the series about a British family who have set up a game lodge in South Africa. While shooting a closeup of Gerald the giraffe’s body and feet at the Glen Afric Country Lodge, the animal became “inquisitive” and headbutted him sending him 16 feet in the air and causing massive head injuries.</p>
<p>After the attack, he was airlifted to Johannesburg’s Milpark Hospital. He died on Wednesday night from his injuries. The announcement of his death was made via a statement on the film crew agency CallaCrew’s Facebook page: “It is with a very sad heart that we have to announce the passing of Carlos Carvalho‚ one of our favourite DOP’s. Carlos was filming a feature at Glen Afric and had a fatal run in with a giraffe on set. He was flown to Milpark Hospital but succumbed to his injuries 20:50 last night. Our thoughts and condolences go out to Carlo’s family and friends during this very sad time. He will be sorely missed.”</p>
<p>Carvahlo won the Silver Lion at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003 for a public service announcement for CHILDLINE. He was also honored in 2014 with an African Movie Academy Cinematography Award for his work on The Forgotten Kingdom.</p>
<p>CHILDLINE  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childline">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childline</a></p>
<p>Childline is a counselling service for children and young people up to their 19th birthday in the United Kingdom provided by the NSPCC.[1] Childline deals with any issue which causes distress or concern, common issues dealt with include child abuse, bullying, mental illness, parental separation or divorce, pregnancy, substance misuse, neglect, and psychological abuse.[2]</p>
<p>In 1986 Esther Rantzen, presenter of That\'s Life!, a popular consumer TV show, suggested to the BBC that they create &quot;Childwatch&quot;, a programme about child abuse that was screened on 30 October 1986 on BBC1, the aim being to try to detect children at risk before their lives were in danger. Viewers were asked if they would take part in the survey in an edition of That\'s Life!. A helpline was opened after the programme so that any child currently suffering abuse could call for help. Rantzen, together with her BBC producers Sarah Caplin and Ritchie Cogan, therefore suggested they should create a helpline specifically for children in danger or distress, to be open throughout the year, 24/7, and launch it on the programme.[4] The project was made possible by a benefactor Ian Skipper who underwrote the charity for the first three years.</p>
<p>Childline has 12 counselling centres around the UK, staffed largely by volunteers. The bases are located in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Manchester, Liverpool, Prestatyn, Birmingham, Nottingham, London, Belfast and Foyle, supported by the online only centres at Leeds and Cardiff. A restructure in 2011 saw the closure of the Childline bases in Exeter and Edinburgh, with Swansea relocating to Cardiff.[6] As many as 4,500 children phone Childline every day, though only 2,500 of these callers can be answered due to lack of resources. Since the merger with the NSPCC the service has expanded, and depends on public generosity to pay for the children\'s phone calls.</p>
<p>Another death in the entertainment industry connected to helping children involved in abuse.  Since we know the entertainment industry is government controlled here in the US, and the UK. Since there are many locations of Childline in the UK this has a UK connection.</p>',
