<p>OP: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to the &quot;official statement&quot;, this crime has not been &quot;debunked&quot; as a hoax. Mysterious deaths have surrounded the information coming to light. Many witnesses and victims of the crime had their lives threatened, and several of the key witnesses, despite being warned to back down, did not take back their claims which resulted in perjury charges and prison sentences. Why would they allow themselves to endure this over a simple lie? This conspiracy runs deep and they want it to be silenced for as long as possible.</p>

<p>It wasn\'t just purgery charges, they rounded up the rest of them on various charges such as possession etc. The key thing to note is that the only ones who seen any real formal prosecution were the victims. It\'s sickening.</p>

<p>Comment: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cant find it now but I read somewhere that Troy Boner died in hospital after running in there yelling about how people were trying to kill him</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OP response: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot; In 1990, according to DeCamp:</p>
<p>“Troy Boner was going to provide the information in open court, under oath, that would blow the lid off the Franklin case, and force a new trial for Alisha Owen [another victim].…As Troy came into the courthouse, he was immediately ushered into a private room by county judicial authorities...the hearing was delayed for one hour.…Troy was in the room with a ‘Special Attorney,’ and with other officials from the prosecutor’s office--the very same prosecutorial team Troy was about to testify against.
“...Troy leaned over and whispered to me, ‘Oh God, forgive me. They guaranteed if I talk here today, they will put me away for twenty years...told me I would be charged with perjury for my original testimony if I opened my mouth today in court….Look what they did to Alisha [she was sent to prison--totally set up by the feds through a phony perjury charge]….Look what they did to my brother [his brother Shawn was found dead after playing “Russian Roulette”].”</p>
<p>In late 2003, just before the 2004 election campaign started to heat up, Troy Boner walked into a hospital in New Mexico, screaming out “they’re after me, they’re after me because of this book,” meaning The Franklin Cover-up, which he was waving in the air.</p>
<p>After Boner was mildly sedated and calmed down, he was put in a private room for observation.</p>
<p>When nurses came back to check on him early the next morning, he was sitting in a chair, bleeding from the mouth and quite dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Wow.</p>

            King never paid the million dollars,  either. He owed it to Paul A. Bonacci, who claimed he helped kidnap

             The Harmon Tucker case is particularly weird. He was found dead near Valdosta GA, where
             <a href="http://cavdef.org/w/index.php?title=Ray_Lemme">
              Ray Lemme
             </a>
             died mysteriously and where there appears to be
             <a href="http://cavdef.org/w/index.php?title=Valdosta_sex_ring_allegations">
              another powerbroker pedophile ring
             </a>
             like the Franklin scandal. I got the Georgia Bureau Investigation (GBI) report on his death and made
             <a href="http://cavdef.org/w/index.php?title=Valdosta_sex_ring_allegations#Valdosta_elite_pedophilia">
              some notes
             </a>
             : the alleged murderer, Walter Gerald Ellis, insinuated that Tucker was a pedophile but was himself suspected in the abduction of a 6-year-old boy. He also kept talking to police about serial killer Richard Speck upon his arrest, a weird parallel to how Sirhan Sirhan ranted about Albert DeSalvo after he was arrested (both Sirhan and DeSalvo were treated by the same hypnotist William Joseph Bryan).

             And I'd like to add the state trooper who was first on the crime scene of the Caradori plane crash. Allegedly some photographs were in the wreckage. A short time later the trooper was driving with his wife and their car was struck. The wife died but he survived and hasn't spoken out publically re: the photos. I will try to find the articles to give more info on this....

            I have upvoted your post because the Franklin scandal needs as much attention as possible, but your title is not entirely correct. Peter Citron was convicted of sex crimes against underage boys and served time in prison. Robert Wadman, the police chief, was forced to resign. Larry King, jailed for financial crimes, had a one million dollar judgement made against him as a result of a civil lawsuit.
           </p>

            They deserve much worse, of course.

             Larry King wasn't punished for crimes related to the rape of children, though. Thank you for the reminder about Pete Citron. He actually lived a few blocks from me when I was growing up. He used to invite all the little boys, including my little brother, over to his basement to play after they were done at the local pool, where Pete hung out. I was always a bit jealous because I never got invited, and this was an adult! A famous one! I've never asked my brother what went down. Doubt he wants to remember.

             Thanks again for this correction.

              I consider a $1,000,000 judgement to be punitive, though of course it is not the same as a criminal conviction.

               Caradori had supposedly gotten numerous incriminating photographs from Rusty Nelson who was a long time photographer at many of these events.
These pictures were removed from the crash site in which Caradori and his son were killed.
Nelson has some informative videos online discussing these matters (if they have not been removed).

                Because his photographs document pedophilia, murder and corruption at the highest levels of world government, Rusty has been relentlessly pursued for the past 20 years.
               </p>
               <p>
                According to Rusty, without tangible evidence, he was jailed as a sex offender, and subjected to extensive CIA mind control techniques of sleep deprivation, mass drugging, and repatterning by endless loop tapes.
               </p>
               <p>
                Rusty relates horrific tales of his incarceration.
               </p>
               <p>
                My interview includes much more detail on Franklin matters, new information on Rusty’s programming, and a walk through the farm house which was violently raided to destroy the evidence that would have set him free.

            I couldn't imagine living such a horrible life. To have the things happen to you like Bonacci, Boner, Owens and then have nothing but injustice after injustice take place afterwards is absolutely devastating. A true crime against humanity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Decamp and Gunderson are both absolute frauds of the worst kind imo I'm glad they're both dead. They didn't stop anything from happening and in all likelihood did quite the opposite. One of the worst, most obvious cases of institutionalized top to bottom pedophilia there is.

              Just like Alex Jones right? Who would know about the noo werld ordur if not for him?

              So we all knew it went on, but was one single person brought to justice by Decamp or Gunderson? No. On the contrary. The victims wound up locked up, dead or discredited. Was Vatican/Jesuit involvement brought up even once in his book? Nope.

             <p>
              I'm quite surprised pg'ers here are so dismissive about them being controlled opposition. It's actually the only explanation for why essentially nothing happened to any of the alleged perpetrators to this day but the victims were treated like trash.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also haven't seen one lick of evidence that Gunderson was murdered either. If you have any I'd happily check it out.

               I agree with your assessment. Actually David Shurter, one of the victims, said that DeCamp was a limited hangout, and a pedo himself, who wrote the book in order to control the narrative. Sadly, he recently scrubbed his website, in order to 'start a new life'.

                I'm not trying to cause any trouble but it's very important to figure out who is involved, and what their role is. Eventually they will run out of shills if we name them all. Sadly,  the good guys always wind up dead or silenced one way or another which makes decamp and Gunderson all the more suspect.

                 Correct. Cognitive dissonance occurs when someone is presented with information that challenges one of their currently held beliefs. Many people are quick to dismiss the new information as false, instead of evaluating it (and their current beliefs) in order to discern true from false. To "believe" in something implies that one is making a leap of faith, or otherwise doesn't have all of the information to really be able to tell whether something is true or false. It's better to avoid "believing" altogether, and to focus on what one knows to be true without a doubt. Beliefs are easily exploited; they leave plenty of room for manipulation by those who wish to maintain power.

             I can say that Gunderson laid his ass on the line to teach me and you for that matter the truth of this subject much earlier than it became known as pizzagate.  And it would seem that he paid the ultimate price for teaching is but what do I know?!

              The best way to control the opposition is to lead it. Alex Jones, Ted Gunderson(who was in his 80s and was practically irrelevant at the time of his death) Hal Turner, Decamp, Ventura, Icke are all fraudsters along with many many others.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you really think either Decamp or Gunderson would have made it through the Franklin years unscathed if they were actually trying to blow the lid off things? Not a chance. They'd both be deader than Boner just look at what they did to the lead investigator Caradori, who had the actual damning evidence before they blew him out of the sky. I thought they were legit for about six or seven years after learning about them but it's a near guarantee they aren't who they appear.

               This. A crucial point to consider when thinking about others who claim to lead the fight against the elite. Those who are really a threat get taken out. The ones allowed to live and keep "spreading awareness" are the ones being controlled.

              I couldn't imagine living such a horrible life. To have the things happen to you like Bonacci, Boner, Owens and then have nothing but injustice after injustice take place afterwards is absolutely devastating. A true crime against humanity.

             I was triggered by visiting this sub the other day, when a post about the Hampstead children was trending. They are a horrific but perfect example of this horror.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can say that Alicia Owens is doing very well today. But I am horrified by what the two Hampstead siblings have in store for them.

              I'm glad Alisha Owens is doing well. It's remarkable anyone could be after what she went through. I imagine she's tried to put it all behind her. I wonder how Paul Bonacci is?

              This subject really gets to be too much to deal with sometimes. It can be helpful to escape from the darkness and into the sunshine now and then.

               So true. From what i understand he is not doing well. Even mild sexual abuse of children can result in wrecked lives. Just look into the eyes of the young Hampstead girl....

             If Gunderson was helping rather than stopping it, he would not have been off'ed. And calling Decamp a fraud is absolute blasphemy. You must be a shill, I'm sorry to say. No rational, honest person could come to the conclusion you have.

              No evidence he was offed. Gunderson can't be trusted, he was a spook. Gunderson was connected to Anton Lavay. Gunderson was subordinate to Michael Aquino but never mentioned this. Gunderson and Aquino put on a performance together on Geraldo, where Aquino came out looking like Dracula. It looked scripted.

              Just to play devil's advocate, Gunderson was the FBI's Los Angeles chief during the height of the COINTELPRO operations. He, without doubt was aware and participated.

              I can't speak for Decamp, but here's an old Voat post outing Gunderson

               It might be futile for me to try to respond to this, but I have looked at the information against Gunderson and do not find it very convincing. The note telling of his "marriage" could have easily been faked (why does it look like it was fished out of a garbage can?), and even if it wasn't, it only says that he had a relationship with a woman named Diana that didn't work out. All other "proof" related to his "marriage", as far as I'm aware, is based on the personal testimony of individuals who could be lying or insane.
              </p>
              <p>
               This does not mean that I firmly believe that everything Gunderson ever said is 100% true.

             The Franklin Child Prostitution Ring conspiracy reveals how rogue elements at all levels of government have been involved in systematic child sex abuse and pedophilia to feed the base desires of key politicians. If you aren't aware of this event yet, you need to see this. It's just horrible. : conspiracy
