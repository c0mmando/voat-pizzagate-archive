           Not sure if this has been brought up before, but I think it may be time to think about to possible connections between the SLC daycare and pizzagate. While I was reading last night, someone had mentioned that they had tracked trafficking activities from cities that happened to be located along I-80, i.e. Omaha, Chicago, etc. If you take a look on a map, you'll notice that Salt Lake City is also located on I-80.

            Someone a few months ago posed as a parent thinking of using them as a daycare for his kids. I can't remember if they were approached in the parking lot by a paranoid guard or if they actually got in and the rooms were weird with random tv's for conferencing. Maybe both.
