<p>Post (archived), a jewish transgender “man” openly revealed his desire to target our children with LGBT indoctrination:</p>
<p>I Have Come to Indoctrinate Your Children Into My LGBTQ Agenda (And I’m Not a Bit Sorry)</p>
<p>I am here to tell you: All that time I said I wasn’t indoctrinating anyone with my beliefs about gay and lesbian and bi and trans and queer people? That was a lie. All 25 years of my career as an LGBTQ activist, since the very first time as a 16-year-old I went and stood</p>
<p>shaking and breathless in front of eleven people to talk about My Story, I have been on a consistent campaign of trying to change</p>
<p>people’s minds about us. I want to make them like us. That is absolutely my goal. I want to make your children like people like me</p>
<p>and my family, even if that goes against the way you have interpreted the teachings of your religion. I want to be present in their emotional landscapes as a perfectly nice dad and writer who is married to another guy. Who used to be a girl (kind of). Who is friendly and cheerful and not scary at all, no matter what anyone says.</p>
<p>I would also like to know: Why are we so afraid of admitting this? I ask as a person who quailed before this accusation (and its slimy misguided undertones of pederasty) for more than two decades. That is our job: to encourage people, especially children, to think differently about a subject than they do now. To dispel the dim and dismal miasma of myths and stereotypes, and instead allow the light of truth and fairness to shine in. That’s the deal, my friends. And if we have done it — if we have come to a place where a kid has been struggling in the muck of ignorance and hatred, and helped them up and cleaned them off and sent them to play in a meadow of love or at least kindness — then baby, we have done the thing well.</p>
<p>At the moment, I am helping to put the finishing touches on a series of children’s books that all feature lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer kids or families. There are six books, and they are racially and ethnically diverse, filled with girls and women doing cool things, page upon page of kids enacting their own identities in joyous and peaceful ways. There’s no bullying or shaming in these books, and no Very Special Episode identity politics — it’s just happy kids being well, solving problems, having adventures, loving and being loved. They have lesbian mums and gay dads and big extended queer chosen families; some are gender-independent. But what they all are is present. They are all in the books, on the page, on the landscape.”</p>
<p>This is liberalism with the mask off – a nasty, perverted, and subversive ideology that targets the most vulnerable and impressionable members of society – our children.</p>
<p>They are not motivated by anything good; rather, they hate everything that White, Christian, and normal society represents, and they want to destroy it and rebuild it in their own twisted image.  They call this “Tikkun Olam” or “healing the world.”</p>
<p>That this gender-confused queer is jewish is not a coincidence – Jews have dominated the LGBT movement, and they use this perversion to further undermine our Christian values which stand in the way of their ruinous agenda.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, there are jewish billionaires helping sell this transgender insanity to our children.</p>
<p>And if you have a problem with it, you will be smeared as a racist, homophobic antisemite, or other “evil” sounding names.</p>

            This is sick. When you talk to a child they can’t take it all in at one time. But put it in a book with cute illustrations and they can read it over and over. Yes that can be indoctrination. I know that when I read or write something over and over it becomes ingrained. Very scary.

              Yes I agree. I have always said that first they groom themselves. They must believe it he lies they tell others first. Then they groom the parents and then the Child. A Mortal Sin.

            Transgenderism is a result of being abused as a child (typically sexual abuse).  Nearly every transgender person who I have come into contact with (which is a lot in my line of work) was abused as a child. It's a self perpetuating cycle. Someone is abused as a child, and they grow up to be an abuser as a result of their trauma.
           </p>
           <p>
            It has nothing to do with religion (at least overtly). It is exactly the premise that mkultra trauma based mind control is built from.

             Absolutely correct. Child sexual abuse is a ubiquitous social virus, with seemingly endless ramifications and expressions in the culture. Life experience reveals this truth to anyone honest enough to confront it. Pseudo-scientific analyses like "dysphoria" are simply intellectual smokescreens to avoid admitting the obvious dirty little secrets that underpin human culture.

             In no way can it be factually stated and generalized that transgender individuals are all (or even most) that cuz they were abused; it cannot be stated they were all abused and grow up to be abusers. This is false and dangerous.

              'satan' is depicted with breasts and a penis so I'm sure that is part of it for some. Messed up big stylee it surely is. I've never liked any sexual behaviour being promoted,  pop videos made me cringe and I never could fathom why people say "my gay friend" - " friend" is enough of a description isn't it?! Another agenda to take us away from feeling strong in ourselves as just ourselves - no labels needed.

              While your remedy sounds extreme, we have to ask what alternative is there for removing a virus? You have to stop the spread, which means ending the carriers of the virus. Perhaps the most difficult social problem to solve.
             </p>
             <p>
              And as Orwellian as it sounds, another important social test would be for psychopathy and finding means to separate high level psychopaths from society. This sounds evil, but psychopaths (which I assume includes most pedophiles) would certainly remove the rest of us from society except for those who they target as prey.

               Regarding purging psychopaths/sociopaths, groups with a very high amount of those include mobsters and the White Sharia crowd.
              </p>
              <p>
               That second group I know from experience on Voat are pretty much all psychopaths. One of the worst shills on

               before his banning (donkeyhote) represents the entire group and based on his posts there plenty of evidence he’s a psychopath.
              </p>
              <p>
               Psychopathy is likely genetic, so there’s no fixing them.
              </p>
              <p>
               As to how to deal with them without compromising your humanity? I’d say remembering your motive is REALLY important. This is about protecting as many innocent people as possible. Kinda like the modern depictions of Venom (Eddie Brock has gone through A LOT of character development to reach this point of wanting to be a true hero).
