<blockquote>
<p>A Florida man who tried unsuccessfully 400,000 times to hack into the computer network of the Bill, Hillary &amp; Chelsea Clinton Foundation has avoided additional prison time.</p>
<p>Timothy Sedlak, 44, was sentenced Monday in Manhattan Federal Court to 18 months to run concurrently rather than on top of his 42-year sentence that was handed down to him last year for child pornography.</p>
<p>The child porn was discovered when the FBI descended on Sedlack\'s Florida home and found him actively trying to hack into the Clinton Foundations servers using password-cracking software running across 22 computers.</p>
<p>Sedlak, who called himself a private investigator told agents he was researching whether charities were unintentionally providing funding to Islamic militant groups, and said the Clintons \'came up in his research,\' the filing said. </p>
<p>He plead guilty to the hacking charges back in February, but the investigation leading up to his eventual guilty plea predated his cyber attacks on Democrats during the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>Back in September of 2015, federal agents executed a search warrant on Sedlak\'s home and discovered 42 computers, many of which were running a password-cracking program according to prosecutors.</p>

            If there are indeed images/videos of Sedlak perpetrating abuse of a toddler, I'd be MUCH less inclined to believe the other CP on his computers was planted.  The excerpts below are from pleadings filed by the federal prosecutors in his hacking case.  (I have the files from pacer if you'd like to see for yourself.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Quote from the prosecutor's sentencing memorandum at page 13:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The defendant has one known conviction for producing images depicting him sexually abusing his friend’s three year-old daughter inside his home, and possessing hundreds of images of child pornography (the “Florida Case”)."
           </p>
           <p>
            Quote from the prosecutor's sentencing memorandum at pages 16-7:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Sedlak’s criminal conduct in this case and his Florida Case are clearly distinct. Sedlak’s conduct in the Florida Case (producing child pornography in connection with his sexual abuse of a toddler and possessing large amounts of child pornography) bears no relationship to
his conduct in this case (attempting to hack the Clinton Foundation). If this Court were to impose a sentence for Sedlak’s attempted hacking offense to run concurrently to his sentence in the Florida Case, Sedlak would not receive any punishment for his very serious conduct in this case."

            Please! Planted there is already an admission they were hacked by foreign governments. Why would this guy get 42 years for Childporn but others get no jail time for actual child rape.

             That's my point and why it's fishy....400,000 attempts is quite a bit to wait to do something. Did they only target him for CP because of the whole Russian narrative, GASP! how could it be possible that anyone else on US soil would attempt hacking. He was in Manhatten, Florida.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's also interesting because the "highlight" is the CP and hacking, yet within the CP they state they found images of him abusing a toddler
            </p>
            <p>
             Interesting take from a lawyers stand point about this occurring within 2 districts.

             But most importantly, which has been stated by a few - how is it others walk and he gets 42 years? If he truly was a Pedo- it still doesn't account for the disparity between sentencing of him and others closer to the good 'ol boys club in D.C.
