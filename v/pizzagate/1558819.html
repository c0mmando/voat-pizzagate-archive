These guys did a child sacrifice video that has been taken down from youtube so it\'s not far fetched that these lyrics have some malevolent meaning. If this song were a map where would it lead? (I\'ll put my guesses in brackets) If you don\'t think these guys are deranged then look at this video called &quot;look ma no hands&quot; (which I think refers to the posture of the guy at the 1:45 mark, bent over with hands behind his back like he\'s tied up) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPgc8bq9OD0&amp;list=PLaTbnoUuEbU0yZLzlTsukNCBWMCClAk47">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPgc8bq9OD0&amp;list=PLaTbnoUuEbU0yZLzlTsukNCBWMCClAk47</a>  made by the guy who made the child sacrifice video (taken down) for this group, The Psyched.

            This is an interesting idea that doesn't quite gel for me. But I have really wondered what the Heavy Breathing vids and songs were all about.  They are so bad I keep thinking there has to be another purpose; encrypt porn or something.  Your idea is very very clever but in this example I don't quite see it as anything but describing their culture as multigenerational sacrifice, speaking I think toward his parents.
