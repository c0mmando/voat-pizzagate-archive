<p>I started this research because Pizzagate. If you don\'t know about that, you will not understand the connections. I looked into a survivor, Bub Mulé.

<p>and he\'s an artists, so let\'s assume he\'s into cameras (actually he states so in articles after the fire that he had to save his camera).</p>
<p>It didn\'t take more than two comments to lead me to people, his friends, that are into children, and Satan.</p>
