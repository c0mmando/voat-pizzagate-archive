<blockquote>
<p>When the world\'s superrich shop for a lavish garden to frame their sprawling estates, they call Belgian master-landscaper François Goffinet.</p>
<p>Goffinet\'s secret weapon: a deep knowledge of the land and a timeless classical style. With his pavilions, ironwork, gate lodges, and follies (who doesn’t love a good hedge maze?), he’s reviving the grand tradition of the 18th century one garden at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="break"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="md-the-artist">The Artist</h2>
<p>Born in 1955 in Castle Reux to the Belgian royal family, Goffinet felt the urge from a young age to create places of beauty. The first garden he worked on was his own, originally created in 1750 by his ancestors in Annevoie. Having discovered his green fingers as a teen, he studied landscaping and gardening at the Royal Horticultural Society in England and worked under the supervision of British master Russell Page, whom he succeeded, curating the iconic Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens, at the PepsiCo headquarters in Purchase, N.Y. Francois has dedicated more than 30 years to maintaining these gardens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notable work of Goffinet\'s, mention in the above article, leads to further supporting evidence of Goffinet being an associate of the Epstein network:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 id="md-billionaires-estates">Billionaires Estates</h2>
<p>Late media billionaire John Kluge, once America\'s richest man, commissioned Goffinet to design 220 acres of stunning land surrounding his family estate south of Charlottesville, Va. Today Albemarle Estate serves as an upscale bed and breakfast—plus a winery—now part of Trump Hotel Collection. (In contrast to the idylls of the garden, John Kluge Junior alleged land-deal fraud in a lawsuit against Trump, after the now Republican nominee acquired the property, once marketed at $100 million, for a mere $6.2 million.)</p>
