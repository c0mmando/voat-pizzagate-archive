            Speaking of Anthony Weiner....
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin withdraw their divorce (10/10/18)
            </strong>
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her jailed sext-a-holic hubby Anthony Weiner have ended their pending divorce case.
            </p>
            <p>
             Identical statements from their lawyers Wednesday cited the scandal-plagued couple’s desire to protect their 6-year-old son by settling outside court —
             <strong>
              but experts say the real reason could be to shield one another from a potential federal probe.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Abedin, 41 — spotted over the weekend sunning herself at the luxury Four Seasons Hotel on Hawaii’s Big Island — was scheduled to appear in Manhattan Supreme Court for a compliance conference in her contested divorce case against Weiner, 53.
            </p>
            <p>
             Instead, one of her attorneys submitted paperwork signed by both parties agreeing to end the case, a court source told The Post.
            </p>
            <p>
             The judge announced from the bench that the case was “discontinued.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “In order to reduce any impact of these proceedings on their child, the parties have decided to reach a settlement swiftly and privately,” Abedin’s lawyer, Charles Miller, and Weiner’s attorney, Margaret Donohoe, said in separate statements.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              President Trump last week urged the Justice Department to investigate Abedin for keeping classified emails on Weiner’s laptop.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             “Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid [sic], Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents,” the president tweeted. “Remember sailors [sic] pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act?”
            </p>
            <p>
             New York law states that a husband or wife can’t be “required to disclose a confidential communication made by one or the other during the marriage.”

             They don't want any more of their Dirty Linen aired in the public.  They have had enough eyes on them with the release of those recent Huma Emails.  They are going to go Incognito for a while, or so at least they hope.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ...“Why I Admire Anthony Weiner;” (...) was written after Weiner was arrested and sentenced to prison for acts of pedophilia.
            </p>
            <p>
             This one speaks for itself. And there is no hidden meaning, no metaphor to be had — as if that would make it any better, should the writer have some grand conclusion and explanation for why she is openly admiring a convicted sex offender.
            </p>
            <p>
             The writer is simply making the case for why she admires his conduct during his trial, for which he was being held accountable, and rightly so, for his illegal actions with a 15-year-old girl.
            </p>
            <p>
             In essence, the author is saying that Weiner chose to take the high road, in accepting that he was responsible for his crime instead of blaming the disease, as many often do.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yet this is a blatant attempt to minimize the negative press of both Weiner and the Democratic party.
            </p>
            <p>
             Despite him no longer holding a position, it still reflects very badly on the party, which is why they went to their knee-jerk political propaganda arm, The New York Times, to pump out a fluff piece.
            </p>
            <p>
             In astonishingly oblivious fashion, the writer ignores the years of lies and manipulation that preceded Weiner’s display of what can only be seen as regret for being caught, as opposed to actual remorse.
            </p>
            <p>
             How can it be admirable to sexually abuse an underage girl, lie about it for years, allow Hillary Clinton to cover it up for you, wait until they have you dead to rights, still deny the charges, then sobbingly admit to them in court when confronted with the overwhelming evidence?'
