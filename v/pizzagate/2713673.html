<p>Beckwitt is described as a &quot;prepper&quot; and his concerns about a nuclear attack from North Korea drove him to build an underground bunker and tunnels. I guess wanting a bunker for that reason could be logical on the prepped world, but why did he need tunnels? And why did he need to dig down 20 feet? So there wouldn\'t be any noise? Neighbors said they had no idea. </p>
<p>Related to pizzagate because of what we already know about tunnels under D.C. To move child victims around. Beckwitt\'s home is in a D.C. Suburb. Could this guy be involved somehow? His tunnels extended out 200 feet, yet when the fire broke out they were still working on their project. Where was Beckwitt trying to dig to? </p>

            I've heard of burying a bus at that depth to create an underground bunker for nuclear fallout protection. The tunnels might be innocent if he was only connecting them to places on his own property to get out. But it still seems a little screwy and scary. Definitely worth looking into.

             I have too. Or a shipping container. What struck me as odd was how deep this was. It's pretty excessive if his reasoning was due to concerned of nuclear war.

             This article says you just need three feet of soil on top of a bunker.

             I could see many people not feeling like that's deep enough and going deeper to be extra cautious. Or, in his case, having to go down deeper than that so as to not disturb the homes foundation. Still, 20 feet is pretty deep!

             <blockquote>
              <p>
               At the end of January, county public safety officials held a community meeting in the Bethesda neighborhood to update local residents on the status of their investigation.
               <strong>
                At the meeting, Dia Khafra said the information they were presenting about the circumstances surrounding the fire had been “sanitized,”
               </strong>
               according to a Fox5 report.
              </p>
              <p>
               “It was my son that was burned to death at that home,” Khafra said. “I’m very emotional because of the things you are all presenting, to me, has been sanitized. I came here because I wanted people to know what was going on here.
               <strong>
                This thing is far more extensive and complicated than people here believe.”

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 "Finding deeply buried facilities stands out as one of the toughest technical challenges in the Air Force’s efforts to find, fix, target, track, engage and assess targets of interest anywhere on earth. Use of deeply buried facilities is prevalent among potential enemies of the United States such as Iraq, Libya and North Korea because they realize they cannot confidently defend their airspace against United States airpower. Such nations have located potential high-value, high- interest targets such as weapons of mass destruction (WMD), WMD manufacturing plants and storage areas, missile garrisons, fuel storage areas and command and control nodes underground. All of these targets are critical to an enemy nation’s ability to project power beyond its borders and threaten United States allies, friends and interests abroad.
Deeply buried facilities, whether they are bunkers buried under many meters of earth or tunnels dug into mountains, are hard find. In many cases only a door or an air vent reveal the presence of what could be a deeply buried facility with thousands of square meters of floor

space. These small aboveground signatures can be easily masked from visible, infrared and other sensors making detection by existing intelligence assets very challenging. Furthermore, most deeply buried facilities of interest are located in denied areas, meaning any sensors must operate from standoff ranges beyond the reach of an adversary’s armed forces.
There is no “silver bullet” intelligence solution to the problem of detecting deeply buried facilities. The solution comes from combining several sources of intelligence, including imagery intelligence, e.g. photographs from satellites or aircraft; measurement and signature intelligence, e.g. detecting heat, sound, vibration or chemical exhaust; signals intelligence, e.g. analyzing radio or radar signals, and human intelligence, the use of spies and informants, to locate and characterize a deeply buried facility. Effectively integrating these intelligence sources to find a deeply buried facility becomes easier when the approximate location of the targeted facility is known. Obtaining the approximate location of the facility requires an intelligence capability that can cover wide search areas, determine the rough location and size of a deeply buried facility from stand-off ranges and do so using technology that is difficult to mask or counter by an enemy. This capability could then be used to cue other intelligence assets to focus in on a specific area and collect more detailed information about the facility.
To find such a capability it is necessary to go outside the realm of traditional intelligence systems and look at ways that scientists or other specialists may use to understand what is going on beneath the surface of the earth. Geophysicists and geologists used gravity field measurements for over 100 years to analyze geologic structures beneath the earth’s surface. Gravity field measurement is useful in understanding the types of soil, rocks and minerals beneath the earth because variations in the density of underground soil and mineral deposits cause minute but measurable variations in the force of gravity. Geologists, for example, can

                </p>
                <p>
                 locate oil by looking for variations in gravity field strength caused by the low-density underground salt domes that contain oil. Similarly, it may be possible to detect deeply buried facilities by measuring the gravity field variations caused by the void created in the rock or soil where the facility is built. Intelligence officers could look for gravity field variations caused by deeply buried facilities that are less dense than the earth around them in the same way oil geologists look for salt domes that are less dense than the rock around them. Since it is very difficult to alter the earth’s gravitational field, it would be equally difficult to mask the gravity field variations caused by a deeply buried facility, making gravity field measurement a reliable source of intelligence for deeply buried facility detection.
Gravity measurement technology in use for geophysics applications today could be advanced and integrated into an effective system for locating deeply buried facilities from space. Experience gained from current space borne, ship borne and airborne gravity field measurements, combined with ongoing research, provides a solid technical foundation to create a space system capable of deeply buried target detection. Data gathered by such a system could then cue other types of sensors to the targeted facility. Working together, these sensors would characterize the construction and functions of the facility in a manner that is very difficult to spoof. Information about the construction and functions of the facility will be necessary for those planning to destroy or neutralize the facility.
This paper will focus on the development and application of gravity field sensors for deeply buried target detection. It will begin with an explanation of what deeply buried facilities are and how their construction and use has evolved over the years. Next, the discussion will look at the weapons available today to counter deeply buried facilities and the intelligence information needed to make these weapons effective. The information needed to properly target these

                </p>
                <p>
                 weapons will directly influence the capability of the sensors needed to detect and characterize deeply buried facilities. The focus of the paper will then shift to intelligence sources, starting with the intelligence capabilities available today and the ability of a potential enemy to counter those intelligence assets, then shift to exploring intelligence sources not in use today and their potential application in the hunt for deeply buried facilities. Finally, this paper will investigate gravity measurement technology to address the problem of deeply buried facility detection and characterization. The examination will include the history of gravity measurement technology, current uses for geology and earth science, ongoing laboratory developments and the applicability of this technology to the search of deeply buried targets. The discussion will conclude with desired system capabilities and potential system concepts.
Gravity field measurement has proven its worth in over 100 years of oil geology and earth science applications. It has enormous potential to help with the search for deeply buried targets. The effort to determine how much gravity field measurement can help in the search for deeply buried targets must start with understanding deeply buried targets themselves."

             Off thread topic...so maybe I'll post in a relevant thread on the board But I'm connecting some dots in\around NEPA (that's PA) centered on the fall-out of the pedo church scandal. Found some anomalies centered on individuals who have reach-back into telecom, .Gov elected positions, info discrepancies btw social media and other data sources, reach-back into "human services" foundations, and employment with another non-profit that serves "venerable youth". Downloaded OpenSource GIS so I can build the network.

             MKULTRA was related to MKNAOMI – a joint CIA &amp; Army Chemical &amp; Biological-Weapons project based at Fort Detrick, Maryland, USA, that ran from 1953 to 1970. The project involved “developing, testing, and maintaining biological agents and delivery systems for use against humans as well as against animals and crops”. MKNAOMI received CIA funding through MKULTRA Sub-projects 13, 30 and 50.

             Back to 1957 – Burnet organised with Dr. Joseph Smadel of Fort Detrick to send the military trained, Dr. Carelton Gajdusek to Papua New Guinea to study the Kuru Virus, which was discovered by Dr. Vincent Zigas[27]. Smadel and Lederberg were colleagues, having both been involved with military virus research together[28][29]. Zigas shared a house with Fiona Barnett’s Nazi, Hypno-ProgrammerDr. Leonas Petrauskas, and they were ‘dearest’ of friends. Burnet had employed Zigas to study the Kuru Virus in Papua New Guinea and collect samples of the virus for Burnet’s laboratory in Melbourne[30]. Gajdusek’s’ studies in Papua New Guinea were financed by the U.S. Army under a contract titled, “Field Studies on the Control of Infectious Disease of Military Importance” in connection with research at Fort Detrick[31]. He sent samples of the virus back to Smadel at
             <strong>
              the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland – who was at the centre of all US Bio-weapons research at this time
             </strong>
             [32]. In 1959, Gajdusek, Zigas and Petrauskas were all working together in PNG[33]. Zigas would later travel to work with Gajdusek at the National Institutes of Health

             Some 113 university, government, hospital and corporate laboratories engaged in research often with potential to be used for germ warfare have refused to disclose their operations to the public as required by Federal rules, a nonprofit watchdog agency has charged.

            <p>
             Instead of shutting their operations down, however, the National Institutes of Health(NIH), of Bethesda, Md., the government agency tasked with oversight of these laboratories, allows them to continue to operate, a peculiar stance for an entity that describes itself as "the steward of medical and behavioral research for the Nation."

             He was arrested in 2013 for adding keystroke logging software to University of Illinois Urbana computers. Wonder why? He was convicted. But then he made millions daytrading and trading bitcoin? I'd say suspicious AF!

             His "mentoring" of the college kid who burned up digging the tunnels in return for an investment in the kid's internet startup sounds a lot like grooming to me.

             Also interesting that the fire was on Sept. 10.

               Yeah...I'm really on the edge with this one. Seems possibly SRA related to me. I would hate to remove it if it is an actual lead that we are going to want to come back to in a couple months when more stuff comes out, like the tunnels on Epstein's island and Ray Chandler. I'm going to remove the flair and leave it up.

             I found his mothers obituary. She died in 2010. One of the daily mail articles I linked to said there was one other person in the home at the time. I suspect it was Beckwitt's father as it was the family home

                <p>
                 MKULTRA was related to MKNAOMI – a joint CIA &amp; Army Chemical &amp; Biological-Weapons project based at Fort Detrick, Maryland, USA, that ran from 1953 to 1970. The project involved “developing, testing, and maintaining biological agents and delivery systems for use against humans as well as against animals and crops”. MKNAOMI received CIA funding through MKULTRA Sub-projects 13, 30 and 50.

                 Back to 1957 – Burnet organised with Dr. Joseph Smadel of Fort Detrick to send the military trained, Dr. Carelton Gajdusek to Papua New Guinea to study the Kuru Virus, which was discovered by Dr. Vincent Zigas[27]. Smadel and Lederberg were colleagues, having both been involved with military virus research together[28][29]. Zigas shared a house with Fiona Barnett’s Nazi, Hypno-ProgrammerDr. Leonas Petrauskas, and they were ‘dearest’ of friends. Burnet had employed Zigas to study the Kuru Virus in Papua New Guinea and collect samples of the virus for Burnet’s laboratory in Melbourne[30]. Gajdusek’s’ studies in Papua New Guinea were financed by the U.S. Army under a contract titled, “Field Studies on the Control of Infectious Disease of Military Importance” in connection with research at Fort Detrick[31]. He sent samples of the virus back to Smadel at
                 <strong>
                  the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland – who was at the centre of all US Bio-weapons research at this time
                 </strong>
                 [32]. In 1959, Gajdusek, Zigas and Petrauskas were all working together in PNG[33]. Zigas would later travel to work with Gajdusek at the National Institutes of Health

                 Some 113 university, government, hospital and corporate laboratories engaged in research often with potential to be used for germ warfare have refused to disclose their operations to the public as required by Federal rules, a nonprofit watchdog agency has charged.

                 Instead of shutting their operations down, however, the National Institutes of Health(NIH), of Bethesda, Md., the government agency tasked with oversight of these laboratories, allows them to continue to operate, a peculiar stance for an entity that describes itself as "the steward of medical and behavioral research for the Nation."

            , do we know anything else about this guy that would lead us to believe he might have an interest in child trafficking? I think we have to flair this per Rule 1, since at this point it's only speculatively related. Let's give it 24 hours for further digging, and if nothing turns up, repost in

             Ok I was expecting that. I have been trying to find out more about him. What has been reported is limited and sounds really sketchy.

              Well it kind of sounds like he was grooming the dude digging the tunnels:

             <p>
              Also, the fire happened Sept. 10...I can't recall if there is a theory with any supporting evidence that 9/11 was a spirit cooking sacrifice near a satanic holiday or not, but that might be an angle. The fact the guy mysteriously became rich "daytrading", gives talks in fireproof suits on how to use thermite, and later burned someone up I think makes it worth considering he may have been courting "Moloch".

               Could be. This guy sounds really nut. Brilliant, but nuts! He was arrested while a student at U of Illinois for hacking. He was found to be in possession of thermite. He said it is used to destroy hard drives:
