<p>Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven. Accomplice: Judith\'s mother. Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.</p>
<p>-The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants. </p>
<p>Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).</p>
<p>Accomplices: LAPD, the media, Ruth Hansen?, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti, Fredrick Brennan.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, setting them on fire as part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly via a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. Basically, it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source being programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course the fire destroys the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.</p>
<p>Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer and sub sonic rounds, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.</p>
<p>Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death?</p>',

           For those who are new, Judith Barsi was a child actress who was a victim of the Hollywood pedophile ring known as Pedowood. Be warned, for anyone who was born during the mid 80’s or earlier, this can be a very emotionally painful lead to look into. 1/1/2018 was the day Pizzagate became PERSONAL.

           The Bronfmans are linked to Barrick Gold via Trizec. Charles Brofman controls Israel’s biggest comglomerate (Koor Industries). Suspected Israeli mafia connections via Arie Genger. Bronfman linked banks such as Household international are the successor to Nugen Hand, a group connected to the Phoenix Program and a shit ton of horrors relating to the Vietnam War.

           The Bronfmans have been connected to both parties since the 60’s. Jack Ruby was a lieutenit for the Bronfman mob. Bronfmans owned the bank used by Bernie Madoff in his scandal. Bronfmans are notorious opponents of free speech. Pro censorhip. Connected to much censorship in Canada. Ties to Southern Poverty Law Center.

           The Bronfmans are directly connected to the Golden Triangle’s opium trade. Via Max Fisher and his company “United Brands”, the Bronfmans are connected to the Silver Triangle, thus much of the horrors affecting the Central American people. The Anti Defamation League has extensive ties to organized crime via the Bronfmans and the Purple Gang.

           A voat thread regarding the Golden Triangle.
          </p>
          <p>
           Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven. Accomplice: Judith's mother. Witness: Clare Torao. 7/19/85-8/26/95. Culver City, CA.
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Sidney Sheinberg, Joseph Sargent. Witness: Fritzi Jane Courtney. Timeline: February-May 1987 Accomplice: Adria Later, Lorraine Gary, Judith’s mother. 2/9/1987-3/18/87, Bahamas.
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder: Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Mike Rosenfeld, Edgar Bronfman Jr, Sid Sheinberg (conspirators), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth." The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who's character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn't take (her heart was too strong) so she had to be silenced. Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was so beloved by the country).
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: LAPD, the media, Ruth Hansen?, CAA, Jack Dorsey, David Brock, Ben Collins, Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, Jonah Peretti, Fredrick Brennan.
          </p>
          <p>
           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (her agent) warns Universal that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down, using Fatal Vision as a template.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, setting them on fire as part of the murder suicide narrative. Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly via a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". Basically, it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source being programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course the fire destroys the evidence, which includes the scent of a corpse and the set up. An autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.
          </p>
          <p>
           Murder Weapons: Pistol with silencer and sub sonic rounds, gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.

           Post Murder: 7/27/1988. Don Bluth possibly threatened in regards to Judith Barsi’s death?
