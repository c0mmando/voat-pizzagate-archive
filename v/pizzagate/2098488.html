            I'm interested in what Dana Rohrabacher has to say to DJT that he doesn't already know. Things DJT knows already:
1) Russian collusion is a lie (cause he would know if he colluded)
2) Wikileak emails were not hacked by anyone but stolen by an insider (if he follows Wikileaks as much as he talks about it, he would have heard Julian say unequivocally that he knows it wasn't given the emails by a state actor. Strongly implied it was Seth Rich)
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems more likely that it's legal maneuvering such as requests for the grand jury case against him be dropped. I doubt that Julian would give Rohrabacher specific sensitive information but I can imagine he could hint at things like "I have stuff that would bring down %80 of congress, be prepared because Wikileaks will release it by the end of the year" or something to that effect.

               Crayzie doesn't have ANY dirt on me.  If she did, it would have been out here already.  (Now she will probably make up some bullshit because she LIES.)  She knows NOTHING about me.

                You FOOLS know NOTHING ABOUT me.  Some online info says I'm in my 30s, others in my 50s, others in my 60s.  To some I am male, to others female.  Ask Bopper and he will tell you I am a female.  LOL   You have no idea which STATE I actually live in because I have used different ones online.  You idiots are CONFUSED AS HELL, so MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!  LMFAO!!

                I have NEVER visited any "tranny" sub anywhere and was unaware that one even existed on Voat.  I have commented, like HUNDREDS of other Voaters on an article, making a comment about JEWS.  So,

                I am a student currently between classes, which is why I have some free time. (Not that that is ANY OF YOUR FUCKING BUSINESS).  I also own and operate a very small horse rescue (hence my moniker) --- impossible to do "from my mother's basement."  I am also writing a book when I get the chance.

                 I followed you to another sub? It was the NEWS sub! I go there, to politics and the conspiracy sub. Wow, what a unique sub. Amazing that I found you! Of course on an article about a tranny 😂
                </p>
                <p>
                 You and your alt donkeyhote, followed me around and stalked me yesterday. So, I was replying to you over and over so you could see what it feels like. Besides, I can say certain things to you that I can't say on this sub. Such as what you like to gag on.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I was not trying to carry on a persona here in the beginning. Since it was a Pizzagate sub, I didn't feel at the time that it was safe to say that I was female. It wasn't that I was lying and enjoying playing some role. I never said I was a man. I just let people think what they wanted. If someone called me a faggot, oh well.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Those DM's to all the men here asking about their python is a total LIE. I even showed a screenshot yesterday proving that I didn't ask for no python picture. To your donkeyhote profile! He asked me if I wanted a pic. That's because you're nasty! I said NO! Then I never wrote back. I haven't asked any man here about their python. I'm "probably" a slut? You wish. You actually think that I am attracted to you? 🤣 NOT!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Ask Bopper? I don't need to. You showed your true self to Bopper. You told him your life story. He knows who you are. I have screenshots of conversations. Proof that he knows you're male, what state you live in and where you are from. So don't even go there you liar. You are in your early 50's, never married but were engaged twice. To men! You keep sending him messages. Why don't you get the hint?!
                </p>
                <p>
                 Your donkeyhote profile goes to a tranny sub. I shared a link and screenshot yesterday proving that you are a faggot. Why are you so ashamed?! You hate women so it totally makes sense now! It is true.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Your old ass has been taking a few classes. It's good you get out of the house every now and then. At this pace, you'll be using a cane by the time your schooling is complete. That's IF you stuck to it. You are going to write a book someday? You have the time NOW. You are here constantly! Go put your energy into your book that you fantasize will become a best seller.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You had a long break today where you didn't post. It's pretty funny because donkeyhote and all the other profiles of yours were quiet as well lol. Why? Because all profiles are yours and you must have slept all day in your parents basement. I shared a screenshot the other day proving that you fucked up and replied to the comment I left on your other profile!
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm not a drunk. I've been sober for almost 4 years. You know why? Because I have strength! I'm proud of myself for overcoming addiction. So, you always calling me a drunk just makes you look stupid,
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you truly do own and operate a horse rescue, then I would be very happy. I love animals. But, it's hard to imagine that a psychopath cares about animals. Besides, even if you did operate that business, that doesn't mean you don't live in your momma's basement!
                </p>
                <p>
                 You have been obsessed with me. You must be bi. I would never be attracted to you. You can get that sick little fantasy out of your head. You are a horrible person and you admit you are ugly as fuck. No thank you! Goodnight!

             You talk like someone in need of contact with their mother(assuming you didn't kill her for asking you to clean out your shit-bucket). I haven't the foggiest who Dana is, noticed that he's a Republican who says he's been in contact with Assange and is to relay information about said contact to Trump. Assange and Trump being key figures in this whole situation - I've no idea how vital the information is or what it contains, are you not curious?

              Ignore him. If you don't show absolute hate for Jews and disrespect women, then this is how he will treat you. This is how the pathetic psychopath spends his entire day.

              He says you talk like a fag, but he visits a tranny sub and I now have proof that his Equineluvr profile has admitted he's gay. So, why he would call you a fag is beyond me. 😆

               I dont show hate for anyone, i just think theyre behind PG. Whats your evidence based theory little girl, and why do you talk like an SJW with the "love trumps hate!!" bullshit? Do you understand that attributing motive to me is not a legitimate debate tactic and has no bearing on the evidence i present? It couldnt be more obvious that you are OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT and your grandfather and father would agree, did they hate women too?

                What is your evidence? Oh I know. The JEWS did it. Case solved. 👏🏻 Ok, good job. You did your duty. You solved it. We couldn't have done it without you.

                 I dont see the humor in disregarding a serious answer to the conspiracy.  You have clearly put far more effort into proving the falsehood that i am equine than into PG, so shame on you, idiotic woman.
