<p>&quot;But there are other factions that are actively organizing against Trump – Answer Coalition is one that is demonstratively against both Trump and Hillary but calls for demonstrations against only – Trump. The organization that funds ANSWER is Media Matters, founded by David Brock and John Podesta, both Clintonites. It is staffed by members of the Marxist, Workers World Party, and specializes in anti-America rallies and immigrant rights protests. They have been accused of financially supporting Hezbollah and Hamas, and were instrumental in the Ferguson riots.&quot;</p>

<p>FUCKING MEDIA MATTERS. FUCKING PODESTAS AGAIN.</p>
<p>A bit of history: </p>
<p>&quot;Advocating socialist revolution and the abolition of private property in the United States, WWP is a staunch supporter of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il. The organization campaigned against the war-crimes trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and it backed Saddam Hussein in his pre-war conflicts with the United States. WWP also supported the Soviet invasions of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan. During the Cold War it always sided with the Communists, against America. In the 1960s, Marcy himself led demonstrations against the Vietnam War and called for the victory of the Vietcong.&quot;</p>

            One more thing to point out, since this is so much like the SDS losers, watch for an escalation where a bunch of white kids who are being paid a monthly salary start building bombs at home and setting them off at different govt institutions and law enforcement buildings. They're super predictable. And hopefully blow themselves up in the process like last time! Only this time, the leftover losers won't get to become college professors afterwards.

              They must have recently amended it bc it was out all over the place from their own supposed members that that's what they stood for. Maybe the backlash was strong on it and they figured out that that was a really stupid way to go. Of course violence during fake protests is also a way to turn people away from them and they haven't figured that out either.

               Okay, I believe you.  All I ever heard was "Anti-Fascism," but admittedly I haven't followed them from day one.

               You're probably right and they are morphing.  They're just pawns so will do whatever their masters (Soros et al) tell them to, and if their masters want a "war" then they're only gonna ramp up the violence.

                Not that I'm the word of god on the subject, I just remember thinking it was a really stupid idea to flaunt it and that it came out IIRC during Milo protests.

            You're seeing the bigger picture. Good!  Welcome to the
            <strong>
             world of the Globalists
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Here are the things you will constantly bump into if you keep looking:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Manufactured Color revolutions
            </li>
            <li>
             Haiti
            </li>
            <li>
             Vaccination programs, AIDS, TB, big pharma
            </li>
            <li>
             Planned parenthood
            </li>
            <li>
             Vunerable teens/homeless/children
            </li>
            <li>
             The "resistance"
            </li>
            <li>
             Churches - of the emergent type, and the ironic type
            </li>
            <li>
             Satanists and the occult, everywhere
            </li>
            <li>
             Weird twitter, bots,
            </li>
            <li>
             Food (doughnuts, pizza, pasta lovers, hot dogs and watermelons)
            </li>
            <li>
             Spirit companies (Vodka, Whisky mainly)
            </li>
            <li>
             Foundations - oh soooo many foundations
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            Through all of these things you will see the Spooks, Soros and the Art world
            <strong>
             everywhere
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            And for some odd reason, Melissa Joan Hart.

           <p>
            Bon Voyage!
           </p>

            ps Huxley was a spook, as were most of the counter culture.  He was involved in
            <strong>
             MK Ultra
            </strong>

               Where can I start to connect Melissa Joan Hart to this? I think one key way to wake up people to pizzagate is expose Hollywood's connection to it.

            Could you go into ties between Tavistock (a Rockefeller Foundation funded organization), Huxley and elite pedophilia.  I assume that is where you are going with this, but I'm not sure.  Almost too incomplete to post, unless I'm missing something (in which case I apologize).

              Thank you. Just got back home, going to tie everything up together more clearly for everyone as soon as everything gets settled down. May be a few hours, but ocd is kicked in and I'm not letting this go until the picture is painted clearly and flawlessly for everyone. &lt;3

            There was an anon weeks ago who suggested the third man in the photograph from Justin Barrows' IG - hooded guys, one Barrows,  one Alefantis and a third - is in fact Alex Soros.
           </p>
           <p>
            The argument was compelling but the picture too grainy to tell 100%. Are there still no experts around here who know their way with image enhancement software?
           </p>
           <p>
            Positively placing Soros jr. in that pic would blow pizzagate right open.

            AntiFa-group which "adheres to Leninist conceptions on the need for a democratic centralist party that supports national self-determination of all oppressed peoples" being funded by Soros. Sounds legit

            I have been thinking that if Hillary or whoever controls her like Soros, actually created ISIS then they would be bringing them back here because Trump would find out and .....stop them from coming here. There are probably some here and they are the protesters who seem like militants and get violent. I think they would use them to start civil unrest and then they would overthrow the government.

             If there weren't three letter agencies influencing, training, manipulating and directing ISIS I'd be very, very surprised.
