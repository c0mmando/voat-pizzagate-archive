   Showerthought: John Podesta was a cryptologist. And he got hacked. He fell for a trick. What if he did it on purpose? The email contains it all and his brother has artwork that confirms it.

            John Podesta is a perfect case of unjustified arrogance. Example, who draws 14 and a fish on their palms with a magic marker and shares that cryptic shit on social media? Explanations have been given, of his supporting some cause, but I'm too tired to find links right now, and they were weak. If that picture was supposed to address some real issue, why does an educated and politically-connected man like John Podesta resort to posting cryptic selfies on social media? Can't he get some CNN time to explain 14 + Fishpic? Most important, as her campaign manager, John Podesta epically failed HRC in this election.

            "What if?" Unless the Pedosta bros are spilling a lot more information than we know about, and some intentional mistake with the password was part of some bargain. And if part of a bargain, with who? I can't even begin to believe that either of these two arrogant DC "in"-crowders (gushed over, despite their unattractiveness and creepy behavior) would throw away their A-list social and political elitist lifestyles, and possibly some of their fortunes, just to save children. If JP facilitated this email hack, it would have to mean either 1) he is already flat-out busted and cryptically leaking shit as trade for a benevolent cell mate, or 2) He had a major come-to-Jesus moment and made a weak attempt at a way out of eternity in Hell.

            It's an interesting idea actually. It would be the perfect way to let people know what was going on and cover your ass at the same time.

            But p@ssw0rd was not what podesta chose himself, it seems that's what eryn.sepp gave him as the initial password (and I guess he changed it after he first logged in)?

            he's also assuming that he has several layers of obscurity.  if you don't have physical access to my phone, for instance, my stupid password won't help you.  if you don't even know that i have an email server using an unpublished domain, and you don't know the username, my password doesn't matter.

            i'm inclined to believe arrogance and situational stupidity is what led to this, more than anything else.
