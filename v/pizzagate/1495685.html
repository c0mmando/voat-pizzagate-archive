<p>My collected trails branching from Linda Tripp\'s Christmas Sleigh shop... Now here is where it gets wierd and a bit hard to follow, but if pizzagate has taught me anything it is to assume that the most unlikely horrific acts are generally what is true with this sick twisted group of semi-people.</p>
<p><a href="https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=529">https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=529</a>
This is a page in the christmas sleigh shop catalogue. Buried in hundreds of different products I discovered this while looking for evidence that the site might be an online catalogue for the purchasing of minors.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/clothing_shoes_mens.htm">http://www.onlineconversion.com/clothing_shoes_mens.htm</a> 1st conversion site... Not anywhere else</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zappos.com/c/shoe-size-conversion">http://www.zappos.com/c/shoe-size-conversion</a> 2nd conversion site, not anywhere else</p>
<p>Now at this point it\'s extremely uninteresting, however I happened to feel that the wording describing why these 2 conversion sites were connected in this very discreet portion of Tripps\' store catalogue, being said that they were needed to make sure &quot;sizes&quot; converted properly from European to US measurements, however no such link to the 2 sites appeared anywhere else on the site.</p>
<p>This link <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/zappos/landing/images/zappos-kids-size-chart.pdf">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/zappos/landing/images/zappos-kids-size-chart.pdf</a> is a redirect after clicking &quot;the try our new children\'s sizing chart! let us help you find the right fit for your little one.) Icon located at the zappos conversion site. Notice now that Tripp\'s store and this portion of Amazon\'s file sharing service are both ssl secured, and not just at checkout, but Tripp\'s entire site is ssl secured. This prevent online archiving, but I manually archived the relavent connections.</p>
<p>I am sorry, but it takes a lot of explaining to even begin to get to where I did on my own throughout today. Notice on the Zappo\'s site that nothing tends to be overly suspicious, other than the fact they needed ssl security for a simple sizing chart pdf. Next I will explain the usage of the second site to corralate with Zappos and Linda Tripp\'s store catalogue. This part is simply a complex theory I developed after pouring through both the catalogue and the second conversion site looking for any pieces that seemed out of place or redundant. I cannot put every out of place piece here, because it was simply too much to handle on my own.</p>
<p><a href="https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing">https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing</a>    Notice the model numbers to the side of each piece of clothing, most of them make sense in a management of inventory kind of way, however I will point out the four that I know to be very sketchy at the least.</p>
<p><a href="https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing?product_id=332">https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing?product_id=332</a>
This sweater seems innocent enough, but after I finish I suspect your spine will tingle with disgust as mine did. Notice at the bottom of the description the way the sizes are laid out. also notice the model number. in each of the sketchy products I detected variations in the sizing system used, the model numbers with unnecessary digits- Kind of like phone numbers with country codes, and also strange language reminiscent of the leaked Podesta emails if not as blatant ostensibly because this site is accessible to the public, albeit not easily found.</p>
<p><a href="https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing?product_id=333">https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing?product_id=333</a>
In this product notice the same as above</p>
<p>[https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing?product_id=335](https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing?product_id=335)
Now this time notice the product doesn\'t have sweater in the model number, and the completely different and almost cryptic size system.</p>
<p><a href="https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing?product_id=336">https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing?product_id=336</a>
Notice the model number also different from the others in the category but similar to the ones I have selected.</p>
<p>Now I have limited time, and don\'t want to take yours up, so I will not list all of the other products that either have strange language, Size systems, or overly complex model numbers. Now lets move on to the other conversion site, because this is where it starts actually making sense.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/clothing_shoes_mens.htm">http://www.onlineconversion.com/clothing_shoes_mens.htm</a>
In this site are many differnt conversions, but I will only point the ones out that made me think something was going on here. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/international_friends.htm">http://www.onlineconversion.com/international_friends.htm</a> this Section was located under &quot;fun stuff&quot;, Notice he says he put the most basic units in this section. now notice the bottom 2 conversions. Since when has &quot;baby weight&quot; and &quot;baby length&quot; fit in with the same category as basic things to discuss with &quot;international friends&quot; along with height, weight, and temperature. I mean seriously.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/haxor.htm">http://www.onlineconversion.com/haxor.htm</a> Now in this section, also in &quot;fun stuff&quot; the way he describes using this conversion.</p>
<p>Now I honestly just discovered this, which has happened a lot in my digging on this one.
<a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/howold.htm">http://www.onlineconversion.com/howold.htm</a>
Notice when you open this up it goes straight to 1-1-1970..... does that sound familiar? it should, that is the out of place model number at
<a href="https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing?product_id=335">https://thechristmassleigh.com/ocart/German_Austrian_Clothing/Childrens_Clothing?product_id=335</a></p>
<p>So far this sounds way out there right? Well swoop on over to this <a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/html_meta_tags_tutorial.htm">http://www.onlineconversion.com/html_meta_tags_tutorial.htm</a>
Now here is when the connection to pizzagate becomes clear, notice under the keywords section that all too familiar reference to pizza? Notice the other references. Notice that this entire tutorial is now about how to set up HTML\'s and Meta tags in the most efficient way. At this point the sinister nature of all of this should start becoming clearer. If you want to, you could read the entire HTML section, as I believe It is the clearest indicator of what this website really is. This is my theory based upon the symbols and general content of the site, including the little apple in the top left of the screen, a symbol commonly associated with teachers, especially at the elementary or basic levels. This site in my opinion is training center of sorts for the newly introduced members of this ever expanding network of human traffickers, particularly the ones involved in the marketing and distribution of human beings.</p>
<p>Now I am not done, I just feel enough evidence has been presented so far to make my theory viable.</p>
<p><a href="http://bluesparks.net/">http://bluesparks.net/</a>     This happens to be the network that owns the training sit. As of now I have not been able to perform an even halfway decent investigation into the other sites on this list, save one, however as I do believe I might be right about the OnlineConversion site, that they are worth a thorough scouring by anyone who wants to see light shed on every tentacle of this conspiracy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.friendsandfamilyforum.com/">http://www.friendsandfamilyforum.com/</a>  This site I went to only briefly. However I became so concerned about the wording, language, and symbolism used by members and mods, as well as extensive modding of what is called &quot;inappropriate content&quot; in a &quot;Family friendly forum&quot; that had content I found disturbed left in by the moderators. This led me to question what exactly the moderators pulled out, and how bad was it. Now for this site, I will not form any hypothesis because I feel I don\'t have enough data to figure it\'s purpose out.</p>
<p>Obviously all of these sites are linked to the place we started, The Christmas Sleigh store. Now there are other connections, especially if you dig into financial data, public records, and domain records for each of the two conversion sites. Unfortunately this job is better suited for people with access to better than free records services and who have experience analyzing financial data. I will say that the connections I was able to make through the Zappo site led to the Fortune 2000 Global company Thomson Reuters at the very top, with Clarivate Analytics (formerly part of Thomson Reuters as Intellectual Property &amp; Science) and finally with Mark Monitor Inc. as the Domain Registrar of <a href="http://www.zappos.com">http://www.zappos.com</a>. While this only shows the chain of companies involved in hosting and management I decided to include it in this report for the sake of posterity. One other connection which could or could not be important is the fact that Amazon.com uses the same Registrar. Once I present the next connection the reasons I list amazon will be clear.</p>
<p>Back to this one <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/zappos/landing/images/zappos-kids-size-chart.pdf">https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/zappos/landing/images/zappos-kids-size-chart.pdf</a>
Now this part of my theory is one I didn\'t base on data collected at the URL, but from the contents of OnlineConversion and my belief that it is a Training Center of some sort. This URL in particular struck a cord with me, because it\'s protected with an SSL encryption with a very suspicious HTML chain, given the cryptic nature of OnlineConversion.</p>',

           this Section was located under "fun stuff", Notice he says he put the most basic units in this section. now notice the bottom 2 conversions. Since when has "baby weight" and "baby length" fit in with the same category as basic things to discuss with "international friends" along with height, weight, and temperature. I mean seriously.

           Now in this section, also in "fun stuff" the way he describes using this conversion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now I honestly just discovered this, which has happened a lot in my digging on this one.

           Notice when you open this up it goes straight to 1-1-1970..... does that sound familiar? it should, that is the out of place model number at

          <p>
           So far this sounds way out there right? Well swoop on over to this
           <a href="http://www.onlineconversion.com/html_meta_tags_tutorial.htm">
            http://www.onlineconversion.com/html_meta_tags_tutorial.htm
           </a>
           Now here is when the connection to pizzagate becomes clear, notice under the keywords section that all too familiar reference to pizza? Notice the other references. Notice that this entire tutorial is now about how to set up HTML's and Meta tags in the most efficient way. At this point the sinister nature of all of this should start becoming clearer. If you want to, you could read the entire HTML section, as I believe It is the clearest indicator of what this website really is. This is my theory based upon the symbols and general content of the site, including the little apple in the top left of the screen, a symbol commonly associated with teachers, especially at the elementary or basic levels. This site in my opinion is training center of sorts for the newly introduced members of this ever expanding network of human traffickers, particularly the ones involved in the marketing and distribution of human beings.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now I am not done, I just feel enough evidence has been presented so far to make my theory viable.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://bluesparks.net/">
            http://bluesparks.net/
           </a>
           This happens to be the network that owns the training sit. As of now I have not been able to perform an even halfway decent investigation into the other sites on this list, save one, however as I do believe I might be right about the OnlineConversion site, that they are worth a thorough scouring by anyone who wants to see light shed on every tentacle of this conspiracy.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://www.friendsandfamilyforum.com/">
            http://www.friendsandfamilyforum.com/
           </a>
           This site I went to only briefly. However I became so concerned about the wording, language, and symbolism used by members and mods, as well as extensive modding of what is called "inappropriate content" in a "Family friendly forum" that had content I found disturbed left in by the moderators. This led me to question what exactly the moderators pulled out, and how bad was it. Now for this site, I will not form any hypothesis because I feel I don't have enough data to figure it's purpose out.
          </p>
          <p>
           Obviously all of these sites are linked to the place we started, The Christmas Sleigh store. Now there are other connections, especially if you dig into financial data, public records, and domain records for each of the two conversion sites. Unfortunately this job is better suited for people with access to better than free records services and who have experience analyzing financial data. I will say that the connections I was able to make through the Zappo site led to the Fortune 2000 Global company Thomson Reuters at the very top, with Clarivate Analytics (formerly part of Thomson Reuters as Intellectual Property &amp; Science) and finally with Mark Monitor Inc. as the Domain Registrar of
           <a href="https://www.zappos.com">
            http://www.zappos.com
           </a>
           . While this only shows the chain of companies involved in hosting and management I decided to include it in this report for the sake of posterity. One other connection which could or could not be important is the fact that Amazon.com uses the same Registrar. Once I present the next connection the reasons I list amazon will be clear.
          </p>
          <p>
           Back to this one
           <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/zappos/landing/images/zappos-kids-size-chart.pdf">
            https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/zappos/landing/images/zappos-kids-size-chart.pdf
           </a>
           Now this part of my theory is one I didn't base on data collected at the URL, but from the contents of OnlineConversion and my belief that it is a Training Center of some sort. This URL in particular struck a cord with me, because it's protected with an SSL encryption with a very suspicious HTML chain, given the cryptic nature of OnlineConversion.

            Wow, I think you're onto something, particularly around Online Conversion charts. I started my own investigation of the organizations on the "charity watch" list, a list developed to rate charities. There were several irregularities around a few of the organizations including how the ratings were doled out and the budget to overhead expense ratio, but particularly around the one for refugees. You gave me some ideas for my own search. Keep on keepin' on, I believe you are onto something...and we never know when we'll crack the nut that busts this thing wide open. Cheers to great work!

            The website using SSL is pretty common nowadays. For example, if you go to google.com, you will get re-directed to
            <a href="https://google.com">
             https://google.com
            </a>
            which is the SSL version.
           </p>
           <p>
            You had mentioned about using SSL for the sizing chart - that's most likely harmless. When you have an SSL web server and a non-SSL web server, you now have to keep track of 2 different URL schemes. It's much easier for the site's authors to simply throw everything into the SSL web server. It doesn't cost them anything more.

            I think this is an example of if you look hard enough you are going to find something. Some of the early stuff seemed like a solid start with the pedo symbols, but then it seemed to fall apart from there. If you take all of these points on their own, it's not that interesting that someone lives by a school, or that they have a business close to Washington, D.C. Honestly, even the model numbers don't seem that interesting. Put all of this together and you have a shaky foundation that really doesn't even draw a strong conclusion. Maybe someone that knows more than me can explain why the OP is right, but I just don't see it.
           </p>
           <p>
            About the online conversion website, that just seems like a generic website for conversion to me. They aren't expecting you to convert the irrelevant information, only the relevant information. I appreciate your hard work, though, and maybe it's me that is wrong.

             I would upvoat your comment, but I'm out of voats. :/
Anyway, I'm all for getting to the bottom of the obvious pedo ring, but this really seems like a stretch to me. Too many quantum leaps. And all the sizing looks completely legit to me anyway.

            There's definitely something off about it. And you can't even choose the sizes before you put them in the cart. Have you registered and attempted to purchase something yet?

             No, but I am sure that just like any front business they would actually operate their cover business alongside the other. Fronts have to maintain the appearance of normal operations, it's how they do what they are designed to do.

            This is insanity. Delete. Clothing sizes and amount of each size in stock size 6 (4x) means there are 4 of that sweater in stock in size 6.

            Guys they are starting another bot flood. This is the same damn thing they did to us last time. Now I have absolutely no doubt. Whatever is here has made them freak out twice now. If you want proof go look at the intervals of new submissions after this started gaining traction. I honestly don't wanna let them bury this again.

              They did this last time, our little research team we had on the first sub started digging and soon after the amount of users active started fluctuating by like 400-500 users instantly, along with a major flood of scripted posts that completely diluted the entire pizzagate sub.

            I strongly suggest that voaters here interested in investigating these leads further:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             volunteer to take on a specific component of the sites by notifying the thread
            </li>
            <li>
             follow the OPs process, record step by step what you look into and find
            </li>
            <li>
             be DISCRETE and don't contact people, expose your investigation
            </li>
            <li>
             document everything you see - screen captures, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
             provide updates for how your digging is progressing in order to help others with ideas or unique methodologies, early discoveries
            </li>
            <li>
             and then organize and post your findings with imagery and content.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            This will allow the OP to understand what is left to dig into and also help him/her organize the findings. I am working on something else right now or I would volunteer - but I noticed over and over again that these conversations and research efforts are rarely well organized and wanted to help on that front.

             This must be done fast..  You don't have to tell anyone just get it archived with archive.is or other and upload content with discriptions of findings.

              Just so you know, you will be unable to archive anything on Linda Tripp's site with archive.is\
All of the other pages should archive fine, but her shop's site is immune to online archiving. You can however save the webpages as complete webpages to manually archive them.

                hmm... I really don't know. That is actually a good question. I am in the middle of archiving as we speak, but I am only archiving the pages featured in my report. It couldn't hurt to archive anything you think could be important though.

            My initial theory was that perhaps and child porn/slavery catalogue might sit behind numerous cryptic combinations of letters or numbers somehow obtainable by converting parts of the Christmas Sleigh shopping catalogue's model numbers or size charts. I figured that the size charts might relate to the ages, weights, or some other aspect of children being sold, while maybe the model numbers could either be converted into HTML keys or working phone numbers with country codes. This is really all just speculation based on the various connections, cryptological nature, and other out of place data located in both of the other sites. Currently I have been leaning towards the possibility that that section of Amazon might be being used as a place for the secure storage of files used by the marketing/distribution "division" of this vast network.

            The honest truth however is I am unable to verify myself if any of this part of my theory is true. I only present it here because I feel that the more possibilities that I present, the better the chances are of being able to break this code. I admit, that since I have not attempted to verify what may or may not be there, I cannot say for sure that in this instance I may be completely wrong. My goal for this was to try to bring this to the light to be examined by what I consider to be the greatest volunteer investigative effort I will ever see in my life. The research contained in this rather long report was not gathered by me alone.

            This is the sub that it all started in. I believe that without every person who researched, contributed, or otherwise supported the investigation into this, that this report would not be possible. There is one Voater who shared his research with me immediately, without which I don't believe I would have had the drive to persist on.

            In conclusion I would like to mention that a massive flood of bots and CTR happened to strike this community at the same time that our small group started making headway. I am not saying that we caused that because our investigation got too close to something important, however I know for a fact that it crippled our ability to gain any traction. I only say this for full disclosure, because I believe that not to do so wouldn't be right.
