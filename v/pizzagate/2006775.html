Part I: </p>
<p>In Part II, I’m going to dig into the sexual abuse that went on in the Portland and SF areas under the not so watchful eye of Cardinal William Levada. But before I get into the skanky Ms. Harris’ role in this alleged cover up, I’d like to give some background of the priest/pedo sex allegations. I’m starting with an article written by the NYT. The headline does not say it all, but then the NYT is hardly the bastion of calling things as they see them. They more run with a narrative. This is an example of their skill in threading the needle in disseminating info on sexual crimes while simultaneously giving a pass to the person charged with overseeing them. That person would be the aforementioned Cardinal William Levada. And again, he held identical positions in both Portland and later SF, so you have the Portland/SF connection that so many of The Cannibal Elite hold. Coincidence? </p>

<p>“&gt;He broke me, he totally broke me,” said Lynch, ...Father Jerry, who Lynch said had taken to leering at him and forcing him to sit on his lap, cornered the boy in his tent and forced him to have oral sex. That was bad enough. But what happened the next day when the priest once again ordered him into the tent was even worse, he said.“I got in there and my (4-year-old) brother was already in there,” Lynch said, breaking into sobs that lasted throughout the next part of his story. “He didn’t look good.”</p>
<p>There are tons more articles on the molestation that went on for years. Showing these articles is the only way for people to understand the severity of what went on and the cavalier way it was handled. The only cautionary advice doled out was that the church would be vulnerable to lawsuits that involved cash settlements if this continued. After reading even this small sampling of how these victims were affected, we can all pretty much agree that most of us would do anything to uncover the truth, but then we have souls. We’re not like the diabolical, soul-less entity named Kamala Harris, the heartless wraithlike creature that PROTECTS CHILD ABUSERS! </p>
<p>Here she is being called out in a spot on article. The post also features her in a picture where she’s striking a vertical pose. Isn’t she more used to horizontal? </p>

<p>Posted By Ashley Harrell on Thu, Jun 3, 2010. Matt Smith\'s column this week revealed how District Attorney Kamala Harris is essentially protecting Catholic pedophiles in her refusal to turn over the San Francisco Archdiocese files on clergy abuse. Oddly, she\'s also come out today with a campaign ad calling for stronger safeguards against online child predators.</p>
<p>Did we miss something? Are online predators somehow worse than flesh-and-blood ones with Roman collars operating within the church? Or is Harris only concerned with combating pedophilia when it\'s convenient?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to say that the Archdiocese files detail how the church dealt with the allegations, and that these files are in the D.A.’s possession. But like the spineless whore she is, Ms. Harris refuses to turn them over, stonewalling the attempt to reveal the truth. Here’s the Smith article alluded to in the previous link. He hammers her pretty hard, but then there used to be journalists that cared about injustices and cabals that preyed on children: </p>

<p>A Secrecy Fetish 
District Attorney Kamala Harris is going too far in protecting Catholic pedophiles.</p>
<p>Was Kamala Harris merely sloppy when she failed to disclose a crime lab scandal and the criminal backgrounds of police who were trial witnesses? Or does she have a policy of &quot;When in doubt, keep secrets&quot;? </p>
<p>In San Francisco, Levada was known as a key architect of the church\'s practice of keeping abuse allegations secret, protecting abusive priests, and punishing church whistleblowers.

<p>And the knee-padded Ms. Harris is serious about acting as a human shield for those accused of pedophilia. She’s even protected Shia LeBouf’s dad. You know Shia? He’s the one who urinates on lawns and threatens to kill police officers. A chip off the old block, I’d say. </p>

<p>Yup, gosh! They have no idea how Shia’s dad got dropped from the offender registry list. And notice how they’re not even attempting to find out? I guess they put it down to an Oopsie! It’s great to know that they’re not concerned about with not knowing a pedophile’s whereabouts. It’s not like they’re putting a community at risk or anything. I think the only thing left to know is if Ms. Harris wears a condom in her mouth during her sexual encounters. </p>
<p>We’ll be moving on to Ms. Harris’ possible link to The Free Masons, but I wanted to slip in a rather amusing piece I came across. It juxtapositions the many similarities between Ms. Kamala Harris and Ms. Angela Rye. Ms. Angela Rye is Executive Director and General Counsel to the Congressional Black Caucus, but doesn’t stop there. It’s a stream of consciousness that slides into tidbits about Clinton, Branson, Obama and the mystery woman with a strange hand, and anything/anyone else you can think of! </p>
<p><a href="https://mindcontrolblackassassins.com/tag/kamala-harris/">https://mindcontrolblackassassins.com/tag/kamala-harris/</a> </p>
<p>The post includes a video of Ms. Rye’s ability to do some pretty extreme maneuvers with her eyes.  See for yourself: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--odDGwB8Mc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--odDGwB8Mc</a> </p>
<p>But as for Ms. Harris’ alleged involvement and/or knowledge of a Masonic order, here’s this article about a Masonic police force that traces its ancestry back to the Knights Templar:  
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-aide-harris-accused-rogue-police-force-20150505-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-aide-harris-accused-rogue-police-force-20150505-story.html</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bizarre fake police force included Kamala Harris aide, prosecutors say One man introduced himself as chief of the Masonic Fraternal Police Department and told Johnson this was a courtesy call to let him know the agency was setting up shop in the area.</p>
<p>“When asked what is the difference between the Masonic Fraternal Police Department and other police departments, the answer is simple for us. We were here first!” the website said.</p>
<p>Johnson said Kiel did most of the talking during their meeting. Kiel said in addition to his police position, he worked for Harris. When Kiel departed, Johnson said, he left his card from the state Department of Justice.
David Beltran, a spokesman for the state Department of Justice, said Kiel was placed on paid leave April 30 — the date he was arrested. He is paid $67,416 annually as deputy director of community affairs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very bizarre story, no? Here’s another link showing him in full regalia. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Both the Masons of California, the umbrella group for 60,000 masons in the state, and the Prince Hall Grand Lodge Masons, an offshoot organization of predominately African American men’s group headquartered in Los Angeles, said that Henry and his group were unrelated to their organizations. </p>
<p>Very curious he works in Ms. Harris’ office, but can Ms. Harris’ replicate Ms. Rye’s “ninja eyes”?</p>

           And the knee-padded Ms. Harris is serious about acting as a human shield for those accused of pedophilia. She’s even protected Shia LeBouf’s dad. You know Shia? He’s the one who urinates on lawns and threatens to kill police officers. A chip off the old block, I’d say.

            EXCLUSIVE: Shia LaBeouf's pedophile father skipped the actor's Las Vegas wedding because he's been on the run from California police for years - last seen living in a party town in Costa Rica

            Offenders are obligated by law to check in annually with their local police station, provide their address and have cops update their photo.
           </p>
           <p>
            But when contacted by DailyMail.com, the Californian Attorney General's office confirmed they have no record of Jeffrey's new location and are unaware of any specific reason why he would be removed from the register.
           </p>
           <p>
            Brenda Gonzalez, press secretary to California Attorney General Kamala Harris, confirmed that even if they did know, under Department of Justice guidelines they would be unable to pass on details to the public.

           Yup, gosh! They have no idea how Shia’s dad got dropped from the offender registry list. And notice how they’re not even attempting to find out? I guess they put it down to an Oopsie! It’s great to know that they’re not concerned about with not knowing a pedophile’s whereabouts. It’s not like they’re putting a community at risk or anything. I think the only thing left to know is if Ms. Harris wears a condom in her mouth during her sexual encounters.
          </p>
          <p>
           We’ll be moving on to Ms. Harris’ possible link to The Free Masons, but I wanted to slip in a rather amusing piece I came across. It juxtapositions the many similarities between Ms. Kamala Harris and Ms. Angela Rye. Ms. Angela Rye is Executive Director and General Counsel to the Congressional Black Caucus, but doesn’t stop there. It’s a stream of consciousness that slides into tidbits about Clinton, Branson, Obama and the mystery woman with a strange hand, and anything/anyone else you can think of!

           The post includes a video of Ms. Rye’s ability to do some pretty extreme maneuvers with her eyes.  See for yourself:

           But as for Ms. Harris’ alleged involvement and/or knowledge of a Masonic order, here’s this article about a Masonic police force that traces its ancestry back to the Knights Templar:

          <blockquote>
           <p>
            Bizarre fake police force included Kamala Harris aide, prosecutors say One man introduced himself as chief of the Masonic Fraternal Police Department and told Johnson this was a courtesy call to let him know the agency was setting up shop in the area.
           </p>
           <p>
            “When asked what is the difference between the Masonic Fraternal Police Department and other police departments, the answer is simple for us. We were here first!” the website said.
           </p>
           <p>
            Johnson said Kiel did most of the talking during their meeting. Kiel said in addition to his police position, he worked for Harris. When Kiel departed, Johnson said, he left his card from the state Department of Justice.
David Beltran, a spokesman for the state Department of Justice, said Kiel was placed on paid leave April 30 — the date he was arrested. He is paid $67,416 annually as deputy director of community affairs.

           Very bizarre story, no? Here’s another link showing him in full regalia.

            Very curious he works in Ms. Harris’ office, but can Ms. Harris’ replicate Ms. Rye’s “ninja eyes”?

            Keep it up, I have had my eye on Harris for a long time going back to when the secret police ties were posted all over the front page of the LA Times. At minimum she is severely compromised.

              People are definitely reading it. I know it saved me a lot of leg work. This will become very prominent if she runs in the next presidential race. The fact that you exposed her now will even help the legitimacy later on when people try and claim it is a hit piece to try and derail her future presidential run. Send me the link when you do post part 3. Thnx in advance.

            Celibacy of Catholic Priests is Evidence of Continuing Gnostic Influence
           </p>
           <p>
            The first point at which this topic was raised as an ideal for Christian priests was the Council of Nicea in 325 (
            <a href="http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/religion-and-philosophy/apologetics/celibacy-in-the-priesthood.html">
             http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/religion-and-philosophy/apologetics/celibacy-in-the-priesthood.html))
            </a>
            )) when the influence of the Gnostic heresy was at its peak in Christianity (
            <a href="http://www.earlychristianhistory.info/nicaea.html">
             http://www.earlychristianhistory.info/nicaea.html))
            </a>
            )). It was introduced by Bishop Hosius of Cordova, who refused to stand with Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, against the Arian Gnostics. Eventually Athanasius' prevailed and Christianity was saved, but the "ideal" of the celibate priests continued. In 1074 Pope Gregory VII said anyone to be ordained must first pledge celibacy: priests [must] first escape from the clutches of their wives. In 1095 Pope Urban II had priests wives sold into slavery, children were abandoned. In 1123 Pope Calistus II: First Lateran Council decreed that clerical marriages were invalid. And in 1139 Pope Innocent II: Second Lateran Council confirmed the previous councils decree (
            <a href="https://www.futurechurch.org/brief-history-of-celibacy-in-catholic-church">
             https://www.futurechurch.org/brief-history-of-celibacy-in-catholic-church))
            </a>
            )).
           </p>
           <p>
            There is no tradition or even mention of celibate priests in the Judaism or the Old Testament. Many of the Apostles are known to have been married and the only mention of Christians potentially abstaining from marriage, though not directed at any particular group, is by the Apostle Paul (
            <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&amp;version=CEB">
             https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+7&amp;version=CEB))
            </a>
            )). Within Gnosticism, however, it is a very significant topic to this day (
            <a href="http://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1663-what-is-celibacy.html">
             http://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1663-what-is-celibacy.html))
            </a>
            )). The celibate priesthood has hurt the Catholic church now for a millennium and has led to many sex scandals that have plagued the Catholic church much more frequently than it has the Orthodox and Protestant churches. The current and on going pedophile scandal being the most recent and of those extremely damaging incidents.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Illuminati, Free Masons, and Mormons are all offshoots of Gnosticism.

             The church did not want to have to financially support or lose land to wives, widows and children so hence imposed celibacy requirements on priests. My understanding is that the celebacy issue was a purely financial motivated but disguised as dogma.

              While that kind of financial benefit may have influenced some on the whole celibacy of priests was a foreign concept to Christianity. I believe it's origin was Gnosticism.

               not really sure, I was told this many years ago by someone who had gone to a Jesuit college, I don't think Catholic Church really fusses to much where they get their ideas but I would expect that the celibacy requirement would be attractive alternative to a guy who isn't interested in marrying a woman.

                You are correct, however, that percentage of the population is very small and not all of those few aspire to become priests. Most of them seem to go into STEM fields in my experience.

                  Oh, right.  I was thinking about those who are essentially asexual, or just not really into sex that much.  Unfortunately, the pool the Catholics seem to be drawing from are homosexuals and pedophiles, though the vast majority are good people who remain faithful to what they see as their calling.

                   an old roommate of mine was great friends with a guy who had gone through the seminary, wanted to be a priest but just at the end, he was put in a compromising sexual situation and he refused, he ended up leaving the program just before he would have finished, it was an initiation ritual that he wouldn't agree to. I don't know if this is true of every one going into the seminary but ultimately this guy became a flight attendant instead.

                    My position is that it is well past time Christians took their churches back.  I'm not sure what has to happen to finally flip the switch on Christians the way Trump has on Americans, but it needs to happen real darn quick.  The church is on the verge of being lost, much like this nation has been.

                     I think the church is already lost, at least in the US. You can't systemically molest young kids and not have that generation turn its back. and its views on women are simply neanderthal.  to evolve into something that it must be to be what it needs to be is a different creature altogether, it missed its chance, it could have been enlightened but too many times it missed its chance. the inquisition, the reformation wars, the pedophilia it just doesn't ever step up and do the right thing.

             Not sure why you'd get kicked off for this. The idea of celibacy is interesting. The thing is that it doesn't matter with pedophiles. They're often married and continue to abuse, molest, and ruin lives.

            Insurance companies report 228 cases of sexual abuse per year by Catholic and 260 per year by Protestant clergy (

            ).  Given that 51.3% of Americans are Protestant and 23.9% Catholic (

            </a>
            ) that would indicate you have a 1.9 times greater chance of being sexually abused as a Catholic.

             Thanks for the statistical analysis. I think the numbers are astounding. It's why I posted the 101 cases. If you had 101 of a disease, they'd cordoned off the city and get the CDC in there ... pronto! But a 101 kids abused? No big deal. The DA hides evidence ... the church goes on ... the priests continue to be priests ... and the kids are left to carry the burden on their own.

              for posting the above. Apparently statistics are un-Christian. My opinion is that turning a deaf ear to the cries of children being molested by sick perverts is un-Christian, but that is just me.

            Thanks and Part III is going to be the most troubling. Extremely disturbing stuff. Yeah, that police force ... it reminds me of a co-workers story. She said her father was in the Masonic order. He had a special cane that he had in his possession that was used in ceremonies, but how she was never told. She only knew it was connected to his position. Well, he died, and his mother was going through things, and there was the cane. She set it aside because she didn't know what to do with it. It was in the living room, on a table. She went out to the grocery store and came back to find it gone. Nothing else in the house was disturbed, only the cane with the strange markings. That story came back to me when I read about that. Had to be the Masonic police that stole that cane.

             I was a pall bearer at the funeral of a friend who was a mason. Two creepy looking dudes from the order showed up and said some words without being particularly welcome to do that. They did some sort of ritual too.
