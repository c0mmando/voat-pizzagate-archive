            While possibly a coincidence, as soon as people start responding and looking into Racine, Wisconsin strange things happen. They also started talking about mods and stopping trolls to silence, and there were excessively aggressive 'timeouts' imposed on another live stream. Reddit Pizzagate was shutdown right after Racine posts gained steam (see the last post ever made on Reddit Pizzagate), other streams were shut down, shills show up in mass, attempted murders occur, strange news occurs, major shifts in the narrative happen. It is scary considering that at least some rogue element of certain agencies are absolutely involved, which is verified from several meetings and obstruction in a federal RICO case. The cover ups and avoidance of legitimate investigations happened at the local, state and federal level with Loretta Lynch personally committed to it until she knew the connection with the Clintons, and with nearly any normal media outlet has also avoided it. There is no where to go, and it is not safe. Racine is a key to show how this all works at the higher level.
           </p>
           <p>
            They use controlled cities as a forced sample to experiment and push an agenda, and begin to control markets and resources including Lake Michigan. It is difficult to know who to trust when no one will actually investigate it for themselves. We don't like providing links to push anyone toward one particular subjective source or another, and are distributing backup information for protection, but there is no protection against people of this type of power. Look at recent news to see how they cover it up with musical chairs - Mayor resignation, past Mayor arrest, City Administrator resignation, DA arrest and resignation, dead judge, satanic murders, extreme trafficking levels, gangs and mafia ties, RICO and extreme corruption, and ties to the most powerful people in the world through groups including Pilgrims Society, Bilderberg, CFR, and others.
           </p>
           <p>
            Racine is what connects the establishment at the top through the Global Agenda (Agenda 2030 with United Nations). Bush, McCain, Ryan, Priebus, Johnson, and Clinton, Schumer, Weiner, Pelosi, Feingold and others. They are all working for the real people in charge, including the secret societies they are a part of. It includes the Pilgrims Society and Knights of Pythias among many others. It links to trafficking, harvesting and racketeering through the mafia, churches, businesses and organizations. Everything is rigged. Blackmail, extortion, embezzlement, laundering, tax evasion, threats and murder are standard patterns and practices, and there is a history of pedo and satanic abuse mixed with Sanctuary status and strange anomalies such as extremely high highest infant mortality rates. It is closely associated with Sustainability, Vaccines, Viruses and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, and is a model for Community Policing, Educational Curriculum control, and many more nefarious activities.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a legitimate concern that some investigators are steering away from the real bigger picture, while Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption are covered up with Ashton Kutcher and pop up organizations like The Fight to End Exploitation that is connected with known corrupt criminal elements. It is all a cover up like Timothy Dolan did with the Catholic Church and may be rewarded by being the first American Pope.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are many narratives out there, but the one that no one is willing to really investigate is Racine, Wisconsin. That is the true litmus test. Why won't Trump or anyone address it and do a real open honest investigation on how Racine ties to corruption and racketeering within both the DNC and RNC, the Clinton Foundation, McCain Foundation, Political Action Committees, and many other groups. Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Colorado, DC, Chicago, and New York are key controlled areas that are linked together through these corrupt networks, then linked globally to Haiti, Ghana, Belgium, Norway, UK, and other main hubs of Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption.
           </p>
           <p>
            THIS IS NOT DISINFO. THIS COULD BE A MAJOR KEY TO SOLVING A LOT MORE THAN SETH RICH'S MURDER. THIS IS MUCH BIGGER AND INCLUDES THE MURDER OF MANY OTHERS INCLUDING SENATOR PAUL WELLSTONE. WE NEED HELP. IF YOU WANT TO CROWDSOURCE ANY TRUTH, IT LINKS BACK TO AGENDA 2030, PILGRIMS SOCIETY AND RACINE.

             The only reason I can think of is the question my mother asked me when I showed her this site, "Why the hell do they have all this Seth Rich shit on here, it makes it very hard to follow the peodo leads?"  She said that if she joined she would downvote every single entry that mentioned his name on
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             until someone provided a direct link to his knowledge/participation in child trafficking and peodophilia, since there is a
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/SethRich">
              v/SethRich
             </a>
             place for them to be."  Edit: I couldn't think of a good answer.

              Webb has focused on human/child trafficking in a high number of his videos... and everything he is finding/connecting all rolls up to the powers that be. If Seth Rich was murdered by the DNC, this is directly tied to the leaks, if the leaks are further investigated, we could get some serious traction and begin to uncover a whole new slew of data points.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are also a number of posts on Voat that connect dots from the Seth Rich case, back to potential ties to PG.

               The question you asked was as to why you received 2 downvotes w/o any comment,  my response was my experience as to a possible reason.  And I am still unable to give answer to the question she asked because no one has explained why they post on

               and hadn't noticed how many downvotes Seth Rich entries were getting on PG sub, but looking back through them I still think that is the reason for all the downvotes.

                Good point! I still think it's related... hell, at this point, any dirt we can dig on DeepState is related if it gets them closer to the light.

              Ok, way to contribute... do you think an active Mossad disinfo agent would admit on video that he was affiliated with Mossad, and post it?!
             </p>
             <p>
              Sounds to me like you are regurgitating the same old bullshit and not really focusing on the possibility that the information he's providing could be actionable.
