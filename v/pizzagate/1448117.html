Raise the bounty for hackers to $100,000 to produce the smoking gun evidence. Let the nerd virgins from their comfy Basement save the children and destroy the elites. Dont destroy the life of your hot wife by killing yourself in the pedo tunnels underneath comet pong pizza by some sleezeball weasel like James alefontis.  No evidence no doe. Just saying guys if you wanna keep wasting away days that are filled with pedophilia it\'d be best if you coordinated with hackers becuase useless paper connections won\'t mean shit because no pedophile is dumb enough to leave it out there and you can\'t even get a smoking gun without video or pics anyways. So that\'s where the hackers come in. I know most of you are the average investigator who want to help but this case and like all other cases in the FBI are solved by high level computer nerd virgins who end up getting tons of pussy after their first big case crack and tons of lives saved. So rich and poor jock boys post up a big bounty for the hackers so they can buy all the pussy they want.</p>',

            Finding a smoking gun would involve the hacking of Instagram so that jimmycomet's complete account history was opened up, along with the accounts of his close friends and co-conspirators. Or someone working at Instagram could leak them. Apart from this, I don't see any chance of Pizzagate going much further. They'll maintain a wall of silence until everyone has run out of stuff to say, which will probably happen pretty soon.
