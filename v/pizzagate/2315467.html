<p>So the main thing I wanted to discuss was the Tamera Luzzatto farm which is discussed in the wikileaks.</p>
<p>First things first, take a look at this website, featuring Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John McCain all holding Mr Potato Head because I happen to come from a land of Potatoes called Ireland and I can tell you 100% this relates to pizzagate and no I am not high.  Well I am but it is not impeding my judgement most of you will be blinded by alcohol in several hours.
Tamera Luzzatto was also photographed holding Mr. Potato Head.  Ireland seems to be a running theme.  I had no idea of the deep Israeli/Irish connection before a few months ago, as exemplified by the family wishes of <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CHtMt">Seth Rich</a></p>
<hr />
<p>So let\'s take a look at these &quot;talking heads&quot; worshipping their potato headed mascot:

<hr />
<p>Need I remind you all that Mr Potato Head appeared in a film called Toy Story which featured a pizza restaurant called <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/d/d3/Pizza_Planet2.jpg">Pizza Planet</a>, not dissimilar to the name &quot;Comet Ping Pong&quot;, wouldn\'t you say?</p>
<p>Oh look, you get to Pizza Planet by rocket.  hahaha
The Planet in question seems to clearly be <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/otis/images/c/ca/Tape_runs_out.jpg">Saturn</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>OK so back to The Farm...</p>
<p>Tamera Luzzatto is here wearing a red feather boa draped around her standing beside the well coiffed Heather Podesta

I am the swift uplifting rush

            Weird how new posts on subjects that are amoral get light touches like this out of random. The woman is satanic. She pimps out not her own children, the mother is dead. , many children , had blogs that are restricted . Helps source children through her work, where she is CEO Pew Charities
Knows John Podesta really well
