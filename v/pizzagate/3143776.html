BOTTOM LINE: They TORE DOWN the crime scene, no one knew about the doctor\'s personal life, even though he was supposedly a wildly popular pediatrician, and  &quot;More than 100 victims have been identified from the 13 hours of video made of the assaults. Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden last week announced a 471-count indictment against the physician.&quot;   While AG Biden made sure Bradley was locked up FOR LIFE, and didn\'t use personal testimony, just the VIDEOS, are we to assume that Dr. Bradley WAS THE ONLY CONSUMER OF THE VOLUMINOUS NUMBER OF CHILD PORN VIDEOS? Evidently, this was not looked into according to news reports.

<p>&quot;The couple said investigators have told them several of the counts in the indictment relate to crimes against their daughter. Bradley said he was treating the child for a recurrent urinary-tract infection, which they now see as a ruse.
&quot;It was just a way for him to examine her private parts every time we took her,&quot; said the husband. &quot;We have laid in bed until 3 o\'clock in the morning to review every visit from birth to now, looking for clues.&quot;
In retrospect, they said, there were some: He lavished hugs and nose rubs on their daughter while being businesslike and perfunctory with their son, now 2; the kisses on the cheek that their daughter had lately begun to complain of; that quick visit to the basement.&quot;

<p>BEAU BIDEN, JOE\'S DECEASED SON, supported &quot;Senate Bill 158 would entitle victims of child pornography to damages of at least $150,000. Under the bill, victims would be presumed injured, sparing them and their families the burden of proving specific damages in court.

<p>&quot;John McCain’s Brain Tumor: Ted Kennedy, Beau Biden Had Same Diagnosis&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Washington Post noted that Beau Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, also died of the same type of tumor. The Post reported that the tumor is called a Glioblastoma and “is an aggressive cancer that is the most common of all malignant brain tumors. About 12,400 new cases are expected in 2017.” </p>

            What I have always found interesting was Beau Biden's position in this case, where he defended the lenient sentence for the
            <strong>
             DuPont heir
            </strong>
            for raping his daughter. (He only got probation in a plea deal - Beau Biden said 'he wouldn't have fared well in prison' :-( ).
           </p>
           <p>
            This somehow never fit into the 'Beau Biden is a hero who put Bradley into prison' narrative.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The child sexual abuse case against a du Pont family heir who raped his young daughter was weak, and prosecutors offered an appropriate plea bargain that spared him prison while convicting him of a felony sex crime, Attorney General Beau Biden said Thursday.

             "This was not a strong case, and a loss at trial was a distinct possibility," Biden wrote in a letter submitted to The News Journal.

             <strong>
              Biden also defended Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden, who noted in her sentencing order that the wealthy father "will not fare well" in prison.
             </strong>
             Biden said the judge "exercised sound discretion based solely on the merits of the case before her" and doesn't allow a defendant's "wealth or social status" to influence her decisions.

              Jurden has been criticized and has been the subject of threats because she gave Robert H. Richards IV probation after he admitted to fourth-degree rape of his daughter.

            <p>
             <strong>
              Jurden's 2009 ruling followed recommendations from Biden's office.
             </strong>
             Much of the ire against Jurden stems from her notation in her sentencing order about Richards' fitness for prison,
             <strong>
              which she listed as a mitigating factor.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             She also noted as mitigating factors impacting the sentence that Richards "has significant treatment needs that must be met"

             His case gained publicity last month when his ex-wife, Tracy, filed a lawsuit seeking damages
             <strong>
              for the rape of his daughter from ages 3 to 5, and accusing him of admitting to sexually abusing his toddler son.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The lawsuit states the admissions about his son came while he was on probation and were included in reports submitted to the judge. Police investigated claims about the boy in 2010 and did not file charges, but said the investigation is reopened in the wake of the allegations in the lawsuit.
            </p>
            <p>
             Biden's office initially indicted Richards on two counts of second-degree rape, charges that carried a minimum 20 years in prison. The indictment said the abuse started when his daughter was about 3½ and ended less than a couple of months before she turned 5.
            </p>
            <p>
             The second-term attorney general, who often touts his prosecution and imprisonment of child predators and those who view child pornography, is up for re-election in November.
            </p>
            <p>
             Biden wrote that the prosecutor, Renee Hrivnak, whom he did not name in his letter, cut the deal to ensure that Richards was convicted as a child sex offender.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hrivnak recommended probation for Richards, something Chief Deputy Attorney General Ian R. McConnel said last week he would have preferred she not have done. He said "it would have been my hope that she would have asked for open sentencing."
            </p>
            <p>
             Biden defended how the case was handled.
            </p>
            <p>
             The girl was the "only eyewitness" besides Richards, who did not agree to be interviewed by police, Biden wrote. There was no "medical or forensic" evidence, Biden wrote, to corroborate the child's account to the Children's Advocacy Center at Alfred I. du Pont Hospital for Children in Rockland, which has experts who interview children in abuse cases.

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "The defendant did not make a statement to police, although he made an ambiguous apology to the victim's mother. A conviction would have required 12 jurors to find unanimously, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime had occurred," Biden wrote.
            </p>
            <p>
             Richards' daughter gave consistent accounts about his abuse, according to the arrest warrant filed by New Castle County police Detective JoAnna Burton.
            </p>
            <p>
             First, she told her grandmother, who reported to the state's Division of Family Services hotline that the girl, in graphic terms, said her father digitally penetrated her, the warrant said. Her grandmother, Donna Burg, told police she took the girl into the bathroom and asked where he touched her. The grandmother said the girl repeated her claim, and said "daddy said it was our little secret," and later said, "I don't want my daddy touching me anymore," the warrant said.
            </p>
            <p>
             The arrest warrant also stated that Richard's wife told the officer she confronted her husband, whom she was still married to at the time. He said the penetration of his daughter "was an accident and he would never do it again," the warrant said.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the Children's Advocacy Center, the girl told the child specialist who interviewed her that her father was "never going to come back home' because, again in graphic terms, her father digitally penetrated her two times, the warrant said. She told the interviewer that she told her father it hurt and he apologized, the warrant said.
            </p>
            <p>
             According to the lawsuit filed by his ex-wife, Richards said during a polygraph taken while on probation that he abused his daughter at least four times. The lawsuit also said the girl told her pediatrician about his father's penetration of her.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Instead of taking the case to trial, though, Biden's office offered Richards a plea to fourth-degree rape, which carries no mandatory prison time and has a range of zero to 30 months under state sentencing guidelines.
             </strong>
             Biden noted the guidelines are zero to 22 months for defendants who accept responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
             Richards' defense attorney at the time, Eugene J. Maurer Jr., recently called the offer "more than reasonable."
            </p>
            <p>
             "In recognition of the weakness of the case, the assigned prosecutor offered a plea and sentence recommendation that guaranteed the defendant would be required to register as a sex offender, participate in court-ordered sex offender rehabilitation therapy and to have no contact with the victim and any other child under the age of 16," Biden wrote. "A loss at trial would have rendered any of these restrictions impossible."
            </p>
            <p>
             The perils of a trial in child rape cases involving very young children can be prohibitive, Biden wrote, noting that such victims often provide differing accounts of the abuse and are "on the cusp of being capable of relating an event in detail. The younger the child, the less detailed the account is going to be."
            </p>
            <p>
             Without physical evidence, "The sum total of the evidence is often the word of the child against the word of the alleged perpetrator." The child "must testify in a sterile courtroom in a room full of strangers."
            </p>
            <p>
             Biden added that before a child can even testify, a judge must deem them competent and decide they know "the difference between right and wrong." Children who clear that threshold then face "the additional trauma by having to recount the abuse in front of the very person who committed it" usually several months to a year after the crime.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jurden's sentence of eight years in prison, suspended for eight years of probation plus treatment and no contact with children under 16 "was made after careful deliberation with due regard of all the circumstances," Biden wrote.
            </p>
            <p>
             Delaware Public Defender Brendan O'Neill and defense attorney Thomas Foley also wrote a letter defending Jurden on behalf of the Delaware Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys. The lawyers said Jurden's sentence was a normal outcome for a fourth-degree rape conviction.
            </p>
            <p>
             "Suspending jail time for probation is frequently the sentence imposed by all of the judges on the Superior Court for first-time offenders convicted of offenses of this nature," the defense lawyers wrote.
            </p>
            <p>
             O'Neill noted in an interview last week that he had not seen a judge note as a "reason not to send someone to jail" a concern, as Jurden did in Richards' case, that the criminal would not fare well in prison, even though he and his deputies have often argued that a defendant was too ill or frail for prison.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the letter Thursday that he and Foley wrote, they questioned why The News Journal did not state in earlier stories that Biden's office "was required to confer with the victim's family before extending the plea offer that resolved the case." The letter also noted that a presentence report, which has not been released publicly, would have recorded whether the victim's family had objections "to the resolution negotiated by the prosecution."
            </p>
            <p>
             Joseph S. Grubb, chief New Castle County prosecutor, said the case file shows that Hrivnak discussed the plea offer of fourth-degree rape with Tracy Richards on June 8, 2008, about three weeks before the plea was entered. Grubb said the file reflects how Tracy Richards felt about the deal, but he would not disclose the information because Richards has not commented publicly.

            Interesting that all three developed GBM.  A good friend of mine developed GBM after receiving transcranial magnetic stimulation to cure major depression -- right in the same area of the brain.

            </a>
            that shows it can be caused by environment factors:

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The only established risk factors for glioblastoma are ionizing radiation and certain inherited genetic disorders [3]. A number of other possibilities have been explored including, but not limited to, occupational exposures, infectious agents, medications, head trauma, blood transfusion, surgery, anesthesia, and lifestyle factors such as diet, however, the evidence for their role as GBM risk factors is inconclusive [3, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17].&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
             Although this study has a relatively small number of incident GBM cases and resultant statistical power is low, results indicate that at least two variables are worthy of further investigation, intensity of carbon tetrachloride exposure and dietary levels of glucose. A usual job with medium or high exposure to carbon tetrachloride was independently associated with development of GBM; examples of such occupations included dry cleaners, firemen, chemists, machinists, and radio/TV repairmen. The association of carbon tetrachloride and other chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons has been reported previously [18]. An epidemiologic investigation showed elevated brain cancer mortality was associated with cumulative exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbons[19]

              , so I guess you could call it that. It cured her terrible depression when everything else failed (including electroshock therapy). They said it was not the cause of the tumor, but as I was just reading about it, I noticed that it can allow drugs (and probably also pathogens and toxins) to cross the blood brain barrier. It may have created a situation in which chlorinated hydrocarbons (Claritin? Teflon pans? Pesticides?) which ARE a known cause of GBM to become more toxic.

            "Lewes doctor released on bail
Hearing set on toddler rape charges
Ryan Mavity
December 18, 2009"
           </p>
           <p>
            "The office featured a theater where cartoons were shown and a Disney-themed examination room, and Bradley told the Cape Gazette he liked to distribute bumblebee snugglers to his tiny patients. One room he said he was fond of was dedicated to painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell.
           </p>
           <p>
            “One of the things that attracted me to pediatrics was the old Norman Rockwell depiction of a doctor,” Bradley said. He also said he “wanted to have people wonder what crazy Dr. Bradley will do next. I want kids, as they grow up, to have all different memories of coming here.”"
           </p>
           <p>
            "On Wednesday, Dec. 16, the Lewes pediatrician was arrested on felony charges relating to an alleged rape of a 2-year-old female patient.  Bradley, 56, of BayBees Pediatrics, was arrested on charges filed by Delaware State Police Troop 4 late Tuesday, Dec. 15, after state officials interviewed the victim. Detectives from Troop 4 placed Bradley into custody Wednesday, Dec. 16. Police received a warrant to search Bradley’s Lewes office, and detectives removed several computers and medical files.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cpl. Thomas Guarini, state police spokesman, said Bradley has been charged with second-degree rape, first-degree unlawful sexual contact and first-degree endangering the welfare of a child. All three charges are felonies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bradley was arraigned at Justice of the Peace Court 3 in Georgetown Dec. 16, where he was read his rights and obligations. The case has been transferred to the Court of Common Pleas in Georgetown for a preliminary hearing at 8:30 a.m., Wednesday, Dec. 23. Bail was set at $36,000. According to Justice of the Peace Court 3, Bradley posted bond Dec. 16 through Court 7 in Dover."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Detectives began investigating Bradley after complaints to state police, Guarini said. He said police did not arrest Bradley sooner because they did not have evidence until the current complaint surfaced. In a search of Bradley’s offices, detectives seized medical records of patients involved in the investigation. Guarini said police hope to go back and look at the medical records and computer files to determine whether additional charges should be filed. He said he did not know and did not want to speculate if any security or surveillance cameras were seized.
           </p>
           <p>
            In light of the charges, Beebe Medical Center has suspended Bradley’s privileges."

            Dr. Earl Bradley's office demolished [Delaware Online News Video] (Includes footage of Beau Biden)
            <br/>
            The only evidence used in the Bradley case were the VIDEOS shown to a judge. NO JURY TRIAL.  DNA evidence destroyed in the office?
COMMENT:
"This guy was indicted on a record 529 counts of child sex abuse; more than seventy percent of the charges were for rape.  He was sentenced to fourteen consecutive life terms plus 165 years without the possibility of parole (they should had killed him).﻿"

            "A local real estate agent who bought Bradley's office property in foreclosure said he would raze the buildings, a move applauded by state authorities. The office complex is in Lewes, Del.
A spokesman for the attorney general's office said officials agreed that demolishing the buildings was in the best interest of the victims, their families and the community."

            Delaware warns Dr. Earl B. Bradley’s patients—Former pediatrician may have administered diluted, expired vaccines
           </p>
           <p>
            "Former Sussex County pediatrician Earl B. Bradley might have given diluted or expired vaccines to about 5,000 patients, state officials said Thursday.
Charged with raping and sexually abusing one boy and more than 100 girls he treated, Bradley also might not have “adequately immunized” patients during the 15 years he worked around Lewes and Milford.
In a letter sent Wednesday to the parents of Bradley’s patients, the Division of Public Health and Attorney General’s Office warned that their children may need to be reimmunized “against infection.”
"The warning stems from a report by Dr. Melvin L. Morse, who said he considered joining Bradley’s Milford office in 2007. Though Morse told The News Journal he informed state officials in 2007 that Bradley told him he was giving bogus saline vaccines and kept expired vaccines, Deputy Attorney General Patricia Dailey Lewis said her office first heard the allegation from Morse in April — more than four months after Bradley was arrested for raping children."
           </p>
           <p>
            "In 160 pages of disturbing court documents, Bradley is accused of videotaping sexual acts with his young patients and molesting them repeatedly while their parents waited in nearby examination rooms.
Bradley, who had been in the 1,300-person town of Lewes since 1994, is accused of abusing his patients for the past 11 years."
           </p>
           <p>
            "According to the arrest documents, the examination room known as the Pinocchio Room because of its decorations was seen frequently on the video tapes obtained by authorities that reportedly show Bradley undressing his patients and performing sex acts on them.
In another room decked out with “The Little Mermaid” paraphernalia, equally horrific abuse allegedly occurred at the hands of Bradley, who investigators said was seen on the tapes muzzling screaming children as they tried to flee the abuse.
Described as a 6-foot, 225-pound man, Bradley allegedly had a “violently enraged expression on his face” as he yelled to a 2-year-old patient to perform sexual acts on him. That particular video was described by the investigating officer in court documents as “one of the most violent and brutal attacks on a child of any age” that he had ever seen." MUCH MORE INFO.

            Offices Where Doc Raped Kids to Be Destroyed
           </p>
           <p>
            "The doctor’s offices on Delaware Route 1 will be emptied of all of Bradley’s personal belongings and then bulldozed to nothingness the same day, authorities told the News Journal.
“Everything is going to be demolished, 100 percent,” said Harry Caswell, a contractor who has been organizing the volunteer demolition effort told the News Journal. “They don’t want anything to get out to the public.”
A spokesman for Attorney General Beau Biden tells The News Journal of Wilmington, Del., that logistical details for the Oct. 10 demolition are still being worked out with other state agencies."

             Evidently, after the death of Beau Biden, younger son Hunter Biden stepped up to the plate. Must see!
            </p>
            <p>
             FIRST SCANDAL:
"Kathleen Biden, Joe Biden’s daughter-in-law, has filed for divorce from Hunter Biden, according to an explosive March 2 report. It all comes on the heels of us learning about Hunter’s affair with Beau Biden’s widow Hallie, and though we knew Hunter and Kathleen had separated, this makes it all official.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Biden Family Scandal just keeps escalating! Kathleen Biden is divorcing Hunter Biden, according to court documents obtained by TMZ, and the couple has apparently been formally separated since October 2015. Of course, the news broke on March 1 that Hunter and Beau Biden‘s widow Hallie are officially dating, so it makes sense that divorce papers, which were filed in December 2016, are the next thing to surface!"
