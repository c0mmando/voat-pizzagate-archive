            you're asking too much of people. The ice bucket challenge worked because all they had to do was get ice water poured on them and have all their friends see it (look at me, look at me). IF you ask people to research, it won't spread anywhere near as fast.
           </p>
           <p>
            But there is merit in some sort of social challenge purely to raise awareness that "pizzagate exists". So many people have never heard of it. If we turn it into a household name, more researchers will naturally appear, and more pressure will be on MSM to report actual news about it if they want to sell papers etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            So.. i would just make it a pizza based challenge. Something like seeing how many pieces of pizza you can eat in 40 seconds because "every 40 seconds a child disappears in the USA".
           </p>
           <p>
            It reinforces the message, it brands it nicely, it's relevant and it's fun...
           </p>
           <p>
            But be sure to call it "the Pizzagate Challenge" right from day one. Don't want it ever being called "the pizza challenge" or the "40 second pizza challenge". The value is in the branding.
