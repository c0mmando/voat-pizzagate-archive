            "Another possibility, which I incline to, is that Ling and Lee may have been sold to North Korea by a local guide. If the guide said that it was safe to cross, or that they were still on Chinese territory, they would have believed him. Moreover, by some accounts they were working on a story about human trafficking — there’s a good deal of trafficking of North Korean women and girls into China, into prostitution and to be wives of peasants — and the traffickers could well have tricked them in exchange for a reward from North Korea.

            They were flown back to L.A, from my understanding. The only reason I can guess they would come to D.C., 3 days after being rescued, would potentially be for security/intelligence de-briefing(s)., But I also believe that would have occurred on the airplane, returning back., With multiple intelligence agency(s) personnel.
           </p>
           <p>
            The image from Comets was just one the things that kind of had me questioning this whole situation regarding the rescue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would Bill Clinton use Steve Bing's, personal airplane instead of a military or US sanctioned/secured airplane?
           </p>
           <p>
            And apologies. I dont believe they were smuggling kids. I believe the women were searching for human trafficking information and found more than what they bargained for.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wouldn't have speculated much, until I saw the article(s) regarding,
            <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/al-gore-had-reservations-about-selling-current-tv-to-al-jazeera-court-papers-say-1408652509">
             $75-100 million
            </a>
            that Al Gore made after selling the failing media company. This was few years later (way after Current TV's reputation had sunk), but it was sold to

           </p>
           <p>
            These profits where questioned by many in the economic community., Which I believe ties into the Clinton's dirt money trail.

             Exactly. They may have found some connection to the Clintons and to silence them, they arranged their release. I dunno. I know little about this particular rabbit hole, but these posts sound great, and seem to be well sourced! I wish more posts were like this!

            They were likely investigating human trafficking:

            The odd part is, Bill Clinton (suspected predator) borrows an airplane from Steve Bing to fly them home.

            Both Clinton and Bing are in Epstein's flight logs for the Lolita Express.

           <p>
            It seems plenty of people want to give the Clintons free airfare because they can write off the expenses as a donation, whereas the Clinton Foundation doesn't have to declare the perk. But that's a separate issue.

            Yes actually it's exactly the email that started PG on 4ch. They were wondering about the weird comment (It doesn't get better than this) and some anon pointed that cheese pizza was a pedo codeword. That's what launched the first frantic search of food related words in wikileaks.

              find 'sugar daddies' - or older, richer men who would spoil them.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Could be used for say, billionaires recruiting young desperate women?
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              She goes to a party where young women try to find a suitor. All of the attendees are in masks and some of the men are married. 
Ling then interviews some of them, asking them why they want to pick a partner using the method. 
One admits they were homeless when they went on their first 'sugar date' while others used it as an opportunity to go to college because they had nothing.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So alot of these women are teens preparing to go to college or women that are homeless, or on the verge of being homeless? 
Sounds like these billionaires really took their "leverage" to easy prey. These guys are pretty much trying to shoot fish in a barrel.

            You do realize that that email was sent from someone from Bill Clinton's office just about three days after Clinton got them released from NK, don't you?  As far as I have seen, they were making a documentary, not involved in human trafficking themselves.  Given that they had just been released, and one of them had a daughter who was 4, IIRC, Podesta's reply makes perfect sense, as does the child in the photo.

              The journalists were arrested on March 17 while conducting research on human trafficking near the North Korea's border with China. Ling and Lee were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor in June for illegally crossing the North Korean border.

             <p>
              They were said to have been reporting on the trafficking of women and shooting video of the border region of China and North Korea when they were arrested at the Tumen River.
The two reporters were accompanied by two men, an American cameraman (Mitch Koss [7]) and a guide who was an ethnic Korean citizen of China.
Pastor Chun Ki-won of refugee aid organization Durihana, who was interviewed in the 2005 National Geographic documentary "Inside North Korea", had helped Lee and Ling organize their trip to China.[8] After their arrival in China, Chun introduced Lee and Ling to Kim Seong-cheol (김성철), an ethnic Korean citizen of China who served as a guide and escort for the two reporters during their work.[9]

             Let me propose three questions?
            </p>
            <p>
             *1. How does Kim Seong-cheol (김성철), "an ethnic Korean citizen of China", mistake which side of the river he is on? North Korea and China are divided by the Tumen river [

              Its not a small river, might I add
             </a>
             ]. No Chinese citizen, local to the area [assuming its why he was hired as their escort], would mistake which side of the river they are on. One side = free, other side = fucked. I think anyone local to the region, or even visiting, will remain well aware what side of the river they are on.
            </p>
            <p>
             *2. How does camera man and
             <strong>
              producer
             </strong>
             , Mitch Koss, manage to get away, across that river? Would the camera man not be more plausible for capture, considering he was carrying the equipment. It seems this is a regular thing for

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Many times, Koss seems to put [reporters] in harm's way just for the heck of it on stories that had been covered before by others.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             *3. Why would former President Clinton need to get involved? You'r Wiki states:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Former Pres. Bill Clinton made an unannounced trip to Pyongyang on August 4, 2009.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             For starters, I didn't know any American politician had the balls/authority, to just show up unannounced in North Korea., And why wouldn't the Obama Administration and Secretary Kerry get involved. Why would someone risk a former president to go do these negotiations?

             My assumption is there was some conflict of interest involved with the Clinton's.
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe Doug Band, wanted to use it as a PR scheme, to garner more "donors" for the Clinton Global Initiative? 
But there's alot about this story that doesnt make sense.

             Im just tossing some information and theory out there, incase people want to explore some of the individuals involved some more.

              Inside the realm known as Clintonland, he is the subject of considerable angst. There are those who worry about the overlap between his work for the Clinton Global Initiative— which he conceived and helped run for six years—and his energetic efforts to expand Teneo’s client base. And there are those who worry about how some of the messier aspects of the charity’s operations could create trouble for Hillary Clinton, who has made the family foundation her base as she contemplates a presidential run. But the real cause for these anxieties runs deeper. At its heart, the unease with Band reflects an unease with the phenomenon of post-presidential Clintonism itself.

             The icing on the cake and admission of guilt comes from Doug Band himself, in email

             Doug Band was the one who sent the pizza.jpg image. Doug Band only has two jobs. #1) Make money for CGI (Clinton global initiative), WJC (william jefferson clinton), and Taneo Clients., And #2) Increase the public's outlook on CGI, WJC, and Taneo Clients.

             I just have a hard time believing the former president needed to get involved in direct diplomacy and negotiations with North Korea.

              As to your first two questions, I don't know, I wasn't there.  Nor do I see any reason to dig deeper into that at this point.

              As far as Clinton going over there, that was arranged with NK prior to his going.  He did not simply pop in on the leader of NK.
             </p>
             <p>
              Hillary Clinton was the Secretary of State at the time this took place, btw.  There were reports that Senator Kerry and even Al Gore, along with the State Department and President Clinton were involved in arranging the trip.

               that Al Gore made after selling the failing media company. This was few years later (way after their reputation had sunk), but it was sold to

              <p>
               I also thought the last interaction Clinton had with North Korea and it's leader, was during the

                nuclear missile crisis of 94'
               </a>
               . I still find it very hard to believe that Kim Jong-il, would request a man he almost went to war with, to come negotiate. North Korea isn't really known for their level headed approach to things. This was also

              <p>
               Dont forget, they negotiated the reporters freedoms. Meaning Kim Jong-il must have gotten something significant in return. 
You dont trade two prisoners for nothing., Especially when you where able to gain a meeting with the former president. Some countries have to pay

                I'm sorry you went to all that work to include all the links in your reply, perhaps someone else will be interested in following them.  While those leads may well be worth looking into, that is not currently my focus.  Again, as to the picture of the two women and the one's daughter, I do not feel that is worthy of investigation, nor do I feel Podesta's reply was suspect.
