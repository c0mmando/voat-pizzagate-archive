<p>Jimmy didnt do a monologue, instead he did the fucking david bowie song &quot;Lets Sway&quot;.  i was drifting off and i heard the words &quot;put on your red shoes and dance&quot; or something and instantly it caught my attention bc of <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1455737">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1455737</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1546891">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1546891</a> and there was a thread i think in the last week that i cant find rn that quoted bowies song and tied it all together anyhow the song and the line caught my attention</p>
<p>next there were multiple jokes involving pizza. one about loving . 13:50 mins in the black guy keenan something is playing steve harvey on family feud and says to john travolta from 1977 played by jimmy fallon &quot;man, you like if somebody <em>taught a pizza</em> how to talk&quot; <a href="http://www.onwatchseries.ac/link/thevideo.me/14964478">http://www.onwatchseries.ac/link/thevideo.me/14964478</a></p>
<p>15:45 liza minelli says to kristen stewart (the people playing them) &quot;oh look at you, youre just a little <em>orphan boy</em> but youre so beautiful!&quot; which the joke intended is shes a scrawny dirty he or w.e but after bowies red shoes and a pizza talking comment then an orphan boy idk</p>
<p>16:35 liza minelli is answering &quot;what keeps you up at night&quot; to &quot;steve harvey&quot; and she says &quot;everything, everything! but lately its been just a terrible, unqualified president! <em>jimmy carter, he\'s just a pedophile!</em>&quot; Steve responds &quot;show me president wackadoo!&quot; and its 2nd on the board and he says &quot;it was true then <em>its even truer now</em>&quot; which may not have been specific to pedophilia but u kno.............</p>
<p>22:40 skit starts guy and girl sitting on couch together guy says &quot;okay on the count of 3 favorite food- 1, 2, 3!&quot; simultaneously &quot;<em>Pizza!</em>&quot; then the girl says &quot;ok wow, this.. feels.. right. I, I like you.&quot; guy says &quot;<em>more than pizza</em>?&quot; girl says &quot;ok ok lots not get ahead of ourselves mister.......but, maybe&quot; they makeout then someone knocks on the door.</p>
<p>27 melissa mccarthy is doing spicer impersonation and its all eastery and she ends up going over holocaust chem weapons comments and then ends up on passover. from my understanding a lotta kids get taken and their blood drank on passover and she calls it jewish easster i mean easter look for easter eggs passover find and snatch kids idk im reaching no doubt but there could be similarities in the eyes of some and they made many pizza and pizzagate comments so far and i guess its bc it is passover so they are acknowledging their cannibalistic bonanza or someshit?? </p>

on this one here i need to make it clear i agree with him entirely but his explanation is not enough because many jews are not like this and they have been subjected to so much shit theyve been made scapegoats of pretend turncoat nonbeliever satanists and real jews are not responsible and im not anti jew im just anti satanists who happened to choose judaism and then zionism as their #1 though they are obvs in all. also he explains during passover they knead the matzah in childrens blood which is said in a joke....</p>

<p>i still cant figure out how to put pictures on here im computarded but i screenshotted her next part bc its her holding up a toy pharoah and talking about them and the jews but egypt and pharoahs are more occult even if it could be a logical progression its something.</p>
<p>i dont care to watch another 40 minutes of this harry styles is singing now and im sick of it</p>
<p>okay 12 mins later at 41:50 or so news reporter acted by <strong>michael che</strong> says to jewess being interviewed &quot;is passover fun for you?&quot; she replies &quot;during passover we eat several foods that symbolize the passover story. we eat matzah because it reminds us that the jews didnt have time for their bread to rise when they were escaping egypt. it actually tastes okay, but its no <em>papa john\'s pizza!</em>&quot;</p>
<p>42:55 the jewess says &quot;the bitter herbs remind us of the bitter lives jews lived before they escaped. the bitter herb at my family\'s table is usually romain lettuce... but its no <em>papa johns pizza!</em>&quot; 
<strong>michael che</strong> responds &quot;wow youre really  giving papa john\'s pizza some free press. is that your favorite pizza place, papa john\'s?&quot; she doesnt reply and starts talking about the roasted egg. </p>
<p>i just realized its not a jew lady its a female playing a young like teenage jewish boy...............</p>
<p>44:18 she continues talking thanking people and complaining about having to go away to camp in the poconos. she finishes by thanking one of her grandparents for always making the best matzah ball soup, but its not <em>papa john\'s pizza!</em> </p>
<p>the actress is supposed to be bar mitzvah boy jacob....</p>

<p>side note, unrelated: i tried to screenshot yesterday is a videogame ive played for a year called league of legends. since ive been aware of satanism and occultism etc since before i played the game ive noticed from the start they do have some satanic or occult imagery.
in the background of the loading screen is the pedo swirl like <a href="https://jaysanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/true-detective-murder-620x457.jpg">https://jaysanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/true-detective-murder-620x457.jpg</a> just without the outer line on the right hand side. when i pasted into paint the loading screen is just blackk i tried multiple times idk. the company riot games makes 1.4 billion a year so not surprising they are in on satanism and whatnot</p>

            <strong>
             by association
            </strong>
            . Using pizzagate-related buzzwords, topics,

             on purpose
            </strong>
            . In TV shows, talk shows, standup comedy, movies, and in music and art. Hollywood can joke about practically anything (even
            <strong>
             pedophilia
            </strong>
            ), if they pass it off
            <strong>
             as comedy
            </strong>
            - while portraying all scrutiny and criticism as "tinfoil hat; humorless; right wing hate speech"... you name it.
           </p>
           <p>
            By doing this, they forward a process of making the general, entertainment/celebrity-loving population immediately
            <strong>
             associate serious issues

            <strong>
             RIDICULE IS A POWERFUL WEAPON
            </strong>
            . Politics-based ridicule is 99% of SNL-style comedy. I don't know when that became their "thing," but I noticed it after GWB was elected, and even throughout eight years of their beloved BHO, they were still at it. HRC's loss was a devastating surprise, an embarrassment to the Hollywood and big media elite, and they not only want revenge, they are desperate/dying to stay somehow relevant.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thanks to independent media, pizzagate is getting A LOT of serious attention. Since that's unstoppable, celebrities have no choice, but to make it into dark, ridicule-based "comedy," to belittle and dismiss ALL accusations and opposition towards their political heroes.

            I can't find the times, but Dana Carvey said some red flag stuff on Marc Maron's show. He said his dad was very abusive, and his dad and mom tried extorting money from him, which sounds like a satanist method. He also said he lived with Paula Poundstone, who had some child abuse accusations against her later. He said he played "ping pong" with Robin Williams. Only time he stuttered was when he said that. And lastly he said Lorne Michaels invited Dana to live at his beach house the summer before his first season, which had never been offered to any other cast member. And one more thing, Dana settled down in Mill Valley / Marin County which is said to be one of the child trafficking hubs of the west coast. (Napa, Sacramento, Beverly Hills, Portland, and Seattle being the others.)
           </p>
           <p>
            It might amount to a hill of beans, but that ping pong comment really makes me thing he and Lorne and other snl people have pizza dust on their shoes.

            and just to remind me that its a big club and we arent part of it ..... i stumbled across louie ck on stephen colbert calling trump a lying sack of shit.... colbert was just loving it . it makes me wonder if louie isnt part of the same elite pedo ring. some of his material on stage concerning his daughters sounds to me like children acting out that have been sexually abused. on the my kid is an asshole video at 4.11 he describes behaviours that i as a parent to two girls know is not normal behaviour. so i question everything about him now and the worst part is he is a brilliant comedian.

             My ex has a son with Louis CK's sister, Gen. Described the family as incredibly fucked up; the mother a horrid bitch that offered the sister no comfort when in labor; that it was the most unfamily-like family he ever interacted with. My ex didn't mention them often, but when he did, it was always with a measure of "well, no wonder she was fucked up, she came from
             <em>
              that
             </em>
             family."
            </p>
            <p>
             So, yeah. There could be some fucked up shit going on; CK's family (especially his mom) is fucked up and negligent. No empathy or consideration for others. Also important to note he was born in DC and grew up in Boston (after living in Mexico)

              i just watched his latest series ' horace and pete ' and its good. he is a great writer and he is a dedicated comedian. some of his material about his daughters just has red flags for me. and now his recent appearances on snl and stephen colbert makes me think he may have joined the illuminati. the first story is the one that tipped me off that all may not be okay in louie land behind the scenes.

                i think he was probably approached by the illuminati as he worked his way up the money ladder but i like his work very much except for the really graphic stand up. makes me uncomfortable.

            Sounds to me like they read Voit and are mocking the information found here and everywhere to make it seem fanatical.
That's ok...you know you have their attention.
I am proud of the hard work people are doing to bring the truth to light.
I wish I could help but alas I am pretty helpless on computers!
I do try and get the word out though!

             You bet. They're seeing and reading serious pizzagate support on voat, YouTube, and every social media site out there. They have nothing but mocking and ridicule to offer as pushback, and they HAVE to push back. Comedy is the safest, and most defensible, way of protecting their own. Great comment, all the way around.

              I never thought of that...that comedy and mocking is the safest way to hit back.
Because I bet there is a ton of evil anger behind those jokes.
And if they could...what would they really like to do?

            i wanted to watch snl because louie ck was on .... but it is just so loaded with political propaganda... and louie ck's comedy is loaded with references to children.... it was on snl that he compared raping a child to eating a snickers .... so good that you would just keep going back for more .... that got him into trouble. snl is so anti trump i find it difficult to watch these days. they've actually had hillary on as a guest to show their support for her. lorne michaels has to be at the heart of it all its his show. on the louie ck show recently they were taking the piss out of pizzagate by mocking people that share stories on social media. it made me feel uncomfortable. i dont watch it anymore unless theres a guest i really want to see because clearly snl has an agenda.

             I used to watch Louis CK and thought he was hilarious. I watched his 2017 special and I cringed through the whole thing knowing the agenda behind all of it. Sickening.

             I once thought, "Louis CK can be a tolerable, and even decent, actor," despite his leftist attitude. Then I watched his stand-up. 99.9% dependent on his audience's appreciation of depravity and filth.

             I can't watch it even if there's a guess I like. And i didn't even vote for Trump, but it's just too much. Gives me the gag response to even think about how they shill for Hillary and the establishment.

             they are pure propaganda. always have been. very subtle through comedy but its there. comedy is a great way to spew propaganda at the masses because they don't see the underlying message and/or think its just funny while it completely flys over their heads. its sad.
