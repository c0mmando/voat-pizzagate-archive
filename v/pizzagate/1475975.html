<p>If I were going to pay a bunch of people bribe money, I think I\'d do it by buying artwork from them. After all, who\'s to say what a piece of art is worth? </p>
<p>Legally speaking, my biggest worry would be the IRS. Al Capone didn\'t go to prison for any of his mob-related activities, after all, he went to prison for failing to pay his taxes. The IRS always gets its money. I\'d be sure that whomever I was bribing reported and paid taxes on that bribe money. I don\'t need hundreds of loose ends out there, any one of which could take me down. </p>
<p>So the person I\'m paying off bought a piece of artwork, it appreciated in value, and I bought it. Nothing illegal about that. </p>
<p>Of course, people would have to know me as an art lover for this to be believable. When they came to my house I\'d want them to see and remember seeing my art collection. I\'d go for some real in-your-face type stuff, something people wouldn\'t soon forget. That way, word would get around, especially in my tight knit town, and the IRS wouldn\'t bother investigating a perhaps suspicious looking transaction. &quot;Oh yeah, he buys and sells a lot of art. Was at a party at his place once. Dude\'s into some crazy-ass stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>The crazy ass art could even become a running joke amongst my friends. They could naturally start joking around and, say, taping a kids hands to a table, just for a laugh, because it resembled the over-the-top artwork I collected. </p>
<h1>Pizza</h1>
<p>Ingredients: Flour, yeast, tomatoes, cheese--that\'s it. All super cheap, all bought in bulk, and all so hard to track. The bulk of the cost is in the cheese, but with double &amp; triple cheese pizzas, deep-dish pizzas and whathaveyou, it\'d be impossible to look at the books &amp; determine just how many pizzas were. You couldn\'t even ballpark it. If a pizza joint says they sold 10,000 pizzas,  you can\'t prove they didn\'t. And the money\'s all taxed so Uncle Sam doesn\'t much care.</p>
<p>Ever heard of the Pizza Connection?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The trial centered on a Mafia-run enterprise that distributed vast quantities of heroin and cocaine in the United States, and then laundered the cash before sending it back to the suppliers in Sicily. The U.S. defendants utilized a number of independently owned pizza parlors as fronts for narcotics sales and collections – hence the name “Pizza Connection”. Evidence at the trial proved that the enterprise shipped no less than $1.6 billion of heroin to the U.S. between 1975 and April 1984. </p>

<p>Hillary\'s pop Hugh Rodham was affiliated with The Outfit, and the Podesta boys are from Chicago too. US Rep. Rostenkowski (D-Chicago), close Hugh Rodham associate, ended up in prison for his mob-related activities.  Bill Clinton was investigated for running a cocaine import operation in Arkansas.</p>
<p>Knowing how the pizza money laundering operation works could even lead to the term &quot;pizza&quot; becoming synonymous with &quot;bribe.&quot; Hey, where\'s my pizza? Are we getting the same pizza as last time? We talking big pizza or little pizza?</p>
<p>Didn\'t Obama pay $65,000 of taxpayer money to have &quot;pizza&quot; flown in from Chicago? </p>
<p>Doesn\'t Nancy Pelosi, whose father was all mobbed up, own a pizza joint? </p>
<p>The Chicago Outfit owned Bill Clinton, they may have owned Obama, and they certainly would have owned Hillary.</p>
<p>I don\'t think much (if any) of this is about kids. I think it\'s about money.</p>

            art is already a known method of laundering money.  As you implied, value is in the eye of the beholder so who could argue with what is paid.
