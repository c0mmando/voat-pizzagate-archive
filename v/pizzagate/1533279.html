            The child abduction rate for Virginia is seven times the National Average. We have crimes, but we haven't specifically connected them to our main suspects yet. We also tend to assume here that the children are killed and the bodies disposed after they have been used, so that would lead to a paucity of direct testimony. The very organizations that are supposed to protect children from abduction are compromised from at the top by people deeply connected to these child trafficking rings, so some testimonial evidence probably has been deliberately destroyed or discarded. Suffice to say, we are working upstream here. However, we greatly outnumber them; do not underestimate the power and wisdom of crowds.

            There are multiple explanations as to where the victims are. Mind control is a major part of this. Many have no clue what has happened. Victims have been imprisoned in lives where no one will listen even if they do try to speak out. The foster care system is another place. Countless kids are completely missing from there and no one will listen. Many are adopted out through Hillary Clinton's cash for kids program and birth parents have no clue where they went. In multiple survivor stories we hear about such things as bodies being reduced to a layer of sludge at the bottom of a tub. Very easy to dispose of the sludge. You've got to remember, satanisn is HUGE nowadays. And it always has been. Many of the victims are bred for sacrifice. Also, victims who are generations old in the occult and disappear in ways that no one says a thing. Not to mention the number of people on the missing and endangered lists that are simply never found.

            it is my belief that once they had a few close calls with franklin etc...they did what the mafia would do ...leave no witnesses

           <p>
            same reason why they use a pizza shop as a front

            another theory is that they have perfected Monarch programming, MKUltra to the point where victims dont even know they are victims

             describes very deep, complex programming that almost guarantees that a Monarch victim will go crazy before they tell what happened to them, or that they will later retract their statements if they do.

             </a>
             describes programming which makes victims believe they have been on spacecraft, so they would seem crazy and discredit themselves if they ever talked to authorities. The "shapeshifting reptilian" idea may have been something planted in the minds of Monarch victims to discredit them. If pizzagate is a manifestation of a continuation of Monarch, then they have probably developed their techniques even further.

            This is a very important question, and one which is a major obstacle to the credibility of pizzagate in the mainstream. Many rational and open minded people simply will not be convinced without victim testimony. At the moment we can only speculate as to what has become of the victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            One difference between pizzagate and the Franklin Scandal is that, at least from what we can tell, the children involved in pizzagate seem to be very young, sometimes even babies. This has been in part confirmed by the revelations from operation Dark Room in Norway. Children abused at a younger age are more likely to experience amnesia related to the abuse. A baby who is abused might be far less likely to speak in a credible way about their abuse later on, if they do remember it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another idea is that the pedophiles have learnt from their mistakes in previous scandals and have decided to make sure all the victims are eventually killed. The Caradori lead list linked to above mentions numerous possible victums of "Satanic Cult Abuse". It is not impossible that many victims are sacrificed in rituals. We have seen numerous potential references to murder and human sacrifice in the pizzagate evidence.

             No kids survive unless they are family members then they are treated like royal offspring and they grow up to be the next generation. All other kids are eventually killed and their organs are sold to hospitals that do organ transplants. Their blood is saved for transfusions and we know the wealthy old super-elite believe young blood can be their fountain of youth.

             I see Cathy Obrien and others that a lot of people on this board try to discredit as victim testimony. There is victim testimony we have access too and it isn't pretty so many reject it.

            <p>
             Actually the speculation begins with the speculation that there are victims.
Contrast pizzagate with the Madeline McCann  case.  A missing child generates an enormous amount of attention and scrutiny.  Pizzagate has alleged, what dozens of victims or more?  Centered in a fairly small  Washington, DC neighborhood?  Alleging not only abuse, but claims that they have been killed, hell the other day people were speculating the bodies were used to make soap.
            </p>
            <p>
             Dozens of kids missing, but no one is complaining about missing children?   Think of how many people would know about the existence of children:  Family, friends, neighbors, nurses and doctors, schoolteachers, etc.  If those kids suddenly disappeared, nobody asks questions?
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes, this is a very major obstacle.

              <strong>
               <em>
                would
               </em>
              </strong>
              complain of missing children if they weren't told their entire family would die. This is a popular tactic out there. How do you think suicide bombers (the real ones and not the hoaxes) go through with it? Simple. Children. Like this: let's say CIA front ISIS wants to bomb place X. A child is kidnapped around place X. The parents are found and a ransom is issued. In order to save their child, someone has to go and blow themselves up. Simple. I agree this is a huge hurdle, but there are some simple explanations for some of your argument.

               It's a very large hurdle and you just made up an example to clear it.  We know a lot about ISIS and that is not how the operate.
Kudos for the CIA front, though.

            Search for "boy prostitutes" and other variances of the words and a man named Norman and you'll find a ton of other names and a series of reports from 1977-1984 on what law enforcement from all over the US was dealing with, especially with the nation wide ring based in Chicago.
