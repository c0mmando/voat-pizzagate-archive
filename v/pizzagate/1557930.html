            Ironically R. Kelly use this as one of his defences as well. His other defence was that the tape showed evidence of being copied so it probably could have been edited. He got off on technicalities. I think they said his face was in the video too. He used the defence his enemies could have hired a lookalike. There was resonate doubt. All charges were dismissed. We all know Kelly is really guilty though. He got off because he's famous and has money.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I would be worried about is them destroying evidence or altering it to make it look edited so that it can't be proved it's them if they are in the videos and using the same defence

            Yeah, I watched some show about a case where that happened.. Luckily, they caught the bitch and the guy's future was spared. Did it to try and steal full custody. Really psycho shit.

            I posted this the other day but it got deleted because it broke the rules:

           <p>
            Sadly it looks like that's indeed their game plan.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quote:
PissGate might be a false flag/psyop to lay the ground work to discredit pizzagate as fake news!
           </p>
           <p>
            What if this was all on purpose and done intentionally so they can point to "FAKE NEWS!!!" as a way to discredit the PizzaGate investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            They let BuzzFeed die, sacrifice a few "journalists" and suddenly they can say "fake news is real and anyone can be duped, even us. That's why we should ignore PizzaGate."
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone's saying "it's so obvious it's fake, anyone would see that if they read it" so maybe they read it, knew it was fake but published it anyway. Why? So they can say "ahh shucks, that fake news, it sure did fool us! TOLD YOU WE HAVE TO CLAMP DOWN ON THAT!" then suddenly instead of just stooges coming after us, there's the whole media machine coming after us.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not saying the 4chan guy was in on it or anything like that. I'm saying they saw an opportunity to muddy the waters and have taken it. These people are desperate. Toppling a media organisation like BuzzFeed, the CIA taking a credibility hit and a couple of nobody journalists being hung out to dry is a small price to pay compared to their nasty secrets being revealed.
           </p>
           <p>
            This terrifies me because the whole thing makes way more sense when you look at it from this perspective as opposed to "fake document got sent to a journo, who passed it onto a politician, who passed it on to CIA, which then was leaked by BuzzFeed". I hope I'm wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            So if this is the case, how do we combat this? Well the thing about trying to peddle a lie is you have to keep fighting to prevent it from unravelling. The biggest thing the PizzaGate investigation has to protect itself is that there's archived, official and verifiable documents from before the fake news narrative was even being pushed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps we can turn it on them and show them "This is what fake news looks like. This is what real news looks like ..... " and meme it and red pill more people?

            Yes! I had been hearing his name for weeks here and was getting brief synopses of the videos but hadn't taken the time yet to go through them myself, with the exception of the day 59 or 60 recap to get a handle on all the info that he had found before the prior videos were "lost". I found him on Twitter earlier this week and was surprised that he doesn't have a lot of follower activity. He's clearly the most well versed and detailed of any other person I've read or watched. Impressive.

            Didn't they say something about if porn was found on government computers it was planted there. I believe they said it around the time they started pushing the fake news narrative.

            I just cannot wait for the day these sick fucks go down, it's going to be a joyous occasion worth celebrating. They have spent decades evolving their complex operations with the public so obvlivious, and the thing that gets them caught is a poofta playing silly buggers on instagram. LOL

            I think at this point the FBI knows too much, their only remaining savior will be to get rid of Trump, which is what they're attempting with the Russian accusations, but once Trump takes office, they're all going to start outing each other and stabbing each other in the back for lessened sentences and immunities. If Trump takes office, they're done.

            Trump will have to get rid of the rioters and terrorists in our country before the military style tribunals to punish all the traitors and child rapers. So maybe three months after his inauguration.

            I've been seeing this in related articles for the past month. This was the first one I remember reading:

            No telling how much the FBI got in their stash last year to carry out such a plot -
            <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/01/21/fbi-ran-website-sharing-thousands-child-porn-images/79108346/">

            possible russia could do that, but i know for a fact with Snowden leak that NSA can get into peoples computers without rainsing any alert from antivirus, my guess is microsoft give them a backdoor. Thinking of it, did someone figure out why Bill Gates donate 25$ millions to CF?

             More likely that the NSA exploited holes in Windows they didn't tell Microsoft about.

            <p>
             Not to say Microsoft couldn't have possibly helped, but the NSA are known to seek out and exploit unknown security holes for themselves. Example:

            Considering we are dealing with Trump who likes to get shit done and understands the exact reasons he's REALLY being attacked? Not long. For some reason his appointment of Robert Kennedy to head up a vaccine safety program was a big sign to me personally that he is well aware of the evil that has been going on against our children on multiple fronts and he will be doing something about it. I may not like RFK jr's opinions about other things but I know he's a strong advocate for this particular issue and that is how you do bipartisan.

            It's not funny they will use any little excuse to try to get away with it. The same way they have gotten away with it in the past . I hope people who know how to make memes can start to lay the groundwork now to prevent them using CGI as an excuse. I would hate to see this whole issue get swept under thE guise of Russian hacking and cgi. The public need to remain outraged and vigilant that these sickos do not get away with ybis smoke and mirror parlor tricks!

             I don't think the video and images they pass around is of them with the kids.  I mean if you really think about it, would podesta want video of Hillary with a child or would alefantis watch video of bill with a child?  Gross.  I hated typing that.  But I'm thinking they keep their bribery videos on VHS tapes, and the stuff on their computers is only children and maybe older children with younger children.  So sad and sick.  And possibly beastiality.  One of the victims says she was forced by her "Nan" and rich men in the "big house" to be with animals :(

            Wasn't there some article (I'm sketchy on the details) about the 1000's of people within the government to do with child porn that the documents were wiped or something? I remember something like that. I don't know.

            This is absolutely laughable stuff, between this and the fake news attack on trump they are starting to look ridiculous everything they do screams guilt.  Come to think of it im starting to feel glad they pushed the fake news angle its given us a catchy term to call bullshit on them for these shenanigans

            Wow, Drudge headlines say Trump did a sting on intel. This is getting really weird. I hope he's got some intelligence and military muscle behind him, though he does, the question is how much.

            I called this! I wish I would have posted about it somewhere, but I've been saying this for a while. I saw an article talking about "kompromat" as an old KGB tactic a while back, and this British Soviet dissident whose trial had been put on hold until January 19th. I can't explain myself coherently on how I knew lol, which is why I didn't post about it, but I totally saw this coming from a mile away.

            The fact that they are going to so much trouble to lay the ground work means there must be something huge coming down the pipeline. 2016 was insanely entertaining but it's beginning to look like 2017 might just trump it in more ways than one.

            That whole «blame it on Russia» for whatever is just sooo telling on how these people are in their minds.. Just like kids caught in the act..  «It's not me, Mom! It's her! Look! » (While swiftly hiding damning proof) ... The game is over.

            This is a "tea leaf" that #pizzagate is about to crack wide open 23 Jan.  Senior leadership within the IC knows what is about to go down.  Everyone has divided into their camps. This will become a fight for survival. Brennan is a Muslim.  Clapper is compromised.  The jury is still out on Comey.  State will buddy up with Langley.  NSA/DoD/Trump /FBI (elements of) are on the other side. McCabe spilled the beans and is under protection.

              January 9th 2017 - GOP Congress will continue to pursue Clinton email investigation
             </p>
             <p>
              "The Utah Republican said that there were multiple questions for the committee to look into surrounding the Clinton email case -- beyond Clinton herself.
             </p>
             <p>
              “There are a lot of other characters that were involved in this, we have to look at the FBI itself,” Chaffetz said. As an example, Chaffetz pointed to senior FBI official Andrew McCabe who helped oversee the FBI investigation into Clinton’s use of a private server. McCabe’s wife- Dr. Jill McCabe who lost a race for a Virginia Congressional seat was given nearly $500,000 by a political action committee controlled by Clinton ally Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe.
             </p>
             <p>
              Describing himself as “very intrigued” and “very concerned” about McCabe’s role in overseeing the Clinton case, Chaffetz promised to pursue the issue “full throttle.”"

              Andrew McCabe.  Deputy Director of the FBI.  Shortly before the election, his wife received a campaign contribution of 650k from Terry McAuliffe, Governor of VA.  Sorry - I had to go to sleep and couldn't reply.

            If pizzagate wasn't a real threat to establishment figures, this propaganda move wouldn't have come about.
Silver lining:  The Establishment is already in panic/cover up mode, preparing for the worst.

               Scrubbing when #pizzagate was trending. Now that it's so large, they're just downplaying the act of pedophilia, and being a pedophile. They are basically trying to humanize those with pedophilia tendencies.

            They can try to blame Russia for CP found on government officials' computers, sure. But Russia can't be to blame for the friggin Podestas' cannibalistic and pedophilistic (I think I just created a new word here) art hanging in their houses and offices. Nor can they be responsible for CPP creepy AF art, Heavy Breathing affiliations and instagram pics, now can they?

             it was a story about 3 years ago - 5000 computers with CP in the pentagon. Were all 5000 users guilty? Maybe, or is a 'standard issue pentagon computer' replete with a secret cache in case anybody 'steps outta line'
CIA Brownstone written all over it

            The US intell agencies never even looked at the DNC servers. It was "investigated" by a third-party company. There has been little mention of this:

              I know Buzzfeed is not the most reliable source, but their story on this is interesting:
              <a href="http://www.blacklistednews.com/FBI_Never_Even_Investigated_the_DNC_Servers_They_Claim_Russia_Hacked/56175/0/38/38/Y/M.html">

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              I cannot find the name of the third-party company identified. They were paid for by the DNC, the same people who were hacked and had motives to cover up their mistakes...and the possible murder of Seth Rich,
              <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/parents-murdered-dnc-staffer-seth-rich-call-public-article-1.2882885">
               http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/parents-murdered-dnc-staffer-seth-rich-call-public-article-1.2882885
              </a>
              , the DNC insider who reportedly was disgruntled by the corruption and leaked the info, ending up murdered soon thereafter. You will not see the MSM pursue this line of questioning or logic of the FBI or DNC. The idea that they allege Russian hacking to benefit Trump, never having done an independent investigation, is laughable.

             They're going to try and claim Photoshop with what's potentially gigabytes upon gigabytes of photos and possibly even videographic evidence coupled with the existing documentation and all the deep level corruption at places like The Clinton Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             From a technical standpoint, you can try and fake one or even a few photos or whole image galleries. However even a short video becomes impossible to fake 100% because look at that's Assange video where we know it was faked because of the way his eyes and his clothing were folding and closing in weird ways. It became obvious after just a couple minutes once it was slowed down and freeze-framed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Couple this with the Jeffrey Epstein connections and the Dennis Hastert convictions along with the banned Conspiracy of Silence documentary that's been leaked to YouTube that you should all share via social media with friends, family, and whomever will listen, it'll be beyond any doubt that the evidence is real and these people are all very much involved in some type of worldwide satanic ritual abuse pedophile cult.

             There has to be. Remember it is how they keep people loyal in the inner circle. For that to happen, they must have video proof of that individual committing an act so heinous that the public will lock them up and throw away the key. Some hacker somewhere has to have these videos.

             You just made me gleefully chuckle. There will most likely be irrefutable video, to which this pathetic set-up will fall flat on its face, like everything they do. "Duurrr, Russia CGI-ed me into the video, DUURRRRR"

               Thats probably why they've been saying all the CGI stuff when trying to claim JA is dead or missing. So they can then use it when their faces are in the vids.

                'The vids'... If there are videos, the likelihood it encompasses even 1% of the perps is not good.
Have we yet had any evidence Assange is really out there? I mean, the interviews could easily be faked, and all the proof required that was easily suppliable was denied. The whole wiki JA thing was never resolved for me. I think the technocrats are doing their worst atm.

             This has been the most eye opening election season ever for the U.S. So many masks have fallen off. Whether it be the evil activities those in power are, and have been, involved in, or the realization of so many that those in "power" are dumb fucks. The games they have played against Trump have been the Webster's dictionary definition of Checkers to Chess. More like Chutes and Ladders to Chess. When I read Brock's media matters plea for "dirt" on Trump with an offer for a reward, it couldn't have been more clear how desperate they were to defeat him. When you see the absolute gnashing of teeth by certain Rep. you have to know they are scared shitless of their crimes coming to light. And I for one can't fucking wait.

              Agreed. This election has 100% red pilled me. I was inching close to that point this past year, but the week following the election was literally like lifting the veil over my eyes and seeing things for what they really are. Hell, I didn't even vote for Trump, but the escalating witch hunt against him has moved me over to his side. (No, I didn't vote for Hillary. I knew she was evil, I just didn't have all the info that I have now).  Now, the same people who called Hillary an awful candidate and didn't even like her but refused to vote for Trump are trying to martyr the bitch. Like she's some saint. Someone I know actually called her "The People's President". Whatever.

              It will be a glorious day when the worst of their evil fully comes to light and the normies have no choice but to wake up too.

               I bet in 4 years you'll be going to Trump rallies and sprinting to the voting booth.  The Donald on reddit has been fun to read throughout election, seeing people come there to make fun and then get red pilled. i really do believe there has been a spiritual awakening where good and evil is becoming very clear to people.
