            James did say Thursday that it was the men and women of LMPD pushing for an outside investigation.

            "I've been contacted by several police officers suggesting there may be a coverup taking place and that we should ask for an independent investigation," adding, "They want justice to be found against anyone that has injured a child."
           </p>
           <p>
            Peden said he, too, has had similar conversations with officers, "For me personally, there are some police officers telling us what rocks to turn over."

            "What I can tell you is there is not going to be any stone left unturned into this investigation of the Explorers Program ," he said. "...To me, it's all about transparency and accountability so I'm looking at all kinds of options here."
           </p>
           <p>
            Asked if he was aware of any cover-up, Fischer told a reporter that it was a "leading question" that he was "more professional to ask."

           <p>
            "It literally shocks the conscience of any reasonable person to know a 16-year-old child being raped by a police officer in a position of authority, and then when he confides in another officer, a supervisor in a position of authority, and he's abused by that officer too," Yates said in an interview. "That is appalling, that is sickening, that is disgusting."
           </p>
           <p>
            "There's been some bad, bad people in positions of authority and they have not been held accountable," Yates said. "They've been protected by other bad people."

            WOW.  This triggered an old, buried memory of when I was in junior high (late 1970s) and in the Explorers. (Different state altogether from this report.)  My best friend was constantly hanging out with her older sister's ex-BF (he was ~35), who was a married cop with small children and "in charge of" (can't recall his title) the Explorers.  When we were 14 he bought us alcohol.  I also remember he used to take her for rides in his black and white (against the rules).  She loved it because if she ever got into "trouble" (official trouble), she could always call good ole Ralph to get her out of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            (There's more that I won't divulge here.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe ALL of these "Explorer" programs -- around the country -- deserve more scrutiny.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's great that the FBI is investigating the LMPD.  But WHO is investigating the FBI?
