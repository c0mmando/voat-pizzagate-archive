            The Clintons have affiliations with more than one cult.  Here's one associated with the Hampstead case:

           <blockquote>

             Ching Hai, the self-styled "Supreme Master" of Zen whose disciples came up with massive contributions to President Clinton's legal defense fund, is no ordinary woman even if one discounts her claim she is the living reincarnation of Buddha and Jesus Christ.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Central to the children’s testimony was the involvement of their father, actor Ricky Dearman, who has known connections to the self-professed spiritual leader, the ‘Supreme Master’, Ching Hai. The children go on to assert that they worship the ‘Supreme Master’. Notably, the Satanic Bible also states that ‘Satan’s ministers will obey all commands of the ‘Supreme Master‘. Objectively speaking, these claims cannot be overlooked, particularly since – in true Satanic style – keeping up a charade of decency and respectability is vital to abusers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ricky Dearman is involved in the film industry as an actor and has affiliations with ‘Supreme Master Television’, a television station airing from 14 satellite platforms and reaching hundreds of millions of households around the world. The beneficiary and focal point of this self-created spiritual hierarchy, Ching Hai is worshipped by followers the world over. Actively involved with child orphanages and schools in third world countries, she also has elite connections, including well-documented links to the Clintons.

            Been watching this cult ever since I found out that Allison Mack of Smallville fame was in it. They apparently brand women with a strange symbol near their pubic area and force them into sexual slavery. They have to maintain a certain weight, run so many miles a day, and live on like 1000 calories or something. I don't think there's a lot of friendship involved but you know, I'm just an outsider. You used to be able to find Mack talking about the cult on YouTube, and also interviewing Raniere. And it was so gross. She sounded brainwashed FOR SURE. All gushy and rambling like he was the second coming of Christ. I hope they arrest all the perps, Mack included. She was high in the ranks.

             Lmao! I was waiting for this to hit major news outlets to verify. It's all true! Oh happy day! There's a video of her (mack) looking shocked as Raniere is arrested by Mexican authorities. You're next, idiota. 😂 But it's sad too because now Smallvile is ruined for me. Adieu, Chloe. Hello, sex trafficking villainness. 😑
