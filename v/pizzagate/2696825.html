<p>\'As the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) still investigates the alleged mass rape of girls at a childcare home in Bihar, the sexual abuse of 15 child monks at a school-cum-meditation centre run by a Buddhist monk has come to light. </p>
<p>The police have arrested the monk while the process is on for the medical examination of <strong>victim children aged between six and 13</strong>.</p>
<p>The institute in the eye of storms is <strong>Prajna Jyoti Buddhist Notice School and meditation Centre</strong> located at international pilgrim town <strong>Bodh Gaya</strong>, the holy land for Buddhists across the globe, in <strong>Bihar</strong>. </p>
<p>The institution was being run by <strong>Prajan Social Welfare Trust</strong>, a non-governmental organisation.</p>
<p>A total of 29 child monks were enrolled at the centre. All the victim monks hail from the eastern Indian states of Assam and Tripura.</p>
<p>The incident came to light on Wednesday after one of the victim monks managed to call up his parents in Assam and narrated his ordeal. Subsequently, some of the parents reached Bodh Gaya to take back their children and reported the matter to the local police.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The victim child monks told the police that the head monk Bhante Sanghpriya would call them in their bedrooms and would sexually abuse them regularly.</strong> According to them, the monks would also assault them badly if the child monks refused to oblige.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“We have registered the case and arrested the accused monk,” the local Gaya district superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra told the media on Thursday. The arrested monk who hails from Bangladesh is being interrogated.</p>
<p>He said the police had requested the civil surgeon to form a medical board for conducting examination of victims adding they had also informed the Child Welfare Committee which will prove psychological assistance to the victims. </p>
<p>All the victims have been rescued and lodged at the Assam Bhawan in Gaya town under police security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The children had complained about the monk to their respective guardians. Also, <strong>they informed us that they were thrashed, mistreated and sexually abused while staying in the school.</strong> We are investigating the matter now and will take relevant action,” another police official Rajkumar Shah said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This is the second time in quick succession that sex scandal has rocked the state. Last month, the police arrested about a dozen persons after alleged rape of 34 girls lodged at a child care home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur town.

            This brings to mind what Tesla said about those boys and the coach. Those boys were sent to the monks when they returned. Something wrong there too. Then we know about the Dali Lama. Every religion. All of them.

              Yes. Those boys. I kept telling my husband there was something weird with that story. He didn’t think so until I read him posts on here. The boys were sent to a group of monks for resting  after their ordeal. Parents considered it an honor. Give me a break. Some must know Thor stories about the monks.

              It's very interesting that Unsworth's attorney, L. Lin Wood, who says he's

                 It's very intriguing. From what I can see, though, charges were dropped against John Mark Kerr later on. Fact remains, though, that he was in Thailand where there is a large community of expatriates instructors with dubious backgrounds.and L. Lin Wood brought him out of the woodwork, so to speak, and now L. Lin Wood is defending an expatriate Brit in Thailand against accusations of pedophilia. Weird.

                 This is a fascinating article about the background of Kerr and the "Operation Twisted Traveler"

                   Pedophilia is widespread among US military officials and high-level diplomats going to Southeast Asia, claims investigative journalist Wayne Madsen. 
Three Americans have been deported to the U.S. from Cambodia after being caught in a major police sting operation against pedophiles.
The men are all alleged to have engaged in sex with children.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The three previously convicted sex offenders were the first to be charged under “Operation Twisted Traveler,” an initiative targeting problems in Cambodia, which authorities described as ground zero for the crimes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office, says Ronald Boyajian, Erik Peeters and Jack Sporich arrived in Los Angeles late on Monday escorted by US authorities after being arrested in February by Cambodian police, the AP reports.

                  <p>
                   The three suspects were named in separate criminal complaints filed in April and May related to child sexual exploitation. They are expected to appear in court on Tuesday.

                    “This is a huge problem with the U.S. diplomatic service. It’s known to the expat community in South East Asia. We even have cases of Congressional delegations going to Thailand and other South East Asian nations to partake of these child prostitutes. If the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok spent one tenth of its time on tracking down high level diplomat pedophiles, we might get somewhere in cracking this entire ring,”
                   </strong>
                   says RT contributor Wayne Madsen.

                Reading another article here about John Karr. Interesting what it says about the sleazy nature of expatriates in Thailand:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 It wasn't long after his stint in Honduras that he made his way to Thailand, entering and re-entering that country mainly on tourist visas. These visas prohibit paid work, but many foreigners flout the rule, and school administrators, eager for the cachet that comes with expatriate instructors, tend to turn a blind eye. Thailand is, however, a favored playground of globetrotting drifters. "You never really know who you're talking to in Bangkok," says an Australian teacher in St. Joseph's English immersion program who met Karr during his brief tenure there. "We've all got a past."
                </p>

                 All very interesting reading.  It seems to me that Wood the lawyer is tied in somehow to the deep state/military/diplomat pedo rings in Thailand.  The false arrest of Karr would have served the ring runners' need to get Karr out of hot water in Thailand and also temporarily take the heat off the Ramseys in Boulder, who may or may not have been part of the worldwide pedo operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Here's an account of Karr's entry into the Boulder investigation:

                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  "In April 2006, two months before her [Patsy's] death, the Ramseys flew from their home in Michigan back to Boulder where they met with district attorney Mary Keenan (now Lacy), who
                  <strong>
                   asked them if they had ever heard of a man named John Mark Karr. They Ramseys said they had not
                  </strong>
                  --neither the name nor the description of this man rang a bell. What did he have to do with the case?"
                 </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                 This does not match up with what lawyer Wood is reported to have said at the time of Karr's arrest:

                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  "Ramsey attorney L. Lin
                  <strong>

                   Wood would not say how the Ramseys knew Karr.

              Yeah well they are telling him to keep quiet for awhile. He is onto something. He has that High Perceptions that is needed to see beyond. By that I mean to not have such a clouded mind he won’t question things but just accept the norm.  I like Tesla’s thinking. And yes where is that lawsuit. The monks that took them in should be researched.
