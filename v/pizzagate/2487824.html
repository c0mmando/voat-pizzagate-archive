INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
This case concerns an order by the Southern District of New York (the
“district court”) that permitted the parties to file vast numbers of judicial records
under seal or redacted in their entirety as a matter of course and without any
judicial oversight. As a result, the public was denied access to the papers in
support of and opposition to Defendant’s motion for summary judgment and the
majority of the district court’s opinion denying that motion, among other
documents</p>
<p>ARGUMENT</p>
<p>I. Broad sealing without a judicial determination of compelling need
undermines the public’s First Amendment and common law rights of
access to judicial proceedings and records.</p>
<p>II. The Court should consider the function of records filed in connection
with discovery motions in determining whether they are judicial records
subject to the common law presumption of access.</p>
<p>III. The district court erred in treating Appellants’ motion to unseal as a
motion to modify a protective order.</p>
<p>IV The district court did not consider the public’s significant and
legitimate interest in access to the judicial records in this case.</p>
<p>V No compelling or countervailing interest overcomes the public’s First
Amendment or common law rights of access to the sealed records.

            President Donald Trump's new nominee for secretary of labor, Alexander Acosta, could face a grilling in the Senate over claims that — while he was the top federal prosecutor in Miami — he cut a sweetheart plea deal in 2008 with a billionaire investor accused of having sex with dozens of underage girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the U.S. attorney for Southern Florida, Acosta agreed not to file any federal charges against the wealthy financier, Jeffrey Epstein, if he pled guilty to state charges involving soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution.
           </p>
           <p>
            Epstein ultimately received an 18-month sentence in county jail and served about 13 months — treatment that provoked outrage from alleged victims in the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            We need to get to the bottom of this, once and for all, no matter what the outcome is.

             I think they had to cut him a sweetheart deal or he was taking down a lot of wealthy and influential people with him.  Don't forget that his lawyer, Alan Dershowitz (the douchiest of douchebag attorneys), managed to get blanket immunity for everyone in Epstein's little black book.  That little black book included Trump, Dershowitz himself, Bill Clinton and many, many more.  Not giving Acosta a pass necessarily, because I'm sure he is a swamp bottom feeder like the rest, but I doubt he had much control over letting Epstein get a slap on the wrist.  With the publicity, they had to have some kind of conviction to keep the public from getting outraged, but he got away with at least pimping out underage girls and more than likely also running a honey trap for the Mossad on his "lolita island".  But, we can't touch Israel in this country.  The Jews run the media and they circle the wagon when any Jew is accused of something.  I'm sure a lot of that comes from a place of fear (given the pogroms against Jews throughout history), but it ends up protecting an awful lot of guilty Jews just to keep the regular Jews "safe".  Covering up for the criminals though is going to backfire on them.  I would hate to see history repeat itself just because people would rather bury the truth than deal with it openly.  Just like the Vatican church.  They should have just dealt harshly with the first pedophile priests instead of covering it up and shuffling them around.

              I agree with just about everything you have said.  That little black book did have some of the juciest names in it.  The Jewish Mafia is indeed in control of Disneyland and others in Pedo Town.  We also have the Italian and Sicilian Mobs as well.  Our country is under siege.  The reason we have a problem speaking out against Jews is because we have some that have railed against all Jews in such a vile manner that people are afraid of being branded as racists if they agree.  It is the same now as with Immigrants not here legally.  Political Correctness Run Amok.  I think this was a plan of action and a smart one.  They have succeeded unless we start naming names, but carefully.  The Church has it's own agenda.  I feel that TPTB have wanted to have a Jesuit voted in as pope for decades.  They finally got their wish. Pedo and Gay Priests will now have more protection than ever before.  The pope just declared there is No Heaven and No Hell.
