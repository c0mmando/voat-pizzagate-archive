<blockquote>
<p>Seattle police and a privately hired spokesman for Mayor Ed Murray have both put out statements about an incident at Murray’s house last summer.Jeff Reading, the mayor’s spokesman, said in a statement Monday that the incident being referred to by the lawyers representing the man who is suing Murray was June 24, 2016. Reading said five guests were the house that night when two people, a man and a woman, knocked on the door asking to use the restroom and the phone....
“For safety and security purposes, the mayor and Michael (Murray\'s husband) do not allow strangers into their home. After being refused, the couple grew slightly pushy, and then were referred to several restaurants down the street where they could find a phone and a bathroom,” the statement said....
The statements came out after lawyers representing a man who is accusing Murray of rape nearly 30 years ago said they want more information from Murray’s former campaign manager and police about the incident....
More than two weeks ago Devonn Hekard filed suit against Murray in King County Superior Court. Heckard was 15, homeless and addicted to drugs when they started a sexual relationship, according to the complaint.
Heckard claimed Murray paid him anywhere from $10 to $20 for sex, the compliant said.
Murray has repeatedly denied having sex with either a prostitute or a minor. In an interview with KOMO last week he said that he doesn’t think he knows Heckard, but admits he might have met him as some point in the 1980s.</p>

            there is a question about who showed up at his door, earlier reports said it was a shirtless man looking to retrieve his shirt and wallet from murrays home ..the fact that he called the chief of police and not 911 makes it all seem more then a bit odd ..even a common police report can be difficult to obtain in seattle all they need to say is its still under investigation to keep anything a secret ..that may be why the lawyer is officially asking for it

            He might have met him in the 80's?  Confessing to that just in case proof is found and he can come up with a story, imo.  This guy is a serious Sleaze Ball, Scumbag,  Lying Sack -  You take your pick.
