            my mousewheel is burning &lt;_&lt; but thx for providing the entire source like this, too, in case the subreddit gets deleted one day :)

            We have to understand how their pedophile system works in order to take it down I think. And given thefact theyre into children we can assume two points:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             <p>
              they need a steady supply of young children or even babies (orphant houses? kidnapping? own children? rape older kidnapped children?)
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              they have to get rid of children once they get too old (slavery? kill them? new members?)
             </p>
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p>
            I'd guess they have a couple of orphant houses controlled by their "friends" that help them get new children from time to time (probably "moving" them from one orphant house to another, "losing" them on the way or something like that?
           </p>
           <p>
            Does anyone feel like putting some work into this?
