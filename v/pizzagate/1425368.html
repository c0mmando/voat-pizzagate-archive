<p>So we can say that the leaked emails have already had a significant real-world effect. Donald Trump is now president elect instead of Hillary Clinton. </p>
<p>but WHY did Hillary Clinton &quot;lose&quot; is an election that was supposed to be rigged in her favor?</p>
<p>its because if Hillary Clinton had won, the email scandal would continue to snowball and create problems for the Clinton administration, but more importantly it would create problems for exposing the mechanism of control of our politicians by international influences. </p>
<p>We have all heard of Jeffrey Epstein and his private jet the &quot;Lolita Express&quot; which ferried people like Bill Clinton to &quot;Rape Island&quot; where underage girls were kept as sex slaves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Lolita+Express">https://www.google.com/search?q=Lolita+Express</a></p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein is an Israeli, allegedly a Mossad asset. Epstein had recorded people like Bill Clinton having sex with minors for the purpose of compromising and blackmailing our politicians.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Jeffrey+Epstein+Mossad">https://www.google.com/search?q=Jeffrey+Epstein+Mossad</a></p>
<p>This compromise and blackmail is the mechanism of control. it was more important to hide the mechanism of control than to install Hillary Clinton </p>
<p>Supposedly Barack Obama had summoned Justice Antonin Scalia to the White House for the purpose of giving him an envelope full of evidence implicating Scalia in a huge pedophile ring. Days later Scalia was found dead with a pillow over his head, at an uber-private ranch that allegedly functions as a pedophile bordello

<p>Justice John Roberts was supposed to rule against Obama Care, but inexplicably changed his vote. it has been speculated that Roberts was blackmailed into changing his ruling, but the &quot;dirt&quot; never surfaced, presumably because Roberts complied with demands. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Justice+John+Roberts+ObamaCare+Blackmail">https://www.google.com/search?q=Justice+John+Roberts+ObamaCare+Blackmail</a></p>
<p>Now we have Pizza Gate coming out of the Pedesta emails... which further illustrates the fact that the mechanism of control is blackmail of pedophiles. </p>
<p>If it seems that Washington DC has an unusual number of pedophiles concentrated in one area, its because it is the pedophiles who are most easily compromised and blackmailed. the establishment doesn\'t let anyone advance unless they are already compromised and able to be controlled by blackmail...</p>
<p>FBI to pedophile: &quot;do you know what they do to pedophiles in prison?&quot;</p>
<p>pedophile to FBI: &quot;oh noes, anything but prison!&quot;</p>
<p>FBI to pedo: &quot;you will become informant and report to agent XXX&quot;</p>
<p>pedo: &quot;yes sir!&quot;</p>
<p>blackmail is only an effective mechanism of control if the &quot;dirt&quot; is especially scandalous (like raping kids) and its not already widely known public knowledge. </p>
<p>so, those who do the blackmailing (Epstein, Mossad, FBI, CIA etc) have motive to obtain evidence to be leveraged as blackmail, but also to keep that evidence secret and unknown to the public.</p>
<p>this pedophile ring exists so that foreign influences (Israel via Mossad) can blackmail our politicians into going along with whatever Israel wants. Why do you supposed Washington just decided to give Israel a HUGE foreign and military aid package?</p>
<p>so, while the idea of our politicians raping kids is disgusting enough, the reason our politicians are able to rape kids and get away with it is because Isreal entices and entraps weak people like Bill Clinton into compromising positions, then blackmails him to control Clinton, and in turn Clinton controls the the little people, the common people. </p>
<p>its also interesting to note that the rape allegations against Donald Trump were dropped, and the woman who made the allegations supposedly admitted that she &quot;made it up&quot;, which is a rather elaborate story with very specific details, such as naming Jeffrey Epstein in the suit. How did this woman know so many details of this pedophile ring? was she given the story to tell, then later was told to retract it when attention on Epstein threatened to expose the mechanism of control?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Trump+Epstein+Lawsuit">https://www.google.com/search?q=Trump+Epstein+Lawsuit</a></p>
<p>i think it was the treatment of Donald Trump by the establishment that ultimately tipped my vote in Trump\'s favor. </p>
<p>the take away here is that this pedophile ring is much bigger than any one person, and much bigger than the sum of the parts. we need to understand how this pedophile ring works, and help explain it to others, so that it can be gradually and permanently dismantled.</p>',

            I was gonna say it looks like ((they)) have something on Trump, but maybe it's not as bad as the pedo stuff (maybe the rape of an adult?) so they were concerned it might not be strong enough to keep him in line.
I imagine they fear something like Trump going "yeah so what I raped the whore? Here's the 2 million dollar "rape experience" contract she signed"

            </p>
            <p>
             Think about how large the establishment movement was against him, you had every slimeball in washington, seattle and the west coast as well as journalists who are wrapped in this gunning for him.
            </p>
            <p>
             If they had something real on him a police raid and arrest qould have shut him down INSTANTLY

            this may explain peter thiel's involvement with the trump campaign. Thiel funded trump, cruz, and rubio. He funded the top three candidates. Why?
           </p>
           <p>
            The thing about thiel, is he is a pioneer in analytics. Palantir is the company behind prism, it is Theil's company. Palantir is from lord of the rings, they are the elvish seer stones that predict the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            Thiel would know who the pedos are, based on online analytics. His programs knew when women where pregnant before they knew.
           </p>
           <p>
            If a massive global pedo ring gets uncovered and destroyed, politicians get sent to jail, and global order is wrecked,  who would fill in the power vacuum? This would be one hell of an opening for a technocrat to fill in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lets not slack off, lets get back to work, and make a better future, so that we can snag the good seats during the power vacuum.
