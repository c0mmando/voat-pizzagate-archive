            Seaman's credibility has definitely come into question recently. The thing is, I never saw Seaman as a big researcher for the movement, I've been more inclined to see him as someone that pulls from the larger claims that we all know about. Seaman is more a personality that gets the basic facts out to the masses, and he's not someone that is working hard to uncover new leads. He's likely trying to make some money off this pizzagate wave, but he has also broadcast a lot of significant information to the public.

            At first I believed everything Shurter said, but then I noticed contradictions in his statements. Sometimes he would claim someone was involved with a certain scandal, and then months later he would retract his accusations, saying he was "just confused" when he spoke about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I first started to question him when he made a video saying that Paul Bonacci was a phony, to me this was a major red flag. Paul has been the most consistent and reliable whistleblower on the Franklyn Scandal, and Paul's accounts of the abuse check out: facts have been tested against his statements again and again. In fact, Bonacci was awarded 1 million dollars from his court suit again Laurence King. His statements of the events held up in court, and they settled for a massive amount of money. Paul is dangerous because he witnessed a lot of horrible crimes and he's coming out with the proof. David has also tried to discredit Noreen Gosh, (someone else just posted about this). Noreen has put her name and well being at risk for decades to reveal the truth. Her story is of course accurate and legit.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Shurter really did receive abuse from his family members. I think he really was forced to participate in satanic rituals. But I also think he's still in the process of healing, and that he's confused about some of the larger stories that may or may not relate to him. My advice is to take his personal accounts seriously, but stay skeptical regarding his opinions and claims of others' stories.
