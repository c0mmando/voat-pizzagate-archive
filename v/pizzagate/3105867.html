<p><strong>Subud and even Deeper Connections to Mind Control/Ritual Abuse Networks</strong></p>
<p>Just to give a bit of perspective, Clair Booth Luce, who Alex Constantine names as being connected to this “elite mind control fraternity,” was herself the longtime wife of Henry Luce, publisher of “Time”, “Life”, “Fortune”, and “Sports Illustrated”. So if researchers like Wayne Madsen and Alex Constantine are right, some of the elites at the very top of these mind control and child abuse operations, are people like the Luce’s, who just happen to own some of the biggest magazines in the country and obviously have an unbelievably powerful role in shaping public opinion. This starts to give you a sense of the elite levels from which these kind of mind control operations are possibly conceived, and then spread out through society. </p>
<p>Again, if researchers like Madsen and Constantine are correct, their research suggests that these mind control/child abuse-related operations are not haphazard operations, but are extremely hierarchical, carefully organized and directed from high levels. This immediately makes me think of <strong>Clinical Psychologist Dr. Corydon Hammond’s “The Greenbaum Speech.</strong>” (See my <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/greenbaum.html">previous post</a> on Voat about the “Greenbaum Speech” for the details, I do think it’s well worth reading). Dr. Corydon Hammond is a Clinical Psychologist at the University of Utah, and in 1992 he gave a speech about mind control and ritual abuse to a professional conference of therapists in Alexandria, VA. The speech he gave has become known as the “Greenbaum Speech.” (<a href="http://www.whale.to/b/greenbaum.html">link to speech</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FUersarZuo&amp;t=1s">Youtube audio recording of the speech</a>). Dr. Hammond has a long clinical background using hypnotherapy to treat patients with multiple personal disorder, or dissociative identity disorder (DID). His resume clearly shows he has a deep background in psychology and hypnosis, amongst many other credentials, he was the President of the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis, a major professional organization of therapists who use hypnosis to treat patients.</p>
<p>In his “Greenbaum” speech, Dr. Hammond describes how he treated a lot of patients with DID who claimed to be victims of ritual abuse. He also apparently knew an informal network of other therapists in other parts of the country, who were treating DID patients also claiming to be ritualistically abused. Based on his treatment of ritual abuse patients, and hearing from other therapists doing the same, <strong>Dr. Hammond describes in detail, how he apparently discovered evidence of a very widespread and insidious network of abuse perpetrators inflicting abuse on child victims in multiple parts of the US, and even internationally</strong>. He says that these abuse perpetrators were systematically using ritual abuse and mind control techniques, to deliberately traumatize their child victims and split their minds into multiple personalities, or “alters,” (split personalities are often referred to as “alters”). </p>
<p>Furthermore, as heinous as this is, Dr. Hammond says that based on his knowledge, this network of ritual abuse/mind control perpetrators was systematic enough in their abuse, that they would use trauma and mind control to instill the same kind of “alters” or multiple personalities, into different child victims, even child victims who didn’t know each other and lived in different parts of the country, or even the world. In the speech, he talks about working with multiple ritual abuse victims who (despite being different people), all claimed to have suffered the same kind of abuse, and all claimed to have the same basic kind of “alter” personalities instilled into them through this abuse. For some unknown reason, these “alter” personalities seen in different ritual abuse victims, were apparently all identified (for some unknown reason) by letters of the Greek alphabet (<strong>alpha, beta, delta, etc.</strong>)</p>
<p>The reason I bring all of this up, is because Dr. Corydon Hammond very specifically describes a ritual abuse/mind control network that is both insidiously spread out covertly throughout society, and yet also very hierarchal, with clearly defined leaderships at both national and even international levels. Constantine and Madsen describe the Subud cult, and the ritual abuse and mind control they allegedly perpetrate, as basically fitting into a larger network of CIA and Intelligence-sponsored mind control programs. Very much matching Dr. Hammond’s description of an alleged mind control/ritual abuse network, Constantine describes this CIA-sponsored network of mind control programs as being very insidiously spread out covertly throughout society. And also like Dr. Hammond, Constantine describes this network as being very hierarchical and ultimately controlled by some of the most powerful figures in the military, business, and media establishment.</p>
<p><strong>As eerie as it is to think, are all these folks essentially talking about one and the same thing? Does the Subud cult itself fit into this network of ritual abuse and mind control that Dr. Hammond describes in his “Greenbaum Speech?”</strong> I know these are unanswered questions, but definitely ones I think worth bringing up.</p>
