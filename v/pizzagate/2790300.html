            I thought I saw that his laptop had been imaged, and there was a copy of the image stored by the NYPD IT Dept? I read that somewhere but am not sure of its accuracy.

             This is inaccurate.  Read chapter 9 of the FBI IG report.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since the Clinton warrant involved a search for classified information, the NYPD would not have been given an image.  An FBI agent who was not working on the classified info warrant, but only the Weiner had to have his computer wiped and reset after classified info was found.

               We can know because Jeff Koons is a famous enough artist that his work is documented and if any one researched this photo at all, they will learn that it was part of a series he did with his wife who was born in 1951.  She was 39 or 40 at the time of the photo.  You could learn all this from his Wikipedia page which shows the people saying the opposite didn't bother to even check.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <p>
                Made in Heaven series
In 1989 the Whitney Museum and its guest curator Marvin Heiferman asked Koons to make an artwork about the media on a billboard for the show "Image World: Art and Media Culture". The billboard was meant as an advertisement for an unmade movie, entitled Made in Heaven.  Koons employed his then-wife Ilona Staller ("Cicciolina") as a model in the shoot that formed the basis of the resulting work for the Whitney, Made in Heaven (1990–91).

               Adult butts come in a lot of shapes and sizes.  This was the butt of a 5'6" 40 year old woman.
              </p>
              <p>
               And I just learned that the name she used as a performer, Cicciolina, means "a little chubby."  So a 40 year old woman who is a little chubby.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is what his wife looked like about two years after those photos.

                I have 7 kids and I've watched them grow into puberty, there's no doubt in my mind the girl in the photo is younger than my teenage boys by several years. My niece who is on the thin side has a much larger body than this photo. At 13, I had a body that was basically fully grown hip wise. That was a girl, not a 40 year old woman.
               </p>
               <p>
                There's literally no possibility of this being confirmation bias at least not in my case, I decided it was CP before anyone else mentioned they thought so.

                Do gay guys normally post heterosexual porn on their IG pages?

                This either confirms James Alefantis is bisexual or that he's a bisexual pedophile. But that 'wife' photo you sent me is the tranniest looking thing I've seen all week.

                 You are wrong.  She was definitely a grown woman. She was born in 1951 in Hungary.  She didn't even get to Italy until she was 21 or 22 years old.  She had a been a famous personality in Italy since 1973, she had a radio show, was in porn movies, she released albums and was an elected member of the Italian government all before she met Jeff Koons

                 It's a 100% a case of confirmation bias.  Because you decided it was CP when it was a 40 year old woman is you confirming your own biases.  Confirmation Bias doesn't not have to do with going along with the crowd.  It's about evaluating evidence in a way to confirm your own conclusions.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The evidence you evaluated is based a small group of people who are not this woman

                <p>
                 You experienced this photo and probably Jeff Koons himself in the context of pizzagate, a subject on which people hold very strong views, a context ripe for confirmation bias.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Outside the context of pizzagate, in reality this photo was created by Koons as part of a whole series he did with his wife.  it was just another photo in the series. you can see what she looks like in other photos from the series.  I would not have pinned her for 39/40 in these images, but that's what she was.  She never even met Koons until she was past 35.

                  <p>
                   We know who the model was.  She was famous in Italy for 15 years before she met Jeff Koons.  I posted a bunch of photos of what she looked from the time the photos were taken.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You mistaking a 39/40 year old woman for a underage girl is definitely confirmation bias.   One of the Jeff Koons photos which is explicit shows her full body and shows the size of her 39 year old hips.

            The word "core" is a bit of code word possibly. I think Alex Jones servers's used to be named "Core 1" and "Core 2" and so forth. They may still be named that but I don't know. I think maybe, but i'm not sure, that "Core" refers to "The Family" or the "Core Group" of elites that run this world like the "Council On Foreign Relations", The "Bilderberg Group", the "Trilateral Commission", the banking families, the cult, etc...

              Maybe you should abandon the Zionist lifestyle and start serving humanity. Right now your mind is neck deep in the swamp. You didn't save your country, Switzerland, and it got messed up really bad. You could leave our country alone and let us try to fix it. You obviously don't have the balls to do it. Q will not save you and if you think he will, you are mistaken.

            IIRC, it turned out in the end that the NYPD never actually had the laptop. It was a rumour spread by Eric Prince IIRC.

            The Feds got the laptop from Weiner's attorney, not from NYPD.

              How much fucking confirmation bias must you have for this?
             </p>
             <p>
              22/9 Daily mail carries a story with a whole bunch of sexting data from THE GIRLS phone
             </p>
             <p>
              Weiner panics, 23/9 gives his hardware to Granite
             </p>
             <p>
              The warrant is issued on 26/9 . It does say 'any law enforcement officer' - so I take that to mean it is possible the NYPD did the raid on Granite, not FBI
             </p>
             <p>
              BUT The NY Post and Washington Post put out stories on 30/9 saying FBI has the laptop, and there's Hillary emails on it
             </p>
             <p>
              thats a 4 day window in which they have to 1) execute the raid 2) take it back to the NYPD cop shop 3) get authority to check its contents 4) surrender it to the FBI 5) FBI assesses its contents 6) report on that to the Media
             </p>
             <p>
              i suppose its possible, just, but that's a very narrow time frame
             </p>
             <p>
              but I keep coming back to this: We have no public statement DIRECTLY from NYPD corroborating Eric Prince's claim, and Eric is one dodgy motherfucker. Every other person who repeated the 'insurance file' claim is downstream from Eric Prince, no independent verification
             </p>
             <p>
              Now, when the 'Steele Dossier' paid for by Hillary is the only sole piece of evidence of 'muh collusion' and Robert Mueller hasnt substantiated it from ANY OTHER INDEPENDENT source, I roll my eyes at those who still push the collusion narrative
             </p>
             <p>
              applying the same standard of evidence, I roll my eyes at the 'insurance file' claims because we similarly have no independent verification of Eric Prince's claims, and we have very solid evidence showing that the window of opportunity for the NYPD AT BEST was very, very, narrow
             </p>
             <p>
              NYPD SVU were looking into it because of what was disclosed to Daily Mail.
             </p>
             <p>
              and the Victim was in NORTH CAROLINA - this means the NYPD may have been compromising the case if they looked into it because of their Jurisdiction Limitation - so it would have been wiser for them to leave it to the Feds anyway
             </p>
             <p>
              Occams razor still tells us the greater likelihood that NYPD never had it

                We know for sure that the FBI got the laptop first.  This means the story put out by Eric Prince, TruePundit and others that the NYPD had the laptop and were ready to charge Clinton until the FBI came in and took the laptop and the case away from is bullshit.  Erik Prince and True Pundit were not even the first with this story.  The NYPD story was a hoax that was "seeded" around the internet.

                </p>
                <p>
                 A fake facebook profile had it in late October several days before True Pundit. Rolling Stone tracked down the woman behind that Facebook profile and she was a 60 year cat lady in Joplin Missouri claiming she had NYPD sources. That was the first reference on Facebook. A anti-semitic propaganda Twitter account tweeted her story that was the first reference on Twitter. Because I'm sure he was Facebook Friends with her. Then YourNewsWire picked it up and others picked it up. This video came out two days before the True Pundit article. It's got everything.

                  The files in the folder named “Life Insurance” contained emails that revealed bombshell evidence that Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin are running a pedophile sex ring. Out of the 650,000 emails on Anthony Weiner’s computer, 11,112 emails are specifically related to Huma.

                  There are three files that are in the folder labeled “Life Insurance” , one of which is called ‘DNC Nuclear Arsenal’. The second file is labeled ‘Intimate XXX’, which contains naked pictures of Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton, and a teenage girl having sex.

                 True Pundit was part of wide rollout of this story. True Pundit did their bit on the same day Doug Hagmann told the same story on Alex Jones. Doug Hagmann accidentally let the cat of the bag, claiming that Rudy Giulaini was behind most of this. Giuliani, of course, was a member of the Trump campaign. If this shit was real, Giuliani could have just said so himself instead of leaking it to the fringe media.

                On August 11, 2017, the company Emerdata Limited was incorporated in the U.K., and listed SCL Chairman Julian Wheatland as Director and 25–50% owner, and Cambridge Analytica Chief Data Officer, Alexander Tayler, was also listed as 25–50% owner. Both have since been removed as significant owners, but Wheatland is listed as an active Director, along with Alexander Nix, the Chief Executive of Cambridge Analytica.

              Noting Blackwater and BlackRock in the same thread, I google Larry Fink and Erick Prince, with the result:

               Please note that Erik Prince knowingly employs George Nader as a consultant, a convicted pedopile who went to jail for his crimes in Europe. Nader worked for Bill Clinton when the latter was POTUS. IIRC, also for the Bush administration before.
              </p>
              <p>
               Nice example of a pedo who got away with it because 'b.b..bbut we need a good Near East expert'. So everybody has been looking the other way, to this day, and doesn't give a shit that he's a convicted pedo.
              </p>
              <p>
               Btw., there is a nice photo of Bill Clinton in a swimming pool with Jeffrey Epstein, George Nader, and Tony Podesta out there on the internet.

                Does Prince employ Nader?  I think Nader was working for the UAE and Prince was doing a deal with Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Russia, but Nader was on the other side of that negotiation.
               </p>
               <p>
                Nader also had warm relationships with the Trump White House.  I don't think "worked for" applies either in his previous cases.  Worked with I think is more accurate.

              There was nothing on the laptop that showed other crimes about Clinton.  That story is dead as a doorknob.
             </p>
             <p>
              The FBI report has an entire chapter on Weiner's laptop and there's no mention of other crimes regarding Clinton whatsoever and no indication anyone from NYPD even saw the laptop.  Some people who were desperate and grasping at straws tried to keep this story alive based on a FBI official's notes.   But there's another more obvious way to read his notes.  There were two investigations regarding the laptop and two warrants needed sex crimes warrant for the weiner case and the warrant covering Clintons emails.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was so insignificant the FBI guy didn't rememeber writng the notes.  The desperate straw graspers overlook this.   Had the note been about evidence that would put Hillary Clinton away for life, he would have remembered the conversation.

                Judd was a member of the Commission on Global Governance. The Commission was established in 1992 with the full support of United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. It produced a report containing many controversial proposals ‘Our Global Neighbourhood’ in 1995. Sitting alongside Lord Judd in the Commission was Maurice Strong. Strong’s appointment as Secretary-General of the UN Conference on Environment and Development—best known as the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 had resulted in the UNs Agenda 21 programme being implemented by all states belonging to the UN system of Governance including the UK.

               According to Haiti Libre, former President Bill Clinton will be in Haiti for a 48-hour visit. During his stay, he will make among others, an announcement during his visit to the recycling company Sustainable Recycling Solutions (SRS Haiti).  Haiti Libre reports that Bill Clinton will tour the Sustainable Recycling Sustainable Recycling Solutions HaitiSolutions (SRS Haiti) plant on February 18 and see the recycling process. He will be accompanied by Andrew MacCalla and Brett Williams, the Co-Founders of SRS, and Mike Shinoda, the lead singer of Linkin Park and a major investor, will join the President. Bill Clinton will make an announcement during this visit.

               Linkin Park started an organization called Sustainable Recycling Solutions (SRS) in Haiti. Without applying for any grant* they were surprised to receive a $250,000 donation from the Clinton foundation.

               If that wasn’t exciting enough, Mike Shinoda of LinkinPark got a rare and unsolicited visit from none other than Bill Clinton himself. Here’s the Linkinpark video…

               Speaking In Miami, Bill Clinton Emphasizes Public-Private Partnerships For Hurricane Recovery
              </p>
              <p>
               The event, organized by the Clinton Global Initiative and hosted by the University of Miami, aimed in part to introduce people working on hurricane recovery projects to potential funders. Those projects are helping Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Antigua &amp; Barbuda and Dominica build back stronger after last year’s devastating hurricane season.
              </p>
              <p>
               "The challenges we are facing include not only things that happened directly as the result of the hurricane, but also reflect the aggravation of problems that existed before them," he said.
              </p>
              <p>
               Those pre-existing problems include aging power grids and communications systems, and a lack of affordable, sustainable energy sources, he said.    WHAT?
               <strong>
                sustainable
               </strong>
               There is that word again.
               <strong>
                sustainable
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               Gregory Milne, chief metrics and impact officer at the Clinton Foundation, said beyond dollars, corporations have expertise NGOs can use -- for instance, how to get a product from a warehouse to a consumer.
              </p>
              <p>
               "If they can partner with some of the amazing health organizations that are here, that are trying to get medications or vaccinations to those remote communities, that’s a win-win situation," he said.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bob Lord, chief digital officer for IBM, said the company just held a 5,000-person hackathon in Puerto Rico on using technology for disaster preparedness and recovery. The "Call for Code" program focuses on developing projects like facial recognition software to identify disaster victims, or systems to track blood donations and pharmaceutical drugs.
              </p>
              <p>
               WOW.  What a moneymaker for corporations.  Big Pharma Drugs,  Vaccinations especially (and fooling around with them) and last but not least
               <strong>
                sustainability
               </strong>
               and facial recognition to track their Ahem, Victims.
              </p>
              <p>
               Whenever is see THAT Word, I know it is not a good outlook for the country CGI and Friends are about to take over.
