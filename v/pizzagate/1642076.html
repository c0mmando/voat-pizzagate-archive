<p>So we\'ve got the Cardinal flipping out over the chairman of lgbtq becoming amabassador.  We\'ve got him resigning but not being reprimanded for his slurs??  Did he know something??</p>
<p>Also during this same time, We\'ve got an Archbishop from Poland living on the island, Josef Wesolowski.  He  was arrested for picking up poor young boys on the shores of the island and taking videos and pictures of them with his phone.  He was extradited to the Vatican for trial, but was soon found dead in his Vatican City residence by a friar.  Hmmmm??  Note: In June of 2015, the Vatican announced a trial coming.  The trial was to begin in July 2015.  He was found dead August 2015.</p>
<p>Also during Walley\'s &quot;ambassadorship&quot; to the island, there was ankther Polish Priest that ran off with 2 young boys to Poland and changed his name once he left the island.  He was arrested a few years later for pedophekia in Poland, his home nation. </p>
<p>So 2 polish priests.</p>
<p>Do we know if the rate of trafficking has increased since &quot;walley&quot; got there?</p>
<p>Link about the Cardinal\'s sermon (not Christian to call people derogatory names, but I\'m wondering if his anger at what maybe was really happening got the best of him?)</p>

           I've heard from locals that LGBTQ was pushed in the schools in pamphlets after James "Walley" Brewster, Jr. was appointed there.  The locals did not like him and would say he was trying to make the island queer.  I don't approve of their gay bashing, but maybe there's more to the story??

           The Cardinal called him derogatory names and later resigned atvthe customary age to resign -- not necessarily because of scandal.

            Yeh.  I figured but wouldn't be upvotef much.  I think everyone is getting tired of investigating and researching.  We've found SO much that it seems like we don't really need to find anymore.  Everyone is just waiting for arrests at this point.
           </p>
           <p>
            I kind of just stumbled onto this when a Dominican republican expressed his disgust on the school pamphlets last night.  I then asked 2 other locals and they agreed and told me how much of a fuss the island put up before "walley" got there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I started reading about the 2 Priests with Dominican Republic AND Polish ties and thought it may be something worth digging into
