           I've heard from locals that LGBTQ was pushed in the schools in pamphlets after James "Walley" Brewster, Jr. was appointed there.  The locals did not like him and would say he was trying to make the island queer.  I don't approve of their gay bashing, but maybe there's more to the story??

           The Cardinal called him derogatory names and later resigned atvthe customary age to resign -- not necessarily because of scandal.

          <p>
           So we've got the Cardinal flipping out over the chairman of lgbtq becoming amabassador.  We've got him resigning but not being reprimanded for his slurs??  Did he know something??

          <p>

            Yeh.  I figured but wouldn't be upvotef much.  I think everyone is getting tired of investigating and researching.  We've found SO much that it seems like we don't really need to find anymore.  Everyone is just waiting for arrests at this point.
           </p>
           <p>
            I kind of just stumbled onto this when a Dominican republican expressed his disgust on the school pamphlets last night.  I then asked 2 other locals and they agreed and told me how much of a fuss the island put up before "walley" got there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then I started reading about the 2 Priests with Dominican Republic AND Polish ties and thought it may be something worth digging into
