<p>I think, he/she is right on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Normally, when people start asserting “pedophiles run the government”…they are implying that we Minor Attracted People [MAPs] have some vast wealthy network, with politicians to do our bidding…and that “we” are going to use this method to legalize pedophilia…</p>
<p>…Which is really absurd, considering the track record of these government shysters…They universally sell MAPs [and sexually active children and teens] down the river…The last thing on their minds, is liberating the majority of MAPs…</p>
<p>That is hard fact…These people have been down right ruthless, towards the majority of MAPs…These sociopaths are not allies to MAPs…</p>
<p>…They are just self serving sociopaths, period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we need to realize that it is a class fight. It\'s the sociopathic elite against the majority of people. We shouldn\'t be too lucky about the arrests right now. Because it fits the system we fight against. It only hits the ones at the bottom of society, I guess.</p>',

            You are skirting on a MAJOR topic that is relevant and deserves thorough discussion, OP.  The "elites" are Jews of royal bloodlines.  You will NEVER see an "elite" go down for any crime UNLESS s/he has pissed off someone higher up in the pyramid.

            I think you're on topic from an interesting new pont of view. I might disagree, but that should not reduce the value of this. To share my two related cents:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             There are several networks of pedophiles having difference in size, area, social status, power. We're haven't really done much to connect these networks to each other, but instead we've focused on the networks including high profile business and political elite
            </li>
            <li>
             People calling themselves MAP's and taking distance from the "sociopathic elite" could be seen as clients of the industry, the enablers of it. They are ready to feed money into the system via buying child pornography or even children. They might have no interest in joining the battle of revealing any cover ups, as they actually benefit from the system
            </li>
            <li>
             However, some of those people could share some valuable psychological POV into the industry being more deeply involved into it. Those opinions could be valuable to investigate
            </li>
            <li>
             In overall, I see some of these MAP ppl as "bad consumers", either ignorant or stupid to realize how they are enabling the industry - The industry on which the elite creates money from. And this money is used to expand the networks, including the child rapes of the elite, production of child porn videos, selling of organs etc.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             they are implying that we Minor Attracted People [MAPs] have some vast wealthy network, with politicians to do our bidding…and that “we” are going to use this method to legalize pedophilia…
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is nonsense. The person who wrote this either doesn't see or doesn't want to see his/her influence to the industry.

            Thanks for the invitation, but all this isn't all that provocative, considering where we are. And the majority of we here, aren't as intellectually limited, as emotionally fragile, or as inherently careless as you presume. Try to give us a bit more credit.

             Well, than I invite you a second time. ;) Just take a look at the first comment.

              Would you agree then, that preemptive warnings
              <strong>
               might
              </strong>
              be more annoying than effective? :)

                I really don't know either. I'm way too easily annoyed here lately. Heh, I think I've slipped below that "majority" I was talking about. This doesn't seem very important anymore, sorry I brought it up. Carry on.

            Nah, while we're not denying the existence of class warfare, there's no way the maps or whatever you want to call them are just innocent victims in all this. There's a huge difference between thinking a 17 year old is good looking and wanting to have sex with prepubescent children. It's fucking sick to even type.
           </p>
           <p>
            We want to take down the sick fuck pedo elite who destroy lives by the hundreds and thousands each year by kidnapping, raping, torturing, and/or killing children of any age.
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally get frustrated when we see stories about high school teachers sleeping with older students because it takes focus away from the bigger issuescreen. A 12th grade science teacher isn't part of the pedo elite. Criminal? Yes. But not on the level of a Podesta, et al.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stop trying to normalize pedophilia.
