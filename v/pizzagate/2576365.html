<p>His summary of the video:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Streamed live 2 hours ago</p>
<p>Democratic U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley was mysteriously denied access to a detention center for immigrant children in Texas over the weekend. In a seperate interview, Merkely also said that he had seen &quot;kids in cages at a separate facility in McAllen, Texas.&quot; While, the Senator attempted tying what he witnessed to policies of the current administration, the original pictures matching his descriptions were actually from the Obama presidency in 2014; the pictures had recently resurfaced, been misdated, and shared by liberal groups online. A possible diversion picked up by the Senator to cover for harmful immigration policies of Obama.</p>
<p>Regarding what happened on Sunday at the second facility, according a report from Williamette Week, &quot;The detention center in Brownsville, Tex. is run by the nonprofit Southwest Key Program at a location called Casa Padre, which was a former Walmart turned detention center, according to Merkley.&quot;</p>
<p>La Raza, a George Soros funded immigration group, is among the SouthWest Key Program\'s affiliates.</p>
<p>Disturbingly, this news comes at the same time that investigators are looking into a newly uncovered possible child-trafficking bunker discovered in Tuscon Arizona, local police are claiming that they believe the site may be a homeless shelter, though this is being questioned by many online investigators who have found more evidence for trafficking than what authorities are acknowledging.</p>
<p>This is potentially relevant to the discovery by Senator Merkley, as the SouthWest Key Program has also operated in Tuscon before the recent scrutiny of their Texas, detention centre. &quot;In Tucson alone there are 200 openings for jobs to assist with the sheltering of illegal immigrant children. This organization is taking old nursing homes and other buildings and converting them to house thousands of children.&quot;</p>
<p>What is really going on at these child detention facilities along the Mexican border?</p>

            Around 2000 they opened one in an old K-Mart in Kankakee, Il. If I remember right they blackened the windows as well. Think it was a Juvenile detention center. I don't recall if it was state or county ran.

            So this sees light on the news, and no questions are asked. Why would a US Senator be denied access to the facility? Notice how police always protect the criminals? Nothing to see here, no cult. Nothing to see here, no abuse. Nothing to see here, no trafficking. This is why "Law enforcement" has changed their hiring policies. They control everything from the top. Since they cannot control every last officer, they control their bosses and change up their hiring practices. They no longer want organized well trained ex military personal. They want aggressive hot heads, those who obey and do not question authority, those who need the job and can do little elsewhere. Things always slip out briefly don't they? Then the lid goes back up over things, and after further review, nothing to see here. Did the Senator or did he not see children in cages? He described what he saw. This has been going on for ages no doubt, and the back and forth about what Potus was in office during these operation's is a red Herring. These are systematic agency operations by the agencies and elite.

            I think the boss's sent him to find their kids and now they are actually covering it so that is strange...but they think it's something that not only can they point fingers at Trump for but it's how they let others know what's going on...like this is why we can't get you that shipment of tortilla's you are waiting for guys.

            I just can't imagine the entire extent of their pedophile operation. There's only one, it's ALL connected, the sourcing, holding, selling, advertising. All those celebrities and everyone who is part of msm, many politicians, wealthy people who have massive influence. Presidents and government officials in the swamp, ALL CONNECTED. Hollywood TV shows made by people such as Dan Schneider

            Illegal alien families should be kept intact and deported, this does smell a little bit but more like pro illegal invasion propaganda, In fact this could be a cover story and these are trafficked kids being used by the"programs" and disappeared in sex death situations which the "congressperson" would love be a apart of.

            Excerpts from a 2014 article on the now-owners of the Wal-Mart building, government contractor Southwest Key Programs:
           </p>

           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             <strong>
              ACORN for Illegal Aliens – Meet the Southwest Key Programs
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Are you curious who has been facilitating the transport of illegal alien children throughout the country? Look no more… meet La Raza connected
             <strong>
              Southwest Key Programs.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             This business was founded in 1987 and was made-to-order for
             <strong>
              Obama’s manufactured chaos on the border.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Social Enterprises: Southwest Key Enterprises, Southwest Key Cafe del Sol, Southwest Key Maintenance, Southwest Key Green Energy &amp; Construction, Southwest Key Workforce Development, The Blooming Florist, Southwest Key Youth, Family, &amp; Transportation LLC
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              They are the underground railroad for the American invasion from the South.
             </strong>
             They are nationalistic in their connections and leadership. Heavily connected to the La Raza Roundtable, don’t be fooled by the charitable facade. This is a radical breeding ground. They are militant, Latino community organizers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Their real goal is the GLOBAL SOCIETY.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obama is also fundraising with a racist Mexican Director who actively promoted the murder of opponents of illegal immigration. Nifty, huh? But Obama couldn’t be bothered to actually go to the US/Mexican border. He would never sully himself with the masses. He has Communist minions for that, don’t ya know.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, while Southwest Key Programs claims to be ‘for the children,’ remember what is really going on here. The redistribution of wealth, the invasion and eradication of America’s borders and the destruction of our Republic. It’s community organizing from hell and is spurring a revolt. Remember, it’s not fascism when they do it. Southwest Key Programs is ACORN for illegal aliens and they are the handmaidens of Obama’s ‘transformation’ of America.

              Sure.  There was another thread where we were researching about a bunch of stores that were closed and there were children kept there.  It was quite a while back.  I think we even had a list of stores.   It might have been within another post.   Maybe someone will remember it.   Can't believe we are both still here, at this.

                I am looking into your link and also links posted in it as well.  There are comments about Walmart centers and a list of closed stores.  There is also something about a Google Barge

                This is just one situation.  Think about that.   Why In The World have we stopped researching Shipping Containers?

                  I think you are right.  Also Mitch McConnels Father in law died a while back and left him and his wife his Huge Chinese Shipping Biz.  It is really big and they were cited for drug running years ago.  She is Chinese and works in DC for the Govt. as well.

               Well, i'm not here much. I'll never be the same after digging into this issue. And not one child was saved from our efforts. Now we see kids locked away behind black windows, and nothing is done, no outcry from the public. God (is)Help(ing) Us

                Yes we need God's help.  I think we will never be the same.  Something is changed in me, I know that.  But we don't know whether no children where ever saved.  Do I think there were a lot of children saved?  No.  And it is about as disgusting as it gets.  Am I angry?  Yes.  But I will not stop and I assume many others on here won't either.  I think we have succeeded in Waking Up many many people.  The memes you see are from what they have seen on here.  The replies on Twitter are about what we talk about on here.  The Podesta Art the Spirit Cooking, they all came from here.  But the fact that there has not been a huge net cast over this country to scoop up a slew of pedophiles and tens of thousands of children saved That Is Truly Sad.

            Blacked out windows after converting Walmart into a detention center. A detention center for underaged children who's parents are gone, missing or in another country. Children being watched by Random Non Profit people who's CEO gets over $700,000 Salary.

           <p>
            I mean If I wanted to organize a child-sex-ring THIS is the perfect setup. Unaccounted children, government persimmon to hold them. No fear of parents looking for them.

              I want to get back to researching Shipping Containers.  We used to do that.  I have a suspicion that while we have gotten away from that, that they are gliding on waters and soaring through the air on freight planes with children, undetected.  These Walmart stores and centers should be a Red Flag.

            Southwest Key whistleblowers in 2015:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Former employees of Southwest Key see....a prison-like facility operated by an organization that views children as commodities and the employees as rent-a-cops, whose most important mission is keep their mouths shut
            </p>
            <p>
             ....staff must ignore the complaints of kids who are hungry, who are given nothing more than a quarter-sized dollop of soap with which to bath, or given someone else’s underwear to use because – after all – these kids should just be grateful that El Presidente (
             <a href="http://www.swkey.org/about/leadership/dr_juan_sanchez/">
              http://www.swkey.org/about/leadership/dr_juan_sanchez/
             </a>
             ) was kind enough to give them some place to land.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Employees are to remain quiet when they believe young children are being handed-off to anyone but loved ones.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              They are to remain quiet as suspected criminals are processed and released into the community under the guise of being minors in need of shelter.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             One whistleblower reported last week that the minors in the care of Southwest Key are allowed to call home once a week. During those calls to Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, the minor children often encourage siblings and other family members to arrive at the U.S. Mexico border and specifically request placement in a Southwest Key facility.
            </p>
            <p>
             No one knows how many children have died after being lured into travelling north.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              “They brain wash us,” said the former employee
             </strong>
             with a Master’s Degree in Social Work. They believe that Southwest Key management engages in a systematic beating down of an employee’s self-esteem
             <strong>
              so that eventually they become more manageable and resistant to questionable practices.
             </strong>
             ....That lack of confidence leads to fear, and fear leads to silence.
            </p>
            <p>
             At one point, according to three whistleblowers, the entire medical staff at the Southwest Key facility in Tucson left. Because of the secretive and distrusting nature created by management, most employees did not know the medical team had left for weeks
            </p>
            <p>
             Those employees who do not break down and continue to question what they see become targets....She asked, “Why did they force you to wash windows?”
             <strong>
              The targeted whistleblower responded, “I took care of the kids and I spoke up.”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              One whistleblower recounts how they had reported a minor, who claimed allegiance to the Mexican Mafia and bragged that he was going to be delivered to a drug family in Phoenix, they were reprimanded.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              They are sweeping it up – all under the rug. And the turnover ratio in the medical department alone is ridiculous – because they don’t have gloves,” stated one whistleblower.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             When the minors arrive at Southwest Key, as part of their orientation, they are shown
             <strong>
              a presentation that includes a tribute to El Presidente. Images of El Presidente feeding masses of children flash before their eyes as they are told that without his kindness they would not be here. In light of the recent influx of children, one has to wonder how many of the new arrivals are here thanks to those phone calls home full of El Presidente’s praise and promise.
             </strong>

            <p>
             Given our in-house medical staff, there has been little need for outside emergency healthcare services. This is also true for law enforcement as, for the most part, the children have no desire, reason or means to be off-site.

            1997 horrific report on a Southwest Key child detention facility, even without mention of child trafficking:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ....the problems in Arizona appear to exist with the deliberate and active cooperation of INS and Southwest Key officials.
            </p>
            <p>
             Representatives of the INS and the Southwest Key facility assured Human Rights Watch that all children were represented by attorneys, but they refused to give out the names of the attorneys. Interviews with the children, however, made it clear that many-if not most-of the children were unrepresented.
            </p>
            <p>
             One attorney told us that, on repeated occasions, telephone calls to clients were monitored by Southwest Key staff.
            </p>
            <p>
             INS policy requires that the children be taken on field trips at least once a week....During their period of detention at the Southwest Key facility (a period which....averaged two months), only three of the fifteen children with whom we spoke had ever been off the premises for a reason other than a court date.
            </p>
            <p>
             ....Southwest Key staff member, angry...."flipped" them from their beds by yanking one side of their mattresses up in the air....it is impossible not to conclude that the ongoing violations are deliberate, and that the INS is knowingly permitting these violations to occur.
            </p>
            <p>
             [SWK refused to provide the facility's written policy on access to courts and legal information]....
             <strong>
              This hostility appears to characterize Southwest Key's and the INS's relationship with outside groups generally.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Detained alien children are powerless and alone, and often no one but the INS is even aware of their presence in the United States. There are few mechanisms for effective monitoring of the INS, and as a result, the INS today remains free to violate children's rights with impunity.

            Caution added - look all you want, but I don't think the Walton family is involved.  This is a former Wal-Mart store.  Someone else could own the property and the building.  It could have been sold.  All it is, is a big former big box store.

             I'm pretty sure all Walmarts are actually owned by the defense dept, at tleast some agency in the government. The Waltons are owners in name only, as a cover, though it may have started out clean (i doubt it).

              As always, you are limited hangout. Walmart founder ran our WW2 internment camps. Not an accident. Corporations are in alliance with the Banking cartel, there is no government, it is a corporation. Start from scratch, you don't get it yet.

             Waltons are walking evil. Knowingly destroy American small business and give ZERO to charity while underpaying their employees.

               Still, while eschewing the pledge, the Waltons have steadily and gradually increased the amount they give through their primary philanthropy, the Walton Family Foundation. They’ve made some adjustments, streamlining the fund’s board and fine-tuning each of its three project areas: K-12 education, the environment, and economic-development projects in the family’s home state of Arkansas.
              </p>
              <p>
               As Sam and Helen Walton’s grandchildren seek to make their philanthropic mark, the foundation will spend $2.2 billion in those areas over the next five years, or an average of $440 million a year. That’s an uptick in its annual grant making, which last year approached $375 million.

              Hmmm...you know what popped into my head when I read this? The fact that WalMart has a policy of allowing RVs and big rigs to overnight in their parking lots. RVers on long hauls between one campsite to another all know this this and take advantage of it.

              No one would look twice at C-class motorhome or Semi with kids in it. They could have mobile pedo brothels and no one would be the wiser. They blend right in.

                My local suburban WalMart (Pacific Northwest region) has five shitty RVs people are living out of parked on the road right next to it, and three large tour buses that are there three or four times a week parked in the rear parking lot. Coincidentally, the apartment complex right next to it, one block from the public high school, is full of Chinese teens who live there without their parents, multiple kids to an apartment, with a few adults scattered around to supervise. The public school is 30% over capacity, loaded with Asian kids whose parents (who still live in China) have bought homes in the vicinity to rent out. Property values have gone sky high (up 40% over the past three years). Another high school in the same district got busted recently and had their State Championship revoked for importing Samoan kids for their football team -- actually paying them to come from Samoa, paying their rent, etc. A public high school.

              I'm always learning. I fought my tendencies to react.  I saw a quote of yours 1.5 years ago:
             </p>
             <p>
              "I gotta slow clap the FBI on this one. I'll even give em four years to show me they are fixing the Country. Because after due consideration, this is in our best interests. We need this shit cleaned up, and I have to admit, they seem to be making progress. Without a civil war."
             </p>
             <p>
              It aged well.

               FBI is part of the cabal, they are Rothschild apparatus to shut quash investigations when they surface. It can't get better, you are just as ignorant as you were 1.5 years ago. They are part of it, they don't arrest their partners in crime, they protect the operations. Saved the finders cult didn't they. You have retained nothing.

            Dem flunkie senator, CNN all over the news, sounds like more flipping of the script. They're still trying to hit back about the 2014 photos of the children locked up behind wire mesh.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me ask you this, when the hell has CNN covered real news? Then look at this post and ask yourself why you posted it?

             They do seem to cover anything that puts Trump in a bad light, and this was what Markley was attempting to do. This wasn't from concern for the children, it was the Dems continuing to try to make themselves palatable (and to cover for Clinton and the DNC's newly outed crimes) by making Trump look as bad as they possibly can. Markley's only point was to show how horrible Trump's policies are. Idiot didn't realize Obama is at fault. Anyway, he unwittingly uncovered some troubling news.

              Wait................a minute you two frauds...Are you ignoring that children were found in cages, and only worrying about Trump? So you are saying it is a lie, Walmart is not in cahoots with the authorities(years of accusations of being detention centers) No kids in cages, and the Senator was not denied access? You and MP are trash.

               This should be Enraging every American.  Children!!!  WTH has happened to Our Country?  I don't care who's children these are!  That's why I am Bleeping Sitting Here Everyday.  All Children.  These are Innocents and are where they are because of the Sins of their parents or Despots.  We are worried about Merkley and his Stupid Antics and the Fire Storm created by MSM.  This is Really Disgusting.

              The elite would have this information and would be able to give the location of any number of places. But why do you say it's troubling? It's an ex-Walmart location. That was how it was first explained ... and it's a detention center, no?

              All I know is something doesn't break soon I'm gonna start screaming at the sky. How many illegal things have they done and for how long and no charges? No proof? Nothing? Really? And then I see this shit ... and that's all it is ... shit.

              I know for a fact that Merkley is a communist and a rabid leftist. You are right in your comment this has nothing to do with concern for children. This is a vile America-hater who wants to smear Trump because the Communists are desperate that their new voter influx has slowed down.

               Among other things, like the evidence that is piling up against the DNC for rigging the election &amp; using donations to fund the Steele dossier, but also stemming back to Wikileaks Podesta emails. That shit is still waiting in the wings.

                I agree that this issue is just waiting for exposure. Merkley is just the snake to try to get out in front of it and do what commies do best - lie lie lie and accuse your enemy of your own crimes.

               You are selling left vs right when both are owned by the Rothschilds who own USA inc. You just did damage control and dismissed this story saying they are attacking Trump, so it didn't happen. Are you MF?

            Jesus Christ....they tried to make us look crazy with this Agenda 21 bullshit which was the alt-right cover for the Deep State's trafficking activities.  The Wal-Marts weren't being used to house US citizens, they were shells of buildings leased by FEMA (probably) which turned the keys over to a non-profit/NGP child trafficking cover.

             Walmarts may be used for those purposes in the future. It's not either or. They closed tons of walmarts and converted them. Walmarts founder ran the WW2 internment camps. Wake up  already. You just told people that they aren't going to be used to detain citizens in the future because they are for migrants. Stop confusing people. There is no Alt-right, they created that to label us that. And the Detention centers are for all their operations. not just one or the other. You guys are tiring.

              First,  you need to stop being a flaming asshole to those of us who are more or less on the same time.  Drop the condescending bullshit while you're at it.
             </p>
             <p>
              I'm fully aware of the extent of the Cabal and their reach into everything.  As an intelligent being, I evolve and amend my positions based on learned information.  Most of us are fully aware that "alt-right" is a made up thing.

              Lastly, Sam Walton was a LT and CPT during WWII.  Times may have been different in WWII, but LTs and CPT generally are NOT in charge of full installations - like a prison camp.  I'm not saying he didn't work for security at a POW camp, as well as security at aviation facilities.  Only that little is known of his service.  Yet, you take a big massive leap to claim he "ran the WW2 internment camps".
             </p>
             <p>
              So, if I/we are "tiring" you, then I suggest you GTFO.  Stop being a prick.

             Sounds to me like a fake news cover story using walmart as a child trafficking front and the congress critter pushing a false scripted narrative for illegal invasion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Interior enforcement and deportation is the solution, housing and trafficking invaders hell no.thats how they "allowed" this environment of child and human trafficking to take place the orgs do it under the cover of "law"
