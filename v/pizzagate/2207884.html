<p>Redhead Hollywood shock and rumor celeb Kathy Griffin isn\'t the only one that thinks somethin\'s up:</p>
<p><strong>\'I can\'t imagine those guys didn\'t know\': Kathy Griffin SLAMS George Clooney and Matt Damon after the actors spoke out about Harvey Weinstein assault scandal\'</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5011775/Kathy-Griffin-slams-George-Clooney-Matt-Damon.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5011775/Kathy-Griffin-slams-George-Clooney-Matt-Damon.html</a></p>
<p>*\'Really? No. I don\'t think so - <strong>I can\'t imagine those guys didn\'t know</strong>,\' Kathy said on Tuesday\'s The Project.
\'I knew, and I\'m not even in the movie business.\' *</p>
<p><em>She pointed out that <strong>Weinstein \'is not a single case\'</strong> and claim that \'every\' network and studio boss in the US behaves in a similar way.</em></p>
<p><em>\'</em><em>The white middle-aged guys who are truly running every network and studio in the United States all behave this way and everyone covers for them</em><em>,\' she said.</em></p>
<p>Now we\'re getting somewhere huh Kathy... Good job!</p>
<p>So, who IS <strong>George Clooney</strong> and <em>what role does he REALLY play in all of this?</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney">George Clooney</a></strong> A <a href="http://www.imdb.com/list/ls051382031/">German American of German Descent</a>, actor, director, producer, screenwriter, activist, businessman, and philanthropist who made his acting debut on television in 1978, and later gained wide recognition in his role as Dr. Doug Ross on the long-running medical drama ER. Obviously he holds a  high regard for Weinstein for helping propel his career and has seemed rather sympathetic towards the Miramax founder, but, as we are about to find out, there\'s much more to know about our Ocean\'s Eleven master con-man.</p>
<p>How about a <strong>PIZZAGATE</strong> connection:</p>
<p>Let’s keep in mind the <strong>Clooneys</strong> are huge <strong>Hillary</strong> supporters and held $15 million fundraisers for her in California.  Not a problem. Many 1%ers do.  However <strong>John Podesta</strong> is co-founder of Clooney’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enough_Project">“Enough”</a> project, his “charity” housed in George Soros’s Center for American “Progress”. <a href="https://rednationrising.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/clinton-corrupting-clooney/">https://rednationrising.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/clinton-corrupting-clooney/</a></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The Enough Project</strong>&quot;  is a <strong>Washington, D.C. based non-profit</strong> organization that was founded in <strong>2007</strong>. The project was co-founded by <strong>John Podesta\'s</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_American_Progress">Center for American Progress</a> and the International Crisis Group in 2007.[1] Its stated mission is to end genocide and crimes against humanity. The Enough Project conducts research in several conflict areas in Africa including Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, and the areas controlled by the Lord\'s Resistance Army (LRA).[2] The Enough Project facilitates several campaigns and initiatives which work to bring attention to these crises, including The Sentry, Raise Hope for Congo, and the Satellite Sentinel Project.[3][4] Its co-founders are John Prendergast and Gayle Smith.&quot;*</p>
<p>However, the irony is that Clooney\'s own foundation was self -defeating, or was it another front?</p>

<p><strong>George Clooney, Matt Damon Denounce ‘A–hole’ Harvey Weinstein: ‘It’s Beyond Infuriating’ (Video)</strong></p>

<p><em>Damon also said he knew about an alleged incident in which Weinstein sexually harassed Gwyneth Paltrow. “I knew the story about Gwyneth from Ben [Affleck] because he was with her after Brad [Pitt] and so I knew that story,” said the “Saving Private Ryan” actor.</em></p>
<p><em>“But I was working with Gwyneth and with Harvey on [the 1999 film ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’… I never talked to Gwyneth about it but Ben told me that whatever or agreement they had come to there was an understanding … and he treated her incredibly respectfully. Always.”</em></p>
<p><em>Clooney added that there “has to be a comeuppance for all of this, all of the people that were part of that chain.”</em></p>
<p><em>“We have to make it safe for people to feel they can talk about this, and in doing that, I think that will scare away that kind of behavior,” Clooney said.</em></p>
<p>Really Matt, George? Well, let\'s try to do that then won\'t we, <em>with or without your help</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Angelina Jolie \'involved in bizarre special forces plot to arrest warlord Joseph Kony by acting as BAIT in a honeytrap\' and Brad Pitt was going to be her \'co-star\'</strong></p>

<p><strong>&quot;Moreno Ocampo also tried to recruit film stars George Clooney and Sean Penn to participate in his various quests as well as the wife of the founder of eBay&quot;</strong> </p>
<p>Hmmm. <em>WHO are you Mr. Clooney?</em></p>
<p>Let\'s take a look at the kind of people Clooney surrounds himself with:</p>
<p>&quot;It\'s amazing synchronicity that <strong>George Clooney</strong>, the same actor who played me in the film <strong>The Men Who Stare at Goats</strong>, may be moving to <strong>my home village of Sonning</strong> - we could be neighbours!&quot; -<strong>Uri Geller</strong></p>

<p><strong>URI GELLER\'S HOUSE; STRANGE LINKS</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://aanirfan.blogspot.com/2015/10/yuri-gellers-house-strange-links.html">http://aanirfan.blogspot.com/2015/10/yuri-gellers-house-strange-links.html</a></p>
<p>The village of Sonning has been home to Uri Geller for 35 years.</p>
<p>Sonning is in Berkshire, west of London.</p>
<p>Other people who have houses in Sonning include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Theresa May, the cabinet minister responsible for MI5, and responsible for dealing with the child abuse crisis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, who hoped to become the next Prime Minister.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Led Zeppelin’s guitarist, Jimmy Page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>George and Amal Clooney. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2013, a BBC documentary reported that Geller is a spy for the CIA and Mossad.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/uri-geller-discusses-his-double-life-as-a-psychic-spy-for-mossad-and-cia-10492978.html">Uri Geller\'s double life as a spy</a>.</p>
<p>It was Clement Freud who persuaded Geller to come to England and settle in Sonning.</p>
<p>Clement Freud is related to Yuri Geller on Geller\'s mother\'s side.</p>
<p>David Litvinoff, The Procurer, by his friend Lucian Freud. Among those who reportedly provided young boys for the top people in the UK government were David Litvinoff (David Levy) and his half-Jewish friends the Kray Twins.</p>
<p>Clement Freud\'s brother Lucian Freud &quot;had a well-documented relationship with the Kray twins Reggie and Ronnie.&quot;</p>

<p>People who have visited Geller\'s house in Sonning include presidents, royalty, Michael Jackson and various Hollywood people.</p>
<p>Three times a year, Uri Geller would bring a number of children to his house.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/round-the-bend-9dsxln7qrnb">Round the bend | The Sunday Times</a>.</p>
<p>The house contains a secret passage and a secret room.</p>

<p>Sonning is spooky little town.</p>

           The village of Sonning has been home to Uri Geller for 35 years.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sonning is in Berkshire, west of London.
          </p>
          <p>
           Other people who have houses in Sonning include:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            <p>
             Theresa May, the cabinet minister responsible for MI5, and responsible for dealing with the child abuse crisis.
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, who hoped to become the next Prime Minister.
            </p>
           </li>

           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           In 2013, a BBC documentary reported that Geller is a spy for the CIA and Mossad.

          </p>
          <p>
           It was Clement Freud who persuaded Geller to come to England and settle in Sonning.
          </p>
          <p>
           Clement Freud is related to Yuri Geller on Geller's mother's side.

           David Litvinoff, The Procurer, by his friend Lucian Freud. Among those who reportedly provided young boys for the top people in the UK government were David Litvinoff (David Levy) and his half-Jewish friends the Kray Twins.
          </p>
          <p>
           Clement Freud's brother Lucian Freud "had a well-documented relationship with the Kray twins Reggie and Ronnie."

            The assaults continued for more than three years, most Saturdays, and at various locations around Jersey, including at sea on the man's yacht.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later, a worker at the home, Thomas Hamon, began sexually assaulting the boy.
           </p>
           <p>
            The boy confided in a older friend.
           </p>
           <p>
            That friend was found hanged at the home.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sadly, large numbers of children were reportedly murdered at Haut de la Garenne.

            The film follows two police officers attempting to solve a series of mysterious deaths in an English village. Angel subdues Armstrong and follows clues that lead him to a secret Neighbourhood Watch Alliance (NWA) meeting. Angel confronts the NWA and tries to arrest them. The group reveals that they kill residents who threaten Sandford's chances of winning the "Village of the Year" award (and are necessarily for all intents and purposes practicing satanists).

            Actually, in all reality, there are probably many little burgs in England that are essentially satanist playgrounds spread out not only in the UK but all over Europe, but one I find particularly disturbing is the

               - You stated as fact that the Podestas were at Freud's residence.  While I believe this to be true, I don't think it has been proven so far.  Did I miss something?

              Step back for a minute and look at all of the roles Clooney and Damon (especially Damon) have had and how closely a lot of those "plot themes" track with real life stuff.

            Nespresso has the coffee, Clooney has a fat Nespresso contract, and Technoserve, of which Soros’s brother Paul was a board member, is making bank off their crony contract with Nespresso.  See?  All the “right” people made the money.

            The other education initiative that the Clooneys claim to be involved with is
            <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/news/blog.asp?blogposts_ID=1983&amp;blog_ID=1">
             Scholas Occurrentes
            </a>
            , the initiative with the Pope that started on  August 14, 2013, just after the probable Amal/George meet up in May. Its mission is listed “To link schools and educative networks around the world by means of different types of pedagogical, sports and artistic proposals aimed at improving education and achieving inclusion of communities with fewer resources through an active commitment of all social stakeholders. The VISION of Scholas Occurrentes is ‘to transform the world into an inclusive and educative society’.”  Ruben is going to “unite” the world. The pope is going to “transform” the world.  They mean this literally. Eliminate borders/sovereignty and claim it’s for “education”. How very UN globalists of them.  No wonder Clooney is their posterchild.

            This is why the relationship between Amal, Assange, Hillary, and Eric Schmidt of Google is so interesting.  She was Assange’s lawyer, now she backs Hillary as Assange attempts to bring Hillary down as Amal is super cozy White House helper Eric Schmidt.  Something must have happened when Clooney entered the picture because Assange’s tone soured quite a bit.  Just shy of one month before the great nuptials, Julian Assange released a book entitled “Google is Not What It Seems”.  In it, he details the “special relationship” between Google, Hillary Clinton, and the State Department, much of which ties to all that.

            Fast forward to this year when the Panama Papers were released.  John Podesta’s brother and one of their corporations came up in the searchable database (which has since been deleted).  The Clooney name came up three times.  Amal’s’ Uncle Ziad, arms dealer to the Middle East usually through France, came up once. Soros and all of his dealings came numerous times.  The 1% globalists who use the “fair share” platform to beat their income equality drums once again didn’t practice what they preached.  As I have stated and attempted to prove many time, the Clooneys use their public platforms to deflect their actual actions onto others while claiming to be “for the little” guy to anyone who will listen.

            The 'White Helmets' celebrated alongside Israeli-Saudi backed 'Al Qaeda' extremists after seizing Idlib from Syrian Army forces.
           </p>
           <p>
            The White Helmets "have been caught filming their fake videos in places like Egypt &amp; Morocco, using actors, smoke machines and fake blood".
           </p>
           <p>
            Actor George Clooney did a documentary on the White Helmets, awarded a Hollywood Oscar.
           </p>
           <p>
            Clooney's wife "has ties, according to our sources, with Israeli intelligence. Lawyer Amal Clooney has represented Yulia Tymoshenko, Julian Assange and Mohamed Fahmy, Qatars press puppet with Al Jazeera in Egypt. Clooney is clearly being groomed."

           </p>

             don't think David Beckham is gay. He does cheat on Victoria all the time however. Also he seems really stupid.

            Amazing research. London is the center of the Clinton cabal, and it's starting to look like it's the center of Pizzagate. You should look into the relationship between the OTO and MI6, btw.

             The OTO and M16 are essentially the same. OTO founder was Aleister Crowley who was an M16 operative. All the western inteligence agencies pay homage to image to the Queen and last but most important it is to the Jesuits who PopeFranis first Jesuit ever Poe ever.

              I believe he was married to Debbie Boone  daughter of Pat Boone who married Shirley Foley daughter of Red Foley some of whom many may not remember.  George's dad Nick Clooney was an actor many years ago as well.  We joke about the Bloodlines with the Royals, there must be a lot  of mixed blood with the Stars as well.  Rosemary by the way was married to her second husband, Jose Ferrer who spent some time in a mental hospital.  And yes, Rosemary did have a nervous breakdown.

            The Talented Mr. Ripley is a 1999 American psychological thriller film written for the screen and directed by Anthony Minghella. An adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel of the same name, the film stars Matt Damon as Tom Ripley, Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf, Gwyneth Paltrow as Marge Sherwood and Cate Blanchett as Meredith Logue, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Freddie Miles.

            Apart from the beginning scenes filmed in New York City, the movie was shot entirely on location in Italy. The cliffside resort town of Positano and various villages on the islands of Ischia and Procida, near Naples, were used to represent the fictional town of "Mongibello".[3] The scenes taking place in San Remo were actually filmed in Anzio, a resort-town near Rome. Famous locations included the Piazza Navona, the Spanish Steps and Piazza di Spagna in Rome, and the Caffè Florian in the Piazza San Marco, Venice.[3]

            In October 2017, former New York Times reporter Sharon Waxman wrote on TheWrap that, when she looked into the allegations of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein in 2004,
            <strong>
             Russell Crowe
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             Damon
            </strong>
            made direct phone calls to her to vouch for the head of Miramax Italy,
            <strong>
             Fabrizio Lombardo
            </strong>
            , whom she suspected of having "no film experience" and whose "real job was to take care of Weinstein’s women needs" in Europe.[105][106][107] Damon responded in an interview with Deadline, "For the record, I would never, ever, ever try to kill a story like that... It’s not something I would do, for anybody". He said that he had known Lombardo "in a professional capacity" while working on The Talented Mr. Ripley, so he called the reporter and relayed his experience with Lombardo at Weinstein's request. "That was the extent of it....I’m sure I mentioned to her that I didn’t know anything about the rest of her piece, because I didn’t."[108] Waxman has since endorsed Damon’s statement on Twitter.[109]
