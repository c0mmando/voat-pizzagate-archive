<p>Twice in less than a year, the federal government has lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children after placing them in the homes of sponsors across the country, federal officials have acknowledged.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>“The fact that HHS, which placed these unaccompanied minors with sponsors, doesn’t know the whereabouts of nearly 1,500 of them is very troubling,” Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, the panel’s chair, said Wednesday. “Many of these kids are vulnerable to trafficking and abuse, and to not take responsibility for their safety is unacceptable.”
HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley disputed the notion that the children were “lost.”
“Their sponsors, who are usually parents or family members and in all cases have been vetted for criminality and ability to provide for them, simply did not respond or could not be reached when this voluntary call was made,” she said in a statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>On Tuesday, members of a Senate subcommittee introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at requiring the agency to take responsibility for the care of migrant children, even when they are no longer in its custody.
An Associated Press investigation found in 2016 that more than two dozen unaccompanied children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. At the time, many adult sponsors didn’t undergo thorough background checks, government officials rarely visited homes and in some cases had no idea that sponsors had taken in several unrelated children, a possible sign of human trafficking.
Since then, HHS has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors, according to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.</p>

<p>After reading this article, it doesn\'t seem like all of the missing children are in bad situations. However, the lack of oversight is concerning. It has long been speculated on pizzagate that the reason why illegal immigration was selectively allowed under the Obama years and why Hillary Clinton wanted a open boarders was to enable child trafficking. So often the media told us to defend illegal immigration because of the kids. It looks like some kids are still worse off entering illegally even when placed in government-approved homes.</p>',

            Federal authorities are protecting the pedo operations, so what do you expect? They let the FINDERS cult go back to their CIA pedo operations, returned the kids to them and quashed the investigation. Federal authorities are discredited. Assumption that they are lying is the preset position.

            The DNC 2016 platform included a provision to prohibit the detention of any illegal immigrant family if someone in that family was claiming to be transgender. This would make it extremely simple for traffickers to bring in kids who aren't theirs and pass on through freely. The excuse is that anyone who is transgender doesn't need to be in any type of prison ever because they're in huge danger there. However the statistics pretty much show that most sex offenders are transexual / transgender men / autogynephiles and that most violence against trannies is coming from other tranny men in relationships with them. Aside from that it's trannies who normally target women who won't sleep with them. The tranny discrimination problem is not violence against trannies, it's a well-founded fear of perverted sociopathic men that leads people to naturally fear that type of person.

            Wow , you would expect numbers of missing children that the government  are responsible  for to be this high in underdeveloped  countries not the US.
How the hell can nearly 1500 kids be lost.
Why arnt the authorities hunting down all the carers of these kids to check on them instead of saying " we tried calling them and no answer so file them as missing.
No they have to do more, visit the address the kids were placed, go to carers workplace, go to other relatives of these carers.
People  have to do their jobs right and find and check on the welfare of these kids.
But nobodys going to do that are they? Because these kids were meant to dissapear into the sick depraved hell they've  ended up in.

             1488... Yea I had that thought too. We must preserve the border for the survival of our country. Are we becoming an ethnostate like the founders always intended up until the kikes ruined it in the 1960s?

            I don't know what to say.  I am so very disappointed in this report.  It seems like they are being thrown back and forth and no one wants to do what needs to be done, only throw it back in someone else's lap.  I have always thought that All of Our Children were my responsibility.  These leaders seem to have no heart or feelings for these Little Human Beings.  Lord Help The Little Children. They didn't do anything to deserve this.
