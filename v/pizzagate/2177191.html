            That man in the men's room is a Super Hero.  If it had not been for him, how much longer would this continue?  I just boggles the mind that people do not know that men taking a small child in with them is a red flag.  I guess most people though don't come in every time at the same time always seeing him.  But the workers, I know they are busy, but really.  Really.  I also do not know why that child was not screaming while being raped.  Does it not hurt?  Did he threaten to beat her if she cried?  There are so many disgusting questions.  But really no answers.  The women that came with him they must have known too.  Shame on them.  That poor little child.  I hope she is released to someone in the family and not CPS.

             I feel the same way...I've worked on both ends of Orlando's Hospitality spectrums. I've worked at a bar/bowling alley named Kings and I worked at both at a Mcdonalds/Pollo Tropical. How could none of the employees noticed something? I feel like I would of. I would find it an instant red flag if a man arrived with different babies every other day/week. Why diden't the employees say or do something? The article diden't mention how long it's been going on for nor the Daycare we worked at which angers me to. I'm trying to remember if there is a Daycare near that Plaza and am going to check it out now when I drive near the area. This man has destroyed many infants lives

              It is beyond my comprehension too  I don't understand why people don't see the signs.  I think we have to start telling people in our families and our friends it is OK to step it.  We should not feel we are intruding.  We are saving a child from horrible consequences.  People are too afraid to mind somebody else's business.  Too Politically Correct, if you will.  Do not blame yourself and don't go too far into this without being very careful.  There could be more to this story.

             I just can't fathom this right now...Since High School I've been going to this Chick-Fil-A. My mom used to take my brother and I all the time. Ive been here with friends, and a long time good friend worked there. How could this of been going on...full on raping babies in the bathroom and no one noticing anything. What in the fuck...I feel like I'm going to vomit.

              That's the problem with people today. Too self absorbed. Forgotten how to keep in touch with their instincts. Attention spans too short to focus on suspicious sights and sounds.

             I feel like I'm not going to sleep now. How many different babies were tortured by this monster in that bathroom...I have been in that restaurant and that bathroom many times in the past from when I've eaten there. I literally feel sick. Everytime now that I drive past there and see that restaurant I'm going to be reminded of that monster now. How horrifically sad and unbelievable... :(

              When you're emotionally ready, use what you're feeling to fuel positive change and possibly prevent future victims. How? Now you have a real case scenario to work with, and the news has been published in mainstream news so normies have heard of it. Get a picture of the scum and blow it up. Put it on a 2x4 and stand on a street corner. With the picture should be an explanation-- short and to the point. Something like, "Pedo monsters are real. Report suspicious behavior." This guy got caught because somebody gave a shit. Lots of people still do. Let's make a difference-- maybe the monsters will think twice if they know people are paying attention. And if people are paying attention, there's a greater chance that more will get put behind bars. Even the crooked LE have to do something when the populace wakes up enough to demand justice.
