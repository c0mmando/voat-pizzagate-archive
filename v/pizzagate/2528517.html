<p>In the case of most countries, we have voices here. Australians pitch in quite a lot; UK and many other places too. When have we gotten word from a Dutch or Belgian pizzagate (just curious)? This seems like a serious pair that should have/could have blown up bigger, and I don’t think we have talked about them in awhile. I know they are pretty old news (2012-2015)... Is there ANYTHING new that we can dig up here? </p>
<p>These were huge protests. They can’t fade away.</p>',

           In the case of most countries, we have voices here. Australians pitch in quite a lot; UK and many other places too. When have we gotten word from a Dutch or Belgian pizzagate (just curious)? This seems like a serious pair that should have/could have blown up bigger, and I don’t think we have talked about them in awhile. I know they are pretty old news (2012-2015)... Is there ANYTHING new that we can dig up here?

            Mentions something called the Pinochio bar in Prague. Listed as the "most amazing bar in the world" by Prague's gay community. This needs some digging. They said something about rent boys. So weird. Years ago, when somebody said boys I would automatically not really think children-I'd think immature behaving men. Sometimes, people will tell you who they are right from the beginning and we choose not to listen for one reason or another.

              Sorry. I overreacted. I’m not gonna delete it though. While I agree that some posts are junk, I’m willing to respect people that are trying to have their say. To get mad because some believes in Q, or to berate us for the lack progress... what’s the point? The pedo elite thing has already given me enough to complain about, why add more? And why complain about the ONLY people in the world that seem to care about the problem? Maybe deathtomasons will take a chill pill before his next complaining comment (prolly not tho).

            Raping a child is a crime. People can see it, report it, and tell th world about it. We all know it’s bad. But if the victim disappears or doen’t talk, it never happened and the monster that did it is ‘innocent’.

             If you remember Roger Stone's tweet about Gen Flynn and the 'list' and the hashtag Netherlands... I still have a strong feeling it involves Joris Demmink, because of his connections to NATO.

              Right... I think he is a huge deal. He seems to have a LOT of pull from his local country, to the international court..
             </p>
             <p>
              How could he possibly resist hundreds of thousands protesting? How does the Dutroux affair fade so completely? Covered up just like Boy’s Town.

               Demmink is in the Netherlands, whereas the Dutroux scandal, and 300,000 protesting, was in Belgium (neighbour country). I think there are quite a lot of people in the Netherlands who know about Demmink. Not sure whether there have been protests on the street though. (NB: There is even a pedophile party in the Netherlands....yep.)
