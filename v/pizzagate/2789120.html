<p>KOCHI, India (AP) — A group of Catholic nuns is holding a public protest in south India, demanding the arrest of a bishop whom one nun accused of rape.</p>
<p>The nuns, members of the order the Missionaries of Jesus, began their protest last week, gathering with dozens of supporters along a crowded street in Kochi, Indian state of Kerala. Kerala has a large Catholic population.</p>
<p>&quot;The church has not given us justice,&quot; one of the nuns, Sister Anupama, told the Times of India newspaper over the weekend. &quot;It was the church which forced us onto the street.&quot;</p>
<p>The protest follows a June complaint to police by a Missionary of Jesus nun who accused Franco Mulakkal, bishop of the city of Jalandhar, of repeatedly sexually abusing her in 2014-2016.</p>
<p>The bishop has denied the accusation, saying the nun was angry because he had earlier ordered disciplinary actions against her.</p>
<p>Police questioned Mulakkal in July. He has not been arrested.</p>
<p>And the church strikes again !  😡😡😡😡😡
This time it’s an adult accusing and still the victim has 
No voice !  The church is falling.....</p>',

            The state of Kerala is home to one of India's biggest Christian populations that dates back hundreds of years. The Syro-Malabar Catholics that inhabit the region trace their traditions back to Thomas the Apostle.

            , a Catholic priest, James Aerthayil has been caught on tape speaking to one of the nuns supporting the victim, asking her to withdraw the case against the bishop.

           <p>
            , he says the church is “willing to purchase a 10-acre site and establish a convent in which you can be secure”, and says the location could most likely be in Erumely or Ranni, falling under the diocese of Kanjirapally.
           </p>
           <p>
            In another case of sexual abuse, the crime branch has charged four priests from the Orthodox Church in Kerala of sexually abusing a married woman. The victim said the priests had misused information from her confessional to blackmail and sexually abuse her.
