<p>KOCHI, India (AP) — A group of Catholic nuns is holding a public protest in south India, demanding the arrest of a bishop whom one nun accused of rape.</p>
<p>The nuns, members of the order the Missionaries of Jesus, began their protest last week, gathering with dozens of supporters along a crowded street in Kochi, Indian state of Kerala. Kerala has a large Catholic population.</p>
<p>&quot;The church has not given us justice,&quot; one of the nuns, Sister Anupama, told the Times of India newspaper over the weekend. &quot;It was the church which forced us onto the street.&quot;</p>
<p>The protest follows a June complaint to police by a Missionary of Jesus nun who accused Franco Mulakkal, bishop of the city of Jalandhar, of repeatedly sexually abusing her in 2014-2016.</p>
<p>The bishop has denied the accusation, saying the nun was angry because he had earlier ordered disciplinary actions against her.</p>
<p>Police questioned Mulakkal in July. He has not been arrested.</p>
<p>And the church strikes again !  😡😡😡😡😡
This time it’s an adult accusing and still the victim has 
No voice !  The church is falling.....</p>',

           <p>
            , he says the church is “willing to purchase a 10-acre site and establish a convent in which you can be secure”, and says the location could most likely be in Erumely or Ranni, falling under the diocese of Kanjirapally.

            In another case of sexual abuse, the crime branch has charged four priests from the Orthodox Church in Kerala of sexually abusing a married woman. The victim said the priests had misused information from her confessional to blackmail and sexually abuse her.
