            Oh I'm not that paranoid,  Ever hear Pastor Glen (or is it Gary?) Hobbs talks about killing Becky and drinking her blood when he was a kid. That was on TV. I Find myself surprised cause everyday I find myself saying this on Voat threads...DONT TELL PEOPLE HOW TO TALK. Or what to say! Toning down the all caps but...if you wanna talk PIZZAGATE bloodlet feasting for youth for power...I will listen. I know that's what's up. It's Hollywoodween and it's very real now so... surprised everyday. Btw, If you don't keep it real I'll stop listening. So howabout that Laura Silsby anyone notice her duping delight during her telivision interview?  Let's talk about psychopathy. Let's talk about the truly dangerous folks in our society, those without guilt.

             Yes. The true danger is the population with no conscious. The people who seem to have no souls.

             When it comes down to it, this whole thing really is about good vs evil.

               Yep but they can't do it. People are not naturally evil and (mind control) programming breaks down on its own in time. Even if they got to every last child in the world, humans would recover.

            Wow great post. I'm totally agreed. And on that note MAD AS FLAMING BEARS! I Can't fond much out there suddenly on Daniel Pye the missionary pedophile, he's from Arkansas but wasn't he held in jail in Haiti along with Laura Silsby?? Because as I agree whole HEARTEDLY that PIZZAGATE is not as much about Hollywood and sickosex as much as it is a tip of the iceberg revelation of blood letting that was  previously unthinkable because it hadn't entered into our conciousnesses and now it is so clear, how dear is blood to us. More dear than gold our children. The only thing to get up about at all. So anyway, that being said Laura Silsby Vice President at Alertsense, the INFRASTRUCTURE compromise. Starting there, going back to when the Clinton state department acted on her behalf...after her arrrst,. It's all Documented but strangely alot of sits even Voat posts weren't popping up for my phone with Daniel Pyes name. One quote I read more than once is one of the Haitian kids said Pye would rape her daily regardless of whether wife Leanna Pye was home or not. Why is she free, or not facing charges. From what I read it sounds like She ,Leanna got alot of people to feel sorry for them, other Americans. I would like to know wether Pye was held with Silsby or just at the same can't time as Silsby.

            There is historical evidence that some of this is true but it won't convince normal people. The battle is won by convincing normal people. It is best to leave this out of the conversation when talking to normies because they won't go there.

             If people won't "go there" they will never understand any of the more complicated stuff. Normies, I fear, will never ever understand secret societies, not even in the slightest sense. You can show them a Freemason Lodge right on their street, explain what they teach in there, and they still will be like "LET PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY WANT MAN, WHO CARES, YOU'RE A CONSPIRACY FAKE NEWS TRUMP SUPPORTER."

              I agree that attempting to have an intelligent conversation with the average american is a real bummer, but, we have to attempt to spoon feed them at a level they can understand because unfortunately getting them outraged is the leverage that will win or lose the fight. The numbers are needed.
             </p>
             <p>
              "Fuck the normies" is not an option. Stoking their rage and directing it properly is vital to the equation.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am as guilty as anybody about teaching people how satanic cults work, but, at the same time I realize that on one level it is not productive and sometimes even harmful.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most normies will say something similar to "OK, I might be able to believe the the pedophilia stuff, BUT, when you start talking about satanic cults I stop listening to your crazy shit."
             </p>
             <p>
              Unfortunately this is our reality and the playing field we have to deal with. If they can't handle the sophisticated thinking process required to understand some of this then they just can't. That is reality. Fortunately proving that satanic cults are involved is not necessary to enrage the normies, whom we seriously need.
             </p>
             <p>
              Child abuse is enough. We don't need the cult stuff to make a case. Normies will not learn the cult stuff anytime soon and its best left out of the equation because it is an instant thought stopper.
             </p>
             <p>
              I linger back and forth from realizing that it is important for people that have the aptitude for the occult learning to learn it, because it is important for at least a few to be able to spot the patterns.
             </p>
             <p>
              At the same time mention drinking blood and you just lost a thousand customers whom we needed. It is a Catch 22.

               Very good observation there. I've almost completely given up on speaking with people about these topics because they either won't listen, make fun of it, or they think you're "alt-right/pro Trump" if you bring up this kind of stuff. Its a very uphill battle. We need the normies, but they don't want any part in this.
