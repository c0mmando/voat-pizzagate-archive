Alefantis is supposedly Greek. Maybe you guys can find a connection?</p>

If you scroll down a bit, you will find a gory picture of a dead person. Very odd. </p>
<p>I have no proof the Sweeties are connected to Heavy Breathing or Majestic Ape, but They both share many creepy similarities. Just thought I\'d share this.</p>',
