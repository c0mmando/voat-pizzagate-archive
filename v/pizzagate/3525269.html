<p>Good news everyone... Child sex trafficking investigators from the FBI’s New York field office have conducted an interview with a victim who provided chilling details about allegedly being raped by Bill Clinton on a yacht in New England when the victim was a young boy.</p>
<p>We still have a job to do here and that’s what we’re doing,” one FBI official told this reporter.</p>
<p>I originally interviewed the victim with journalist Jen Moore who provided the details against Bill Clinton and other elite politicians to child trafficking specialists in DHS Department of Homeland Security and the FBI in July 2018. Moore, an advocate who investigated abused and trafficked children, had been in the process of investigating allegations by the 26-year-old man that — as a young boy — he was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and pimped out at private sex parties attended by other D.C. elites.</p>
<p>But Moore and the traumatized victim wanted to contact Homeland Security and the FBI first to see if they would open a criminal case against Clinton prior to publicizing the claims.</p>
<p>Four weeks after contacting the Feds, Jen Moore was found dead in a D.C. hotel room. Moore died of an apparent seizure, though her death remains suspicious and the timing — beyond disturbing. After Moore’s death, the victim, fearful for his own life, decided to not go public with that interview.</p>

            Interesting. It's been more than a year since True Pundit claimed they had this interview. I wonder why they are only finally releasing this now?
           </p>
           <p>
            It would be good to give some highlights of this guy's very NSFW claims:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             He's saying his great uncle, who is not named, took him to a large yacht (he says "like a luxury cruise ship") to pimp him out when he was 8 years old.
            </li>
            <li>
             At 5:20, he claims that before Bill Clinton came in to rape him, his uncle held him up above his head, where another man slashed the bottoms of his feet with a scimitar, captured the blood in a chalice, took a sip, and then walked away through the crowd.
            </li>
            <li>
             5:52 The uncle then held him up and got Bill Clinton's attention, and Clinton looked at him and shrugged, "Like 'What am I going to do? I guess I have to do it.'" This was on the top deck of the boat.
            </li>
            <li>
             6:30 "There were four podiums [in a square] and one in the middle. A pedestal. There was a teenage girl on one of them, but the youngest girl was I think six years old.
            </li>
            <li>
             7:54 When I was taken into the ballroom these people were marched diagonally from one enterance to the other to get to the top of the boat and they were all bleeding from cuts on their feet and they had cuts from their chest to their abdomen. When I was brought out to the top of the boat, they were all already on the ground being forced to continue having sex in their state."
            </li>
            <li>
             8:40 "So there were four pedestals with women in different states of sexual development on them. And the middle pedestal has Bill Clinton."
*10:47 He says is 26 now (2018 -- the year TP originally claimed to have this video), meaning these events date to the year 2000 at the end of Bill Clinton's presidency. If I'm calculating that correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
             11:56 "That was the worst experience of my life, but they never stopped kidnapping me, even as an adult."
            </li>
            <li>
             Goes on to describe being used as a "prop" in blackmail sex tapes
            </li>
            <li>
             17:42 "I have been kidnapped dozens and dozens of times"
            </li>
            <li>
             26:40 Mike Moore (True Pundit) says he is going to reach out to the down to earth guys he knows in the FBI, and claims he doesn't have to take notes because he has a photographic memory.
            </li>
            <li>
             31:52 Video captions state that victim started puking into a wastebasket so they concluded the video. It then states Jenny Moore (who was sitting just off screen next to the victim, handing him peanuts and a water bottle) would contact the FBI and DHS on his behalf. It states she did, and they never contacted her. It ends: "She was found dead in a DC hotel room four weeks later."

              Interesting. Now why would my consolidating this information rumple your undies enough to threaten to kill me?
             </p>
             <p>
              I've never called anyone here a bitch. Jem777 told quite a few lies on this board, especially when required to source her claims like everyone else. My position has been consistent from the beginning: cut the BS and follow the submission rules the users have repeatedly voted on.
             </p>
             <p>
              I've never seen definitive proof that Jem777 was actually Jenny Moore, though I have repeatedly asked for it. At the time of what was heavily pushed as her "murder", there was no evidence presented she was even dead. Just George Webb and Mike Moore making unsourced claims for $$.
             </p>
             <p>
              I HAVE seen repeated attempts by multiple different people to use her and her death to:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               Frighten researchers away from investigating and reporting crimes against kids
              </li>
              <li>
               Increase traffic to heavily monetized sites like True Pundit and Crowdsource the Truth
              </li>
              <li>
               Sow confusion
              </li>
              <li>
               Raise the hope of folks here, and then blast it to smithereens
              </li>
              <li>
               Stir up drama and distrust
              </li>
              <li>
               Outright lie, claiming moderators a) are intelligence operatives who b) persecuted her c) tried to silence her and cover up what she was investigating d) sent thugs to her apartment to beat her up e) ignored credible death threats made against her by other users and f) actually murdered her.
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p>
              So, I have continued to try to get to the bottom of what's really going on.
             </p>
             <p>
              Why is it that you don't want me to do this?

                    It's funny that someone as sensitive to unjust accusations as you appear to be, would be slinging them only at the people who think you a fool. You need to post proof that I consider you anything more than a sad imbecile.

                    I know you won't believe me, but I came back to this submission so as to see if TTT had made more alts. and whether or not they were pinging people to be mean to them. Including you. You keep burying yourself deeper and deeper.

               Thanks for your summary. I was very hopeful about this news, but the events described are so way out there for the public to accept.

               The scars would be something. However I recall it's said that Cathy O'Brien has some scars in her genital area, that's some measure of proof but doesn't necessarily go to confirm her whole story.

                 Argosciv is an A-number-one, super-duper ass licker with an exceptionally long tongue. You all butt-hurt because he sucks sphincter better than you do? He loves the attention you give him, he gets sympathy from it. Faggot.

                <p>
                 He posted that series to try to make himself important, and had a meltdown because everybody thinks him a fool. Everything he does is so he can be petted by the Mods of several subs. Have you ever watched him suck Putts' ass? Epic!!!

                   That's a little better. You got a lot of boring political stuff there. I know very little about the anons, except that they are late comers, politically motivated, and know nothing about who is really pulling the strings. You say you know so much then why not post the proof. I learn about the things I've missed by reading the links I archive. You want me or others to spread the word then you have to provide a clear evidence trail. Links that can be shared, to back up your narrative. The people we share this info with don't have the time to look every little claim you make up, you should help, not preach and slander others.

                No, srayzie did nothing of the kind. She posted evidence of Jenny Moore having many discussions with the botnet that has spammed this board with bullshit from the beginning, which resulted in multiple accounts attacking her here and on Twitter until thewebofslime doxxed her real life address to criminals on Voat who threatened to rape her kids. She was silenced and driven from both Voat and Twitter, just like our other moderator who dared publish the testimony of the kid raped by James Alefantis, abortionburger.

                  I'd need to see specific proof of this. It's untrue. Everything I saw from srayzie

                   Jem claimed that I had sent thugs to her house to beat her up
                  </a>
                  , and then saw numerous people claiming I helped murder Jem, she saw Jem's history here being unfairly whitewashed and mine being unjustly villified and shared what she knew. I believe she stated that the spam bot that called itself "Sarah" had stalked both she and Jem.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  She was reluctant at the time to share what she knew due to the harassment she'd already received from the Sarah bot network. Of course, it turns out her fears were justified. She was subsequently doxxed, humiliated, urged to commit suicide, and ultimately driven off of Voat after her address was posted and her children were threatened with rape.

                     I'm saying that srayzie frequently dm-ed me with claims that JEM777 was crazy and called sarah, I didn't agree with that but arguing with her about it became aggravating for me to be here. I see that in fact you are calling sarah a bot now that srayzie is gone so obviously srayzie was wrong about this but she worked hard at trying to turn me against JEM like it was personal for her. She also wanted me to facebook her, which I was not going to do.  I have seen that lots of the original pizzagators have gone too, I don't wonder why. As for abortionburger, she posted openly on youtube and doxed herself which is stupid. The shills (the enemy) are  child rapers and murderers so it is be dangerous to aggressively provoke them and srayz was exceeding in her provoking of them so threats are to be expected to some degree.

                      So post the screencap. Otherwise, how can you expect anyone here to believe you?  I had numerous conversations with srayzie about sarah and never once did she say she was Jem.

                      Abortionburger had a ten year social media history before becoming involved in pizzagate. She was also very young and naive. She had no idea what she was getting herself into. She was incredibly brave and took a stand against injustice. She was inspiring to work with and I wish she was still around. For her sake, though, I am glad she isn't here taking abuse from people like you.

                  You and your pals ES, Slime, Kev and the rest of the gang harassed srayzie and poured over her posts until enough info could be gathered to dox her. I saw it all go down, and I've documented a lot of it. It was disgusting. Slime doxxed her and what did he find? That she was exactly what she said she was, a housewife and PG survivor. Her "criminal" record was a DUI, which isn't much of a surprise, since she told a lot of friends here she was a recovered alcoholic. Right. Watching you assholes target her and try to cut her out of the community was the most enlightening experience I've had here on Voat. The true nature of numerous users was exposed.

               @Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt
              </a>
              and back in 2017 did a bunch of research into the societies and fraternities in the Racine area. Something about the Root River, etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a lot of weird stuff there. But it never really amounted to more than just a bunch of weird people and places. We can only speculate about the organizations, the tunnels and private airport.
             </p>
             <p>
              Please, stop beating around the bush. Tell us excactly what the 8th wonder is, why its important and what happened to Wisconsin_Is_Corrupt.

              My Germanic grandparents were from Racine. I am not far away. But im tired of the pursuit. I need a little leading.
