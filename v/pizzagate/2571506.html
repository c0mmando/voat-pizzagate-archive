<p>In what can only be described as a grassroots victory for parents everywhere, the children\'s film &quot;Show Dogs&quot; has been pulled from theaters and will be re-edited following an intense public outcry over what many parents saw as covert pedophile messaging. </p>
<p>&quot;Disturbingly, these are similar tactics child abusers use when grooming children-telling them to pretend they are somewhere else and that they will get a reward for withstanding their discomfort,&quot; she said. &quot;Children\'s movies must be held to a higher standard, and must teach children bodily autonomy, the ability to say \'no\' and safety, not confusing messages endorsing unwanted genital touching</p>
<p>So who\'s to blame for the &quot;Show Dogs&quot; fiasco? As of now, it remains a mystery, because according to the film\'s writer, Max Botkin, he had no hand in the final draft, which was delivered by 12 different writers before the first day of shooting, he told CNN. In a statement, he also distanced himself from the final product.</p>
<p>&quot;I absolutely condemn any suggestion or act of non-consensual touching in any form, as well as disassociation as a coping mechanism for abuse of any kind,&quot; Botkin said in a statement. &quot;I understand and empathize with the parents\' and groups\' concerns regarding the message the movie may impart.&quot;</p>
<p>The question still remains and truly speaks volumes as to the dunces that run Hollywood: How come not a single producer, actor, or executive ever raised a red flag regarding the film\'s subject matter prior to production?</p>

<p>What does that look like to you? This is how they make manchurian candidates, by abuse in early childhood.</p>
<p>I think you don\'t know how bad these people are. While you could call the &quot;go to your happy palace&quot; groomers pedophiles... they are ultimately slavers. Child sex slavers.</p>
<p><a href="https://kek.gg/i/4N3QHH.jpeg">They want their product, the child, to behave and deal with being used.</a></p>

            Did I miss something?  I don't see anything about the movie being pulled from theaters in that article.  The closest I saw was:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Now, less than a week after its debut, which pulled in an abysmal $6 million on its opening weekend and a "rotten" score of 23% on the Tomatometer, the film's producers have released a statement apologizing to the offended parents while promising to make amends.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Responding to concerns raised by moviegovers and some specific organizations, Global Road Entertainment has decided to remove two scenes from the film Show Dogs that some have deemed not appropriate for children," the studio said. "The company takes these matters very seriously and remains committed to providing quality entertainment for the intended audiences based on the film's rating." "

              I went back and re-read.  "has been pulled from theaters and will be re-edited".  I think they will try and relaunch it.  Now that the movie is "scandalous", kids will want to watch it even more.

                Keep an eye on this.  I bet subliminal stuff gets added in the re-edit.  What makes me sick is this movie was designed not just for conditioning, but for pedos to use as a "tool".

               <p>
                Creep tells his GF that he's taking her son/daughter to the movies for the afternoon.  She thinks he's "father" material.  Meanwhile, the creep now has a nice pedo trick - movie, our secret, don't tell mom....whatever creepy shit they do.  Sick to my stomach.

            Your Instagram link takes us to a hashtag search that brings up only like 5 results most of them Tom Petty related so not sure what you’re looking at there.

            MK/Monarch Butterflies and Tavistock Projects no doubt.  What a horrid thing.  Although we know they will be programmed to do horrid things, I have a feeling of sorrow for them.  They had no choice in the matter.  They were taken not asked.  Just like BO.  His mother and father are the ones to blame, the CIA and our govt.   These Tavies must be stopped or they will destroy the earth.  Scorched Earth.
