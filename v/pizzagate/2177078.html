            Milo will never talk about PG. He's another one of those freaks who like to bath in blood.

             I remember this. He had a bunch of twinky girly-boys bathing in blood and called it "art." I'm pretty sure some of them were underage.

              He was making fun of leftist/feminist "artists" like Marina Abramovic as a publicity stunt.  There were no underage people involved at all.  Stop spreading disinfo.

             Milo is with 100% certainty a child rapist himself. After all, he's a "Jew", a sodomite and an elite/controlled opposition insider. A real royal flush of wickedness right there. The idea that he wouldn't be a child rapist is beyond me.

            I was a staunch Milo supporter from way back, but the truth is he had been what now looks like a cringe worthy advocate for age of consent laws being lowered .  he may have been duped by the pedosatanists into advocating one thing, but it was a ruse to legitimize something else.
While I do not advocate teenagers engaging in adult relationships, there is evidence in my own history of dating a 19 year old when I was 16, this person was not a pedophile and we remain friends to this day.
Thats the gray area that is being used against Milo .
As a middle aged adult with children , I already know the difference between my daughters dating someone 3 years older, and the pervy soccer coach who I got fired for creep touching a 6 year old when my kids were in elementary school.
While I do not advocate anyone dating a minor,and that includes a 16 year old dating a 19 year old, I know that when Milo and people of that generation were growing up, these situations were not addressed as pedophilia....lots of people we knew were having these sorts of inappropriate interactions with older kids... but nobody equated that with child molesters and adults who are exclusively attracted to pre pubescent children,
thats how indoctrinated we were.
We had no idea what was going on with these vampires,
We were also indoctrinated into believing that abortion was about womens health and feminism.... all of that was propagandist lies meant to indoctrinate all of us who grew up in the 80's.... we never even heard of Margaret Sanger, or Eugenics, or had the foggiest notion of social engineering.
At the outset of the whole pizzagate story, Milo appeared to be chomping at the bit to talk about it... and then he went mute.... which says , to me, that it never occurred to him that his previous statements would be lumped into all of that to discredit him.
He was also abused at a young age; groomed, as it were; and that was likely never dealt with and/or processed as abuse in his psyche.

             Yep, Milo said something about teenage gay boys pimping themselves out to older men on a Rogan interview way back and they blew it up saying Milo supports pedos.

            <p>
             Not defending older people taking advantage of teens but it is much different and less evil than the satanic sacrifice and sex with babies we are combatting here.

              On Joe Rogan's podcast, he was talking about the "mansion parties" (the same ones mentioned by Katt Williams when he says "is that two niggas kissin?") and at these "parties" he mentioned, and specifically said multiple times, "VERY YOUNG BOYS" were "doing drugs and having sex with older men." He repeats "very young boys" three or four times. Milo is obviously someone who was part of this "young boys doing blow and having sex" scene, but I don't think he's cutting infants heads off and drinking their blood. But I'm still not a supporter of him because he destroys our movement by parading around joking about sucking black dicks all the time. People connect us to him, and then we are looked at as a joke.

             Great analysis.  I agree that is seemed like in the early stages when PG story broke we was "chomping  at the bit" to talk about it.  All the more reason to try and get a reaction on him when asking about his current stance on the issue. Literally ANY kind of response would be very telling and would be good info to have for this continued investigation...

             Awesome. I think he is heavily invested in propping up the legend in his own mind he's created about himself as the great seducer, though. Getting around that is going to be tough.
