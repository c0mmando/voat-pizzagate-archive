            Yes, I'm mortified!!! It seems that real-time gaming means that we are opening our homes to perverts all over the world.

            It isn't.  I monitor my kids and haven't seen any problems. I am sure some get on there but its like any web site, or even stuff like Xbox live etc. Got to assume they are there and monitor.

ABC show The Goldbergs features podophile symbols

           <p>
            Someone made an account like 2 hours ago just to comment that they spoke to the shows creator and prop supplier and how they didn't know.
           </p>
           <p>
            Scroll down in comments from user Garry_Willis. 
I personally heard from the shows creator and prop supplier .This was completely unintended ,based on how props are ordered they are randomly provided . These symbols of neon were not associated with pedo 30 yrs ago at the time these props were generated .I was bashing the Goldbergs myself about this until I researched it myself and reached out to the prop man and I firmly believe this was done unintentionally .
           </p>
           <p>
            I replied back to him.
I'd like to believe that. But you've been a member for 2 hours. Where is this conversation? Screenshots? Email proof? Why doesn't he come to voat and discuss it himself. It's odd that you barely became a member just to explain that

            My kid plays this game, I watch him close, his computer isn't in a private space and his account has restricted login times, etc. I've seen the occasional weirdo as in any online multiplayer game, but it's pretty obvious that most players are kids. Tldr; I think roblox is mostly harmless.

            My son told me about this back in 2010 or so. He was in Kindergarten and he said some kid in his class was playing Roblox and that the character went out on a date with a girl and then killed her.

            This rugby guy is a complete tard. Never played this game, have seen it on the Xbox homepage though.

            He probably thinks GTA causes people to kill and steal cars everyday too. Being a hawk over your child and setting restrictions on everything is most likely just going to make them more curious and cause them to rebel. Or they're going to grow up in their own little bubble that'll get popped real quick from real world interactions. Not saying to let your kid do whatever they want, but rather saying stop being a faggy parent.

            And the person that made a virtual 'move' on his virtual character, was probably some trollin bored 15 yr old.. Not some 50yr old guy trying to "groom" children lmao. dumb.

            I actually play this game, it's mostly innocent, but I have seen some shenanigans. It's mostly aimed toward kids... I usually just play tiny tanks, and which I get invited to chat a lot. I almost never go, because why.... I just want to play the game...
           </p>
           <p>
            The couple of times I have joined the Xbox chat, (live microphone) it was kids so I usually didn't talk or left pretty quickly. That's what a normal person does anyway.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway roblox is set up so that anyone can make a game, it's actually pretty cool and engaging that a kid say a 12 year old, could make his or her own game and maybe it becomes famous, or maybe they just learn.
           </p>
           <p>
            But because it attracts so many kids just like anything else it's gonna attract pedos. Now I have never seen an actual pedi on there but what I saw (and reported one day) were "games" that someone made.. that were XXX based. Like you walk in this huge building and the only way to describe it was it was an online sex orgy trade show with prostitutes (computer simulated) you could talk to, beds of orgies you could join in on, and there were like 50 or more people some of which surely were kids, and I wonder if the majority were because I think this games probably 60 to 75 percent kids..
           </p>
           <p>
            This was removed swiftly after I reported them, there were two of these.
           </p>
           <p>
            Unfortunately just like YouTube, sites and games that allow user created content will run into these things. It's whether or not the company takes these things seriously and remove them quickly. Which roblox did.
           </p>
           <p>
            But what the father above is talking about is a privacy issue. I'm absolutely positive he can limit his child's ability to chat and interact on the service. And he wasn't a good parent and did not look into the game he allowed his child to play, and set the privacy settings appropriately. And have the talk with his child about online interactions and what's acceptable and what to do when something happens that is outside of acceptable.
           </p>
           <p>
            I chalk this story up to bad parenting. Sure roblox like any other kid centric game or hobby is going to attract sickos. But roblox has privacy controls for that very reason, and bad parents find out about them reactively rather than proactively.

             Is there any way to set rooms as being "adult" so kids (or at least, kids who are listed as being under 18) can't get in?
            </p>
            <p>
             I remember on Second Life, there was something that looked like a playground, but I noticed the ADULT thing up at the top. I wondered why a playground would be listed that way, but then it hit me...

               Yeaaaars back I used to use Gaia. While I'm pretty sure it was made for kids, there are/were 18+ rooms. I remember I got banned for a while (I assume it was an auto-ban after they clicked a report button) for telling someone who admitted to being under 18 to GTFO out of the room.

             I play on there, too. My kids share my account and I have it set at the kid-level for more privacy.

             Developers have to put filters into any imput-based chat (like private messages in game) else the game gets pulled.

             Part of me wants to make a guild on there that reports pedo shenanigans and help moderate. Probably would get shot down, though.

               I'm developing a game for my kids (my kids play the games, and I play with the Builder's Club) that's a cross of Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros... with some Fable mixed in for shits and giggles. Gotta save the princess after defeating a hellhole of zombies underground, collect shrooms for potions and powers. Hidden caves, fairy pools... yeah. That's been eating up my Roblox time.
              </p>
              <p>
               Next time I actually play I'll have to give tiny tanks a whirl.

            Who the heck do ROBLOX think they are fooling?  The kids of course.  Wake up people and check your kids electronics.  IPads have all kinds of games they are privy to.  The kids think you are keeping them safe.  They trust you so if it is in your house they think it is ok.  Make sure you keep their trust.  This is horrid.  This is their way of Normalizing Their World with the rest of it, though our children.  They are the next generation.

               Pedo Warriors sounds sort of... wrong.

               Sounds like warriors who are pedophiles.

               Anti-Pedo Warriors sounds better.
