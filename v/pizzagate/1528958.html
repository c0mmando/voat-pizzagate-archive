<p>A huge hit came up today! Thought I’d go Twitter diving and I came up with a Twitter account for Ms. Paule-Carre that’s gonna really make you go WOW! According to this, she’s sounds more an operative than anything else … or that’s what it seems like to me. Read what this Twitter account says:</p>
<p><a href="http://archive.is/81Be1">http://archive.is/81Be1</a></p>
<p>So she was born in LEBANON (gee, wonder where the Podestas got those ties to the Middle East?), a French national, and in 2011, is based in Amsterdam!!! So all those listings at 124 Amherst in Winchester VA, what were those? She’s stating here that she’s BASED in Amsterdam!  And that she has “a management consulting firm”!!! Which firm is this? PCS Enterprises? Or Gusifer? She’s never described PCS that way. Remember that PCS was described as “business services” and Gusifer is mostly left blank.  
</p>
<p>I really think we need to be all over this. Why did she base herself in Amsterdam? Why did she open a Twitter account that she never used? (Please note that it only has one follower. If you click on it, it brings you a second private protected account for: Paule Carre! <a href="https://twitter.com/paulecarre">https://twitter.com/paulecarre)</a>) Why does she barely advertise that art gallery of hers? And what did this being based in Amsterdam have to do with the adoption services. SFI was doing business in five countries! Was The Netherlands one of them?

</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have someone named “Gusifer” (see previous link on China for this individual) asking questions about flights from Newark to Zurich with full loads and full loads of fuel … the subject even switches to Hawaii! Why would he want to know the weight capacity and how many stops to make? </p>

              I think it's a combination of things--tax and laws, its physical location in Europe, and language (~90% of the Dutch can speak English).

            Marina Abramović (Spirit Cooking) lived in Amsterdam for a long time as well.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 1976, after moving to Amsterdam, Abramović met the West German performance artist Uwe Laysiepen, who went by the single name Ulay. When Abramović and Ulay began their collaboration,[9] the main concepts they explored were the ego and artistic identity. This was the beginning of a decade of influential collaborative work. Each performer was interested in the traditions of their cultural heritages and the individual’s desire for ritual. Consequently, they decided to form a collective being called "The Other", and spoke of themselves as parts of a "two-headed body".[27] They dressed and behaved like twins and created a relationship of complete trust. As they defined this phantom identity, their individual identities became less accessible.

Selling that house 20 years later, for $4 million, funded her move to New York and her purchase of Star House.

            A little bit off topic here, but I still think that Natalee Holloway from Alabama on a highschool SR. trip went to Aruba with her class and was never found. Jordan Van der Sloot was last seen with her. His father was an Dutch attorney I believe.  The authorities botched the investigation from the beginning. Even then people was throwing around that Holloway may have been kidnapped and sold into the sex trade. Now with pizzagate and the Netherlands pedo bust one has to wonder if the Van der Sloots could be involved with this sick shit!

             He admitted she died when he did not realize he was being recorded. Is that the truth? Who knows. But since he ended up killing another young woman several years later, it's not hard to see this as a case where privileged rich sociopath drugged innocent girl to rape her, she dies by his hands or from the drugs, and daddy helps cover it up by disposing of the body.
Not every bizarre disappearance and death are going to be related back to these sick fucks.

             POSITVE!!! The link is in the other post. Here's a link through Wayback showing the exhibits.

             Yes, there is a clothing store, but that is not the art gallery. Also, if you go click on one of the 19 snapshots captured by Wayback, like the one in 2016, you'll come upon the apartments for rent:

               Here's a more definitive link. Her pic is prominently displayed. There's even a map. If it's not at the address listed, I really would love to know that.
