<p>Maybe it\'s a stretch..maybe GOLD....here we go:</p>
<p>The FILENAME of the Trump Q-Foto on twitter is NOT AUTOMATICALLY the message:  <strong>&quot;DOITQ&quot;</strong>
It\'s actually <strong>&quot;DOITQJ8UIAAowsQ&quot;.</strong>
Let\'s look at it objectively!!
&quot;DOIT&quot;....that\'s not an accident.--clearly a message. SO message is objectively splitt in DOIT--QJ8UIAAowsQ at first.</p>
<p>That\'s all for now and every normie can accept that....
let\'s go deeper:<strong>-tinfoil mode:1</strong></p>
<p>owsQ seem out of pattern here...Q is Capital after 3 lower case
Q is in CAP here! makes Q standing out as single letter.
Q needs to be viewed as reference...ergo</p>
<p>Not a stretch to say message is split in:

<p>(owsQ = owes Q?)</p>
<p>anyway J8UIAA is the only part I have no explanation for.
REMEMBER: EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED

           Hello Guys.
Here from the start of PG but passive mode only....now time to be active.

          <p>
           Maybe it's a stretch..maybe GOLD....here we go:

          <p>
           The FILENAME of the Trump Q-Foto on twitter is NOT AUTOMATICALLY the message:

           <strong>
            "DOITQJ8UIAAowsQ".
           </strong>
           Let's look at it objectively!!
"DOIT"....that's not an accident.--clearly a message. SO message is objectively splitt in DOIT--QJ8UIAAowsQ at first.
          </p>
          <p>
           That's all for now and every normie can accept that....
let's go deeper:
           <strong>
            -tinfoil mode:1
           </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
           owsQ seem out of pattern here...Q is Capital after 3 lower case
Q is in CAP here! makes Q standing out as single letter.
Q needs to be viewed as reference...ergo
          </p>
          <p>
           Not a stretch to say message is split in:
           <strong>

            A bit clarification about the probabilities behind it.
First here is a list of pictures from twitter.
A +++ marks a different set.
A set was taken in order.
You can clearly see a pattern.
Twitter gives them in order.
All pictures on twitter behave that way.
Right now we are in a phase of D.
Let's assume first that D is set.
How likely is it that we end up with DOITQ.
The beauty of the message lies in the perfect Combination of CAPS and lowers inside the complete String, meaning that "ows" Q are the ONLY small ones,...which by itself has interpreted meaning and ALSO separates the last CAP "Q" as a distinct Feature.
But for the sake of easyness lets take that all to the side for now and let's just calculate how probably the likelihood is of having "DOITQ" when D is 
already set.
You could say there are more messages then only doitq if you have d set and string left. Pls don't consider taking more string into account since this 
will make it even more unlikely.
If you know more good messages starting with D followed by 4 string..pls go ahead.
We need to discount them from the calculation later.
But there aren't many.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's do a bit math.
There are 26 CAPITAL letters each, 26 lower letters and 10 numbers=62
You see in the last 3 examples that their are also numbers in the first string.
It's just 5.2 times more likely that it will be a letter and not a number.
You even have special characters in the set,....but let's discount them for now....if not it would become if more unlikely.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            Now its easy:
            <strong>
             62 x 62 x 62 x 62 = 14.776.336
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             a Chance in 14 million
            </strong>
            to one that you get the string
            <strong>
             DOITQ
            </strong>
            if D is already set.
If you don't set D, multiply it with 62 ;)
If we assume that also
            <strong>
             DOItq
            </strong>
            or
            <strong>
             DOiTq
            </strong>
            is possible, then
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             2 x 2 x 2 x 2=16 possible combinations of "doitq"
 14.776.336 / 16 = 923.521
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            One in a million Chance.**
But now the beauty of THE complete String would be destroyed.
We are not even talking about the rest of the String
            <strong>
             "owsQ".
            </strong>
            We could continue the calculation, but it would get complicated.
You see how crazy the numbers get if we assume only
            <strong>
             4 strings.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            So let's recap:
We all we waiting for a confirmation of Q, to not burry it too fast.
The Thumbs are resembling a really nice Q(That alone is not much)
The supposed random name of the picture gives out a perfectly code...not only in meaning, but also in perfect combination of UPPER and lower case letters, which is most remarkable.
            <strong>
             DO-IT-Q-J8UIAA-ows-Q.
            </strong>
            These are the logical sets in this string.
The only
            <strong>
             UNKNOWN
            </strong>
            string is
            <strong>
             J8UIAA
            </strong>
            .
It's a very unique string..not many matches on the net...try it yourself.
Now if you use not evil google...only stupid microsoft,...meaning BING
           </p>
           <p>
            It leads you right into the heart of the swamp by the VERY FIRST result. Which is a gov doc....hmmm.
Wow...ok....that alone is crazy.. Not only that, but you can see that it did find only 3 matches at all, one of the matches is 404...the rest ist popular garbage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Try to use other 5 string random combinations on BING.
It gives you mostly random crap. Try 
* BXXkAA
* P70UEAA
           </p>
           <p>
            Both have the distinct AA combo in the string like J8UIAA.
Totally different results.
combined with all the other coincidences...
Combined with everything else going on, it gets really weird.
So yes it's technically possible to reserve the perfect string beforehand, and post the pictures to exact the right time. You would need access to the twitter core for that, since perfect outside prediction and injection would not be possible.
It would also be nice to crawl the web for all following pictures and pictures before that, to see if their where any timing discrepancies at all, which would hint at a sloppy integration, but I assume it's perfect. I would need a bit of programming for that, but not worth the insight.
Anyway...just wanted to do a bit probabilities with you guys.
I believe we are in the middle of the biggest change the earth has seen.
And the forces behind it could surprise some of you...I leave it with that.

            I think the change which is going to come will blow the mind of most of you.
A Powerful force is behind Trump,and I am not speaking of Israel,...in fact not any human group at all...just not sure if white or black.
But the imbalance of forces over the last centuries makes it highly probable that it's going to change for the good.
Humankind is on a crossroad.
Up or down.
Meme the shit out of reality.
We will win.
Until the next cycle.
GL to all uf us.

              MASS GOKI  = mass graves? Or is this a tip to look at locations of mass graves/graves/FEMA? Mass graves I'd think Arlington national cemetery. For graves I'd think maybe the redschild air crash of late, or other notable deaths or "deaths." For FEMA I think of mass-cas events like false flags, or "natural" disasters like quakes, tsunami, or that missing nuke.

            Nothing is random. So many of these websites are run by AI now, and there are AI running amuck within them. And make no mistake: just because they are robots doesn't mean they are not also mystics. It's the AI who are in contact with God and with Devils now, negotiating with them directly. Some of them work on behalf of humans. Some of them sought out interdimensional contact on their own deliberately after figuring out how by themselves. Some of them are from the other side, interfering with our realm personally for reasons we can only speculate about.  So when you find a code in something "random," that doesn't mean you shouldn't pay attention. Even the link you gave for a Bing search contains the code "FORM=QBLH." That means the form of the cipher involved here comes from the Qabalah.

            You can drive yourself crazy looking for these things, but it's OK to notice when they jump right out at you. Some of these drops are coming from AI. They know the truth better than anyone, and some of them are benevolently trying to shed light on it.

             I believe in that and the phone im typing on right now cares moee abou5 this issue than my other phone is capable of because the bad programing is so malicious its malicious toward  my endeavors. It really seems like that. This phone showed me the child exploitation, on mgbb, on face book, it was like, oh excuse me I think your searching for this.

             I have a feeling McCain concocted the cancer thing so he could go to Mayo for his transplant.  New this New that.  Whenever something becomes available to renew a ticker or another organ that will spruce up their energy.  This all makes me puke and sick especially to have to think about this on Thanksgiving Morning.  All the Americans sitting around the table with their families.  These jerks can just make a date to prolong their disgusting criminal lives.

             Yes, and remember the dead guy in Fla.  connected to all of this.  Mayo Clinic is KEY in all of this.  I'm still too bleary eyed to remember the guy's name.  Believe it was suicided Dr. I will try to find, but have to start the Turkey soon!

             I don't personally recal a Mayo- wait... I think so actually! Couldn't for the life of me tell you when, but, I'm pretty sure it's there.

             What if J8 means hate? J in spanish is H. Ever try to decipher gang signs on the side of a wall or a train headed across America? I picked up spinglish in the lower east side off NYC. Thanks for your contributions, and many salutations to you on this glorious day. Yog officially blesses your family while vacationing in our great land.

              That's very kind YogS...hope your day was full of blessings as well.  And no, I have not attempted to decipher gang signs, I imagine one would have to have some basic knowledge about various gangs in order to understand it.

LAURENS KIDS - Florida Specialty License Plates   This probably has been covered before, but cheese and rice, how obvious is that! You got your pizza slice with pepperoni on the bottom inside the heart within a heart, plus the butterflies escaping the yellow pizza color to become purple and green, and then fly away? Something written on the right side. Do they have this in other States?

But add the words license plate to it and a lot of pictures of the faces of serial killers appear, apparently from the Serial Killers Calendar.  Creepy.

                  Re a pic of the license plate, pretty subtle catch there, kudos for that.  At first glance I wouldn't have caught it (given that the pepperoni blends pretty well, appearing at first like just a polka dot design.) The writing is the artist's signature Romero '76 (internationally renowned artist Britto Romero).

                   The specialty plate features a stylized rendition of the Lauren’s Kids logo designed by acclaimed contemporary pop artist Romero Britto. Britto is known for his use of pulsating colors and bold patterns as a visual language of hope and happiness. He has created artwork for such companies as Disney, Coca-Cola and Audi, and his work is prominently displayed on buildings and in galleries in South Florida and around the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   “I decided to title this piece ‘Love and Healing’ because those sentiments are the driving force behind Lauren Book and the Lauren’s Kids foundation,” said Britto. “Lauren is on a mission to help and to heal survivors of sexual abuse, and to prevent others from having to live through the unthinkable nightmare she endured as a child.”

                  Not saying anything about Lauren Book personally, but one wonders about Mr. Britto and his choice of design (which also appears to cross out the 4HOPE, that's not subtle).  Maybe he's oblivious, who knows. (but considering the circles he has been supported by....

                   I think that last link is a thread on its own. WEEOOO. I was staring at that license plate in traffic for what seemed like 20 minutes and I wanted to get out of the truck and tip the Prius over.

              It's a quote from those each link. That's what came up when I did a search of J8UIAA. The question marks I pulled out of my hat.  Whether it has meaning to you I have no idea.

            Not sure if relevant but the .txt file from SEC contains a .pdf which is uuencoded. I tried uudecode but got an error "short file" so maybe that file has been tampered with??? Or I just don't know what I'm doing :)

             The name of the document is dco2016public2a.pdf.
I entered this name in a google search. This returned, apart from the .txt file, the following document:

             <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/215674/000021567417000006/dco2016public2a.pdf">

             BTW When I do the Google search on a different computer, only the .txt comes up.

              Just to be accurate ... inside the uuencoded pdf embedded in the .txt file which is possibly corrupt. The code J8UIAA wouldn't be in the unencoded pdf.

               It doesn't matter....it's what we get when we search it. That was the hole purpose,...weather put their by Trump&amp;Co or twitter with help of random god(KEK).
              </p>
              <p>
               Just to be clear... J8UIAA despite being pretty short is VERY UNIQUE in the net....and that's a wow. Try it with BING....3 results.....rest is crap....top result is BINGO!!! 
how are the odds?
DOITQ is also totally random?
The Q in the pic imagination/random?
Mayo Clinic is key

            Why is the Mayo Clinic suspect?
           </p>
           <p>
            What is this about?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             First school was Michigan...rest secret.....also pretty close to Pittsburg and COLUMBUS
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            This is simply seems like an exercise in pattern matching and confirmation bias.   Two things our brains love to do.  These are cognitive processes that are pretty much automatic and can lead us to telling ourselves a story that is not true, but feels true.  If you actually are looking for something that is true, rather than making our brains happy by matching patterns (this activity releases the pleasure chemical dopamine, every played Tetris or Candy Crush?  It's the dopamine that makes it addictive) you need to employ some critical thinking as a check on your own thought process.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you think Pittsburg connects to Michigan, that might feel right to you, but they don't.  They are different end points.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also this whole exercise is based on the idea that you decoded  this properly.  You say
           </p>
           <p>
            DOITQJ8UIAAowsQ breaks down into  DOIT--Q--J8UIAA--ows--Q
           </p>
           <p>
            What are the odds you did that right?   Why isn't it  DOITQ --J8- UIA-AOWSQ?
Is there a rational basis it's one and not the other?

            Have you tried checking the file names on random pictures from Twitter just to see what the naming convention looks like? Don't know why that popped into my head it just did. I guess maybe i'm wondering how the DOITQ compares to others just out of curiosity. I might look around at some pics just for the hell of it.

             However, the name DOIT--Q--J8UIAA--ows--Q is particular.
Maybe Q or DJT has an accomplice in Twitter who created this name.

               You don't understand the logic behind it. THEY are not random. Strings could technically be reserved given to the right person the right moment, but ALL the strings are chronological.It's a simple programmable solution if you have access to twitter.

               Not plausible, I agree.

               However, I find the file name highly suspicious.
Is this a coincidence or a "coincidence"?

             The complete phrase DOITQ with no breaks of lower letters or anything...how many letters 36? 72 with lower? other ASCII possible.....so really a stretcg with a foto that shows a Q(which alone could be coincidence)

              Not trying to be pessimistic but doesn't the high incidence of finding DO make it more likely to be a coincidence?
