Associate Justice Ginsburg was sworn in in1993 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg)</a>).  
</p>
<p>In 1977, while serving as General Counsel for the ACLU, she co-authored a book which advocates lowering the age of consent to 12, which would result in legalizing pedophilia and sex trafficking for victims 12 and over and eliminating states\' statutory rape laws for victims 12 and over, and also for legalizing prostitution. </p>
<p>From the article (link below):  <strong><strong>Age of consent</strong></strong> refers to the legally defined age at which a person is no longer required to obtain parental consent to get married. It also refers to the age at which a person is held to have the capacity to voluntarily agree to sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse with a person under the age of consent may lead to criminal charges of statutory rape or sexual assault . . . .</p>
<p><strong><strong>Statutory rape</strong></strong> is sex between an adult and a minor below the age of consent. Every state has a statutory rape law in some form. <strong><strong>The age of consent varies from state to state, but is generally from 16 – 18 years of age. . . . Consent of the victim and belief that the victim is of the age of consent are usually considered immaterial.</strong></strong></p>
<p>A <strong><strong>pedophile</strong></strong> is an adult with “sexual fondness for and activity” with children, i.e., minors below the age of consent. <strong><strong>Pedophilia</strong></strong> is legally defined as sexual child abuse, i.e., any sexual activity with a minor below the age of consent, which includes fondling a child’s genitals, intercourse, incest, rape, sodomy, exhibitionism, and commercial exploitation of children through prostitution or the production of pornographic materials.</p>
<p>Since the age of consent in the United States, which varies from state to state, is from 16 to 18, lowering the age of consent to 12 would legalize pedophilia of children age 12 and above.</p>
<p>That is exactly what Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Clinton appointee and daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants, recommends in a co-authored book that led to sweeping changes made by the federal government in the name of sex equality.</p>
<p>In 1977 when Ginsburg was General Counsel of the ACLU, she co-authored (with Brenda Feigen-Fasteau) <strong>Sex Bias in the U.S. Code: A Report of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights,</strong> which was published by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in April 1977, for which Ginsburg and Feigen-Fasteau were paid with federal funds under Contract No. CR3AK010.</p>
<p>Ginsburg wrote on p. 102 of <strong>Sex Bias in the U.S. Code:</strong>  Eliminate the phrase ‘carnal knowledge of any female, not his wife, who has not attained the age of 16 years’ and substitute a federal, sex-neutral definition of the offense . . . . <strong><strong>A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person, . . . [and] the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old.</strong></strong></p>
<p>Ginsburg (and her co-author) also recommends that the Mann Act be repealed. <strong><strong>The Mann Act is a federal law passed in 1910 which makes it a felony to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of “any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose”.</strong></strong></p>
<p>MY NOTE: In the book, Ginsburg and her co-author also advocate for:</p>
<pre><code>* Legalization of prostitution.
* Sex integration of prisons, reformatories, schools and colleges and their activities (including sports), all-girls and all-boys organizations, and fraternities and sororities.
* Changing the names of the Boy Scouts, Girls Scouts and Big Brothers of America to reflect sex integration.
* Elimination of the traditional family concept of husband as breadwinner and wife as homemaker.
* Comprehensive government child-care.

             It wouldn't be inappropriate to call for mass prayer for her natural death. Jesus called for drowning by rope tied to millstone and thrown into the sea for individuals who merely cause children to stumble. And we're talking about things going way beyond that and people in authority who sanction the harm.

            She also calls for ending polygamy laws in that book. That book was all she was known for and if you put it all together, she was advocating for adults to have a concubine of 12 year old kids, including same sex.
