  'creationDate' => '2017-02-17 00:47:47',

  'formattedContent' => '<p>There are some videos going around lately in which a voice being compared to John Podesta\'s can be heard yelling at a child in what looks like a shower: <a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/fatherhood.webm">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/fatherhood.webm</a>, <a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/each.mp4">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/each.mp4</a></p>
<p>The website these videos come from is <a href="http://worldcorpo.net">http://worldcorpo.net</a>, owned by a supposed organization called &quot;Worldcorp Enterprises&quot;. Looking at the other videos on the site, you can see that there is a man present in many of them, but he does not look like John Podesta. He can be seen performing strange sexual and morbid acts such as sticking lit matches into his penis, (<a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/matchhead.webm">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/matchhead.webm</a> NSFW), urinating into a toilet and drinking it, (<a href="http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/piss.webm">http://worldcorpo.net/content/video/piss.webm</a> NSFW), and the like.</p>
<p>After a bit of searching, I believe this man is almost undeniably Gary Lee Munroe Barney, who claims to be the CEO of Worldcorp Enterprises in multiple posts on this website here: <a href="http://thespiritguides.ning.com/profile/GaryLeeMunroeBarneyHolySage">http://thespiritguides.ning.com/profile/GaryLeeMunroeBarneyHolySage</a>. If you click the link you\'ll also notice that he has ties to spiritual practices and traditions. According to another post regarding this man, he is also the head of the Universal Life Church, or UCL, (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1646770">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1646770)</a>), founded by Kirby Hensley, which is currently being accused of being a front for occultists, ritualists, and just sick people in general. Munroe also has a Tumblr page, where it is seen that he has easy access to children of all ages, including working for UNICEF at one point, (<a href="http://holysagemunroe.tumblr.com">http://holysagemunroe.tumblr.com)</a>). Something interesting to note is that there is a link at the top of his Tumblr page linking to a Facebook account, though from most of the pictures seen, it doesn\'t seem to be his account, but rather that of a young adult male. However, that does not completely dissociate this boy from Munroe. After a bit of scrolling through the profile, there is a picture that I am almost sure includes Munroe: <a href="http://prntscr.com/e9pk9e">http://prntscr.com/e9pk9e</a></p>
<p>I\'m not sure who the boy is in relation to Munroe yet, perhaps a student of the church, a relative, or maybe even a friend(?) It may or may not also be important to note that there are videos on the Facebook page of this same boy jumping onto a pool bare naked with whoever is recording the video whistling casually in the background.</p>
<p>That aside, it was stated by someone on Reddit\'s <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald">r/The_Donald</a> recently that Munroe is also a part of one of the organizations with ties to the Clinton Foundation, though stupid me forgot to save the post and I have no way to confirm this, so take it as an unverified claim</p>
<p>Regarding Podesta now, one thing I happened to notice while watching the videos on Worldcorp\'s website was that there is a shot in one of the music videos, Malarkey, where the back of a man\'s head can be seen while he is sitting on a bench. This man looks strikingly similar to John Podesta--skin tone, suit, glasses, ear shape, hairline, hair color... Here is a still frame from the Worldcorp music video of the unidentified man: <a href="http://prntscr.com/e9pxhb">http://prntscr.com/e9pxhb</a></p>
<p>Now compare this to pictures of Podesta from different angles: <a href="http://prntscr.com/e9pxq2">http://prntscr.com/e9pxq2</a>, <a href="http://prntscr.com/e9py56">http://prntscr.com/e9py56</a>, <a href="http://prntscr.com/e9pyqc">http://prntscr.com/e9pyqc</a>, <a href="http://prntscr.com/e9pywj">http://prntscr.com/e9pywj</a></p>
<p>I\'m not sure if the two men are the same, but until someone is able to prove or debunk it, I think it may definitely be something to keep in mind until further notice. If it does turn out to be him, then I would take that as irrefutable evidence that Podesta is into some sick child\'s play, literally. This is, of course, on top of the other mountains of indicators that Podesta is involved in this scandal, such as the police sketches, paintings at the residence, toys, Tony Podesta\'s statue, their involvement with previously-convicted pedophiles, and, of course, Spirit Cooking, which, like Munroe\'s own interests include, unnerving, abstract spiritual rituals. Go figure.</p>
<p>I dunno what to make of all this, I\'m honestly overwhelmed right now, so I\'ll let you guys decide. Keep in mind that even if Podesta has nothing to do with what\'s being discussed here, there is something seriously up with this Munroe guy and I feel he is a danger to the children with which he interacts. Anyway, feel free to correct any mistakes I may have made in constructing this post, definitely add any information I am missing here, whether it supports or disproves what I\'ve composed here, etc.</p>
