            16 year old bullshit. I believe what I said though bro. You the only man in the house with any real damn brains. Its a fact and a burden for you bro. You the big brain in the house. Thats what you get for being smart and diplomatic. I am also wasting wasting minutes because I don't want to clean these fish. But, we gonna eat em tonight, so I gotta clean em. If I stall long enough my buddies will have em all cleaned and I won't have to do it. Best plans!!! :)

             You and your buddies have an upvote brigade.  You all made that public announcement so your high upvote counts wouldn't be suspicious, but real users of this subverse don't actually upvote or like any of you.  The only upvotes you get are the few

              You need to give control of the sub to somebody that understands pizzagate and gives a shit. You have told us a hundered times how much you don't give a shit. I have no idea what you consider your role in this sub really is beyong "i don't give a fuck" because that is your main message. Pathetic. Do better. Pick yourself up. Give a shit. Do something better for the sub.

             <hr/>
             <p>
              I don't want the sub. You couldn't give it to me because I wouldn't take it. But you need to give it to somebody THAT DOES GIVE A SHIT because a lot of people are sick and fucking tired of hearing you say how much "you don't care."
             </p>
             <hr/>
             <p>
              Do you have any idea how pathetic that is? No, you don't, but you should consider alternatives. I think you would be happier than, well, maybe even DUCK SHIT. if you just got rid of the sub. No joke. It might be time.

                   What the fuck kind of question is this?  Colloquially, all those words can mean the same thing.  Is this what passes for deep thinking in that pedophile Jew skull of yours?

If they did delete his youtube channel I will pay the subscription fee and give you the password so that you can watch the rest of his videos because I realize how smart you are.

            I love the term "pizzagate". It's memorable and cringey. The contrast between what it uncovered -- Podesta emails, Podesta art collection, Alefantis Instagram horrors, Silsby, Dyncorp, Brock, NGOs -- and the MSM use of the term is incredibily eye opening when presented to normies. We are the turd they can't wipe off of their shoe. We are infamous. There is no such thing as bad publicity.

              I never saw conclusive evidence it was anything other than Alefantis. People think he looks like the Rothschilde lady, and there was a pic showing him in a family photo which I believe was debunked due to ages and dates.

             I admit that when the term 'pedogate' was brought up the first time, I thought it would maybe be better to use it.

             But after almost two years into Pizzagate, I totally appreciate the term.

             There is absolutely such a thing as bad publicity, when it programs newcomers to dismiss ideas entirely.
Think of all the ignorance and ridiculousness we associate with the term 'Flat Earth'
             <em>
              Then
             </em>
             , imagine if you'd never heard any of the "if the world is round why don't we fall off the
             <em>
              bottom
             </em>
             , HUH!?" Idiocy they disseminate consistently, and were just asked to entertain the thought that NASA and ((TPTB)) might be lying to us; not only is it entirely possible but, at least as far as first-hand knowledge and observation goes, it's at least worth considering.
            </p>
            <p>
             Straw men arguments WORK! 90% of Americans think we're all here discussing "Hillary, George Soros and other Democrats trafficking kids out of CPP's nonexistent basement".  They are MUCH more difficult to
             <em>
              'red-pill'
             </em>
             as a result, and many will dismiss
             <em>
              any
             </em>
             evidence IMMEDIATELY as a result.

              Nope. I have redpilled almost everyone I know, simply by pointing out the disparity between what we uncovered, how we uncovered it and the way the MSM and Dems reacted. That simple dichotomy completely destroyed any mention they'd ever heard of it.

               I was pointing out that 99% of flat Earth "discussion" and"proofs" are borderline retarded bullshit, actually, and hardly comparing the two except in the one aspect that both are prolifically shilled with weak, easily debunked arguments that cause the entire subject to be dismissed rather than intelligently discussed, actually.

               Your scepticism is fair and generally warranted, but you misunderstood me here; I'm not an idiot (things idiots say for $400) and I'm on truth's side, which I would hope mean I'm on your side.

            What senator did Anthony Weiner page with? Was it chuck Schumer? Who was involved with page gate?

             I think you are correct about Schumer.  I read on here that he roomed with Schumer.  Schumer is a member of the Knights of Pythias. I believe Weiner is too plus many others.

            I will continue to call it "Pizzagate" and i think all should too.  "Pizza" is the blatant code word used repeatedly in the the Podesta emails.  The symbolism in countless pop culture material also point to "pizza" and the blurring of lines between the food pizza,  general sexuality, and children.  It started as "Pizzagate" because that what US,  the organic internet researchers, deemed fit.  We started this investigation calling it "Pizzagate" and we will END this investigation calling it "Pizzagate".

             TOTALLY AGREE!
Then, a new poster, PIZZAGATE LAWYER tried to woo us down the road to "namechange".
            </p>
            <p>
             A big reason NOT TO is that original posts on the subject used the term "pizzagate". If no one knows to use that term in a search engine ALL THE ORIGINAL RESEARCH IS HIDDEN.

             For some sick reason they are kicked upstairs for their horrible things they do to children.  Sacrificing to Moloch and all that crap they believe in.   It's the Luciferian religion.  SICKOS all of them.

               I hope so.......I don;t have any sympathy whatsoever for any of them.  I don't care what their back story is.  I am a reasonable person, but not where they are concerned.  I have read way too much about what evil they have brought to this world.  It can't come soon enough.

            "Pedogate" is the world-wide horror show, the general, wide-reaching, ever-present pedo activity at high levels. "Pizzagate" is very specific to one 'operation' if you can call it that. The labels they attach to these things don't mean much to me, but this thing that we've been looking into centred on DC is, in my eyes at least, "Pizzagate", and to stop using that label would be to bend to those very propaganda campaigns spoken of here.

              It does not take a genius or historian to know that the government’s first move in trying to control anything is to infiltrate and lead it. As was seen in the Occupy movement, and many others, that were no doubt filled with genuine individuals, yet was led into irrelevance, from the top, by the FBI.

              As this investigation moves forward we must be cognizant of the very real danger this potential infiltration may pose, and likely already does. We must stay focused on the true culprits and not on the surrounding distractions and created in-fighting that is designed to pit a movement against itself, thereby proving that the movement was never serious to begin with, hence, cannot be trusted.

            Ding Ding Ding. Qanon anybody? Probably 99% of the Q posts are not pizzagate related but SOMEHOW Q is magically inherently related to pizzagate? Not its not. Q has slowly and carefully morphed into a mainstream news parrot and not much more.

           <hr/>
           <p>
            We all know that anything that comes from the mainstream news is coming from the CIA, both FOX and CNN. So why would smart redpilled people waste their brain cells on it?

           <p>
            Pizzagate became a big thing because we created OUR OWN NARRATIVE. We didn't follow, we led, and they couldn't stop us or control us. That unique property of creating our own narrative is in jeopardy if we let this sub be led by Q and the mainstream news narrative.

             I recently revisited a cache of Jimmy Comet Instagrams and a now famous one beckoned me for a closer look. It is the Instagram presumably taken by J. Alefantis and is a picture of David Brock (his then boyfriend) and Lynn de Rothschild in her D.C. apartment. THESE THREE WERE KEY PLAYERS. I happened to notice that the Instagram included the location: RIVER HOUSE (New York). Curious, I did some research on it. This article is the info jackpot!
            </p>
            <p>
             "Great Houses of New York: River House, the Best Address, Part IV"
            </p>
            <p>
             "With a long history of welcoming the socially eminent, River House’s co-op board is now extremely selective, using quite different criteria. Once, a few millions and a place in the Social Register were adequate credentials for most who aspired to live here and join ‘the club’. But today, maintains Corcoran Group broker Ellen Kourtides, “one needs strong financials for this sort of building,” explaining, in upper-class code, that its residents place a high premium on ‘privacy’. “We’re talking about liquid assets. It can be as much as four to six times the price of the apartment. If financing is allowed, it’s not because you need to finance your apartment to move in, it’s for tax purposes.”
            </p>
            <p>
             "Why had Gloria Vanderbilt-DeCicco-Stokowski-Lumet-Cooper further risked the opprobrium of her peers in pursuit of a flat? Ultimately the answer seems to be sentiment. Inasmuch as several of her near relations lived here and many more belonged to the River Club, she had been in and out of its revolving door from the time the building opened. Indeed, for several extended periods before her first marriage, and even afterward, she lived here in the tower suite of her cousin, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney."
            </p>

             "Henry and Nancy Kissinger live here, so do Sir Evelyn de Rothschild and his wife, the blonde American financier, in an apartment designed by the decorator chosen by the Obamas, Michael Smith."

                 <p>
                  HSUS raises millions of dollars from American animal lovers through manipulative advertising. An analysis of HSUS’s TV fundraising determined that more than 85 percent of the animals shown were cats and dogs. However, HSUS doesn’t run a single pet shelter and only gives 1 percent of the money it raises to pet shelters while sucking money out of local communities.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  HSUS puts more into its pension plan and Caribbean hedge funds than it gives to pet shelters. Between 2012 and 2014, HSUS put over $50 million in Caribbean investments while also putting nearly $10 million into its pension plan.
                 </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                 <p>
                  HSUS executives have been accused of sexual harassment. In Feb. 2018, HSUS CEO Wayne Pacelle resigned after credible accusations that he had sexually preyed on staff members. His deputy, vice president Paul Shapiro, resigned the previous month after also being accused of sexual harassment. HSUS board member Erika Brunson shockingly blew off the allegations against Pacelle, telling the Washington Post, “We didn’t hire him to be a choir boy.”

So why don't you just go back to your creepy corner and leave us alone instead interfering? Obviously you went through my comment history attempting to stir up shit. Not surprising. Whats wrong? You drunk today or what? Why don't you just leave us the fuck alone.

                      just came to the completely stupid, self-centered, narcissistic, emo-woman conclusion that if she wasn't around the rest of you wouldn't be getting attacked.  Kek.

               A bit of both, but to answer your underlying question, I am in in no way credible and you should assume as with anyone else that I'm more likely a shill than what only I know myself to be:
(TL;DR) A longtime lurker and for the most part someone who's not seen any reason to interject in the conversation, since I rarely have anything to contribute.
              </p>
              <p>
               I'm only joining the conversation now because it dawned on me that the same is true for probably 99% of us that care &amp; are paying attention to this stuff, and I've noticed more and more lately that that thinking makes for a conversation involving mostly shills and people with alterior motives, and that if we don't participate we can't really even be mad that the majority of what we read is idiotic partisan bullshit at best and straight-up propaganda and disinformation at worst.

              Tony Podesta was and is a close friend still of Denny H.  They went to a Japanese Island together decades ago.  There was a letter one time that someone wrote about their trip there.  It must have been a fun time for all.  I believe the letter has been scrubbed.  I listed it one time on here.  If someone knows the name of the Island, please include here.  I am racking my brain but can't remember.  Whoa.  Just found this thread about it.
