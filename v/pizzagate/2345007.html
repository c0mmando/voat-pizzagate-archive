            Well folks the lengthy title pretty much says most of it. The rabbit hole awaits those brave enough to read the New Science mag article and then use any reasonably capable search engine to check out the back trail and Bio of the shrinks and spooks mentioned in it. This fascinating article is from the prestigious New Scientist Magazine edition of Dec 28, 1961, but covers events and deeds all the way back to 1941.
Basically the linked article disproves the bullshit debunking efforts from anti-pizzagate shills and enablers that adrenochrome is some sort of mythological urban legend stemming from the film “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” and has no real existence as a psychotropic drug that is actually administered to humans. 
Secondarily the link is pertinent to pizzagate because it establishes incontrovertible links between the pioneer developers of adrenochrome (as a psychotropic drug) and known  MK Ultra psychiatric researchers as early as 1952. In particular I refer to Dr Humphry Osmond (the article's author) and his sidekick Abram Hoffer.
It has been submitted and documented elsewhere on VOAT that there is credible evidence and  probability that adrenochrome is being manufactured from the blood and/or adrenals  of children who have been purposefully terrorized and tortured to death in order to increase blood serum levels of the adrenaline metabolite known as adrenochrome (which is a psychoactive drug in its own right.)

            The relevance of this material to PizzaGate ( and / or Pedogate) is rather extremely extensive :
1. It proves, in the most absolute documentary sense possible,  that the drug adrenochrome is not an urban legend or myth, but is in fact a psychiatric pharmaceutical substance designed to alter mental states in humans. And that it has been used for those purposes since at least 1952. Specifically, Osmond  claims that it produces prolonged psychosis-like states of profound indifference resembling psychopathy.
2. The article's author ,  Dr. Humphry Osmond , acknowledges and documents himself as a pioneer in the research and use of adrenochrome in human subjects for psycho pharmaceutical purposes.
3. He names  collaborators (e.g. Abram Hoffer) and institutional locations frequent references to contemporary studies of Mescaline and LSD-25, which we now know (with historical perspective) to be part of several MK Ultra and related programs.
