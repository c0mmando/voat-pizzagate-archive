             Khashoggi's involvement with the Mossad is the reason for his falling out with Al Fayed. Of course the Mossad had a Hebrew speaking, coke snorting, strip club attending Atta for their 9/11 operation (not the Mohammed Atta who was alive and well, whose passport was stolen). the CIA/Mossad had a strong presence in Venice Beach.

             Side note: all the TV vids that supposedly were of planes, came directly from the MIT Media Lab. The live vids only showed the explosions and demolition.
            </p>
            <p>
             Khashoggi was 81, so it is not impossible he died of natural causes.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             “But people do die over this sort of stuff. There were billions of dollars – literally billions of dollars – behind Hillary Clinton’s election campaign and those people have lost their money.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You have also to remember that there’s a big financial interest – particularly in the armaments industry – in a bad American relationship with Russia and the worse the relationship with Russia is the larger contracts the armaments industry can expect especially in the most high-tech high-profit side of fighter jets and missiles and that kind of thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             “And Trump has actually already indicated he’s looking to make savings on the defense budget particularly in things like fighter [jet] projects. So, there are people standing to lose billions of dollars and anybody who thinks in that situation bad things don’t happen to people is very naïve.”

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Laura Biancolini began traveling on Khashoggi’s yacht,
             <strong>
              along with what is known in some circles as a bevy of lovelies, at the age of seventeen
             </strong>
             . She converted to Islam, changed her name to Lamia, and became Khashoggi’s second wife before giving birth to her only child and Adnan’s fifth son, Ali, now nine, in West Palm Beach, Florida. Marriage to a man like Adnan Khashoggi cannot have been easy for either of his wives. Women for hire were part and parcel of his everyday life, and
             <strong>
              he often sent girls as gifts to men with whom he was attempting to do business
             </strong>
             . “They lend beauty and fragrance to the surroundings,” he has been quoted as saying.
            </p>
            <p>
             Everywhere, I heard people say, “If Khashoggi tells what he knows, there will be enormous embarrassment in Washington.” The reference was not to the charges pending against Khashoggi in the matter of Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos. It had to do with Iranscam. Roy Boston, a wealthy developer in Marbella and a great friend of Khashoggi’s, said, “I can’t imagine that the Americans really want him back in the United States. It would be a mistake. The president and the former president would be smeared. And the same with the King of Saudi Arabia. Adnan would never say one word against the king. But the Americans? Why should he keep quiet? If he really starts talking, good gracious me, there will be red faces around the world.”

The art treasures were first hidden on his yacht and then moved to his penthouse in Cannes. The penthouse was raided by the French police in a search for the pictures in April 1987, but it is believed that Khashoggi had been tipped off. He turned over nine of the paintings to the police, claiming to have sold the others to a Panamanian company, but investigators believe that he sold the pictures back to himself. The rest of the loot is thought to be in Athens.

            <p>
             MPTP itself is not toxic, and as a lipophilic compound can cross the blood–brain barrier. Once inside the brain, MPTP is metabolized into the toxic cation 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) by the enzyme MAO-B of glial cells. MPP+ kills primarily dopamine-producing neurons in a part of the brain called the pars compacta of the substantia nigra. MPP+ interferes with complex I of the electron transport chain, a component of mitochondrial metabolism, which leads to cell death and causes the buildup of free radicals, toxic molecules that contribute further to cell destruction.

            <p>
             Shaheen was the youngest of nine brothers and sisters. His parents emigrated to the United States during the Great Depression. When he was three years old, his father died, leaving his mother, who could not speak, read, or write English, to care for the family of nine children. For his part, he began selling newspapers at a corner movie theater at the age of six. He earned a degree in Political Science from Mount Union College in 1955. After serving in the US Army as a Classification and Assignment Specialist, he began graduate studies at Georgetown University. Shaheen is known as a polyglot.[1] While at Georgetown, he was recruited[citation needed] by the United States government in 1960 to move to Saudi Arabia.[citation needed] After serving in that capacity[citation needed] for two years, and during that period, he met Khashoggi.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1962, he began working as a high-ranking official to Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian businessman.[2] Shaheen spent the next 25 years with Khashoggi, establishing close personal relationships with the Saudi royal family and other Middle Eastern leaders and businessmen. Shaheen was president of Khashoggi's Triad Corporation.[3] Khashoggi was commissioned by the late King Saud to help organize the Ministry of Defense protect their oil fields.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Mr. Khashoggi attended Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt, a traditional training ground for the Middle Eastern elite, where pupils were caned for using any language other than English. Afterward, he enrolled at what was then Chico State College in California. Barely a year after arriving at Chico State, at 21, he brokered his first major deal, the sale of $3 million worth of trucks to Egypt. His commission was $150,000. He never returned for his college degree.
