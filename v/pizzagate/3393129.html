<p>From the red carpet to the runway, TEMPTU has created showstopping looks for some of the most iconic faces in fashion, music, and film. Now, we’re bringing the flawless finish loved by makeup artists and image makers to you.</p>
<p>Our breakthrough formula first turned heads in 1981’s cult classic film Tattoo, where we introduced our original TEMPTU paint formula and tattoo ink transfer. It became an overnight success with Hollywood makeup professionals and soon our body paints and cosmetics were in high demand. In 1996, we revolutionized the pro cosmetics industry with the introduction of our airbrush foundation. The unparalleled flawless finish of TEMPTU’s formulas has made our brand an industry go-to for decades.</p>

<p>in 2017, a twitter user posted an ad for Mark\'s yacht rental (which listed a partial resume)</p>

<p>Paint-on tattoos Tired of just plain old skin? You can color your world with Temptu tattoos, paint-on tattoos which are applied in minutes. They can last for days, even through swimming and showering, or be removed instantly with ordinary rubbing alcohol. Ingre- dients are safe and non-toxic, says the manufacturer, Temptu Marketing, which distributes do-it-yourself and professional kits. The tattoos are available for plus postage from Somachrome Inc., 1225 Broadway, Penthouse 3 New York, N.Y. 10001.</p>

            What is the purpose of a mirror? to take away your thought of inner self and BUILD a higher thought of your outer apperance.....as an actor. What is the purpose of  TV exactly the same, pictures you dont make up are given to you, the opposite to read. It is easy to shape you without a own build thought in imagery.  So who are you in reality? A mountain of pictures.....Bilderberg.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In 1957 Paul Kohnstamm, a member of the fourth generation founding family, was president.  By 1959 H. Kohnstamm products were widely used in soaps, foods, cosmetics, plastics, and medicines.   The company had plants in Clearing , Illinois (near Chicago) and New Jersey (Camden, Kearney and Newark) in addition to Brooklyn.  The Newark facility was the former General Color Company plant.
            </p>
            <p>
             The company experienced a setback in 1976 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned Red No. 2, a food dye in use for 68 years. This was the most heavily used food dye in the U.S. with applications in hundreds of products such as soft drinks, candy, ice cream and cosmetics.  The FDA said a rat feeding study suggested that Red No. 2 was a weak cancer-causing agent.
            </p>
            <p>
             The company had an alliance with Benzenoid Organics in Bellingham, Massachusetts, likely for the supply of dye intermediates.  There was also a manufacturing facility in Montreal and an affiliate company in the United Kingdom in the 1980s-1990s.  Paul Kohnstamm continued his interest in the UK company under the directorship of Timothy Hicks.  For years, Victor Kohnstamm ran an offshoot of the company in Mexico known as H. Kohnstamm de Mexico.
            </p>
            <p>
             H. Kohnstamm &amp; Co. was acquired in 1988 by Sensient Technologies Corporation and the Brooklyn plant was subsequently shutdown.  Just before his retirement in 1991, Dr. Samuel Zuckerman, longtime head of research, received permission from the company to work with Joseph E. Levine and his makeup artists on the new film "Tattoo" starring Bruce Dern and Maude Adams.  Dr. Zuckerman continued to refine the unique body-art formula invented for paint-on temporary tattoos with his son Roy Zuckerman, who founded Temptu, which exists today.  Temptu has provided memorable, temporary, FDA-safe tattoos for "Cape Fear", "The Sopranos", fashion shows, etc.

            Sara Schwieder Inquirer Stan Writer Perhaps you'd like a tattoo of violet snakes curling around your neck? How about a red rose planted on your bicep? "Mom" written across your heart? Fire-breathing dragons cavorting across your diaphragm? All possible, and, better yet, all painless. And highly realistic. If you want to make a spectacle of yourself with a tattoo but don't want to suffer, technology has come to your rescue. A new kit, called "Temptu," has been developed by a New York City company that produces a fake tattoo that looks real. The designs are virtually identical to real tattoos, but the wearer does not have to keep these designs forever. They are created not with dye inserted under the skin by needles, but with color painted on with a brush. The fake tattoos - disappear after a few washings or with a swab of alcohol. Although the tattoo has lost none of its mystical power, it no longer has to represent a lifetime commitment. "I think the fake ones look real-er than the real ones," said Betsy Green, manager of Skinz New Wave clothing store, 331 South St. She sported a fake tattoo of a sizzling pink flower nestled below her right collarbone with a coiled, blue-green snake splashed across to her left shoulder. The store not only sells but demonstrates the product. "A lot of people have always wanted tattoos but were too scared to do it," she said, displaying a real tattoo a red heart on her wrist. "Real ones hurt so badly; they're done with needles and they really, really hurt. So these arc nice." Said she: "You can just use your imagination, and use any color you want, and just paint it in. Some people can paint in freehand. If you're the slightest bit artistic, you can. The response has been terrific." There are other types of artificial tattoos, like the wet-and-press version used as a children's plaything, or the type put on with a ballpoint pen. But the idea for the Temptu tattoos originated during the filming of the recently released movie Tattoo, which fea- Philadelphia Inqurw JOHN PAUL FILO Betsy Green displays her fake tattoo, while Dempsey shows off the real thing Jim and Jimmy Dempsey Getting look at son's fake tattoo The tattoos depict a pirate, several women, an Oriental scene, flames, a spider web, a dragon, an eagle and flowers, among other things. The tattoos cover both his arms and part of his legs. "Some people collect coins, some collect stamps, I like tattoos," explained the Philadelphia truck driver. So what did the hard-core real-tattoo lover think of those who were not so brave? "I don't put fake ones down, but it's not something you have to live with. It's a style. I guess it's all right," Dempsey said. In fact, he brought his son, Jimmy, 9, to get a "Temptu" fake tattoo for his birthday. The boy chose a design of flames, done in orange, red, yel' low, blue and black, and asked that it be painted on his tures actors with intricate tattoos all over their bodies. Because the tattoos called for in the movie were so complex, it would have taken hours to paint them on each day with ordinary makeup. Film producer Joseph E. Levine wanted designs that would retain their colors, but that could be easily removed. So he asked Dr. Samuel Zuckerman, a cosmetic chemist, to come up with somethings table. "He came to Dr. Zuckerman to solve a technical problem, which was how to get paints to stay on the body for a few days of shooting under hot lights, and with physical contact, so they didn't have to make up each day," said Roy Zuckerman, the chemist's son and a partner in Somachrome, the New York manufacturer of the fake tattoo kits. Bruce Harman, 23, an artist who is demonstrating the "Temptu" kits at Skinz, obliged. Each Friday night, he draws on fake tattoos, costing from $5 to $100, in the display window at the South Street store, attracting fascinated crowds. As Harman produced the design, Jimmy sat shivering behind the window glass, his white chest suddenly blooming with color. The crowd laughed when the red went on, and smiled encouragement to Jimmy. When it was finished, he looked at it in a mirror, a little scared, it seemed, of its instant magic. And what was the verdict? He paused a long time, looking. Finally, he seemed to have made up his mind. "It's neat," he pronounced. And the crowd clapped its agreement. "We took a technology which was done for the movie, and brought it to the point where people could buy it and do it themselves at home. Out of a theatrical need came a product," he said. The $19.95 kits are selling well here and throughout the country, especially in California, the younger Zuckerman said. The first kits came out in September, and 10,000 of them have been sold so far, he said. The kits include six colors, a brush, a brush cleaner, setting talc and designs on paper that can be traced onto the skin for those . whose artistic abilities are lacking. The kits are recommended for people 1 1 years or older.

             Wonder if criminals ever figured out that they could use these to commit crimes, and then be cleared because they did not have said tattoo when caught? Pretty sure some similar compound made it's way into dandruff shampoo. My room mate splashed that stuff all over the shower and it stained the grout and caulk permanently.

               Or use it on the kid. Well known fact that the Triad always tattooed their slaves on the back or side of the neck. I was dismayed at this becoming a trend for tattoo enthusiasts in the 90's to do the exact same thing. I doubt any of them even know what the characters mean, but they still wear them to this day. I asked one of the students in my school to write my name in Mandarin character. I wonder still what he called me, as he was a clever, mischievous child.. His dad owned a import company in Houston. If you ever see a bag of fried small octopus tentacles that look like pork rinds, or chicharrones, and wonder what they taste like, they taste kind of fishy. I would eat them again though.
