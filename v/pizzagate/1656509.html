            The majority are just brainwashed by identity politics man and are not PAID shills. But your right there are going to indeed be some of them as well. However, I would imagine even most paid shills think pizzagate is indeed fake just another smear campaign by the right. I mean hell man most of those people won't even know who Vince Foster WAS...Let alone take a look at that guys "suicide" or his bullshit nothign of an investigation into his death.
           </p>
           <p>
            You would be suprised by the ability of indentity politics man..its like religion. It gets to a point people will ignore facts instead opting for faith. It's how they define themselves its how they deal with this very complex and confusing and sometimes scary thing called life. They just can't handle it. Some folks turn to religion some turn to a movement and go for it no matter what.

            Guys I am sickened, this fucking
            <em>
             triggered
            </em>
            me to feel what I would ascribe to "the rage that SJW's display during protest"
           </p>
           <p>
            This is definitely the shit you experience in a fraternity and/or secret organizations. You out there who have gone through it, know what I mean.
           </p>
           <p>
            They degrade you and dehumanize you psychologically, for my experience it was a ritual we called it Line-up on brotherhood night. After you are humiliated in front of your peers, they pull you into solitary and berate you mentally and physically to the point of humiliation and submission, they. break. you. down, period. I left and refused to be associated, truth be told I only saw the very tip of the iceberg guys...
           </p>
           <p>
            I am afraid this kind of shit is very real in the adult world... generations have allowed it to be desensitized.
           </p>
           <p>
            Breaking one down, building them back up is a psychological tactic run rampant in our society, i.e. military, and or other secret fraternal organizations.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just really, really didn't even realize how REAL this was for the innocent victims of this heinous arena. The fact that
            <em>
             these
            </em>
            were the tactics at play, The same tactics I've seen heard and felt. These tactics... should NEVER, NEVER, NEVER be used on a fucking child man... my soul fucking aches.

             I believe it's John Podesta because in the video "Each" he sings "I'm John Podesta". When the kid is asked "what's my name" the kid responds with John.

           <p>
            Please refer to the original video and please be clever enough to notice that the original video does not even resemble the one currently being shopped. This video says JOHN because they altered it. Tired of explaining the troll here.

            I've listened to this a bunch now.  When he starts to sing what kind of sounds like "I'm John Podes -- SING!" I think it actually sounds like "I'm j-" and then just some slurring, and then "SING!"  I don't think there's a "ohn Podes" in there.  That is us hearing what we want to hear.  I think he was starting to sing the line "I'm just a kid who's 4" again.
           </p>
           <p>
            That said, I'm not less persuaded that this is Podesta.  It still may be him.

            Look man. It's voat. You can say the nigger kikes did (blank) to the boy. And that's fully your right man.

           <p>
            I think it was a pretty polite and respectful plea to you "hey man, lets take it easy on this one" from Disgusted-Lurker. Didn't wasn't trying to jump down your throat.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Unfonrtunately, that child may very well already be dead." might have been at least not as flippant as to that childs fate. And I mean really man. You just watched a kid getting tortured. Being "edgy" about that might not be the coolest thing to do man. But its completely your right to do so.

            It's both. Nature and nurture man. Some argue genetics play a larger role some argue nurture does. I don't  know I generally think genetics play a larger role.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everything that makes you,  you. Comes from genetics or "how god made you" if you will. And how you were raised and the friends you've had the enemies you've had. In some ways I sometimes kinda doubt free will. Everything about you is a result of things you didn't control. You can say I have made choices but really the very decisions you make are products of your intelligence/tempemerment (genetics) and your judgement (past expeirences). Neither of those you get to pick.
           </p>
           <p>
            But that is certainly debatable.

            Regardless of whether this is Podesta or not, it's a glimpse into something very evil, but not just spontaneously evil, it's planned and coordinated with a sinister end game

            No. Fever pitch hasnt been reached yet. Dont advocate for this sort of thing. Makes us all look terrible and accomplices to insanity in the proles eyes. So many mindnumbed folks out there that couldnt comprehend this evil let alone rise up to crush it...clock is ticking though. Dont lonewolf anything.

            He is making this kid call him daddy because he is getting power by being the abuser (his father) instead of the abused. Imagine if we had a purge that let everyone do whatever they wanted to their abuser....they would all be killed and the cycle could finally end because there WOULD be consequences.

            Even if this isn't John Podesta, this is not "put to rest." It looks like some kind of MK-ULTRA torture brainwashing straight out of Tony Podesta's bathtub artwork or the movie Hostel.

             Honestly, that dude making a cold remark like that really could be a way from distancing himself from what he saw. Being "flippant" about horrifying things...Sometime sit means that persons kind a dick. Sometimes it means they can't process what they just saw or heard and don't really want to.
            </p>
            <p>
             Not to be all "sjw concern troll" or anything. But it's actually kinda true. That shits so bad some people don't know to do anything else other than get real cold or make a joke. And that's alright man it's almost to be expected that level of horrific shit will affect people in all ways.

            this is definitely more clear, and "John" is more clear.  it doesn't seem like exactly the same clip as before.  the other one had "I'm just a kid" with the kid screaming, then the creepy Caillou song.  but it's the same incident.  I have not ruled out that this may be IN Comet Pizza, the lighting is the same - perhaps there is a shower there.

            Where is the actual evidence that ties Worldcorp to Podesta? Yes, it does sound like him, but this is not proof. I am seeing people all over twitter, yt, etc., saying this is Podesta as though it is a proven fact. A good investigator is careful not to make unsubstantiated allegations as this can undermine credibility of the investigation. The objective should be to develop a ROCK SOLID case that could stand up in a court of law. This would easily be ripped apart by any half witted attorney. I don't think this video should be ignored though, as it is very disturbing and has been stirring up anger in people......which is what we need. We need people to start getting angry enough that they want to do something about this. But to say with certainty that this is Podesta in the video, without any direct link between him and worldcorp, can cause people to question your discernment......even though you have good intentions.

            I was red pilled 15 years ago when virtually no one was talking about this. When I spoke of it people thought I was a lunatic. To see so many people waking up now and to see communities like this working together to expose these creatures, finally gives me hope after all these years. Thank you to everyone here for all your hard work. God Bless.

            I've watched this video a number of times and it disturbs me more and more emotionally for longer and longer periods each time I see it and hear it.  I have three small boys and don't think I can bear another viewing, especially one even more graphic.
            <br/>
            I suppose I'm being a total wimp by asking others who have watched this version if it supplies any further evidence without actually watching it myself one more time...?

            I don't know if this is Podesta. Podesta is from Boston isnt he?? The guy in the video has an NJ accent. The IP of worldcorp traces back to NJ.

           <p>
            Check out this hidden directory of Worldcorp I found, it contains a picture of convicted pedophile Robert Robinson:

            Someone has also altered the sound. I finally listened to the "proof" today. SRSLY? It's not just "cleaned up" someone with a pro mixer altered the sound, and actually input John."

            Thanks for clearing that up Detective.

            I never understood why all these rich white people listened to such shitty music. Now it makes sense. Its to drown out the screams.Theres actually 2 live shows going on. Awesome.

            At this point I hope the devil does exist. Because if not than that means our species best and brightest are just a bunch of delusional morons dancing around and raping babies.

             It looks nothing like a face, IMO.  But it's dark and blurry, so I'm not sure what it is.

              Why are dollar burgers even in existence?  I always thought it might be 'fillers'.  Tribal folks do say that human tastes like pork (long pig..learned that from Archer of all places).
             </p>
             <p>
              That would be an excellent and sick way of disposing their evidence.  Plus, they think of anyone outside of their 1% elitist ring as peasants who deserve to eat shit and die.  What better sick way of getting gratification then by pushing 'meat' made of tortured and murdered children? (that the general populace has NO idea about).
             </p>
             <p>
              It's like Snowpiercer...(2013 movie about  failed climate change experiments and a train that constantly ran around the world, keeping a small amount of people alive) the corruption of the 'elite' (front cars of the train) and using children to benefit themselves).  The rich were eating steaks and the poor (last cars of the train) were eating cockroach bars (and having their children stolen from them in the night), and were none the wiser until they stormed the Elite's and started killing them.

            This is obviously conditioning. This will actually breed another abuser. All humans have a limit to what they can take...Everything you are is a product of your genetics and your enviroment. You choose neither it's an unsettling though for most obviously. Everything in this world is a gift. Even your uniqueness.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's truly saddening to see this. Rarely some people are born what you would call evil no matter what happens the most loving home or supportive influences. Sometimes genetics just throws a curveball. On the other side RARELY can someone endure this kind of treatment for long and not turn into an evil person themselves.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm not trying to say punishments should not exist even for this kid later in life if they walk a dark path. Rules have to be set to a certain degree and mercy can only go so far. However...I dunno what im trying to get at here really. Mostly, this is how you take any semblance of "free will" away from someone. Your willpower is not limitless. What makes you unique is not impervious to assault from an outside source.

            This isn't just an assault on the body. The person is literally assaulting this beings soul. And this is happening every day...and you will probably never truly rid it from existence. But good lord. We could make it more rare. And maybe there will always be people able to bring someone back from this and I hope someone like that finds this kid. And god bless them for they are truly there brothers keeper. And I'm not even religous.

            Also, While I am an advocate for the death penalty. Be careful of wishing to torture that man to death. THAT is in infection.  Just kill him quick and clean and be done with it. If to find out where the boy is you consider torture fine...However, tricking him into thinking your his friend is generally a better method of gaining information. That said...If its torture with the honest intent of gaining information perhaps. But be careful of wanting to torment him as he does the boy just for your own pleasure. You then become just a little more like him be very wary of that or even wishing or fantazing of it.

             This is the very essence of spirit cooking. He is literally fracturing this kid's soul. The lights, the terror, the hot and/or cold water. Total desperation and isolation. Manifest terror. I am nearing the point where I am literally not above organizing a mob and finding this motherfucker myself.

            They reposted that same shit about 5-6 times. Mods did not delete them even though reported. What does that tell you? Then it just took off and the edit fest began. Now people are taking it as fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just scroll down to my posts. This video went from what it was in the first link to altered so much to convince people it's Podesta. This is NOT serving our purpose. If it were being passed as an example of child abuse YES, but it's not. It;s been altered on purpose and John Podesta isn't worried at all. That only hurts us~

             Nothing worries john podesta. He thinks lucifer will protect them and he has the high priestess on his side. Don't expect normal human reactions from him he is twisted and evil.  The video was professionally alterd yes. Who is the question?  Majestic apes videos are professionally altered too. Is it a stretch that podestas video would be professionally altered for effect? Another possibility that I personally lean towards is the FBI might have altered it to comply with cp laws.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also you say The video is old. So are many of the podesta Wikileaks emails. The age does not mean it is fake. 
People have tried to identify the video before.....but the public is aware of podesta as the most infamous pedofile right now. It's not a stretch that someone familiar with podestas voice would connect it to the video. 
You cannot definitely say the video is a fake. There are several possibilities.there is no final answer and right now to many the video is exposing the ravages of pedofilia to complacent masses. This is great!
            </p>
            <p>
             The FBI and nypd have all the evidence they need on wieners computer, there are good guys and gals in the inside that have to give clues in order to help advance this because god knows the people in positions of authority are never going to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
             This video should not be discounted.

              Again, the video is of actual child abuse. No one is disputing that. It's been talked about and investigated on youtube for years.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the video were unaltered to attempt to inject Podesta into it it absolutely would have been a great pedopill. It is not any longer as the integrity of the entire thing has been wiped out entirely by the purposeful altering to inject a false narrative. False narratives are not evidence. It only makes people who buy it look like fools.

               Withholding judgement is one thing and declaring it false is another thing. It might be disinformation or it also might be a leak from FBI or some other organization. It should not be discounted but should be researched. There is a child involved and the victim deserves a chance. Of course Some are false leads and that's ok. Some leads go nowhere as well. Investigating leads does not discredit the cause, as a matter of fact iAn objective and impartial investigation which can weigh both sides of the coin Legitimizes this. We need to stop tip toeing in fear, of what "they" will think. They will always lie and deny even when the truth is in their face. Lie and deny is their method. So just do what you best, try to help this poor kid and it might be podesta or someone else, but it is not false.....it remains to be seen. Thanks for hearing me out :)

               </p>
               <p>
                NO WHERE did i say that is a fake video of a kid screaming. It's been on youtube for years as reported by Fartyshorts. The video is real, no one knows the context or where it came from. But some clever b/tard has used it on his worldcorp hoax and some even more dedicated b/tards have "enhanced it for your gasping pleasure". The original upload in no way shape or form resembles the one being floated now. It's fake. Sound, everything cleverly edited. I bet you didn't know you can do just about anything to a video. It's not John Podesta. And pushing it as if it were is hurting not helping anything. But from what I recall there's a few "sleuth" sites who enjoy witch hunts in the wrong direction.
               </p>
               <p>
                JAYSUS the b/tard that did this gets &gt;9000k Internetz and as it's so wild watching you nutters, no wonder the black hats enjoy it so much.

Instead you just think you know everything so I will leave you to yourself and keep talking to that mirror, eventually it will talk back to you, just be patient. I for one will not waste anymore time, I clearly thought you were someone else.

                  LOGIC? LOLOL Then please explain logically why the only two videos that were hotlinked on this "secret discovered website" were the most inflamatory and copied from youtube? Because you don't understand that you can't apply logic. You're spinning in circles. The troll site had the hotlinks installed by the creator. The hotlinks were passed around to get tards to spread them

                   Yawn, your fervor to prove yourself right, will not make it right, nor, will anyone believe you because you jump up and down demanding to be believed. Hotlinks you ask? Because it might have been leaked by maybe the FBI? Or an enemy of podesta that wants him to be the fall guy? Clearly you have a hard time thinking outside that narrow little box you call a mind.  Just keep desperately clinging to your theory because your arrogance cannot handle the possibility of being wrong....poor baby was everybody a winner in little league? I for one don't know and am not above admiting that, but I also acknowledge you don't know anything and have not presented a convincing argument either...yet, you are tremendously zealous to make sure this is not investigated. Go ahead please debunk it, investigate it. I beg you, help trace the video and please help find the abuser who posted it. Find out who made the video. Investigate! Hack! Love to hear your excuses, let's see:  hotlinks, that's your argument, well it does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt  and certainly does not hold up in this sub..., your other assertion that a  a video being old means even less. As to your assertion of a doctored video I will remind you again that the magestic ape videos were highly doctored. This is part of their culture and their artistic style.....so it still fits. And if it was a leak it would have to be blurred or no one would be able to view it legally. So genius please feel free to enlighten this board when you find out who posted that video. I look forward to it. I won't be holding my breath though, let me tell you a little secret: Closed minds are the mark of stupidity, arrogance is for fools and I suffer neither. I am done with you.

            Why isn't Podesta comming out defending himself, saying that the video is fake and it is not his voice? Would not that be the reaction of a high profile politician accused of thing like that? Need more proof?

             He is exercising his right to remain silent in case charges are coming. He is a lawyer. I kept asking myself this but it became clear, in case he is charged he will remain silent. He is guilty, I have seen enough, the Madeline McCann efit, the lack of an alibi, the silence, the email codes. The friend that he associates with. Why does he remain silent? Would you? Of course not! He does not have an alibi if he did he would put all of this to rest.  No he is silent because he is anticipating that there will be charges brought. So instead he uses misdirection: fake news, aliens, Russia....any kind of false flag to get people's attention off of this. Even his actions like his silence speak volumes. With just the circumstantial evidence alone I would find him guilty on a jury especially if he pled the 5th.

             B. Man, this shit has fucked my whole day up. Up early, supposed to unseasonably warm and sunny. Here I am crying at my laptop chain smoking cigs. Goddamnit man, if this doesn't awaken something inside you that is primal, then you are part of the problem. My first response is, "where is this dude. let's go get him." I have never felt such righteous indignation in my life. If evil is so real, is pure good just as real? This isn't just kids being tortured to me. This is the confirmation of something I long ago thought I had settled in my own conscience. EVIL IS REAL! I am literally sick. I mean, I know it's a meme now but I am
             <em>
              literally shaking.

              We have all felt that feeling when we realized spirit cooking is real. It will subside to a low rumble after a while, and not the full-on blood curdling rage you're feeling currently. If evil is real, so is true good. At least there is solace in that. Being awoken to true evil also cracked gods doors open for me. I cant be the only one.

            This video made the torture and molestation of children far too real for me. No child should ever have to endure such pain and torment. The pedophiles around the world must be dealt with, starting with those in our government.

             one small thing that gives me hope and brings light to this incredibly dark and horrific occurrence is that this child's screams have been heard. And heard by many.  He may only be one child out of thousands that have experienced this pain and torture, but we have heard him and it is from the echo of these cries that we will not forget and never give up on him and others like him.

              I have never felt such rage. You can see the child so clearly. So terrified and alone. My blood is cold. NO MERCY FOR THESE MOTHERFUCKERS. I swear to god this is the worst shit I have ever seen, and that's really saying something coming from a man in his 30s who has just about seen it all on the internet. This is not acting. This is demonic and this is pure, synthesized evil. Drag them out in the street and literally pull them limb from fucking limb. This is the FUCKING WORST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN....................END IT NOW!

             It saddens me that this is happening. More so that common people won't embrace it with so much evidence and things that's happening. People be critical FFS. Good thing is that there's getting something done now. But end result? How far do we get? Can this happen again? ... We need something serious protection after. Laws, fight against corruption. A system designed against itself. Even if someone from inside does something bad. The system will report itself... And they say that internet warriors are useless. Ha! Lets show them guys! :)

             Yea sounds like him, the lights and colors look the same as one of the heavy breathing shows at comet and the child calls him John, Skippy and he says I AM JOHN PODESAHGHHGHHGHG while singing the Calliou song.

               100% says John, John is however a very common name. The voice on the video I would say it slightly uncommon though, and does sound very similar to the voice of John Skippy Podesta.

             It doesn't. It's been around for years and even made waves before PG. There are videos on YouTube analyzing these clips (without any mention of PG/Podesta) from a couple of
             <s>
              years
             </s>
             months ago.

             However, I believe it is connected to the known hair-fetish-pedo who always shoves his presence in to everything pedo-related.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Podesta connection is purely based on the voice.

                Thanks.  That at least takes us back that far.  However, that just links back to the worldcorp site; I don't see any further explanation of the abuse video itself.  (I get that the rest of the clips in the "Silvagunner" video are fakes.)  The YT channel owner didn't seem to know anything more either, and said he was assuming it was fake.
               </p>
               <p>
                So, we still are left with what appears to be a child being subjected to MK Ultra conditioning.  Is there any more analysis of the video or its origin that you can recall seeing?

                  The video you link to says that it's all fake (

                  It seems pretty real to me. I think that child is being tortured, and tortured in the style of Hostel / Tony Podesta artwork.

                I am sorry, I can't find any older one than that. I think I was wrong. I also checked when Worldcorpo.net was first registered and it was on 2016-04-01. I think I may have seen the video on 4chan before that.

               It sounds like he's starting to sing "I'm just a kid who's 4" again, not "I'm John Podesta".  Obviously it would be incredibly helpful if it were "I'm John Podesta"... but that's all the more reason to question what we think we're hearing.  The more we want to hear Podesta, the more we "will".

               I will tell you something even more disturbing. The elite are in on it. The day this video surfaced, Seth Meyers on his show made a reference to Cailou with a pic. Timing was uncanny. I thought it was a nod to the video. Nothing is a coincidence, I thought I might mention it now. They are all in the know. It's a stanic network, everyone is in on it. Jake Tapper, Nani Pelosi's Goat Hill Pizza! I a great article here on VOAT how pizza joints have been used as fronts for illegal activities for decades.

              Someone has also altered the sound. I finally listened to the "proof" today. SRSLY? It's not just "cleaned up" someone with a pro mixer altered the sound, and actually input John. I tried to tell them they were being trolled, the trolls cussed me, called me a pedeo and kept reposting and DV to hide my comments which should be clue enough. Falling for this stuff is emotional bullshit. Don't investigate PG if everything you see is going to fool you.

                At no time has anyone asserted the video is not of a child being abused. The video has been on youtube and discussed at length for years. What it was used for is despicable. Altering it make it into something it isn't (evidence of Podesta) is asshattery. Sorry you're not able to discern the difference.

               Even if the video isnt John Podesta(i dont think it is, sounds a lot younger than him) that child is clearly being abused. This video going viral is bringing more attention to pedogate. I think thats a good thing in general. Child Trafficking in our nation is real and we need all the attention we can get on this issue in my opinion.

             It's a telling sign that it's a fake in relation to Podesta. It's a fake..fake fake fake.

             " It's been around for years and even made waves before PG. There are videos on YouTube analyzing these clips (without any mention of PG/Podesta) from a couple of years ago."
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              However, I believe it is connected to the known hair-fetish-pedo who always shoves his presence in to everything pedo-related.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Podesta connection is purely based on the voice.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And the voice has been altered with a professional mixer. The video is real, it is a child being harmed. It is NOT John Podesta in the video.

              Consider that an agency or someone might have purposely leaked this and blurred this out so that it is not breaking any child porn law. Another possibilityis that  this particular video may have been chosen  because of visual quality again becaus ethough it depicts all the details necessary to expose the abuser with out breakeing any laws. I would not put it past anyone to leave breadcrumbs to assist the public.

              How about some sources?  Because that sounds an awful lot like John Podesta, who has likely been raping, torturing, murdering, and eating children for many, many years.

                    So, no link.  Not too surprised, I can usually find things if they exist.

              Even if its been around for years guess what. So has Podesta the molesta!
