<p>So, I checked out Dr. Brazelton and I\'m seeing a lot of parallels we\'ve seen lately, which I\'ve bolded. </p>
<p><em>Brazelton was born in Waco, Texas. He graduated in 1940 from Princeton and in 1943 from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, where he accepted a medical internship at Roosevelt Hospital. From 1945, after war service in the U.S. Navy, he completed his medical residency in Boston Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) before undertaking pediatric training at Children\'s Hospital of Boston.</em></p>
<p>*He entered private practice in 1950, in <strong>Cambridge, Massachusetts</strong>. His interest in child development led to <strong>training in child psychiatry</strong> at <strong>MGH and the James Jackson Putnam Children\'s Center</strong>. He subsequently served as a Fellow with Professor Jerome Bruner at the *<em>Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard University</em><em>, then <strong>combined his interests in primary care pediatrics and child psychiatry</strong> and in 1972 established the Child Development Unit, a pediatric training and research center at Children\'s Hospital in Boston. Since 1988, he has been Clinical Professor of Pediatrics Emeritus at Harvard Medical School.</em></p>
<p>*Brazelton was <strong>president of the Society for Research in Child Development</strong> (1987–1989), and of the <strong>National Center for Clinical Infant Programs</strong> (1988–1991). He appeared many times before Congressional committees in support of parental and medical leave bills, and continued to work with the <strong>Alliance for Better Child Care for a more comprehensive day care bill</strong>. He was a co-founder of Parent Action and served on the *<em>National Commission on Children</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>*Brazelton appeared several times on <strong>\'The Oprah Winfrey Show\'</strong> and the *<em>\'Ellen DeGeneres Show\'</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>This here sounds a lot like Alfred Kinsey\'s &quot;research&quot;:</p>
<p><em>Brazelton\'s foremost achievement in pediatrics and child development has been to increase pediatricians\' awareness of, and attention to, the effect of young children\'s behavior, activity states, and emotional expressions on the ways their parents react to, and thereby affect them. For example, one of his first publications in the field of psychology was a study with Kenneth Kaye of the interaction between babies\' sucking at breast or bottle and the mother\'s attempts to maintain it, the earliest form of human &quot;dialogue&quot;.</em></p>

<p>I\'ve always blamed Dr. Spock for how children misbehave today because of his silly time-out recommendation. Most everyone knows there\'s a difference between abuse and discipline, but let\'s not get distracted by arguing about this. Here\'s the info: </p>
<p>*Spock was <strong>the first pediatrician to study psychoanalysis to try to understand children\'s needs and family dynamics</strong>. His ideas about childcare influenced several generations of *<em>parents to be more flexible and affectionate with their children</em><em>, and to treat them as individuals. However, his theories were also widely criticized by colleagues for relying too heavily on anecdotal evidence rather than serious academic research.</em></p>
<p><em>Spock was an <strong>activist in the New Left</strong> and anti Vietnam War movements during the 1960s and early 1970s. At the time, <strong>his books were criticized for propagating permissiveness and an expectation of instant gratification</strong> which allegedly led young people to join these movements—a charge that Spock denied. Spock also won an Olympic gold medal in rowing in 1924 while attending <strong>Yale University</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>At Yale, he was inducted into the Eta chapter of Zeta Psi and then into the senior society Scroll and Key.</em> - The oldest secret society at Yale.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Spock">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Spock</a></p>
<p>Dr. Spock\'s second wife was 40 years his junior. </p>
<p>I find all of this very strange. We have Connecticut (Sandy Hook) and Cambridge connections and two doctors who were heavily interested and involved with newborn and child psychology, elite universities, secret societies, a man who married a woman much, much younger than himself, strange research that resembles pedo activities, and child psychology that may have been related to MK Ultra, but more research is needed. All of these details scream Pizzagate. Please help dig into these men and any colleagues they worked with. </p>
<p>It sure seems like bullshit to hide missing children\'s ads because it would scare children. Maybe they were involved with the cults themselves.</p>',

            Yes, Dr. Spock notably caused the worst damage by telling parents to let the baby "cry it out" alone, without tending to them.  That is a sure way to create attachment issues between mom and baby, which is horrible for a childs future wellbeing and ability to relate to others

             Henry Makow nails it, and I admit I was wrong. I thought Spock taught that children should be tended to every time they cried, but it's the opposite.

               Absolutely! Honestly, how many authors have appointed someone to represent their work once they pass? They sure want to keep his teachings valid and relevant. Keep screwing up the kids directly from the cradle.

                No parental contact.  Think about it.  That is the teaching of the Rainbow Cultural Garden as well.  Teaching them 7 languages a day to confuse them but never any contact with the parents.  The profess Multicultural Teaching.  Another words, you do not belong to your parents anymore.  You are a Ward of the World.

             Great find! He has quite a lot in common with Dr Spock. Activist, loves babies, a Harvard graduate, divorced with sons from that marriage, and a new young wife. It's interesting that he's Jewish. I don't believe Spock is, but I could be wrong. I also find it interesting that he focuses on dying children. More organ donation work behind the scenes?

              He was an old crusty marxist jew spinning contradictory yarns pushing the a myriad of bad parenting and not being "dispclined" foucsed while showing care, he was essentially an unloving hippy, show them no true care just let them run wild. His associations were pedo that for damn sure

             Thanks for that info! I didn't check Wikileaks, and what you found is fascinating. Compared with the other info found, it seems that the teachings of Spock were designed to get these kids into institutions of psychiatry or military. Quite sad.

            A lot of the criticism of Dr. Spock was designed to discredit him for his stand against the Vietnam war.  I read his Child Care book as I awaited the birth of my first son.  I found it practical, down to earth and wise and found none of the claims about it to be true.  I raised two responsible, kind, smart, sons who people like.

            Sigmund Freud and James Putnam: Friendship as a Form of Sublimation
           </p>
           <p>
            We suggest the correspondence between Putnam and Freud reflects the very fact that the lifting of sexual repressions makes possible the development of male friendships.

             So what did the son do?  Did he commit suicide by beating himself up?  Multiple injuries  I thought maybe he was shot, but no.  Very odd indeed.

             I believe Robert D. is a different Putnam, a political scientist who has written about children in a societal context:

             Btw, the Putnam Children's Center closed in 1979.  Here's a short history on it:

                What?!!? Very strange indeed. According to the article I linked, it was his grandson. Maybe there's something really strange going on here like maybe, and I'm just speculating here, one of his sons impregnated his 2nd wife. After all, she was 40 years younger than he was. Technically, it would be his son and his grandson all in one!

                Yes, the entire incident seems extremely bizarre. Given that those close to Dr. Spock have reported that he wasn't that great of a dad and that his sons appeared distant and detached, there was something going on in that family. Let's remember that Spock's first wife, this son's grandmother, was an alcoholic with mental issues, then he practically immediately married a woman 40 years younger than himself. What did this grandson know? What happened to Spock's first wife? Did she end up committing suicide? Was she institutionalized? So many questions. I guess it's possible that the grandson suffered the same mental illness as his grandmother, but as we've seen with abuse, it's familial and generational.

             Great find! I find it interesting that Brazelton focused on low income children, while Spock focused on middle income families. Seemed they covered every child, but the elites.
            </p>
            <p>
             Brazelton's "Touchpoints" research and teachings strike me as weird. Especially the way he would tell parents regression is normal. Children usually don't regress unless traumatized or they've experienced extreme changes in their day to day lives.
            </p>
            <p>
             And, here we are back at the Clintons! Guess what? Putnam is where Hillary got her idea that "It takes a village" to raise a child.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              "If it takes a village to raise a child, the prognosis for America's children isn't good: In recent years, villages all over America, rich and poor, have deteriorated as we've shirked collective responsibility for our kids," Mr. Putnam wrote.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              The book comes as Congress debates the future of federal support for education to counter poverty, and Mr. Putnam harked back to potential Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whose 1996 book It Takes a Village made some of the same arguments.

               You know, I was wondering who focused on the elite's children, and Raniere's a good guess and I wouldn't doubt if there was another such as those at the Presidio.

              I always thought there was something wrong with "It takes a village." There was a push for women to go to work and place there children in day care centers. I've never been a fan of them myself. As we have seen, many of them sexually abused children and when caught, closed up shop and moved to another town to start over. No accountability. Brazelton urged taking raising children away from parents and put  them into the hands of strangers. No wonder we have mixed up kids.

               Couldn't agree with you more. It seemed that children were much more balanced and grew up to be more productive adults when mothers stayed home. The feminist movement has created the most unbearable offspring.

               Sadly most families (except for the very wealthy) now have no choice financially but for both parents to work outside of the home and send kids to daycare. Thanks again, globalists 🖕

              He seems to not be very fond of her idea.  Surprising that he does not agree.  Great to hear and we must remember one thing.  She has a habit of twisting things to her liking.  They always have a way of explaining things that are their own.  I have remembered reading somethings that seem like they are going around in circles.

              The panel, the National Commission on Children, was created by Congress in late 1987 to investigate the condition of children in the United States. The panel is dominated by Democrats, but it includes officials from the Bush and Reagan administrations. The chairman, Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, a potential Democratic candidate for President, led the panel's deliberations but, under the law creating the commission, was not allowed to vote. Another potential Democratic Presidential candidate, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, is a member of the commission. A Blueprint for Action

             <p>
              Members of the commission were appointed separately by the Senate, the House of Representatives and Presidents Bush and Ronald Reagan. Besides Governor Clinton, members include Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, the Harvard pediatrician; Mary Hatwood Futrell, a former president of the National Education Association; Bill Honig, the Superintendent of Public Instruction in California; Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, business executives, officials of the Bush Administration and former Reagan aides.

               Kudos to you, carm! There he is. Brazelton is one of the commissioners. Fantastic! It's definitely no accident that these child psychology experts are deeply politically involved.

                Yes, but I used reversed psychology on kids I worked with at a school and it worked well.  But of course, my motives were different.  Some were extremely Head Strong!  Their motives were definitely ulterior.

                 Well, there's good manipulation and bad manipulation. Sociopaths are masters at manipulation and it's always for their own gain rather than the safety of others or to teach a lesson.

                  I have always been very interested in the case of Etan.  I remember when he went missing.  Many of us waited and waited.  The day never came.  There was a post on here about a woman that claims he is still alive.  That she was in the car with him and the guy that picked him up.  She claims it is someone that took them for other men to use them for sex.  It was heart breaking actually.  I may just see if I can find it.  I think of him quite often.

                   That's pretty messed up if she knows he's still alive and won't go to authorities, unless she knows that the authorities are involved. Yes, please post if you're able to find it.

                    There are more threads on this too.  Very interesting.  She was trying to get DNA done and she showed pictures that she had.  Amazing is how I remembered it, and it still is.  I so believe her.  I can imagine if she did not go to LE, since she is probably scared.  I have to finish reading thread.  Possibly she did get help.  I thought she may have found her family.  That may be in later thread.

            I've heard tons of criticism of Spock, but never about pedophilia. Brazelton is widely regarded as some kind of saint, and nobody brought up any specific allegation against him. I googled him and couldn't find even a whisper of negativity. So I'm pretty baffled about this post. Either I missed something (i do skim, I'll admit it) or it's a nothing 🍔 burger

             It may be a nothing burger, but I would try skimming again and halt your eyeballs as soon as you see the name Alfred Kinsey. The research that Brazelton did in regards to infant suckling is just creepy to me. Reminds me of the stuff I've heard Cathy O'Brien and others speak about in regards to how their father's abused them as infants.

             Not to mention, the facilities these men were involved with were doing some shady stuff and other weird connections that you can see in the comments that others are uncovering. Besides, I'm always weary of public figures that are so squeaky clean - it's almost like nails on a chalkboard. But, I could be wrong and I've never claimed my rabbit burrow digging leads to huge evidence, but worthwhile nonetheless.

            Since you posted the Etan and Milk Carton link I wanted to research.  Found this about ICMEC and milk cartons and something very frightening that they are pushing about Missing Children.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.freerangekids.com/group-that-put-missing-kids-pictures-on-milk-cartons-now-says-dont-teach-kids-stranger-danger/">
             http://www.freerangekids.com/group-that-put-missing-kids-pictures-on-milk-cartons-now-says-dont-teach-kids-stranger-danger/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            On Good Morning America last week, a spokesman for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children — the people who put the missing kids’ pictures on the milk cartons without bothering to explain that the vast majority were runaways or taken in custody disputes, not nabbed by predators — told parents NOT to teach their kids stranger danger.
           </p>
           <p>
            And actually, NCMEC told me that, too, when I interviewed them for my book — I quote them. But it always felt like they were talking out of both sides of their mouth, because when they were interviewed by OTHER sources, they kept warning about all the danger out there.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr. Marty Klein, whose Sex, Culture and Intelligence blog’s motto is “Changing the Way People, Politics &amp; the Media Look at Sex,” did the heavy lifting on why this late-date “Don’t demonize strangers” statement seems both welcome AND hypocritical:
           </p>
           <p>
            Yesterday, Callahan Walsh of NCMEC—The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children—appeared on Good Morning America to urge parents to stop using the phrase “stranger danger”—the phrase that NCMEC itself popularized for decades. They rightly noted—finally—that most child sexual exploitation is from someone known to the child, not a stranger.
           </p>
           <p>
            For decades, NCMEC has told parents to fear “stranger danger,” and instructed them to transmit this fear to their kids. They even got the phrase institutionalized in elementary schools.
           </p>
           <p>
            NCMEC has been one of the single biggest drivers of parents’ fear in our lifetime. By conflating “missing” and “exploited,” they have panicked Americans into thinking the average child is “at risk” of being kidnapped. By talking about “children” they conflate the experiences of five-year-olds and 17-year-olds. According to their own website, over 90% of “missing” teens are not “missing,” they have run away. Some are no doubt living on the street and risking their health and lives, but they have not been kidnapped. In fact, over 3/4 of runaways are running away from institutions like foster homes and other social services.
           </p>
           <p>
            THEY Are Spreading The Word That There Are Not That Many Missing Children!  They Are Getting Through According To The Comments.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are the ones that started the pictures on the Milk Cartons.  I really feel this is frightening.

             Wow! So, the milk carton thing may have been a psyop all along while the real missing children went largely ignored. Isn't it funny that they wanted the parents scared, but Spock and Brazelton wanted the milk carton photos stopped because it unnecessarily scared children.
            </p>
            <p>
             This entire thing stinks to high hell. Mighty hard to abduct kids when they're scared of getting kidnapped, so why not ease the worry, but keep the parents scared, so the kids will eventually think their parents are being overprotective and reject the warnings their parents are giving them. Is this the ultimate reverse psychology? After all, this thread is mainly about the childhood psychology. The rabbit hole deepens.

              Yes, Reverse Psychology.  But now they are trying to Hood Wink again.  Trying to get people to believe there aren't that many Missing Children.  Kidnapping is not the same as Trafficking.  There are sometimes Ransoms asked for Kidnapped Children.  A whole different thing.  They are trying to change their tune again.  As often as their socks.

               Thanks for info on Etan Patz and Milk cartons, I heard it was Johnny Gosch. Didn't know anything about Etan.

               Do think NCMEC making wrong choice about "stranger danger." I grew up in awful neighborhood. Lots of child snatchings. Posters of missing kids did look like a head on a stick warning, terrifying to other kids.
So, we walked to the store in groups &amp; instead of talking Batman vs. Superman it was fight strategies to get out of trunks, and vulnerable body parts that kids could reach. 
Do think it points to psyop and further possibility of fox in the hen house behavior from NCMEC to drop it completely. Especially b/c the rise of human trafficking epidemic!

                Believe me, we have researched NCMEC up the ying yang.  They def are up to fooling the public.  And, if you read the comments, the people are being fooled.  So sad that people do not question anything nowadays.  But then we do, so that is uplifting. Spreading this to others is how to make headway.  Other Moms &amp; Dads need to know.

                 Re:NCMEC past posting...I've been thinking about collection re-posts. So much good work already done, sometimes feels hidden in jars &amp; pockets of internet. Search Voat awesome actually, but wonder are collection posts obnoxious to users? Guess could ask for mod advice too...on reminder -remember when-icymi-link collections. So hack, but @ least sophomoric for a lurker.

                Exactly.  Her it takes a village statement was really clever.  People listened because many thought, Wow, yes we need all the people we can get to help our children.  But she had different ideas.

                 Exactly. I remember a time when family lived nearby one another and you didn't have to rely on the "village" to help you with child care because your family members could help. Now, we don't know who to trust to watch our kids. Glad I don't have any.

                  People used to watch out for all the kids on their block.  Because Moms did not work.  I think this was one reason they wanted the Women's Movement to succeed.  Not that I don't think women should not work if they so desire.  But the economy was better and allowed it.  Now things are not the same and most women HAVE to work.  I am a firm believer in staying home if at all possible until the children are  ready for HS.  This is of course sounds like a Dreamworld.  As I said, if at all possible.

            Waco. Did you ever see a film called Race with the Devil? Peter Fonda is the star at the time. Maslansky. I think that chick from MASH was in it.

             Yes, Waco stuck out at me, too, but didn't bold it because I couldn't relate it to PG. No, I don't think I ever saw that movie. I'll have to check it out for symbolism. Thanks!

                Start at 44:58 and read the note. Some of the symbols may be obvious to you, and some may not. The dropping of letters in common words is pretty much just that, code.

            This is interesting - Mothers brought their children to the James Jackson Putnam Children's Center because of over-dependency.

            That's mighty interesting considering Dr. Spock's teaching told mothers not to allow their children to cry in their cribs. Was this all by design, so they would end up at this center for "study", then eventually create children who wouldn't be productive citizens and now the snowflakes we see and can't stand today?

He entered private practice in 1950, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His interest in child development led to training in child psychiatry at MGH and the James Jackson Putnam Children's Center. He subsequently served as a Fellow with Professor Jerome Bruner at the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard University, then combined his interests in primary care pediatrics and child psychiatry and in 1972 established the Child Development Unit, a pediatric training and research center at Children's Hospital in Boston. Since 1988, he has been Clinical Professor of Pediatrics Emeritus at Harvard Medical School."

              It's worse than you think.  The procedure manual also says, as quoted above:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Children who are Wards of the state may be included in research that presents greater than minimal risk with
              <strong>
               NO
              </strong>
              prospect of direct benefit..."  (my emphasis added)
             </p>
             <p>
              So wards of the state can be experimented on even if there is no chance of benefitting the child--like mice in a lab.

               This makes me think of Henrietta Lacks.  Not a child but at the mercy of a Frankenstein as well.  I am already worried when it comes to animals, but children, or any adult, it makes me sick.  Dangerous.  This must be exposed.  Speaking of Frankenstein, maybe the movie was a message.  You know how they lie to tell us what they are doing through movies with messages, maybe they were telling us while they were hiding in plain sight.  Frankenstein Experiments.  Just today we have a class action lawsuit against MK Ultra.  People are not going to sit back anymore.  Hopefully all the truth will come pouring out.

              Very interesting find and previous thread.  Wish I could find the text of that book.  I did find that Putnam was a big Freud fan:
             </p>
             <p>
              "Putnam was one of those instrumental in bringing Sigmund Freud to the United States...He also wrote the introduction to the translation from the German of Sigmund Freud's Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex."

              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              From a synopsis of Freud's "Three Contributions...":
              <a href="https://everipedia.org/wiki/Three_Essays_on_the_Theory_of_Sexuality/">
               https://everipedia.org/wiki/Three_Essays_on_the_Theory_of_Sexuality/
              </a>
             </p>
             <p>
              "Discussing the choice of children and animals as sex objects — pedophilia and bestiality — he notes that most people would prefer to limit these perversions to the insane "on aesthetic grounds" but that they exist in normal people also."
             </p>
             <p>
              ...and
             </p>
             <p>
              "His second essay, on "Infantile Sexuality", argues that children have sexual urges...Looking at children, Freud identified many forms of infantile sexual emotions, including thumb sucking, autoeroticism, and sibling rivalry."

                  After I heard the interview, I emailed Putnam to congratulate him for the name check, and to continue a conversation we had started last year when Our Kids first appeared.

                  You said Robert was associated with the Children's Center and he's not.  There's no apparent association between James Jackson Putnam and Robert D. Putnam is all I'm saying.

                   You're right. I went off on a tangent unknowingly and got confused. James Putnam is associated with the Children's Center and Robert Putnam is associated with Hillary Clinton and her "it takes a village" BS. Sorry about that.

             Hey, thanks! Valuable info you found there. More evidence of kidnapping and experiments!
            </p>
            <p>
             Strange that he would name his boats after an animal with a protective shell and a protective shell in general. A turtle has a shell and a carapace is the hard protective covering of arachnids and insects. Wonder what the significance was of him doing this? Almost like he thrived for protection, like how the elite wear masks.

              A boat is a very private thing on which a lot can happen unbeknownst to others.  I don't know if anyone ever visited him in his floating homes or, if so, whether any were children.  Like I said, just an interesting bit of knowledge to file away at this point.  I didn't even think about the boat names, but your take is interesting.

              I think it's very likely that Brazelton was instrumental in establishing the Boston Children's Hospital guidelines for experimentation on children who are made wards of the state, even in cases where there is no prospect of benefit to the child.

            I met Dr. Spock as a teenager in the sixties and came away enormously impressed.  He didn't strike me as harmful in any way.  He was old but he walked fast and loved to talk, especially to youth raised with his books in the home.  Had a strikingly bright and caring mind.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would be much saddened if we find more than innuendo.  He's held responsible for a great deal of social chaos he didn't cause or agree with.  That we all got MK'd eventually, isn't his fault.

             Here's a different perspective:
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              More startling is the account of Spock's family life, his first wife's mental illness and alcoholism, his stern and distant treatment of his two sons, his divorce after more than 45 years of marriage, and his remarriage in his early 70s to a woman 40 years his junior.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             And more worrisome, and similar to Kinsey:
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              As a product of the clinical fascination with Freud's psychoanalytic theories so prevalent in the 1920s and 1930s, especially in New York City, Spock managed without invoking Freud's name to translate Freudian theories into a practical primer on the nature of children and child-rearing practices, all in a calm and comforting manner.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Freud was all about sexuality, so it does make my alarm bells ring when seeing that Dr. Spock was a big follower of his and incorporated his own research and analysis.
            </p>
            <p>

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             It seems as though Dr. Spock was most certainly a "do as I say, not as I do" person.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              Dr. Benjamin Spock, his critics cry, turned out a generation of coddled infants who developed into demanding little tyrants.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              And now the world is reaping a whirlwind, they say. The small monsters have grown up to be unkempt, irresponsible, destructive, anarchical, drug-oriented, hedonistic non- members of society--dropouts from the accepted codes of moral, social, political, academic and economic behavior. And besides, they don't want to fight in Vietnam.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              But if the pediatrician and author of a phenomenally successful book on childrearing, "Baby and Child Care," had been as permissive in his views as his critics claim, his own offspring didn't know it.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              For his two clean-shaven, respectable, well-mannered, quiet grown sons saw him as a rather stern father.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              As for Dr. Spock, he denies he's "a permissivist" because, he says, "no distinction is made between admirable permissiveness and over-permissiveness."

             Thanks for offering your personal experience and perspective, but we still need to dig in order to rule him in or out. While not as creepy as Brazelton, Spock was very involved with politics and I'm interested to find his stance on what day cares should be doing. This article does a good job of discussing Dr. Spock's political involvements.
