            When I saw the name "David T" it sounded familiar - I looked at some of his other videos and recognized him as David Todeschini. He had a youtube account in his full name and posted  this on October 16th -
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGsecPnRQ9A&amp;t=493s">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGsecPnRQ9A&amp;t=493s
            </a>
            A commenter asked him why he wasn’t being forthcoming about being a convicted sexual offender (can’t find the comment now.)   There is an individual by this name who looks like David T and who is a convicted sex offender (1999 - 1st degree sexual assault and 2nd degree sexual sodomy of an 8yo male.)  Conviction was in NJ, but he also lives in NY, so it's possible he knows something.

            A lot of what he says confirms, and elaborates on, what FBIanon said.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is that it says that the Weiner laptop was using TOR to access a server through the dark web. Well, how do they know that? The whole point of TOR is that it is anonymous, incredibly hard to decode/compromise, and leaves no footprint. That's what security/forensics professionals have said on reddit, and I'm not aware of any secret backdoor that has been revealed in public court documents yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the idea that they found his laptop, and then using his laptop they figured out that he was accessing another server through TOR... just doesn't make much sense. It sounds like something written by someone who knows a little about TOR but not a lot about computing network security and how TOR works.
           </p>
           <p>
            But maybe I am wrong. The other parts sounded straight out FBIanon and made sense to me.

            Somebody needs to step up to the plate and leak what the fuck is going on with Weiner and pizzagate. What about Huma, what about the Clinton foundation, hell George Webb has 100's of hours of evidence against tons of people.

            This is the same info that was floated by FBI anon, Flynn, and a few conservative, fringe, unreliable news websites in October (websites in Oct.). In my opinion, they better start dismantling things in a controlled way, you know, like how they brought down the WTC. Controlled demolition. Otherwise, when this info leaks significantly, which it inevitably will, there will be a hellish uprising from citizens.

            @5:56  the complete conclusion of the investigation may take months if not years.

            What?
           </p>
           <p>
            umm, I thought a  case is opened based on data  and
            <strong>
             then
            </strong>
            it proceeds as they compile and collect more depositions and data along the way, which
            <strong>
             then
            </strong>
            could lead to months and/or years of trial.
           </p>
           <p>
            The vid, along with other NYPD sources said they have incriminating evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why aren't charges laid  first and a full hearing and depositions in place?
           </p>
           <p>
            This doesn't make sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Are they waiting in hope that the public will forget or become diverted and move on, relieving them of their duty and actually becoming an enabler?
           </p>
           <p>
            The vid said that if the public knew they'd burn D.C. to ashes.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, the videographer informants are protecting and enabling  (accomplices and compilicit)  to child crimes?
           </p>
           <p>
            This world is a complete psycho planet.  Let's not inform the public because we don't want to upset them  and let's  enable the criminals because we don't want the politician platform destroyed and/or improved?
           </p>
           <p>
            These people are all insane!  This mentality explains why the west is in the shit mess it's in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the vid goes on to say that they will   eventually leak data if nothing is done about it.
Where have I heard this before.  Oh yeah,  every fucking week!  It's a stall to buy time in hope that people will forget and move on!
           </p>
           <p>
            I have no doubt that the information about Weiners laptop is true, but I do doubt the informants will ever do anything to expose it.

             I'm with you for the most part. This is the same info that was floated by FBI anon, Flynn, and a few conservative, fringe, unreliable news websites in October (websites in Oct.). In my opinion, they better start dismantling things in a controlled way, you know, like how they brought down the WTC. Controlled demolition. Otherwise, when this info leaks significantly, which it inevitably will, there will be a hellish uprising from citizens. We could investigate Hillary for the next 20 years, but we only need one solid case to put her away for life, and that would disable the image, reputation, and power of the cabal of which she was the anointed figurehead. We should also go after many others as well, like Podesta, but there are many who will likely get off. I don't care as log as the head of the snake is chopped off and reforms are enacted to prevent this from ever happening again. Instead of prosecutions of the lower bunch, reform/dismantle the CIA and fire and deny pensions to the fed employees.

              I think there should be a hellish uprising because that might wake the people from their lulled   zombie programming. 
They've been at this for so long, duping and playing the world citizens with lies, spin and propaganda, making the public look like their the ones making information up.

             <p>
              Are you asking people not to react to a situation that should warrant a normal reaction ? 
Trying to control the reaction and/or outcome of the public when the politicians they appoint   produce decades of horror-ific outcomes is not a good idea.

                I've read interesting opinions about the French Revolution.  Sadly,  I wasn't there to give an account and I'm sure their propaganda machine was as rabid as this one so we may never know the real truth.
Humanity has been played like a cheap guitar for thousands of years.

               Nah, I'm saying they better start doing substantial investigation and reform, or they're fucked. I would rather avoid social uprising if possible. And it is possible...

                They've definitely given the perps all the time to format answers, shred and delete information and band together to attempt to coordinate responses.   Put all these mofo  suspects in the same room, start asking each one specific questions as they would in an interogation,  and then the truth will come out.  At this point it would have to be performed by multiple nonpartisan investigators because who can trust any of them?

            I don't know if I believe this!
Making this sort of claims, may result in a visit from the FBI!
If they have those names of Pedos, they should release them one at a time, and some verifiable proof. That would be so freaking Awesome!
Yet, not holding my breath.
