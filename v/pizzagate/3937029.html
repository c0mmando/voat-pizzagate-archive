            <p>
             Elizabeth Conway Symons, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean, PC (born 14 April 1951), is a British politician and former General Secretary of the FDA Trade Union and a Minister of State. From 2010, Baroness Symons has served as the Chairman of the Arab British Chamber of Commerce (ABCC).
            </p>
            <p>
             She was created a Labour life peer as Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean, of Vernham Dean in the County of Hampshire on 7 October 1996.[1] From May 1997 to June 1999, she took her first government post, serving as a junior Foreign Office Minister. From 1999 until 2001, she was Minister of State for Defence Procurement and, from 2001 until 2003, Minister of State for Trade. From 2001 until 2005, she was Minister of State for Foreign Affairs with responsibility for the Middle East, International Security, Consular and Personal Affairs, and Deputy Leader of the House of Lords.
            </p>
            <p>
             In office when Tony Blair was prime minister.
            </p>
            <p>
             Symons was or remains a member of the British-American Project (BAP). It has a membership of 600 leaders and opinion formers, drawn equally from both countries, according to The Guardian, and holds an annual conference at which everything that is said is officially off-the-record.[2] also serves on the Board of Governors of the Ditchley Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 2001, she married her long-standing partner, Phil Bassett, a former writer at The Times. They have a son, James, born in 1985.[3] In October 2002, Bassett was appointed to the Strategic Communications Unit in 10 Downing Street, leaving in September 2003 to become special adviser to Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs.

            </h1>
            <p>
             The Guardian alleged in its issue of 9 January 2005 that Symons may have used her office to give "special treatment" to David Mills, husband of Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell. Mills was seeking her assistance in sidestepping a U.S. trade embargo against Iran in order to sell $200 million worth of British Aerospace jets to that country.
            </p>
            <p>
             On 9 February 2006, The Guardian mentioned her as one several former government ministers who had accepted lucrative positions as company directors and consultants. In the case of Symons, the companies involved were British Airways, law firm DLA Piper, and the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&amp;O)

             During the administration of President Bill Clinton in the US, the Australian journalist John Pilger attacked the BAP as an example of "Atlanticist freemasonry." He asserted in November 1998 that "many members are journalists, the essential foot soldiers in any network devoted to power and propaganda."

             First there were the recent Twitter celebrity hacks. NOW I’m predicting Twitter at some point is going to go down altogether.

             People are SO WOKE its not even real. Tweets are for sure going to start mysteriously deleting during an outage.

             <p>
              David Mackenzie Donald Mills (born 31 May 1944)[1][2] is a British corporate lawyer who specialises in international work for Italian companies. He was accused of money-laundering and alleged tax fraud involving Silvio Berlusconi; he was convicted in first instance and on appeal, but the conviction was quashed by the Supreme Court of Cassation.
             </p>
             <p>
              He is the widower of Labour Party politician Tessa Jowell following her death in May 2018. ..According to The Independent, Mills's father Kenneth Mills was a senior spy. At the end of the Second World War Kenneth Mills was running MI5's operations from Gibraltar. Later, he was transferred to Jamaica and—according to a family legend—personally foiled an attempted revolution in Cuba

             Martin Christopher Jarvis (born 20 April 1969 in Romford, London) is an English actor, presenter and writer who has appeared on BBC television since 1992, apart from 2000–2002 when he was working with ITV and Channel 4.
             <strong>
              In 2019 he started a radio station for children called Little Radio.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             He made his name in the early 1990s on Children's BBC, presenting from the "Broom Cupboard" alongside Zoe Ball and Josie d'Arby [1] as well as hosting his own shows like Look Sharp.[2] Chris wrote a lot of material for Children's BBC himself (including the mini soap opera Wood Lane TV) and created several memorable characters including "The Anorak". In 1997, Chris was part of The Friday Zone [3] (which was broadcast on Friday afternoons on BBC One for most of the children's slot) with Debra Stephenson, Peter Simon, Dominic Wood, Steve Rock and Emma Lee. They released a single called "Glasses" as a spin-off from the programme, to raise money for Comic Relief.
            </p>
            <p>
             As an actor Chris Jarvis has appeared in The Demon Headmaster and ChuckleVision, and played Mr Mopple in early CBeebies story-telling programme Step Inside.[6] He also presented Maths Mansion.
