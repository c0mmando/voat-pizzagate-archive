             The Guardian alleged in its issue of 9 January 2005 that Symons may have used her office to give "special treatment" to David Mills, husband of Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell. Mills was seeking her assistance in sidestepping a U.S. trade embargo against Iran in order to sell $200 million worth of British Aerospace jets to that country.

He asserted in November 1998 that "many members are journalists, the essential foot soldiers in any network devoted to power and propaganda."

              David Mackenzie Donald Mills (born 31 May 1944)[1][2] is a British corporate lawyer who specialises in international work for Italian companies. He was accused of money-laundering and alleged tax fraud involving Silvio Berlusconi; he was convicted in first instance and on appeal, but the conviction was quashed by the Supreme Court of Cassation.

              He is the widower of Labour Party politician Tessa Jowell following her death in May 2018. ..According to The Independent, Mills's father Kenneth Mills was a senior spy. At the end of the Second World War Kenneth Mills was running MI5's operations from Gibraltar. Later, he was transferred to Jamaica and—according to a family legend—personally foiled an attempted revolution in Cuba

            <p>
             Martin Christopher Jarvis (born 20 April 1969 in Romford, London) is an English actor, presenter and writer who has appeared on BBC television since 1992, apart from 2000–2002 when he was working with ITV and Channel 4.
             <strong>
              In 2019 he started a radio station for children called Little Radio.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             He made his name in the early 1990s on Children's BBC, presenting from the "Broom Cupboard" alongside Zoe Ball and Josie d'Arby [1] as well as hosting his own shows like Look Sharp.[2] Chris wrote a lot of material for Children's BBC himself (including the mini soap opera Wood Lane TV) and created several memorable characters including "The Anorak". In 1997, Chris was part of The Friday Zone [3] (which was broadcast on Friday afternoons on BBC One for most of the children's slot) with Debra Stephenson, Peter Simon, Dominic Wood, Steve Rock and Emma Lee. They released a single called "Glasses" as a spin-off from the programme, to raise money for Comic Relief.
            </p>
            <p>
             As an actor Chris Jarvis has appeared in The Demon Headmaster and ChuckleVision, and played Mr Mopple in early CBeebies story-telling programme Step Inside.[6] He also presented Maths Mansion.
            </p>

             He is the godfather to one of Pui Fan Lee's sons
