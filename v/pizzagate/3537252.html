<p>Someone is on 4chan right now urging an investigation into a place called Playground Coffee. Zenat Begum is owner. There are a lot of shills in this thread trying to distract and deflect (they are getting creative but are still really obvious). The OP reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could be killed for posting this. I\'ve had to take certain measures to conceal my identity.</p>
<p>I\'ve heard you people are the ones to show this kinda stuff. There\'s not a lot I can say without jeopardizing my identity.</p>
<p>Look into Playgrounds Coffee in Brooklyn. Advertised as a family friendly and &quot;kid friendly&quot; location. See if you can find the blueprints for this place; it will help you discover the truth. Owners have a lot of new wealth, and are more connected than you might think.</p>
<p>I\'m posting this because they\'ve received some unwanted attention recently and I fear they\'re going to bury everything. You\'ve gotta move fast. Archive everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have some very weird and disturbing instagram posts, such as this one which says stuff like &quot;Sam is a tall guy and Svaha is clearly the height of a child. And to think how their bodies had to meet to have this conversation is so warming.&quot;</p>

<p>Closing shop after 20 years in, Zenat took over in 2016.
