<p>In that post I mentioned that a Randy Byrd assaulted Linda Collins-Smith\'s ex-husband Judge Philip Smith. I also mentioned that a person by that same name was arrested in connection with Dr. Richard Duane Johns. Dr. Johns was alleged to have been distributing Oxycodone and Byrd was alleged to be implicated in the drug ring ... AND NOW HE\'S DEAD! </p>

<p>Okay, I can\'t believe this. I just happened to check to see if there are anymore suspicious deaths and found the name of Mr. Byrd.

            Pretty soon no one will want to speak up about PG. Think of what is happening to Assange. He released the podesta emails which for the most part put pizza in a totally different context. The overlords play for keeps. It reminds me of a mop up.  Thanks for bringing this to my attention. You and everyone here are such great researchers.

             Thanks so much. Agree that there are a lot of great researchers on Voat. Some of the posts are truly amazing and have answered a lot of questions as to what is going on.
            </p>
            <p>
             As for Assange, we owe him a debt of gratitude. While I already hated Skankles and The Manchurian Candidate, the emails drew back the curtain and revealed way. And the handlers/overlords do not play around. I really do believe they just needed a couple of stakes in our hearts to get complete control and Skankles winning the presidency was one of them. Re: what is happening to Assange, I keep remember those last few tweets. The one that featured PAPER PLANES and him escaping the embassy by means of a disguise. If our POTUS is the man he purports to be, and the kind most either think he is or hope he is, he will not let Assange fall through the cracks. The picture of Assange in the back of the van speaks volumes.

             I can't say that I trust the plan totally. I don't know what's planned, but out POTUS is promising big doings coming soon. All I can do is hope. So thanks for stopping by and reading this post.

              Whether Assange was part of an intelligence agency or not whether he is an actor or not, concerns I've had in the past as I also have for Snowden, does not take away the fact that he when he released those emails in 2016 he said someone will be going to jail. We got the emails I couldn't make any sense out of them and then someone picked up on the pedo language and that's when I believe all this began in terms of serious acceptance of what conspiracy theorist have been saying for a long time. So yes we definitely owe him some gratitude and yes I will definitely went to jail unfortunately it was him of course we were all looking forward to seeing Clinton in jail that's what I was looking forward to do you remember the release the hype of the release? I remember staying up it was like 2 in the morning or something. Now it doesn't take much to convince people that one of the elites major crimes against humanity is the treatment of children. Something which in the past people with just roll their eyes.

               Yes, we disagree on points, but not on wanting Skankles locked up.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think the thing that most people are forgetting is that Assange wasn't relying on those emails for his information. We relied on them and we read them and decided for ourselves what they meant and what they didn't mean. That's what objective news reporting is about. This was hampered by the use of jargon, but it didn't interfere with Assange's take on things because he knew everything. It's the difference between reading an online exchange between a pedo and a victim he's grooming and actually being in the room when they meet up and observing everything that happens. Assange was the latter. He knew every little thing of what Skankles and the elite cabal have wrought over the years. He knew what was going on in The Manchurian Candidate's White House as concerns those Johnny Depp Wonderland little boy parties. And the $66,000 hot dogs shipped in from Chicago. Top that off with what happened to friend/associate/tipster Set Rich. What I'm saying is that no one was more vested in Skankles being jailed than Assange. Hence prompting her ''drone him'' suggestion. Should that be ''Arkandrone him''? Not sure, but what I am sure of is that he knows all and he's key to busting this thing wide open.

                 Yes, I would also.

                <p>
                 As for the countries mentioned, we don't know anything yet. Assange posted videos as Ecuador being helpful. They were enigmatic, but the thrust was that. As for the UK, it could be US intel (the white hats this time) picked up something big planned for Assange. That would require everyone to move quickly. Right now, it could just be that the safest place to keep him is on ice in a maximum security prison.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So we don't know. Everything is conjecture, and this story can be twisted fifty different ways. But why would he run those videos? This was just before he went dark. Lots of people go dark to keep safe so maybe Ecuador ''forcing'' him to go dark was part of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let's hope there is a plan and that it works.

                   I think it's derived for how crucial he is and those videos. If he hadn't posted them ... I don't know what I would think. Maybe that's why he did it. Maybe not. But remember the Harry Lime videos? He's out and about with his cat. Embassy cat. ???? Yes, I'll keep positive.

                     No. these were videos posted by Assange on his Twitter account. It was his twitter account and it's the one that got shut down and the one he put the encryption key on
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     It was a couple of months before Ecuador cut off his communication that he started posting videos. Paper Planes was one. Song is by MIA. Then came the Harry Lime music and Harry Lime in the alleyway being discovered by following the cat. Then there were hints to soccer and him being on the Ecuadorian soccer team. Then there was this really interesting one about him changing his appearance with make up and leaving the embassy anytime he wanted.

                    <p>
                     Sorry you missed them. They might not have been deleted who knows. Set the dates for maybe the last six months before Ecuador pulled the plug just to be sure. But I think Paper Planes had a couple of submissions on Voat. I might be wrong there. Could have been another forum.

            Another one that knew too much.  With his checkered background would not be surprised if he was involved in her death.  This is certainly a strange set of circumstances.  Do these people really think they are going to be allowed to live after being their henchmen?

             I know exactly what you mean. Especially if he there was more to that ''assault'' on Philip Smith, Linda Collins-Smith's ex-husband. Were they leaning on him to ''handle'' his wife? Did they have something on him? I'm still wondering what he did to get barred from judicial jobs.

              Whenever THEY are involved it is always a mess.  A conflagration of never ending rat lines and happenings that are almost impossible to figure out.  That is how they roll.

                I dream of the day that Hill and Bill get what’s coming to them. Many want them to hang from the rafters but let’s get real. Doubt it so I just want them locked up to the point where they can’t run their operation from jail cell.

                 I don't want them hurt. I want them locked away and for everyone to know exactly what they're like. I want incontrovertible evidence to prove what they've been doing. It's hard to believe it will happen. I see absolutely no progress. None. Oh, wait ... yes, I did see progress. That article about what's going on in Arkansas is very heartening. Things are just taking time because of the Deep State and because the press is no longer independent. They're propagandists for the elite cabal. It gives one a distorted view of what is actually going on. It's why I follow our POTUS on Twitter. I want to hear what he and people like Jim Jordan say.

             Pelosi?   Her father was connected to organized crime

            <p>
             Nancy Pelosi’s father Thomas D’Alesandro Jr. allegedly was a “constant companion” of notorious mobster Benjamin “Benny Trotta” Magliano and other underworld figures during his political years in Baltimore, MD.  D’Alesandro was a Congressman for five terms from 1938 to 1947, and Baltimore mayor for three terms from 1947 to 1959.   Magliano was identified by the FBI as one of Baltimore’s “top hoodlums,” and he widely was acknowledged as the representative for New York’s Frankie Carbo who made his bones with Murder, Inc. and later became a made guy in the Lucchese family.  The allegations are included in D’Alesandro’s recently-released FBI files which Friends of Ours has obtained pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once a family is connected to them, they are always connected.  Did Nancy ask for a favor?

            im going to give you the sole example of where i know a tyre 'blew out' and im talking about BARRY SHEENE having a massive accident at Daytona
            <em>
             testing
            </em>
            experimental tyres. He was at 200kmh+ on a banked speedway, the tyre expanded and jammed up against the frame throwing him off.
           </p>
           <p>
            he survived.
           </p>
           <p>
            he woke up literally with his foot next to his face but he survived.

              tyre blowouts happen when the tyre has been driven around underinflated.
             </p>
             <p>
              the walls flex backwards and forwards and weaken eventually blowing out. this happens a lot on cars because people are dumb and dont do anything about slow leaks etc and keep on driving, the car pulls to one side and they dont worry about it. TRUCKS are a bit of a danger, trailer tyres blow out a lot and if you were on a motorcycle next to that then youre in trouble, that shit can take your head off.
             </p>
             <p>
              to get that happening on a motorcycle you would have to be riding it around for months with almost flat tyres which would make most motorcycles unrideable anyway and there is
              <em>
               far far far far far
              </em>
              less weight on those than a car or truck. so i just dont see it happening. if it did, what would happen?
             </p>
             <p>
              Well - a front blow out in a straight line you either drop the front end or it jams up and you go over the handlebars pretty heavily maybe get the bike on top of you afterwards, either way, its one of the more serious falls you can have, wrist snapping, back and neck slamming against pavement, not nice, you probably wont walk away but youd have to be doing light speed for it to instantly kill you. On a corner? You would lose the front end and lowside, which would be sliding out of the corner, easily survivable unless you slide under something coming the other way, normally just hip or leg injuries, maybe arms, rarely a heavy enough knock to the head to seriously fuck you as long as you have a helmet.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rear end? well youd just lose the back end, around a corner youve got nothing to grip so you wont high side (rear end slides, grabs, flips you over, pretty bad, not as bad as front or rear impact) on a straight, highly likely you could actually keep the bike upright and bring it to a stop even if the wheel is locked up (again, Sheene, banked corner, 200kmh, heat expanded the fuck out of an experimental tyre and it expanded into the frame, nothing really strange about it, just very unlucky)

               The whole thing is bizarre. And, the thing is, that with all these people turning up dead ... including 32-year-olds from ''natural causes'' ... I wouldn't believe anything other than they're cleaning up loose ends. The timing is all too coincidental.

             Yes, CPS seems the hub of ripping children out of homes. The fact there's no real oversight continues to amaze me. There's case after case of children who are actually being abused winding up dead all because CPS failed to take action. But there are no repercussions for it. Nothing except, perhaps, a flashy news story that goes away in a couple of days. With the outrage gone, CPS returns to business as usual.

              It all started with the Family Act during Clinton's reign.  Walter Mondale and Newt Gingrich take the blame for pushing and  getting it passed.  There are parts of it that allow them to do what they do.  They are allowed to collect money for each child they place into a home.  Think about it.  Many of them are placed many times.  Those Children are  on a merry go round just to make money.

               It's a dreadful piece of legislation and the ones being hurt are the children.

               I can't believe everyone will turn a blind eye to child abuse in order to make a buck. Although, there are probably those that don't. Most likely they're the ones gotten rid of so all the workers and staff will be on the same page.

                 That is beyond depraved. I'm always struggling for words to describe how horrible these things are. I so hope these people get what's coming to them. I fear they won't, but I've been wrong before.

                  Yeah for real. Going through a tough move right now or I’d have time to post the old info. I was amazed at finding it even knowing how depraved Emanuel is. My friend lives there and is saying that things will be kept as horrible as usual even with new mayor. They want to keep business as usual so they can keep lining their pockets. Depravity is a good description 
of what they are doing to the people that live in those hoods. I keep track because of my intense hatred of the Emanuels. Rahm since his Clinton days Zeke since he was architect of the Affordable Care Act and Ari since finding out his horrid past in the CDAN Bl.  Sorry for the rant. Hard to stop when it comes to them.

                   The frustration has to come out. These people are so obviously scum. I think seeing them locked up and put away will relieve a lot of this. Just to shove a paper featuring their conviction will be great to have in your pocket or purse. Run into a lib, and just whip it out and say, ''There and there and there!'' It'll be rejuvenating. :Like a decade spent at the best spa.

             </p>
             <p>
              When I heard about Centurion Aviation above, it connected a few dots for me... Devos also created (and runs with an iron fist) a massive annual art event here in Grand Rapids called ArtPrize that is a well-known hot spot for sex trafficking each year; so much so that groups warn females not to go to the massive event alone...
             </p>
             <p>
              Basically, underage teens are enticed or sometimes forced to become prostitutes during the event, many are used by high-profile 'clients' that are in town for the event, and I have seen many times quite young looking women dressed provocatively entering the Devos property. Not children, but teens/college girls. I used to live with a friend right down the road from one of Devos' homes.

             I mean- It doesn't make sense that'd he'd be riding a motorcycle If he knew he was at risk to get suicided.... So either he knew he wasn't at risk, It was an actual accident, or he faked his death.

              Follow the wives.  I've sort of worked out the business relationships between the two when corruption is involved and the front companies that the wives set up to cover for the spouse's corruption.. could work the other way around I'm sure.
