<p>&quot;You kids are gonna fry like (BABY MUMMIES...)&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is what it looks like when I sweet talk first twin <strong>Barbara Bush</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Barbara B</strong>,</p>
<p>I\'m sorry for putting you in an awkward position. It would have been an awkward position for me to put you in in high school if I had wanted to make a contact that validated my uncle\'s college experience and how that reflects on me, which is why I avoided you and Jenna and went to McCallum. It didn\'t turn out like I had imagined which is why I have second thoughts about making a contact that validates my heritage, but I know I am in less of a position to keep your attention. Its not likely that you are gonna allow me to introduce myself as the nephew of a Yalie 1968 grad in your father\'s class and be given all the opportunity in the world to bond with you out of similar known fate with you because that reference has become passe.
I would still like to though. This is hard for me because I don\'t know if you read what I write you. It could be all going to your Other folder or you refuse to acknowledge what I am saying by reading it. Anyways, I loved my mother to death and I am desperate for a symbolic victory for me romantically through my vicarious standard for a worthy young lady through her example, and you are the obvious go to. I really think I can get into Yale and if I can I think you should take to me given my matching your alma mater, but that would require a drastic commitment from you, to make my acquaintance in a way that would give me an opportunity to date and court you while I am just beginning to account for my providence as a man and eligibility toward the female sex.
I just want to say, I admire what you do with Global Health Corps and I am deeply attracted to you, which is legitimate considering all your positive attributes I assure you, so if you see something worth taking, I can guarantee you I am going to make the most of my potential. I love you, and I could die on the spot if you were willing to administer the phenomenal experience of becoming married to me, because it would mean I was so complete, although I would also look forward to enjoying you for the entire rest of my life, in the justice you could potentially do for me accounting for such a universal variable as fate or destiny.</p>

<p>There\'s almost a book in that link. <strong>He quotes illuminatis, rape, sadism and SHIT</strong>. He has some weird shit in the eye too, like Caris James, like McCann and Soros. IM FUCKING SCARED RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p>Some quotes from Kindle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Weroance shared from The Illuminatus! Trilogy: The Eye in the Pyramid, The Golden Apple, Leviathan by Robert Shea
I made breakfast in a pretty nasty mood, wondering if I’d seen the fnords, whatever the hell they were, in the hours he had blacked out, or if I would see them as soon as I went out in the street. I had some pretty gruesome ideas about them, I must admit. Creatures with three eyes and tentacles, survivors from Atlantis, who walked among us, invisible due to some form of mind shield, and did hideous work for the Illuminati.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Weroance shared from Intercourse by Andrea Dworkin
Women are property; adultery, rape, and some forms of incest hurt the rightful owners of the women by damaging the value of the goods or by violating the man’s integrity through violating his legal and deeply felt personal right of private, exclusive sexual access. Following the rules lets men have sexual access to subjugated women while moderating male-male conflict over that access.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Weroance shared from Intercourse by Andrea Dworkin
And with the great wound, the vagina, moved to the throat, there is, like a shadow, the haunting resonance of the blood-soaked vagina, in menstruation, in childbirth; bleeding when a virgin and fucked. While alive the women are virgins in the long duration of the first fuck, the draining of their blood over time one long, lingering sex act of penetration and violation; after death, they are carnal, being truly sexed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Weroance shared from Intercourse by Andrea Dworkin
In The Kreutzer Sonata, the husband sees the wife with some empathy, as human, only after he has brutally murdered her: “‘I looked at the children and at her bruised and disfigured face, and for the first time I forgot myself, my rights, my pride, and for the first time saw a human being in her.’”23 Art is merciful.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Please, read this one!!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Weroance shared from Refusing to be a Man: Essays on Social Justice by John Stoltenberg
At issue: child sexual assault. They calculate the age at which the diameter of a child’s vagina can accommodate a grown man’s penis. They think it’s eight. Or they don’t bother to calculate.&quot;</p>

           . He has some weird shit in the eye too, like Caris James, like McCann and Soros. IM FUCKING SCARED RIGHT NOW.

           Some quotes from Kindle:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "Weroance shared from The Illuminatus! Trilogy: The Eye in the Pyramid, The Golden Apple, Leviathan by Robert Shea
I made breakfast in a pretty nasty mood, wondering if I’d seen the fnords, whatever the hell they were, in the hours he had blacked out, or if I would see them as soon as I went out in the street. I had some pretty gruesome ideas about them, I must admit. Creatures with three eyes and tentacles, survivors from Atlantis, who walked among us, invisible due to some form of mind shield, and did hideous work for the Illuminati."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Weroance shared from Intercourse by Andrea Dworkin
Women are property; adultery, rape, and some forms of incest hurt the rightful owners of the women by damaging the value of the goods or by violating the man’s integrity through violating his legal and deeply felt personal right of private, exclusive sexual access. Following the rules lets men have sexual access to subjugated women while moderating male-male conflict over that access."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Weroance shared from Intercourse by Andrea Dworkin
And with the great wound, the vagina, moved to the throat, there is, like a shadow, the haunting resonance of the blood-soaked vagina, in menstruation, in childbirth; bleeding when a virgin and fucked. While alive the women are virgins in the long duration of the first fuck, the draining of their blood over time one long, lingering sex act of penetration and violation; after death, they are carnal, being truly sexed."
           </p>
           <p>
            "Weroance shared from Intercourse by Andrea Dworkin
In The Kreutzer Sonata, the husband sees the wife with some empathy, as human, only after he has brutally murdered her: “‘I looked at the children and at her bruised and disfigured face, and for the first time I forgot myself, my rights, my pride, and for the first time saw a human being in her.’”23 Art is merciful."
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Please, read this one!!
           </strong>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            "Weroance shared from Refusing to be a Man: Essays on Social Justice by John Stoltenberg
At issue: child sexual assault. They calculate the age at which the diameter of a child’s vagina can accommodate a grown man’s penis. They think it’s eight. Or they don’t bother to calculate."

            <p>
             "Weroance shared from Refusing to be a Man: Essays on Social Justice by John Stoltenberg:
            </p>
            <p>
             Men as a class know that their social and cultural and economic advantage over and against women depends absolutely upon the continuance of involuntary pregnancy, involuntary gestation, involuntary parturition, and involuntary child rearing. Men know that the very continuity of their gender class—the continuity of “masculinity” as a distinct and imperious gender identity and the continuity of “men” as a distinct and imperious power bloc—requires that everyone born without a penis live her whole life palpably circumscribed and controlled by the will of anyone born with a penis."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Weroance shared from The Illuminatus! Trilogy: The Eye in the Pyramid, The Golden Apple, Leviathan by Robert Shea:
            </p>
            <p>
             “About this gnosis,” Saul asked, “is it the orthodox theological position that the illuminations or visions were actually coming from the Devil and not from God?” “Yes. That’s where Manicheanism enters the picture,” Father Muldoon said. “The Manicheans made exactly the same charge against the orthodox church. According to their way of looking at it, the God of orthodox Christianity and orthodox Judaism, was the Devil. The god they contacted through their own peculiar rites was the real god. This, of course, is still the teaching of Satanists today."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Weroance shared from Intercourse by Andrea Dworkin:
            </p>
            <p>
             In many cultures and tribes, men can be similarly possessed; and the key to the possession—the dreams, the sex, the physical reality of desire, the obsession—is that the woman herself is magical and evil; through wickedness and magic she exerts illegitimate (therefore magical; therefore wicked; therefore originating in Satan) power over men."
            </p>
            <p>
             "Weroance shared from Servant of the Bones by Anne Rice:
            </p>
            <p>
             “I recall in Paris a clever satanic magician in a room full of gaslight. The wallpaper was most intriguing to me. A strange black coat hung on a hook. Life almost tempted me. Gaslight and machines; carriages rolling on cobbled streets. But I killed the mysterious man and retreated once more into the bones."

            The kid is bi-polar (hugely). From the Stratfor email, this "Gray" cc'd his Dad on the rant. Father says "thanks for letting me know, I had such hopes for the new medication." 
Adding here, if the guy is a little loopy, often there are streaks of truth in the "perception of reality." Any shrinks/psychologists here who can comment?
