<p>Look at this bullshit. It says its debunked because of news sources saying it\'s debunked but with no actual claims to explain how it\'s debunked. What the fuck? It says extended protection otherwise I would edit it myself. Can anyone bypass this bullshit?</p>

<p>Debunking</p>

            I expect edit wars, conflicts of interest, etc... but this is a move by the admin to push the notion that Pizzagate is proven to be false, which we all know is complete bollocks.

            Even if you could, there is no point in editing it other than to annoy the admin - it'll be reverted within a minute. They're pushing the fake news agenda, they can't even maintain neutrality by saying something simple like "an ongoing online debate which has been rebuked by mainstream media", they have to use the term "debunked" which is what I'd call a "weasel word" and that is known to be bad form on Wikipedia. Everything about the way they've handled this is counter to what Wikipedia is supposed to be - neutral. Basically, they're fucked just like Twitter and Reddit are.
