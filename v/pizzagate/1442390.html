            Anyone realized that AJ in doing Controlled damage for the Zionist agenda, he NEVER reports information before it comes out, yet he boasts about all his sources, he is there to make the people who are believe in conspiracy theories seem crazy and out of touch with reality, watch the BBC interview with AJ
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgBq6q4x8Fw">
             https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgBq6q4x8Fw
            </a>
            , he says that the EU and the Euro is a Nazi concept, which it isn't is a Zionist concept, and before the mods try to censor this, this is fact not me being anti-Semitic, you have two different ideologies, Zionist uses the Jewish religion to achieve it's goals, saying you hate Zionism is different from saying you hate Jews, your regular Jew is more likely than not a very nice person, but Zionists take advantage of the religion for political goals.

             Fear mongering.  Normally he does it to sell his overpriced products, but I guess you have to maintain the brand.

             I seriously don't get why people don't see through his shit.  He's a con man through and through.

            I wholeheartedly disagree.  I got 3 minutes into it and I found at least 2 instances of misinformation.  I wrote about it in another comment, linked
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1442390/6966541">
             here
            </a>
            -- linked so I don't spam the comment section with the same thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Considering this is the beginning of the video that is supposed to introduce people to the investigation, I think it's pretty damn important not to make unsubstantiated and/or misleading claims.

           <p>
            @2:35
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             "[and then] you rewatch the Post articles where the Podestas are talking about how they love to photograph the naked kids in their neighborhood..."
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            What the fuck is he talking about?
           </p>
           <p>
            And then earlier in the video, @1:38
           </p>
           <p>
            "It's so horrible, that I just said, 'What is this?'
            <strong>
             It's like photos of kids at parties with images of people bleeding to death, with women wearing satanic outfits drinking blood
            </strong>
            , and then Podesta says 'I'll see you at the spirit cooking dinner,' and it's the most dark form  of black magic that Alistair Crowley was involved in."
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, what the fuck is he talking about?
           </p>
           <p>
            Note how he uses "it's like photos of kids" then "
            <em>
             with
            </em>
            images of people bleeding to death".  These are weasel words.  He's technically not saying there are photos of these things, just that it's as if there were.  He's also technically saying they're two separate things, that is photos of kids and images of people bleeding to death, but making it sound (by tone of delivery) like there's kids at parties
            <em>
             viewing
            </em>
            images of people bleeding to death.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's blurring the line between fact and fiction and it's a detriment to this investigation.
           </p>
           <p>
            And these are both not even 3 minutes into a 30 minute video.
           </p>

            Alex Jones is a fucking snake.

           <p>
            WHAT IS THE AJ Agenda on #PizzaGate?
           </p>
           <p>
            BIG LIE by Alex Jones is there are 1,000's of emails mentioning Pizza, nope maybe a few dozen at best, I have personally read the wiki dumps a month ago when they first came out
           </p>
           <p>
            ...
Download all 60,000 Podesta dumps in bulk, and run a text search with GREP -I Pizza, you will get less than a few dozen mentions of  pizza, not 1,000's as AJ says in this video

             Sure he exaggerates.  And not just on that issue. He embellished what some of the emails said. He's a shock jock and it's his character. Doesn't detract from the 99% of things he said I agreed with, or the fact he is taking a risk covering this to his massive MASSIVE audience. InfoWars covering PizzaGate in nearly a dozen segments now, is BIG. It's very positive. I don't get the constant pissing in AJ, unless it's disinfo or butthurt purist "but he never mentions da jooos" nonsense.

            I saw a video of a protester who Alefantis let inside and showed around. The place has been scrubbed. All the artwork has been taken down, the bathroom is crystal clean (about 20 yelp reviews mentioned it being filthy like a truck stop), the backroom is normal. Clearly they scrambled to clean up all the evidence. If you want my guess, if there's any evidence it's underground. Or not even there anymore.

             Another BIG LIE by Alex Jones is there are 1,000's of emails mentioning Pizza, nope maybe a few dozen at best, I have personally read the wiki dumps a month ago when they first came out, I came over to these sites to see how people were interpreting the dumps.
            </p>
            <p>
             So why would AJ lie about pizza? Only because he has an agenda, to make it appear that code words of pizza are rampant in the entire DNC, which or course is NOT true.
            </p>
            <p>
             In fact of the 60,000 Podesta dumps, the majority are sincere posts between friends with no context of code, I'm talking over 99%.

            Comet Ping-Pong is not the problem, the problem is that AIPAC-FBI have  black-mailed US-GOV in DC for 50+ years using child sex slavery rings.  Until this history is cleansed the entire DC GOV purged, not a fuck will change in DC.

           <p>
            Note it was the CIA itself that since 1940's has been using NAZI-SS operation-paperclip operatives to murder and fuck babys, why would the CIA out their own Mk-Ultra history?? They are simply throwing comet-pizza under the bus, but no baby fucker in the white house will be harmed.
