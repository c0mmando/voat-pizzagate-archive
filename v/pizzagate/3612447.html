<p>Humanrights.org estimates that each trafficked child nets his or her handlers $100,000 a year.

It helped ensure silence, cooperation, suffering and death: a sex-trafficked child lives about seven years.</p>
<p>These are some of our videos of dead kids walking.</p>
<p>Herkimer Child Traffickers Relocate</p>
<p>August  2016,  Herkimer’s long-time major child traffickers moved their final lot of kids through their 341 Eureka Avenue trafficking hub.  For months, we’d been the target of a successful campaign of  distraction that kept our security cam and our attention away from that neighboring lot. Only on the regional traffickers’ last day did we swing our backyard camera  on them, puzzled by the large  number of kids who’d suddenly appeared next door. They were whisked away almost as soon after they’d appeared.</p>
<p>“It’s just kids.” Trafficked Kids – Herkimer NY 8/14/16</p>
<p>This is the last consignment of kids being shipped through this Herkimer child trafficking transfer hub at 341 Eureka Avenue. It was a consolidation of three carloads of trafficked children. We had never before seen that many kids passing through at one time. The three vehicles then loaded up and moved on. The property was never used again as a major child trafficking hub.</p>
<p>days later the two young traffickers you see in the video, dubbed by us Little Mama and Pretty Boy, cleaned out and turned Herkimer’s premier child trafficking spot over to their most visible local ally, Stanley Sykes and his gang, for their own drug and child trafficking use. Stanley was heard to bellow that he paid a franchise fee for the trafficking rights. </p>
<p>Herkimer a Haven for Child Trafficking</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that Herkimer, which has shrugged off wholesale drug trafficking, street assaults and waves of poison gas attacks, might not strain to see child trafficking in its many guises. Folks in this rural New York village have long been conditioned to mind their own business.</p>
<p>Herkimer Child Trafficking Stats</p>
<p>Only after Little Mama and Pretty Boy were gone did we realize that for over 2 years, we’d seen them trafficking about 20 – 40 children a week, right next door, with their Herkimer allies running interference. </p>
<p>It’s estimated by humanrights.org that each sexually exploited trafficked child nets on average $100,000 a year to his or her captors. The potential profit  from the 1000 – 2000 children annually trafficked through Herkimer would be $100-200 million.</p>
<p>Herkimer NY – Bustling Child Trafficking Hub</p>
<p>Herkimer’s ideally sited for the center of an extensive child trafficking network. It’s just off of Route I-90, the New York State Turnpike, a major interstate, and within a few hours of New York, Boston and Canada. </p>
<p>We believe what we saw was primarily a brokerage operation, using Herkimer as a way point for newly acquired kids trafficked to Herkimer from Central New York and beyond, then quickly redistributed to the south and east to be broken in to serve the booming underground sex industry of our major metropolitan areas. </p>
<p>The needs of Herkimer area pedophiles are serviced by our regional gangs,  who sell, trade and rent local kids. They and the big time child traffickers appear to honor their non-compete agreements and cooperate on projects of mutual benefit, such as the production of online kiddie porn.</p>

            . The individual writing this blog appears to be mentally unsound. They make wild and defamatory claims about their neighbors with little to no actual evidence, such as
            <a href="https://herkimerpost.com/index.php/2017/12/08/herkimer-poison-gas-attacks-good-news-bad-news/">
             this post
            </a>
            about "poisonous gas" based on security camera footage of what looks like a sprinkler.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's also no evidence of production of child porn, or any criminal record presented for any of the individuals this person names (despite that information being public record, if it exists). There is also no connection to elite child trafficking. I could remove this per Rule 1; but I think it better to leave it up with the flair, for future reference.
