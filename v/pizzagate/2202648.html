<p>Weinstein is a Scientologist. </p>
<p>I never knew who he was until recently but I could have sworn I saw his face at a VIP party for CCHR several years ago. I also saw Michelle Stafford on the MOCA photos from that Spirit Cooking art fundraiser put on by Abramovic and she is someone I knew within Scientology when I was invited to lobby with CCHR (I was never a Scientologist and never wanted to be, I was just an anti-drug activist). I will probably get sued for this, but I am a dry rock. I do think I have been a target for some time now, and I am in fear for myself and my family. </p>

So is this dude. I know him. His name is Doyle Mills. I need help tracking down the BOLO for this, as I only stumbled on this on a YouTube video and I am not sure where it came from. But there are other threads on this guy on Voat. And a few on my websites. </p>

<p>Thanks to MAGABoomer for sending me to the anonymous message board here: to discuss this photo of the naked kid on his lap <a href="https://whyweprotest.net/threads/doyle-mills-osabot.78333/page-2">https://whyweprotest.net/threads/doyle-mills-osabot.78333/page-2</a>, where I received my first death threats of the year. Threats that I deserve to &quot;lose my kids to CPS and die in a fire.&quot;</p>
<p>MAGA Boomer was shilling hard against the Podesta video &quot;Fatherhood web&quot; actually being John Podesta. He is the one who sent me there. I was then threatened with the above. </p>
<p>MAGABoomer was later banned from this forum for posting child porn.</p>
<p>Doyle Mills was listed as working with &quot;KP Ghost Productions&quot; and he is a traveler around the country. He likes to befriend people and become their child\'s godfather. Kinda like James Alefantis does. </p>
<p>If Hollywood is PedoWood and Harvey Weinstein is considered &quot;God&quot; by the woman who loves Roman Polanski, then it follows that Harvey Weinstein is the high priest of Scientology Pedophilia Entertainment industry. The disney connection of supplying children via Weinstein to pedos is obviously going to implicate all of Elsagate. </p>
<p>Doyle Mills is &quot;OSA&quot; at Scientology. I asked my ex friend why I was getting death threats after posting on the Anonymous board about Mills, and what OSA means, and what I got soon thereafter was more stalking, in person, and via phone and web.</p>
<p>Kamil Bryant, the owner of boychat, doxxed me on Twitter. I later noticed after I had reported him extensively, to the Secret Service and FBI etc., that their website was taken down. </p>
<p>Beylant knew where I lived. I contacted the police and FBI. Later, when I called to talk to the FBI about some more incidents, the FBI lady laughed at me and hung up on me. The local police are investigating. I\'ve been getting stalked ever since, and I am passing the torch here. Most recent stalking as recently as a few days ago. Today I posted the Lisa Irwin stuff again on Twitter and Facebook and now my Photoshop application won\'t even allow me to cut and paste the picture I wanted to do into a new document, and I know how to use it as I am a graphic designer. </p>
<p>I have already restarted my computer.</p>
<p>Also, I\'m pretty sure either Kamil Beylant or John Podesta or Doyle\'s daughter in the Ukraine has a copy of my email, my entire family\'s names, etc. </p>
<p>It has been real, Pizzagaters. </p>
<p>Discuss. </p>
<p>Mod please do not delete, as I will be adding more links as necessary after putting my children to bed.</p>',

            Take a Gander at this.   Lots of children all kinds.  All ages.  A baby  with blond hair, probably a boy all of a sudden appears and a boy and girl doing homework are in many pictures.  A little girl with stuffed animals is in about three pictures and then no more.  A teen boy and maybe a couple more.  He is holding a tiny little pair of white baby booties with little teddy bears on them.  Where aare all these kids coming from and to whom do they belong.  Something very strange in quite a few pictures is that he is holding an airline ticket.  These are all for different places.  Are thy messages of some kind to someone.  I am on the way?  I dont know but there are quite a few.   All the different children is what really bothers me.   I remember seeing before that he had a video  of a little girl asleep in her bed and it was so close up you could see her breathing.  It scared me.  Knowing what I know and what many of us know about him.

              Yes, I noticed other children than what you mentioned.  Mostly with blond hair.  But I will never forget that little  girl in the video, so close you could see her breathing and almost hear her too.  I think it is telling that his IG is still up, I think he is feeling protected  by his "clients".

               That was his other goddaughter. The last time I saw him he was having a hard time getting that woman to let him come over and see them and she lives in a town very close to me. She had stopped returning his texts. I did not see her on the IG much after that, I think the mom must have figured it out.

                Thank God.  That group, single Mothers is a very important group to reach and educate. I think people still believe sex offenders don't live near schools, they showed on the news that a whole bunch lived near this one school where a girl was attacked.  Police were going around and warning people.  Singe Moms still are too trusting, many know, many do not.  I am so glad that one knows.  It is better to be lonely than dead or without a child.  These perverts know how to charm that is for sure.

            In your opinion, are these photos of Megyn Kelly examples of duper's delight? Why was she photographed with Weinstein?

            The Specific MOCA Auction photos seem to have all been scrubbed including my own slimg archives. This guest list I found here on Voat 9https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1557498) is incomplete, as I have somewhere on my laptop, a photo of Michelle Stafford at the event. When searching Voat it seems that the videos of this event were all taken down from YouTube as were the slimg archives. There are still a select few on Google. DOes anyone have a good link for a video with all the leaked photos?

            There isn't any evidence presented here that would indicate Weinstein is a Scientologist.  However, Scientology has done some truly evil shit to hildren and deserves to be heavily scrutinized.  It very well may be that it has been an avenue for pimping children out to Hollywood power brokers.  In Scientology, children are considered small-scale adults, which leads to a whole lot of insane shit.  Also, there's this:
            <a href="https://tonyortega.org/2017/10/14/coming-to-grips-with-scientologys-most-vile-secret-which-was-hiding-in-plain-sight/">
             https://tonyortega.org/2017/10/14/coming-to-grips-with-scientologys-most-vile-secret-which-was-hiding-in-plain-sight/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            The connection to Abramovic likewise is unsubstantiated in this post but is something that could potentially exist.  LRH, before he created Scientology, lived with a pack of Alaistair Crowley disciples who practiced sex magic, people who were trying to create the anti-Christ.  There isn't a lot out there about this, but what has been said is very disturbing.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for connections between Scientology and the rest of Hollywood, I believe they're there but the church's influence has waned heavily.  The more likely reason for similarities in the way these people circle the wagons and deal with each other and the outside world is that both Hollywood and Scientology are "high control groups," or cults.
           </p>
           <p>
            If anybody wants a good starting point for this shit, you should check out Tony Ortega's blog, tonyortega.com.  There are a number of other people who comment but Tony, as a journalist and not a cult member, seems to be a bit more objective.

Michelle Stafford is a scientologist and she was at the MOCA Auction with the spirit cooking theme, I have screenshots, but will have to find them. L Ron was a Satanist and believed himself The Beast. Parsons, Hubbard and some other people were all friends as you say.

             One aspect of this is that they want people to look away from the false flag operations taking place for what they are, and think it's just a bunch of people hopped up on antidepressants. Yes those can make you kill, but that doesn't mean that the CIA didn't invent those drugs and that the deep state isn't doing terrorist shootings and false flags.

             It's where they deliver the top secret level of their Bridge to Total Freedom.  It's creepy as fuck but for more mundane reasons; they use it to isolate you so they can soak you for donations, as well as protect their Satanic bullshit.  (The first round of OT VIII was Hubbard declaring himself the anti-Christ).

            I've always said the entire conspiracy has to do with scientology. The way they go after people (the left and scientology) is the exact same. Operation white snow showed how many people they had in the government. They are very obvious about how many people in hollywood they have on their side. Seems obvious.

            Scientology is MindKontrolUltra in action, just watch Leah Remini discussing the cult aspects, the levels of trust, and indoctrination.  Using depression as the hook Scientologists collect family info using their auditing process.  That information is stored and used when needed to further the cause. For example, using followers to harass the agents and their families to get Scientology recognized as a religion just to get tax exempt status.

            Scientology is connected to The Masons, LDS, Joseph Smith and the Romney Family the are all connected.  Believe it or not when I was researching the Romney ancestors, they had to leave the US because of the change of the laws regarding Mormon marriage, and they moved to Mexico, when things were relaxed Mitt Romney's father came back and settled in Michigan and was elected Gov.  But when I looked up Samuel Romney there was a part of the Wiki page that listed Cheney as a relative.  These people are all connected and I believe the religions just as the Catholic religion where are started for a reason by these opportunists.

              Thank you.  We should also go back to researching Doyle Mills and what happened to him.  He was stalking the child of some woman in Az.  A dangerous pedophile.

               He still lives in Clearwater but travels for work. He uses AirBnB to find families to target when he travels for work. His company is called Digital Lightwave. One of the kids he was after was mine. But now it's moved on to others as far as I know. He tries to do the direct grooming method but based on the BOLO I stumbled on he could also potentially be actually kidnapping kids. I was watching his instagram for a while and it is still public. His main tag line on instagram is "Until direct thought transference is worked out, pictures are the best way to share the beauty of the world with others." then he puts the link to the website for the Pave the Way Foundation, which is some kind of weird NWO foundation nobody has ever heard of besides people who know people on the board. When I was first introduced to him it was like this, "hi Amy, welcome to CCHR, here is someone you need to meet" and then he was like, "Hi I am a board member of the Pave the Way Foundation" "What's that?" "Well we are going to unite all religions."
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, he can be seen giving the secret handshake to two popes. I will add more pics soon. But look at his instagram and the Anon thread on Why We Protest that I posted above, that has the photos of the popes, and the naked kid he put on instagram.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you go to his instagram you can see how he likes to try to be close to the kids at all times. Most of them are not his kids, but two of them are his grandchildren through his step-daughter.
              </p>
              <p>
               He comes off as a nice guy at first, until you get a few years into the friendship and he starts trying to cuddle with and drool on your kid.
              </p>
              <p>
               The KP Ghost productions thing I believe is a code for Kiddie Porn. When I looked at that person's page it was bizarre and creepy and seemed like the product of some kind of fetishist or mentally ill person. He is always posting photos of himself with a camera. Different ones sometimes that seem more like webcams or something.
              </p>
              <p>
               I don't know why he leaves his IG public for so long after all this as I am 100% sure he knows I outed him on my websites but I assume it is for marketing his stupid NWO kid supplying business to the other pedos.

              Thanks for that.  I have long believed that many stars and others were agents for either our country, the  British, or Russia. It was interesting to read about Errol Flynn.  Disgusting human being.  If you can even categorize these idiots as human.  Trying to insert satan into a fetus = Total Insanity.  If these religious zealots were ever analyzed  by a psychiatrist, they would have been declared INSANE.
