<p>Mods, it\'s Pizzagate-related because Pizzagate involves the &quot;elite&quot; hypocrites in our government.  It\'s clearly time to dig into old Al Franken to see what else he might possibly be hiding in his closet. . . .

<p><strong>SENATOR AL FRANKEN KISSED AND GROPED ME WITHOUT MY CONSENT, AND THERE\'S NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT</strong></p>
<p>By Leeann Tweeden</p>
<p>In December of 2006, I embarked on my ninth USO Tour to entertain our troops, my eighth to the Middle East since the 9/11 attacks. My father served in Vietnam and my then-boyfriend (and now husband, Chris) is a pilot in the Air Force, so bringing a ‘little piece of home’ to servicemembers stationed far away from their families was both my passion and my privilege.</p>
<p>Also on the trip were country music artists Darryl Worley, Mark Wills, Keni Thomas, and some cheerleaders from the Dallas Cowboys. The headliner was comedian and now-senator, Al Franken.</p>
<p>Franken had written some skits for the show and brought props and costumes to go along with them. Like many USO shows before and since, the skits were full of sexual innuendo geared toward a young, male audience.</p>
<p>As a TV host and sports broadcaster, as well as a model familiar to the audience from the covers of FHM, Maxim and Playboy, I was only expecting to emcee and introduce the acts, but Franken said he had written a part for me that he thought would be funny, and I agreed to play along.</p>
<p>When I saw the script, Franken had written a moment when his character comes at me for a ‘kiss’. I suspected what he was after, but I figured I could turn my head at the last minute, or put my hand over his mouth, to get more laughs from the crowd.
On the day of the show Franken and I were alone backstage going over our lines one last time. He said to me, “We need to rehearse the kiss.” I laughed and ignored him. Then he said it again. I said something like, ‘Relax Al, this isn’t SNL…we don’t need to rehearse the kiss.’</p>
<p>He continued to insist, and I was beginning to get uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said ‘OK’ so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.</p>
<p>I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn’t be so nice about it the next time.</p>
<p>I walked away. All I could think about was getting to a bathroom as fast as possible to rinse the taste of him out of my mouth.</p>
<p>I felt disgusted and violated.</p>
<p>Not long after, I performed the skit as written, carefully turning my head so he couldn’t kiss me on the lips.
No one saw what happened backstage. I didn’t tell the Sergeant Major of the Army, who was the sponsor of the tour. I didn’t tell our USO rep what happened.</p>
<p>At the time I didn’t want to cause trouble. We were in the middle of a war zone, it was the first show of our Holiday tour, I was a professional, and I could take care of myself. I told a few of the others on the tour what Franken had done and they knew how I felt about it.</p>
<p>I tried to let it go, but I was angry.</p>
<p>Other than our dialogue on stage, I never had a voluntary conversation with Al Franken again. I avoided him as much as possible and made sure I was never alone with him again for the rest of the tour.</p>
<p>Franken repaid me with petty insults, including drawing devil horns on at least one of the headshots I was autographing for the troops.</p>
<p>But he didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>The tour wrapped and on Christmas Eve we began the 36-hour trip home to L.A. After 2 weeks of grueling travel and performing I was exhausted. When our C-17 cargo plane took off from Afghanistan I immediately fell asleep, even though I was still wearing my flak vest and Kevlar helmet.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I was back in the US and looking through the CD of photos we were given by the photographer that I saw this one:</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe it. He groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep.</p>
<p>I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated.</p>
<p>How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it’s funny?</p>
<p>I told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture.</p>
<p>I wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster.</p>
<p>But that was then, this is now. I’m no longer afraid. </p>
<p>Today, I am the news anchor on McIntyre in the Morning on KABC Radio in Los Angeles. My colleagues are some of the most supportive people I’ve ever worked with in my career. Like everyone in the media, we’ve been reporting on the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations since they broke, and the flood of similar stories that have come out about others.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, we had California Congresswoman Jackie Speier on the show and she told us her story of being sexually assaulted when she was a young Congressional aide. She described how a powerful man in the office where she worked ‘held her face, kissed her and stuck his tongue in her mouth.’</p>
<p>At that moment, I thought to myself, Al Franken did that exact same thing to me.</p>
<p>I had locked up those memories of helplessness and violation for a long time, but they all came rushing back to me and my hands clinched into fists like it was yesterday. </p>
<p>I’m still angry at what Al Franken did to me.</p>
<p>Every time I hear his voice or see his face, I am angry. I am angry that I did his stupid skit for the rest of that tour. I am angry that I didn’t call him out in front of everyone when I had the microphone in my hand every night after that. I wanted to. But I didn’t want to rock the boat. I was there to entertain the troops and make sure they forgot about where they were for a few hours. Someday, I thought to myself, I would tell my story. </p>
<p>That day is now.</p>
<p>Senator Franken, you wrote the script. But there’s nothing funny about sexual assault.</p>
<p>You wrote the scene that would include you kissing me and then relentlessly badgered me into ‘rehearsing’ the kiss with you backstage when we were alone. </p>
<p>You knew exactly what you were doing. You forcibly kissed me without my consent, grabbed my breasts while I was sleeping and had someone take a photo of you doing it, knowing I would see it later, and be ashamed.</p>
<p>While debating whether or not to go public, I even thought to myself, so much worse has happened to so many others, maybe my story isn’t worth telling? But my story is worth telling. </p>
<p>Not just because 2017 is not 2006, or because I am much more secure in my career now than I was then, and not because I’m still angry.</p>
<p>I’m telling my story because there may be others.</p>
<p>I want to have the same effect on them that Congresswoman Jackie Speier had on me. I want them, and all the other victims of sexual assault, to be able to speak out immediately, and not keep their stories –and their anger– locked up inside for years, or decades.</p>
<p>I want the days of silence to be over forever.</p>

            Hey there SecondAmendment. This is riding the line between indirectly and directly related to sexual abuse of kids by the global elite. At a bare minimum, you need to make a case at the top of the body of the post about why you think it's directly related. I would include the link that shows Franken clearly has a history of joking about child rape and is pals with pedos (with any pics of him chumming it up with a couple, if possible).
           </p>
           <p>
            I think this story has value (and the image, visceral effectiveness) in confirming the Pizzagate premise that a culture of depravity and moral bankruptcy where pedophilia can thrive pervades the elite circles of power in America. But technically, as written, this doesn't satisfy Rule 1. I am going to leave it up so you can try to edit it so it more closely fits.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looking into who wanted Franken elected and including that information would make this more appropriate for
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            , as well. Any pics of him with Alafentis, perhaps? Epstein? You get the idea.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, another reason I'm going to leave this up right now is to see if
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/kestrel9">
             @kestrel9
            </a>
            or one of our other meme-makers could turn this image into a meme we could share. That picture captures in a single image, the horror of the foul brutes who are in control of our military, and the dishonor that brings on us all, especially the good folks who serve and their families. "BRING ON #TheStorm" ought to be the caption. We need to flush these fuckers.

            Al Franken might have committed a sexual impropriety while "filming a skit." Poster makes no effort to link this post to pedophilia. Pizzagate is under a coordinated attack from Hollywood and Washington D.C. to blur the line between old geezer ass grabbers that Shock! liked girls 15 years ago a year under age of consent. But oops statute of limitations ran out so nothing we can do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Until Fox News starts showing famous politicians in handcuffs for pedophilia the "storm" is only blowing pizzagate off the map.
           </p>
           <p>
            This needs to be called out.

            Ok Saudi pedophiles, we are sorry. We didn't mean it. Just give us your cash and we will set you free to rape more children. Its all cool now. Us taking your money cured your pedophilia....
           </p>
           <p>
            Can we stop pretending now?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Saudi authorities are negotiating settlements with princes and businessmen held over allegations of corruption, offering deals for the detainees to pay for their freedom, people briefed on the discussions say.
In some cases the government is seeking to appropriate as much as 70 per cent of suspects’ wealth, two of the people said, in a bid to channel hundreds of billions of dollars into depleted state coffers.
            </p>
            <p>
             The arrangements, which have already seen some assets and funds handed over to the state, provide an insight into the strategy behind Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s dramatic corruption purge.

             Will you also stick this as a comment in the stickied Storm thread, Esoteric? Definitely relevant, I am sad to say. But since we are trying to document everything, I think it's really important to capture the whole picture if possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also, Q and FBIanon both said several times that the global system is so broken that an incensed public is necessary to exact change. This news is not what we want to see happening, but it IS happening and we need to stay on top of that. For what it's worth, as I understand it, the worst, most powerful one of them was the one that went down in the chopper crash.

            I was going to say Sylvester Stallone would be next, a few days ago, but refrained. Alas, he is. Read a book about him and others many years ago.

             you get the prize, I'm sorry to say.  I saw the Stallone story on Daily Mail right before you posted this, and I did a link to it here, mate:
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/2245618">
              https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2245618
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             You were right.  I'd love to know about the book you read.  If I remember correctly, didn't Cathy O'Brien claim to be abused by Stallone in her book?  My memory might be failing me but I seem to recall a book about Stallone, too.  I know some Beverly Hills people who used to run in Stallone's circles and they severed their ties.  They said he was a real jerk.  Coming from these friends, whom I respect, I believed it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree that what's coming out is only the tip of the iceberg.  I'm with you, though:  LET IT RIP.  EXPOSE THEM ALL.  Stallone was one of my favorites but the contemporaneously-filed police report (filed by his 16 year old victim in 1986) is all the proof I need to say, "that's it."
            </p>
            <p>
             We don't need these heroes that Hollywood's crammed down our throats for decades.  Screw Hollywood.  Screw pedos.  Screw the elites.  Expose them all, regardless of political party.

              This was probably roughly 15 years ago, very telling book, don't remember it but I think it was written from a groupie standpoint, by a groupie, who had collected these stories. Stallone was the biggest jerk in the book. Seems O'Brien did name Stallone.

              .  The elites in Washington have been concealing the pedophilic, satanic, ritual abuse of trafficked children for decades.  Think back to Barney Frank's threats to out them all while he stood and spoke on the floor of Congress.  The more the "elites" are exposed for their illegal activity, the more we get to the heart of why we're all here.  So I say "SCREW

Sick people in government are the reason this shit goes on.  Exposing a sitting fucking Senator -- particularly a hypocritical windbag like Franken -- is exactly how we destroy the pizzagate system, one broken brick at a time.

                 You're the one accusing people of being Brock shills because they make you aware of things you don't want to hear. Not everybody lives in your false reality. People have their own opinions. If you can't handle hearing things you don't like maybe this environment is too high stress for you, newbie....You'll learn.

               Posts that do not pertain to pedophilia are muddying the water. Period. They play along with the "our friends" in the mainstream media.

                I hear your concerns, Esoteric and agree about muddying the water. I think there's an opportunity to use it to our advantage though. See my comment to the OP.

            Don't forget that al Franken joked about Rob Reiner's father Carl raping him repeatedly as a child. The same Rob Reiner that's close friends with podesta and is non stop anti trump on twitter.

            Maybe it's been mentioned already, but there is a video floating around somewhere of Al Franken making a "joke" about child rape at the roast of Rob Reiner, maybe someone can find it.

            I don’t know why I didn’t see it earlier. This is all a distraction,
McGowan, Spacey, Louis C.K, Franken, Hoffman, Feldman, Moore. All these claims are for minor offenses for the most part. This is all to distract us from the more horrific abuse and murder that’s occurring. Take a step back and look at the patterns and look at where the stories are coming from NYT, WAPO, etc. why? What’s the underlying agenda? What else do they know?

             , and I can definitely see your point about these stories being a distraction.  I like to take the optimistic view that this is a process of desensitization of the normies who aren't yet aware of the atrocities being committed by the "heroes" in entertainment and politics.  I think it's going to be a stepwise progression, so that by the time there is evidence of the hard core Pizzagate child trafficking, sexual abuse, and sacrificing to Moloch, the public will not totally freak out.  By then the public will become more immune to the shock of these stories.  I am very encouraged.  Sunlight kills pathogens.  Bring on the sunllight.  Expose these psychos because they belong in prison, not "ruling" over us good guys.

              I see this as positive too. I think they are releasing this stuff as a way to deflect the conversation because they know more serious things are coming and they are looking for cover. I don’t think wapo or nyt are trying to do us any favors. That’s why I don’t think it’s to desensitize the masses. If it was, it wouldn’t originate there.

            Franken does a big spiel during the Grateful Dead Movie, filmed at the closing of Winterland on 12/31/78.  The Dead environment has arguably popped up a few times here in Voat, and I'm getting a sinking feeling there is more to them than meets the eye.

            Connected to N Cal, the LSD days, guys like Owsley with a Senator grandfather, hippie "takes a village" culture, naked people everywhere, a fave song titled "Dark Star", etc.   If you've read McGowan's Lauryl Canyon book it starts to all make sense.
           </p>
           <p>
            Based on what I saw in the movie, Franken was a total Deadhead, as he was front and center at that big show in 78,

            I donated to Al Franken just once,  when he first ran.  But something seemed funny to me about him after he won.  I could not put my finger on it, but I told my husband we were not sending him any money, because my odometer was sending me vibes.  But I thought it was just something political.  I never dreamed he had done anything like this.  After reading this to my husband, he said he will listen to me more often when my odometer goes off.  Every time I saw him on TV I felt there was something I did not know about him, but nothing like groping someone while sleeping.  This goes beyond just trying to put your arm around someone at the movies.  This  is the worst kind of taking liberties. You Are A Scumbag Al Franken.

              The certification of Franken as the victor came only after a series of recounts dragging out for almost half a year. It also sparked an investigation by Minnesota Majority, a conservative watchdog group that compared the list of those recorded as having voted in the election against what Fund calls “criminal rap sheets.” The group found, in what appears to clearly warrant further and official inquiry, that
             </p>
             <p>
              … At least 341 convicted felons voted in Minneapolis's Hennepin County, the state's largest, and another 52 voted illegally in St. Paul's Ramsey County, the state's second largest. Dan McGrath, head of Minnesota Majority, says that only conclusive matches were included in the group's totals. The number of felons voting in those two counties alone exceeds Mr. Franken's victory margin.

             Now we wonder what voting felons get in return.

              Oh my gosh thanks for reminding me.  We were sitting here trying to think of the opposer's name.  Norm Coleman.  It went on for weeks I believe.  God Almighty.   Another case of Election Fraud.  Let's see what happens next time.  Now that he has been accused.

              Yes, I know.  Unfortunately I did not remember it then.  All this coming out  being on voat has brought it all back.  I  don't really remember it as you describe.  I did not watch the video for it is already disgusting enough.  I am on overload today with the constant coming out and now I have just posted a submission myself on more allegations of Spacey.  I hope Franken is forced out.

              Yes, you are so very right.  Although it won't happen as fast as we would like, I feel their reign is coming to an end.  The sooner the better.  Down they come, One by One.

            Are we being trolled? Or is this true but having nothing to do with the Satanic network, so they surrender this stuff? I am just asking. A blatant pattern of deviant revelations from the MSM. None of it...zero percentage...is the Satanic network, the CIA. DC elites. Should i care about any sacrifice of celebrity over sexual misconduct if the bottom line is passed over? I say no. Keep vigilant and don't worry about not being popular for being a party pooper.

             I think that's a good starter (talking about adult rape and harassment by politicians). Once it is established that
             <em>
              this
             </em>
             is a common behaviour, it will be easier to redpill the masses on the other, darker issues. I hear you, though.

             , I promise it's safe to click.  Just about all I know how to do is click on links, read stories, and then copy and paste.  I would never, ever, ever post anything unsafe.  You have my word, for what that's worth.

              , that dumb pervy bastard, Al Franken, just released an impotent statement that says:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               “I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann.  As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but it wasn't.  I shouldn't have done it."
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              I find it telling that this sick prick "doesn't remember" the incident.  That tells me that he has done an awful lot of groping and sexual abusing in his time, because he doesn't remember something this bad.  There must be too many incidents to differentiate his criminal attack on Ms. Tweeden.  Here's a link to a tweet regarding Franken's bullshit apology, by the way:https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/931190208158191616
             </p>
             <p>
              FUCK YOU, AL FRANKEN.  Now I'll be looking through the
              <strong>
               104 Podesta Emails with the word "FRANKEN" in them
              </strong>
              , which all of y'all can find here:

               Thanks, great post! He won't get away with "it was clearly intended to be funny, but it wasn't". What a lame excuse!
              </p>
              <p>
               Funny for the perp, for sure. Knowing that the woman was asleep, and reading her text, ppl won't follow his narrative though.

               Great idea to look through the Podesta Emails!

             He isn’t groping her. He isn’t even touching her. She has her full uniform on in addition to that.

             The article has her mentioning that he kissed her as well. No pics of that though.

             .  I am clueless about how to do stuff like posting images on here.  But the link is good, people.  I would never link to an unsafe place.
