            This post is unusually lacking for webofslime. I don't know of the DREAM center or Michel Zaleski, and there are no links with info on them. (Also, why not just say Laura Silsby?)
            <br/>
            I googled Michel Zaleski, the first link mentioned George .oros and Open $o¢iet¥... connection wasn't private when I clicked the link, I ran away.
            <br/>
            Edit: Also,
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/webofslime">
             @webofslime
            </a>
            , where did you get the info that the DREAM center was to be the orphanage in DR? All I remember reading is that god told Laura what hotel to use in DR, and she had no paperwork to actually build an orphanage.

             It was late.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first time I brought attention to this, it received a whopping two upvotes, last month. I have always felt like these orphanages have not received nearly enough attention.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first reason it caught my attention, above the other orphanages, was the name.
            </p>
            <p>
             The location, on the North Shore of the DR, doesn't have too many orphanages.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is their website.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.dominicandream.org/">
              http://www.dominicandream.org/
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             This is their location.
            </p>

             They began funding for it and construction in 2009 and were just finishing it around the time of Laura Silsby's arrest. Silsby claimed that the orphanage was on the North, by the coast. This orphanage matches that description. There are a couple of others in the North, but they are older.
            </p>
            <p>
             Additionally, the Kimball Foundation is another founder of this particular orphanage. To me, this was interesting, because President Spencer Kimball, of the Mormon church, was in charge while kids were purportedly being subject to satanic ritual abuse inside the SLC Temple. 60 children were able to describe the inside of the temple, even though most adults aren't allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Spencer Kimball's son helped a mining deal and a oil drilling deal go through in Argentina, interfered with Urugayan politics and subsequently got the Mormons banned from several South American countries.
            </p>
            <p>
             Spencer Kimball's grandson works for Google.
            </p>
            <p>
             Combine that with the weird Zaleski contribution and we are looking at a suspicious set of people involved in this orphanage.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think these orphanages are worth looking into, but I haven't seen anyone start breaking down some of these donor lists.

              Thank you, and I really appreciate your work. Interesting theory. I'm not the best to do this, but I agree it seems like an unexplored link. Like said, Zaleski has Soros ties...
