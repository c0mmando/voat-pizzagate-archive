<h1>On the recent announcement</h1>
<p>Putt touched on some neat stuff in his recent announcement, so let\'s discuss some of what was said. </p>
<h1></h1>
<p>First off, I want to point out that the <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/1330806">Canary</a> was updated when the announcement was made, just like I\'ve been saying it would be to all those who were worried the Canary had died. Let this help lessen our future worries somewhat; the Canary is updated when submissions are made to <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements">/v/announcements</a>, and at almost no other time. Not every month, not whenever Putt makes a submission -- only when he makes an announcement. (There is at least one example of the Canary being updated without an announcement, but never has the reverse been the case, and it is to announcements we must look when concerning the Canary). </p>
<h1></h1>
<p>The words in Putt\'s announcement which seemed to catch the most attention were: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>you guys piss a lot of powerful people off</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and understandably so; it\'s a fascinating revelation...though not really a surprising one. We can all understand the danger of freedom of speech to those who seek to control narratives with falsity. I <a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/1946021">made a post</a> about this some time ago, highlighting how seemingly every financial power in the world was doing everything they could to destroy us through that route -- to no avail. There is no question at all at this point that Voat, as it stands, is a platform for Truth and therefore a danger to the lying elite.</p>
<p>I wasn\'t going to call attention to <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/2306193/11442606/10#11442606">this thread</a>, but a number of others already drew attention to it and Putt is sufficiently obscure here that it probably doesn\'t matter. In it he ranks the &quot;interestingness&quot; of the DDOS attackers (who were most active during the first attempt at the database Port) at 8-9 out of 10. Now, &quot;interestingness&quot; is anything but an objective measure and only so much can be read from this, but since the context of powerful people is provided in the announcement, my mind can\'t help but leap to interesting / influential on a worldly scale, and for <em>that</em> scale I would consider a 9 to be along the lines of International / Central Banks. Considering what has happened in the past with respect to Voat\'s Credit Card processor ending its relationship with Voat, I can only conclude that it is <em>possible</em> that those behind the (very severe) DDOS attacks against Voat a few months ago may have been directly affiliated with the International Banks. For the Banks (or some derivative of the Banks) to attack Voat directly is truly interesting, I would say. This is all just speculation, of course, but what we must take from this is that Voat is certainly a platform where Truth can thrive, and is a threat to those with the most power. </p>
<h1></h1>
<p>Putt also mentions one of the big changes that may arrive for Voat in the New Year. He refers only to the &quot;democratization&quot; of Voat. Some people in the comments were concerned about what this might mean. However, Putt was <a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/2306193/11442483/10#11442483">careful to highlight</a> that he will not push any changes without community feedback, so we\'ll all get a chance to experiment with the change and decide whether or not it suits Voat. <sub>Everyone is also capable of prowling the <a href="https://preview.voat.co/">preview site</a> to find the probable prototype of the very change Putt is proposing. </sub></p>
<h1></h1>
<p>As a sidenote, Theo <a href="https://voat.co/v/whatever/2308584">made a thread</a> proposing doxxing as a possible explanation for NeedleStack\'s disappearance. I mention this here despite it not having to do with the announcement because I mentioned Needle in a recent overview post, and doxxing Voat\'s perhaps most well-known user is yet another sign that powerful forces are willing to go to great lengths to suppress the discussions we have here. If Needle was doxxed, let her story be a warning to us all. Be careful of what you post, and know that what we do here is no small business, is no mere game. The Truth spreads on. </p>

              You can't be this stupid. For a start a DDoS could be instigated by a single 400 pound guy in his mums basement.There is no all hands on deck situation which would stop (((them))) from hitting a website which is at best inconsequential, and in reality, a haven for the crackpots and losers who can't make it on Reddit.

              The idea that anyone gives a shit about what you're doing here is hilarious. Examine it's evolution. Admittedly it was funny at first, this place had a direction and narrative, but now all it is, is a scatter shot of the Jewish NWO bullshit i've heard for at least a decade.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can't work out if you're a fan of the discord which invented Q because you're delusional/propagandist or just can't admit you're wrong, but it'll fade away into nothing just like all the 4chan insiders did.

             Well, she just stopped posting about a month ago, after some dickheads claimed to have doxxed her. If you click the links in peacekeepers original thread and dig down, you'll find it. Hopefully it was only because of family/holiday/personal obligations, but we had one good mod who interviewed a guy who claimed to have been raped as a teenager by James Alefantis driven off of here by the same type of shills using similar tactics, as well as a user who was doxxed and verbally threatened by Alefantis (both ended up filing police reports) so it could very well be that she was silenced through intimidation. Putt isn't kidding when he says voaters have pissed off powerful people.

              I'm still in that limbo where it feels like what you guys are doing here are inconsequential but then those stuff happens. Everyone, do take care and never be intimidated. You're all doing good work here.

             I promise you that the majority of pedophiles A Praying this sub is run in the exact manner its been run since December last year. This sub is so far away from doing anything of Value.... I understand that Insulting. But it's true. And it's not the users fault. It's the mods.

             The guy who owns Voat - 'PuttItOut' is the alt he uses. People say often only "Putt" when they are talking about him.
            </p>
            <p>
             He made an announcement before Christmas about some changes regarding Voat in 2018 and people asked him about a DDOS attack that occured some time ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             He said the people here on Voat would really 'piss some people off'.
            </p>
            <p>
             This post refers to this statement.

            does pizzagate have a simple infographic I can show people like work colleagues and old relatives. Something that would be easily understood. something that gives enough proof. something that can convince even the most blue pilled of cukcs. That the world is run by satanic child rapists. bonus points for turning tem against the UK royal family.

             A simple, direct approach could be downloading and printing copies of the pictures from Alefantis' instagram account.
If you enlarge the picture of the little red haired girl taped to the table, hauntingly looking at the camera with deeply ringed eyes, make sure you point out that the 14 pieces of tape fastening the child's arms to the tabletop.
Also how her torso is pressed tightly against the table.
Then, you can refer your colleagues to the nationwide televised interview Alefantis did with Megyn Kelly. When Kelly asked about the girl in the picture, Alefantis dismissively explained that the girl's sister did it.
Well ...
If any of your colleagues are parents and they believe a youngster would stand still and allow herself to be extensively taped to a table, they would be nuts.
This is a smoking gun lie that should enable the unravelling of these abominations.

              Have you tried catbox.moe?  Drag and drop to their site, then copy and paste the url created there, here. If it's not the right file format. Maybe try screencapping, or taking a pic with your phone and upload that to the image host site.

            Right. I'm sure Jacob Rothschild threatened Putt via PM personally.

              Yeah...it went on for more than a month, 24/7, and involved real time problem solving on the part of the hackers (i.e. it wasn't just bots). They were saying in Putt's thread on the topic that it would require a very great deal of money to pay for that kind of an operation. It's why we still have various safety measures in place (can't upvoat too fast, built in lag occassionally, etc.).
