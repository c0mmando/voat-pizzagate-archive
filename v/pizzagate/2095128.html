It pulls together the Bush family, Chinese spies, trafficking of illegal immigrants by Southern farm owners, and the infamous case of John Couey raping and murdering Jessica Lunsford.</p>
<p>John Couey abducted Jessica, raped her, and buried her alive, but there was a cover-up to make it appear that he acted alone. As it turns out, Mark Lunsford (Jessica\'s father) had child porn on his computer and appeared to be pimping out his own daughter to other pedophiles, including Couey, who got in through an unlocked door without the dog barking at him (indicating he knew the Lunsfords). The family members in the trailer with Couey purportedly didn\'t know he had Jessica, even though he held Jessica in the trailer for multiple days. Police officers visited the trailer multiple times, even entering one time, and also didn\'t discover Jessica. They also didn\'t find Jessica when she was buried right outside Couey\'s trailer, and may have actually called off search teams when dogs identified the area she was buried. State attorney Brad King refused to prosecute Mark for child porn possession or Couey\'s family members for aiding him. And the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) somehow sent a letter to Citrus County telling them to round up Couey to the wrong sheriff\'s department address. An FBI agent apparently pressured Couey into taking the fall on his own, without implicating anyone else.</p>
<p>Gene Secord is mentioned in that article as one of the people related to Couey. He was married to Couey\'s niece, Madie Secord, although their relationship was on the rocks by 2005. <a href="http://www.ocala.com/assets/pdf/OS682579.PDF">In a deposition</a>, he reveals some interesting facts, such as Couey\'s mysterious connection to Georgia (which corroborates the claims that he was involved with Coggins Farms in Lake Park GA). He was apparently one of the only people in the trailer with Couey who didn\'t do drugs - Couey, his sister Dorothy Dixon, and his niece Madie Secord all smoked crack.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.topix.com/forum/city/sarasota-fl/T4LKR59T0MC7JJEQI/p79#c1821">Allegations beginning in 2013</a> made a more interesting claim: part of the reason Couey\'s family didn\'t face charges is that Gene Secord was the nephew of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Secord">Major General Richard Secord</a>, a covert operations specialist involved in Vietnam and Iran-Contra. Perhaps this sounds a little farfetched at first glance, and it\'s worth asking what Richard Secord would have to do with the Couey case anyway, but allow me to put forth a potential theory.</p>
<p>One little-known fact about the Iran-Contra affair is that Lt. Col Michael Aquino was involved. <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/aq3.html">Rusty Nelson, a child porn photographer involved in the Franklin scandal, testified in court</a> that he saw Franklin scandal ringleader Larry King hand a suitcase of bearer bonds earmarked for the Contras to &quot;the Colonel&quot;. This was Michael Aquino, indicating that Aquino was active in the Contra supply effort alongside people like George H.W. Bush, Oliver North, and <strong>Richard Secord</strong>. Michael Aquino, as most people here know, was also a Satanist pedophile implicated by multiple children (such as Paul Bonacci) as leading the Monarch mind control program.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gangstalkingmindcontrolcults.com/monarch-the-new-phoenix-program/"><em>MONARCH: The New Phoenix Program</em> connects Aquino and Secord even further</a>, claiming that both of them led a covert operations cell that worked on mind control. I haven\'t verified this book, but given the connection between Secord and Aquino, it\'s reasonably likely that Richard Secord had a role in Monarch.</p>
<p>Now let\'s return to John Couey and Gene Secord. Couey had an incredibly low IQ, close to being legally retarded. <a href="https://thejohncoueyconspiracy.wordpress.com/2014/10/17/not-everyone-thought-coue5-the-sexual-offenders-solutions-and-education-network-in-the-maelstrom-of-all-this-controversy-citizens-such-as-shirley-lowery-came-up-with-unique-theories-as-to/">Some people actually speculated</a> that Couey\'s low IQ allowed him to be manipulated by mind control operatives. Maybe that seems outlandish, but there are some pieces of evidence supporting that theory. It appears that Couey was an operative in this interstate pedophile ring, and his tasks probably included kidnapping other children for this ring; but why would this child sex ring, which reached the highest levels of government, trust a lowlife like Couey unless he was controllable? Also, Couey and most of the rest of his family were heavy drug users, and drugs are often employed in mind control programs to make people more suggestible. Who was the only person not using drugs in the trailer? That would be Gene Secord.</p>
<p>Might Secord have been a Monarch handler for Couey and his family? If so, that would imply Secord was deeply connected to covert operations inside the government. A family connection to Richard Secord would provide support for that possibility.</p>
<p>(An interesting aside: the <em>MONARCH</em> book I mention above says that Richard Secord was involved in using energy weapons technology to manipulate the mind. The sex ring Couey appears to have been involved with extended into Valdosta GA, where Moody AFB was based. Moody AFB recently had multiple civilian and military personnel arrested for trying to solicit sex with minors. And there are mind control allegations there too. <a href="https://everydayconcerned.net/2017/05/25/electronic-slavery-in-america-military-neuro-weaponry-used-contractually-by-us-air-force-veteran-to-abuse-exemplary-and-highly-accomplished-tennessee-woman-pastor-control-town/">One woman claims</a> she was electronically tortured by her ex-boyfriend who was stationed at Moody AFB, and <a href="http://peacepink.ning.com/forum/topics/introduce-mind-control-and?id=2351430%3ATopic%3A1121&amp;page=2">allegedly in 2007</a> there was an EM wave technology tested at Moody AFB.)</p>
<p>So maybe a family connection between Gene Secord and Richard Secord is more important than it might appear. Plus, even if the theory about Couey being mind-controlled is wrong, a family relationship could still be significant in some other way.</p>
<p>As of now, I\'ve been unable to verify or refute such a connection. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Secord">Based on the Wikipedia page</a>, Richard Secord (full name Richard Vernon Secord, born 1932) did retire to Florida after Iran-Contra, and Florida is where Gene Secord lives too. The Wikipedia page mentions two younger siblings of his, Sandra and Jim, about whom I\'ve found no other information. <a href="https://www.familytreenow.com/search/people/results?first=Richard&amp;last=Secord&amp;citystatezip=Florida&amp;rid=0sll&amp;smck=T-dOulYYmFF3GkBOWIm6bQ">Here</a> is some family tree information for Richard Secord, which apparently doesn\'t mention Sandra or Jim. <a href="http://mugshots.com/US-Counties/Florida/Citrus-County-FL/Gene-A-Secord.6271231.html">This</a> is a mugshot of Gene Secord (full name Gene Allan Secord, born 1969).</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate it if anyone who\'s skilled at uncovering family trees would take up this investigation. It could provide a very significant connection between Iran-Contra, a Florida/Georgia child sex ring, and mind control operations.</p>',

            ^^ Superb post.  You laid out the foundation for your hypothesis well.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have little to add to your narrative EXCEPT:
           </p>
           <p>
            (1)  A Satanic FL-GA sex trafficking ring has already been well established.  This goes back to at least the late 1970s and perhaps even earlier.  See Ottis Toole and Henry Lee Lucas, both members of the Hand of Death cult.  They confessed to many murders that they DID NOT commit, but the extent of their child sex trafficking involvement is not in dispute.  Their stomping ground was the Tallahassee area up into GA but also extended into southern FL (Miami area).
           </p>
           <p>
            HL Lucas has a George Bush connection:  He was the ONLY Texas inmate on death row who had his sentence commuted to life by Gov. Bush, a "death penalty" governor.  Rumor has it that HLL received favorable treatment because he and GWB belonged to "the same satanic cult," presumably the Hand of Death.  The "satanic cult" extended through Brownsville, Texas and down into Mexico.
           </p>
           <p>
            (2)  Iran-Contra and FL are already connected via southern FL cocaine running, mostly through Miami, and of course Jeb Bush served as Gov. of FL.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will search around to see if I can find a Gene-Richard connection via genealogy.
           </p>
           <p>
            I haven't read your article yet but look forward to perusing it later.

             Thanks for your kind words! Glad you'll look into the potential family connection between the two Secords.

             I do remember reading about Ottis Toole and Henry Lee Lucas, and the Satanic cult activity down in the South. Also of note is the fact that Finders cult members were caught and arrested in Tallahassee. The child sex ring I write about in my article is probably just a small glimpse of the vast pedophile underworld in the Florida/Georgia region.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jeb Bush is actually implicated in the cover-up of this child sex ring. Aside from his FDLE being the one that failed to notify local law enforcement about John Couey, a journalist writing about this case (with apparent inside sources) said:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The Citrus County Sheriff's Department, the lead agency investigating Jessica's death, now reports top-level interference in the case from Tallahassee and Washington, DC and that the case "involves others." The recent reported tie-in of current White House sexcapades involving male prostitutes to past Republican (and some Democrat) involvement in the Franklin, Nebraska child sex slave scandal of the late 1980s involving GOP lobbyist Craig Spence ("suicided" in New York City), Lawrence King, Jr. of Omaha, top Republican officials in Nebraska and Washington, DC, Saudi sex slave traders, and President George H. W. Bush has once again come full circle. Jeb Bush has also been charged with covering up the fact that some 6000 children, supposedly in the care of Florida's Department of Children and Families, are now missing from foster homes and other care centers.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             So Tallahassee and DC (in other words, Jeb and George W. Bush's administrations) were involved in the cover-up.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also of note: part of this Florida/Georgia sex ring ties to Yang Enterprises, a Florida company protected by the Bushes and their allies. Yang was an IT contractor with the Florida Department of Children and Families, specifically
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1870448">
              for their foster care case management system called HomeSafenet
             </a>
             . (The above quote mentions that Jeb covered up missing kids in foster care.)

             <p>
              Haven't found Gene's genealogy yet but did find some tidbits -
             </p>
             <p>
              "They are Couey's half-sister, Dorothy Marie Dixon, 47; her daughter,
              <strong>
               <strong>
                Madie Catherine Secord, 27; her husband, Gene Allan Secord, 35
               </strong>
              </strong>
              ; and Dixon's boyfriend, Matthew Oley Dittrich, 31.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to arrest records, Dixon, Dittrich and Madie Secord admitted lying to law officers who, unable to locate Couey during a check on local sex offenders, asked whether he lived with the group at 6647 Snowbird Court. Each was held on a charge of obstructing justice and taken to the Citrus County jail, where bail was set at $500 each. Dittrich and Dixon posted bail Saturday, jail officials said.
             </p>
             <p>
              Gene Secord was arrested on an unrelated charge of failure to pay child support. His bail was set at $5,160.

              "We're not going to plea bargain this if I have anything to do with it," Dawsy said of the charges. "These are a bunch of cracked-out individuals. Just a bunch of druggies."

                Madie Secord has sought restraining orders against her husband several times.

              "He's not part of that trash that Jeff (Dawsy) said. He's not cocaine trash," said Hill, 58. "He has problems like the rest of us."

              She said the group formed after Dixon's husband, Troy, died about a year ago. Dixon sold a home and signed a lease at the mobile home near Jessica Lunsford's home on Dec. 11.

              PRELIM CONCLUSION:  DiCK Secord is a direct descendant of Laura Ingersoll Secord, a War of 1812 hero. Virginia Hill (Gene's mother) and Gene himself seem like trailer trash.  It's certainly possible that Gene and DICK are related, but that's not the feeling I get.  Maybe they are distantly related.
             </p>
             <p>
              In addition, Gene Secord doesn't look like any Monarch handler I have ever seen.  His uneducated "laborer" status also goes against his being a Monarch handler.  Finally, he has been in and out of jail several times (see article above); most handlers get off scot-free and never see any jail or prison time.
             </p>
             <p>
              I will continue looking, but frankly at this point I'm not on fire because Gene doesn't fit the typical Monarch handler profile.

               Yeah, that conclusion is fair. This was a potential theory I had based on the odd shared surname and the other Iran-Contra connections that do pop up (specifically Hank Asher), but Gene Secord is far removed from the circles that Richard Secord operates in. Being the most normal person among John Couey's family isn't saying much. And good point about his arrests.
              </p>
              <p>
               That said, if political elites needed someone as a handler for Couey, it's not too implausible they'd pick another trailer trash-type person to become part of his family. Gene wouldn't need to be a very high-level operative - maybe he could have just been someone sent in to keep watch on the family. But I do agree with you, such a connection to Monarch and/or Richard Secord is a long-shot. Thanks for looking into this regardless.
              </p>
              <p>
               What's most important in the John Couey case is uncovering a solid connection between him and Coggins Farms. Two sources that I cite, articles by Ralph Kershaw and Dan Hayworth/Roger Schmid, make this connection on the basis of anonymous law enforcement sources. I am inclined to trust Kershaw and Hayworth/Schmid because they made the allegations about Coggins Farms being involved in sex trafficking a couple months
               <em>
                before
               </em>
               John Caylor published an article about that. But anonymous sources aren't good enough on their own. All I have so far is Gene Secord stating that Couey, a Florida resident, went to Georgia so often that he practically lived there. That's actually some pretty remarkable corroboration, but it sheds no light on what Couey specifically did while in Georgia.
