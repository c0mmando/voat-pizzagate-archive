            Honestly I would not start it at Comet PP and I would keep the focus off the pizza parlour itself and Satanism.  Talk about human trafficking stats, talk about missing children, talk about the many many many cases we know about, The Franklin Scandal, Jimmy Saville, etc..  talk about censorship and media coverup.  Talk about law enforcement complicity, Talk about Weiner's laptop...  these are much more important than any of the questions about satanism, or art - art and religion can be considered subective subjects and ARE NOT your strong subjects.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree that the protestors on the 18th came off very well despite a very rough terrain, so CONGRATS to them!!  And talking to livestreams and periscopes and red pilling all along the way is good.

            Where are the colourful, intriguing posters? Depiction of web of corruption, with sarcasm, gallows humour, fiendish riddles, ghoulish double entenders (Devil (metaphor) is afraid of mockery)) juxtaposed with cries for help from the one who cannot defend themselves. Tap into paternal/maternal instincts. Images of dubious connections of Podesta Brothers with convicted pedophiles: Epstein... etc. Jeff Koons board of directors if NCMEC - would force a double take from even the most lay man. Pick the most depraved artwork, plenty to choose from our pedo Jeff. Edibleschoolyards and Alifantis, Abramovic Spirit Cooking. Remember, picture is worth a 1000 words. Now for the what nots - Under no circumstance bring satanism or religion into the mix - baby steps!!! For the trolls or the brainwashed, never engage in a debate unless they are open minded - respond with dark sarcasm, greatest weapon against trolls. ....example 'It's trendy to have 7 year olds in the pool with 65 year old creeps for entertainment, totally normal...' More sarcasm, more dark humor. If someone is open to it, raise the issue - make sure that they know that it is bi-partisan, Dennis Hasterd was a republican. Make sure that we are NOT ACCUSING ANYONE, all Podesta has to do is explain the emails - unless his attorney warned him about the Miranda Rights - anything he says can be used against him. Let Alifantis explain how does a pizza parlor owner gets to visit the White House 5 times. These two points should be driven home, like Buldog, don't let go!!!! Don't wonder into other areas. Focus on key points. Hilight the insane sensorship on social media even against seasoned names such as Ben Swann - who merely asks for investigation. Hilight the WEB OF CONSPIRACY - DC Police Chief Peter Newsham, a pedo enabler - photographed with Alifantis! 
On the side note we should make a point that they have already lost, it's out and there is no hiding. Whether arrests happen or not they are finished. They are living on borrowed time!

            I like the idea of collecting talking points and getting ready to rebut their questions and doubts. But I also think , why wait for someone to ask questions? Instead everyone should whip out their phones and go life, so that there are thousand of life streams drown out the main stream lying media.

             Totally agree. That or find out if any organizers can find an outspoken pizzagater that can bring camera gear and act as a journalist. Everyone could then just plug the livestream so they can have their head in the game irl.

             More talkers/streamers might be better though.

            I thought exactly the same thing. From the videos I watched, this was a great example of the reality that vice makes people weak, while virtue makes people strong. When the two face off, as long as virtue holds fast, there is ultimately only one likely outcome.

            Thank you guys so much for taking the first major step in peaceful protest to show the world that this is a decent cause supported by decent people who are asking relevant questions and seeking real answers to the unthinkable crime of organized child-sex trafficking and abuse at the highest levels of society.﻿

            Glad you're all safe and thank you for the updates - looking forward to the 25th - show them again how this is a real issue that warrants real resolution.

            I wasnt supporting the protests before because I thought it was a shill scheme, but now I really am supporting it. I saw the people in the videos, and ive spoken to some on twitter. They are genuinely concerned people, and I hope they can do their best on the 25th.

             I totally agree. I wish this post was flagged or something, so the 25th protestors think about preparation and go in with confidence. Really think the 18th was a good test run and example.

              Yeah im glad that the 18th even though it had a small turn out the group was confident so it was okay. I really hope we get at least a few hundreds on the 25th. Im almost considering going, but its 3 hours away so idk.

            You will have assholes at this protest.  Assholes will ruin your message.  This thing is so huge, indescribably huge, in a 1000 lifetimes we could never imagine it.  Therefore, the message needs to get out diplomatically and through MSM.  The old saying will always remain true - one bad apple can spoil the bunch.  Regardless, I wish all of you God-speed, good karma, and safety.  My heart, mind, and soul are with you.

            At this point, what good is a protest going to do when your average dumbed-down American doesn't have a f'ing clue about what's going on?  They are not going to get it.  They need to be hit in the face, and as I commented on a similar post, how about being subversive?  Somebody out there knows how to break into the major tv networks - ABC, NBC, CBS, and CNN - say at 10 pm ET on a Tuesday or Wednesday night with 1 or 2 excellent orators and graphics.  How about a printed news release delivered in bundles, free, to thousands of mini-marts?  Anonymous, Wikileaks, 4chan, Reddit, are you out there? At the very least on March 25, take with you printed copies of Wikileaks  Global Intelligence Files that pertain to the 911 hoax.  Maybe, just maybe, that will begin to open eyes.  Maybe, just maybe, pizzagate, pedogate, whatever the hell we're supposed to call it, is too macabre, too sickening, too unbelievable to stomach as the first bombshell especially with the massiveness of it.  Who would have thought in the beginning that it would be anything more than Comet?

             I think every single DC pedestrian that takes a flier or walks away from the protest with a more open mind is a positive impact made. Every press video with comments supporting the cause is positivity generated. Traction doesn't come over night, but persistence is key.

             doing this in DC, in their neighborhood. Lots of missing childrens cases in DC. A level of awareness, even just suspicion, can make a huge difference.

            Related note: please don't slam this, and if you're going to respond do so with maturity. Is anyone else worried about Seaman speaking? Even if he has good intentions, confidence and coherence are important. He could be the blunder that ends up being promoted too heavily.. just my opinion that he may not be fit for press challenges.

            No amount of intimidation can stop this movement. Those "reporters" are complete cowards. Zero integrity. Lied through their teeth. They are getting what they deserve in the video comments. They intended it for evil... But God used it for good.

            I can't wait to see what you all do when you show up on 3-25. Be aware, fearless and relentless. The opposition is terrified. We showed up 3-18 and lit a fire. It better be blazing by Saturday.

             The youtube video is just as good. That like ratio is great. I mean it could simply mean that the pizzagate community being directed there is larger than the one that watches their channel, but either way the content of that livestream is a total win. There is a confidence gap between the protestors and the reporters.

              Yes, i have read the comments there aswell. Nice There is not just a confidence gap between the protesters and the reporters. They are young total Libtards..(as they state pretty much 90% of DC voted for Clinton, and most media is total Liberal minded)  And they could be hired straight away by CNN.. These are not real journalists out there to look for the truth. They came there totally biased telling multiple times it is a widely Debunked conspiracy theory. You could see they where send there to make the protesters to look stupid. As i see all the comments, that may have just backfired at them. Even if that was only a small protest turnout, the comments are great. I really hope the 25 March one will be Big..
