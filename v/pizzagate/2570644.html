<p>The most explicit sexual images aren’t in question; the grey area involves images of nude children, often pubescent, that are sexual only by context. </p>
<p>Section 163.1 of the Canadian Criminal Code defines child pornography, in part, as any visual representation of “explicit sexual activity” or “the depiction, for a sexual purpose, of a sexual organ or the anal region of a person under the age of eighteen years.” </p>
<p>The United States statute similarly includes in its definition of child porn the “lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.”</p>
<p>By specifying a “sexual purpose,” the law protects high-minded free expression—such as the photography of Sally Mann, whose work features child nudes and who has been accused of exploiting children—even as, at the lower end of the market, it leaves room for interpretation.</p>
<p>The law specified a “sexual purpose” as the defining characteristic of child pornography, but did that have to mean explicit sex? Read another way, Belanger thought, the statute surely could mean that a “sexual purpose” could apply to any image at all that common sense suggested had no reason—other than a sexual one—to be on film. This legal argument was quietly radical</p>
<p>Then she watched them, noting every moment that could be said to serve a “sexual purpose.” All the videos contained nudity. In one, a child takes fifteen showers; in another, staged in a sauna, nude children sit around on couches and eat food. Each film began with the same scrolling text: “Naturism has been around since the dawn of time. The freedom of being ‘one with nature’ is a healthy pastime in many European cultures.”</p>
<p>“You say, ‘This one film’s borderline, and this one’s not borderline,’” Belanger said. “But it’s all the same kids, right? So it sexualizes the whole collection.” That reasoning turned out to be convincing enough that a judge granted the CES a warrant to go after not just Way, but also Azov Films and its customer records.</p>
<p>When customers began voicing reservations about any specific boy—“He’s becoming too old, and they’re not into that,” Belanger said—she would notice that in videos made around the same time, the boy would wrangle younger ones into view and then slip out of the frame.</p>
<p>Way seemed to spend much of his time emailing his filmmakers, among them Igor Rusanov and Andrey Ivanov, both from Ukraine, and Markus Roth, based in Romania</p>

<p>NSFW...VLADIK AND THE CIA </p>
<p>Azov Films, based in Toronto, sold \'child porn\' films to customers worldwide.</p>
<p>Azov Films was closed down in 2011.</p>
<p>( who picked up after?)</p>
<p>Church of England vicar Charles Richardson, who reportedly bought Azov products.</p>
<p>The Canadian police handed to the UK police a list of around 2,000 Britons who were linked to Azov Films.</p>
<p>Some of the suspects worked for the government,</p>
<p>The list was ignored for two years.</p>
<p>Azov-Films reportedly produced child porn.</p>
<p>Azov-Films\' headquarters was in Toronto Canada, but its films were made in Crimea, Russia and Romania, by people including Igor Rusanov.</p>
<p>Brian Way and his mother Sandra Waslov, of Staford VA USA, were the owners of Azov-films.com and Boyjoy.com. Way has been in custody since 2011.</p>
<p>Could Azov-Films have been used by a certain security service to blackmail top people?</p>
<p>Azov-Films sold DVDs and streamed videos of naked children.</p>
<p>Azov Films said its films were &quot;naturist&quot; and legal in Canada and the US.</p>
<p>The films were sold in 94 countries.</p>
<p>Among the countries involved in the investigation were Australia, Spain, Mexico, South Africa, Norway, Greece and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p>&quot;Officers located hundreds of thousands of images and videos detailing horrific sexual acts against very young children - some of the worst they have ever viewed.&quot;</p>
<p>As a child, Vladik appeared in the \'naturist\' or \'soft-porn\' films produced by Azov-Films.</p>
<p>Vladik Shibanov was killed in a car \'accident\' on October 20, 2009.</p>
<p>&quot;Vladik was sexually abused by the maker of the Azov films Zverozub aka Igor Rusanov.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vladik actually did appear in 2 short porno movies when he turned 18 produced by Rusanov.</p>
<p>&quot;The founder of Azov films was starting a hardcore adult gay site featuring Vladik and other former Azov stars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rusanov ... turned much of his \'business\' into sex-tourism for wealthy vip-pedophiles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ukrainian police arrested a teacher from Simferopol, who for at least five years had been filming and selling porn involving Crimean boys.</p>
<p>&quot;The educator is suspected of organizing sex tours to the Crimea, during which pedophiles from abroad were provided with children...</p>
<p>&quot;Some time ago Rusanov became involved in an international criminal business to create porn for gay pedophiles...</p>
<p>&quot;Many of the victims were members of the Scout Movement or summer camps organized by Rusanov...</p>
<p>&quot;In fairness, we note that most of the video filmed by Igor Rusanov is Naturism...</p>
<p>Igor Rusanov, from the Ukraine, made most of the \'child porn \'films for Azov-Films.</p>
<p>After university, Rusanov was in the Soviet military studying &quot;covert command and control, secrecy and encrypted communication.</p>
<p>&quot;He graduated with honors and had the highest form of access to state secrets.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, Rusanov was most likely a spy.</p>
<p>Rusanov spent some time in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Rusanov became involved with the promotion of tourism and youth activities in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2002, he began working in collaboration with the American-influenced Christian Center for Science and Apologetics, which runs camps for children.</p>
<p>The Christian Center for Science and Apologetics may, or may not, be a front for the CIA.</p>
<p>Sandra Waslov, from Stafford, in Virginia in the USA, was listed as Vice President of 4p5p Inc., the Canadian corporation that owned Azov-Films, FKA Baikalfilms.com, and Boyjoy.com.</p>
<p>According to researcher Silvija Germek, Stafford, in Virginia, is the location of one of the busiest airports for the CIA. </p>
<p>Sandra Waslov is the mother of Brian Way, AKA Steve, the joint owner of the Azov Films firm.</p>
<p>Allegedly Azov Films may have links to the \'Russian Israeli mafia\' which allegedly has links to the CIA and its friends.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Russian Israeli mafia is run by Jews from Russia, the Ukraine and Lithuania.</li>
</ol>
<p>Their bases include Russia and parts of the former Soviet Empire such as the Ukraine, Kosovo, Moldova, Ossetia and Poland.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reportedly the Russian Israeli mafia is involved in the child sex trade, including snuff films.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toronto is a major global child porn and child sex slavery hub. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toronto has always been known as \'Disneyland for pedophiles\'. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barney Frank is also one of the star speakers at the University of Toronto.\'</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Reportedly, the kids of the Franklin Scandal in Omaha \'remembered Barney Frank\'. Barny Frank\'s boyfriend allegedly \'ran a pedo ring serving politicians in the Beltway.\'</p>
<ol>
<li>Reportedly Azov Films distributed its softcore films through Amazon</li>
</ol>
<p>It has been suggested that some of the Azov-Film children had been mind controlled. </p>

                he stepped down and hans-peter friedrich also stepped down as minister of interior because he was the one that told him they come after him. now he lives in north africa.

                btw: edathy was the head of the NSU-investigation association.(how convenient? the NSU stuff is the most ridiculous stuff going on here in long term now. its absolutely blatant theres more to it like OP Gladio). one of the NSU Trio is also named as a pedophile.

            The Russian-Israeli Mafia: Off-limits to FBI, US intelligence
           </p>
           <p>
            The same cancer that bankrupted the Soviet Union and the early Russian Federation, namely the Russian-Israeli Mafia — the global organized crime syndicate that uses Israeli government protection and passports to cover their illegal worldwide activities — has so thoroughly permeated the American political and business system that the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies are virtually powerless to bring the major perpetrators to justice.
           </p>
           <p>
            Across the United States, FBI agents have been hamstrung by the Justice and Homeland Security Departments, led by two individuals, Michael Mukasey and Michael Chertoff, whose close links to the Russian-Israeli Mafia in New York and New Jersey have seen case after case involving Russian-Israeli mobsters going un-investigated and virtually ignored.
           </p>
           <p>
            Neo-con outlets such as The Daily Telegraph in Great Britain, which has also witnessed an infiltration of its government, law enforcement, and intelligence services by individuals linked to the Russian-Israeli mob, are now complaining that there are so many Russian Federal Security Bureau (FSB) agents in Britain that MI-6, MI-5, and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) are finding it difficult to battle “Islamist terrorists.” However, the FSB is primarily a law enforcement agency that has been waging battle against the Russian-Israeli Mafia, particularly its major backers like exiled Russian-Israeli oligarch Boris Berezovsky who have been granted protection by the British government while they plan subversive activities against Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.

             Longtime lurker never posted...am not sure I can yet —-stumbled upon search images containing photos of sexualized children and some cp—using Bing—if one types n a lowercase o followed by a number (o6,o7,o9) etc (some numbers more than others but most have some) into bing and select images —oh my —-it is beyond disturbing 
Unsure if it t same with others seems like ddg has them as well ...I just feel this needs attention

               was hoping people could add to it
              </p>
              <p>
               maybe I can dig further and make another post using this one as springboard
              </p>
              <p>
               knew there is a lot more to the story, was hoping comments would help expand it, figured it was huge and the connects could be made worldwide, but only 2 of you came up with more
              </p>
              <p>
               Thank You for the info,  I need to keep this going, back to digging :)
