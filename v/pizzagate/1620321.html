            "Brock Pierce is a controversial figure who has received surprisingly little attention despite connections to the Clinton Foundation, digital currency Bitcoin and involvement in a notorious scandal involving a child abuse ring...
           </p>
           <p>
            Brock was a member of the Clinton Global Initiative, former child actor who appeared in films such as the 1992 classic Mighty Ducks and Disney’s “First Kid,” and Chairman of the Board at the Bitcoin Foundation. Pierce also co-founded the Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), a forerunner of video sharing site Youtube....
In 2000, DEN suffered an absolute disaster amid claims by employees and several Hollywood child actors such as Michael Egan III that Pierce and his partners, Chad Shackley and Marc Collins-Rector ran a child abuse ring with a number of other Hollywood directors and A-list actors, many of whom were financially tied to DEN.
           </p>
           <p>
            Egan alleged that between the ages of 15 to 17, he would be given alcohol, cocaine and other drugs and was raped repeatedly along with other young boys who were present. The abuse allegedly occurred at the house shared by Collins-Rector, Shackley and Pierce as well as on trips to Hawaii. On at least one occasion, Collins-Rector threatened Egan with a gun to force him into compliance.
           </p>
           <p>
            Egan filed a civil suit after his reports to the LAPD and FBI fell on deaf ears. Individuals named in the suit included Pierce, Collins-Rector, Shackley, as well as Bryan Singer, Garth Ancier, Gary Goddard and David Neuman.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr. Egan’s allegations mirror other similar claims made by actors such as Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood that child sex abuse is rampant in Hollywood.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pierce and his co-accused resigned from DEN and fled hurriedly to Spain to escape the FBI. Collins Rector was apparently primarily concerned that investor David Geffen wished to kill him over the scandal. Depositions taken from Pierce revealed that Geffen had purportedly been paying an employee to spy on DEN, and that he had been fed information and stolen faxes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ultimately, Collins-Rector was the only individual charged with sex offenses in relation to the scandal. Brock Pierce was never able fully escape negative public opinion over the role he played however. When he became the Chairman of the Board at the Bitcoin Foundation, at least 10 members resigned in protest. Several resignation letters explicitly listed Pierce’s association with pedophilia and child pornography as the reason for their departure."
