<p>Voodoo and JuJu Magic has already been used by certain child/sex slave traffickers to ensure the victims don\'t attempt to speak out.

<blockquote>
<p>A human rights activist and lawyer in Warri, Delta State, Benefit Orugbo, has revealed how a human trafficking syndicate based in Delta State reportedly abducted over 40 girls from Warri area of Delta state, mainly below 18 years, as sex slaves for gold miners at a mining field in Burkina Faso. </p>
<p>“Miss Joy was in early January, 2017 coerced, detained, deceived and harboured by one the syndicate alongside two other girls of about her age at Ashaka Hotel, Owo-Olomu in Ughelli South local government area of the state for about four days within which period a member of the gang took our client and other girls to a juju shrine at Ughelli, where a man who claimed to be bishop Oku, the priest of the shrine, bathed and incised with a razor on the foreheads, chest region and shoulder of our client and the other girls and the incision rubbed with a substance which appears to be charm.”</p>

<p>These rituals have also been used for occult purposes but also involve the abuse/abduction of children.</p>

<p>African children trafficked to UK for blood rituals <a href="http://archive.is/WpvzA">http://archive.is/WpvzA</a>   2011</p>
<p>Over the last four years, at least 400 African children have been abducted and trafficked to the UK <strong>and rescued</strong> by the British authorities, according to figures obtained by the BBC. ... there is evidence that some are involved in the abuse of children who have been abducted from their families in Africa, and trafficked to the UK.  According to Christine Beddoe, director of the anti-trafficking charity Ecpat UK, a cultural belief in the power of human blood in so-called juju rituals is playing a part in the demand for African children.</p>
<p>&quot;Our experience tells us that traffickers can be anybody. They can be people with power, people with money or people involved in witchcraft,&quot; she explains. &quot;Trafficking can involve witch-doctors and other types of professionals in the community who are using those practices.&quot; One senior police detective says part of the problem is the silence that surrounds the matter. People think even talking about juju might lead to something bad happening to them Det Ch Supt Richard Martin, Metropolitan Police</p>
<p>Testimonies from many of these children have revealed that once they arrive in Britain, they are exposed to violent and degrading treatments, often involving the forced extraction of their blood to be used for clients demanding blood rituals.</p>
<p>Some of these victims agreed to share their experiences on the promise of anonymity because they still fear their abusers. 
One boy explained how witch-doctors took his blood to be used in such rituals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The traffickers or witch-doctors take your hair and cut your arms, legs, heads and genitals and collect the blood. They say if you speak out I can kill you.&quot;
Another victim feared for her life, saying the &quot;witch-doctor told me that one day he would need my head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to a US State Department report, Uganda has become one of the main source countries for children to be bought and smuggled to Britain. Some 9,000 children have gone missing in the country over the past four years.</p>
<p>The ease with which a child could be procured was apparent when, posing as a British trafficker, I went looking for help in the cafes and bars in the underworld of the Ugandan capital, Kampala.</p>
<p>For $250 (£160) a reformed criminal introduced us to Yunus Kabul, who boasted he had been abducting children for witch-doctors in Africa and abroad, for years.  During our conversation he offered as many children as we required.</p>
<p>Mr Kabul arranged a meeting at an isolated hotel. Unaware he was being recorded, he described how he got hold of children for his customers.</p>
<p>&quot;It all depends how they want it done? I can take you to a family home, I would have no problem to get a child officially or there is a way of doing it secretly, abduct a child.&quot;
I asked Mr Kabul if the police would cause a problem.</p>
<p>&quot;I have to find a house where we can take the supply, the children, in a remote area. So the police cannot find them,&quot; he explained. 
Mr Kabul demanded a fee of £10,000 ($15,600) per child. I withdrew from the negotiations. </p>
<p>The head of Uganda\'s Anti-Human Sacrifice Police Task Force, Commissioner Bignoa Moses, admits there is a problem: &quot;We cannot rule out that children end up abroad because as of now we don\'t have the capacity to monitor each individual and many simply disappear.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the push to normalize pedophilia continues, and as more people seek out occult/sexual experiences, occult based pedophile rings and satanic ritual abuse activity will continue to grow.  Any child that has been scared by viewing or enduring a bloody ritual can be kept in line by watching the violent My Little Pony videos.  Properly conditioned, even seeing a picture of the cartoon characters could keep those kids silent, so they won\'t speak  when their abuser takes them out for pizza during normal business hours.</p>',

            It is the Satanic Occultism that is causing much of these problems.   They are working on spreading this evil practice because it is their "religion".  Also it will corrupt the people and the children.  It must be stopped.  Remember the Satan Club that is allowed in the schools now.  We are becoming to politically correct and allowing the bad with the good just because they can.
