            I respectfully disagree. These guys are complete jokes compared to the disinfo agents of the previous decade. Your thread was useful! Anyway, good luck to you.

            I think it was my very first post here, and the very first reply I received, someone going off on me aggressively accusing me of shilling. I don't really see how it matters if someone is motivated by trying to save children from being sexually abused or even murdered. Like, angry people on the internet and up/downvotes from anonymous strangers.. noooot really a big deal. We need to be able to debate with each other and disagree, or we will suffer the downfall of an echo chamber. I want us to be strategic. I want us to succeed. Someone who flips out and tries to just verbally attack with no constructive thoughts in their post? That's someone promoting an echo chamber. An echo chamber will destroy an investigation. Keep things in perspective. And if you do find anything that might be important, please come back and post it on another account or something. Remember why we are doing this.

             Me too. Mine had a MAGA in their ID but I got the feeling they were acting the stereotype of a Trump bro scenario to make the sub look bad  while arguing with me about my post in a less than helpful manner.
