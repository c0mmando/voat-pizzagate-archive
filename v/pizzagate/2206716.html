            It annoys me that people include Pizzagate into the bucket of traditional conspiracy theories. Pizzagate is a massive OSINT corruption investigation that looks at how people represent themselves on social media over 10 years. The cannibal pedophile part is how pizzagate suspects represent themselves (even if it's a cultural injoke), it wasn't invented out of thin air. As such, it is different than your average conspiracy theory.

            It's also important to remember who created the term " conspiracy theory "

            It is ironic that the American left is a major enforcer of the CIA’s strategy to shut up skeptics by branding them conspiracy theorists.

            Big f'ing deal.  The source of this info is from the  "European Journal of Social Psychology."  The journal's overall peer review rating is poor.  Its 5-year impact factor is 2.22 and is currently rated 21/60 in social psychology academia.  In other words, its basically garbage.

            The tabloid journalism is worthless, as far as the journal paper itself (it's here:
            <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2331/epdf">
             http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2331/epdf
            </a>
            not the link provided by OP).  While I didn't read it completely in depth, it had enough flawed and fuzzy logic within what I did read, to keep me from putting my brain through the pain of wading through the tortured assumptions about what the 5 mini studies could reveal, and the dubious methods as to what constitutes a reliable measure of a someone's 'belief' based on how subjects followed directions to look for patterns in a series of coin tosses.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Limitations and Future Research:  In Study 2, and for some of the dependent variables in Study 5, we only found an indirect effect, and not a direct effect of the manipulation on irrational beliefs. We suspect that the relatively large base-rate variance in these variables precludes a direct influence of relatively subtle manipulations in between-subjects designs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Specifically, from the outset people differ substantially in how strongly they endorse conspiracy theories and supernatural beliefs, with some people being convinced skeptics and others being highly susceptible to such beliefs. People are also likely therefore to vary significantly
in their sensitivity to subtle experimental manipulations. Although the lack of a direct effect precludes strong conclusions about cause and effect, one should bear in mind that the main purpose of this research was to illuminate the extent to which illusory pattern perception is part of the underlying cognitive processes that support irrational beliefs...
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            <em>
             We didn't find the pattern exactly as we predicted due in part to the fact that our subjects varied so much from each other, but all in all we can ignore that enough so that  we can still see a pattern based on an outcome we know must be out there somewhere

            Can you explain how you can ignore Elitism?
Or the fact that Our Founders actually created Elite Patriarchy in total
betrayal of the citizens of this nation, endowing them with land grants,
giving them immense influence and control over our "people's" government,
the nation's wealth and natural resources.
In fact, that was the FIRST redistribution of wealth from the public to Elites.
           </p>
           <p>
            And how is the wage gap between men and women an "illusion" ...
until the early 70's most women were still making only 50% of what males
were making for the same work.  And currently, it's still averaging something
like only 78%.

             but even with all external factors have been adjusted for, a gender pay gap generally still exists.[1][2][3] Unadjusted pay gaps are much higher. In the United States, for example the unadjusted average female's annual salary has commonly been cited as being 78% of the average male salary.[4]&gt;

            Consider also that many women who retired in the 90's and 2000 were 
women whose pensions and Social Security checks still reflect that 
discrimination.  Many women, in fact, who retired in those years, don't 
have private retirement benefits because they interrupted their working
years to care for children.

             Are you really arguing that the "wage gap" is a real thing? Really? Look into the reasons why those numbers exist and don't just buy those inaccurate and misleading stats at face value because they are wrong. You can't compare male v female and ignore the types of career fields and jobs that are involved! Of course you will get skewed numbers if you compare the fields that men choose vs the fields women choose! And women tend to work less hours than men as they are often more available for the kids. That's a choice that families make. It's reality.

             The problem is that even if it were proven to be more beneficial for all you wouldn't want to admit that men are more productive workers and women better nurturers of children.

             <p>
              Nor are men "more productive workers" .... in fact, wherever women work they are highly valued.
And that included their history of production during the War Years.
              <br/>
              That was also true of their military service.
They also find that female police officers bring assets to the work which results
in more peaceable settlement of conflicts and less conflicts.

             <p>
              I'll agree that NATURE recognizes women as the more reliable gender in
giving females the major part of responsibility for reproduction and child care.
             </p>
             <p>
              And what is this ...

             <p>
              Isn't he busy enough trying to deny that male delusion and the Industrial Revolution
created Global Warming which is pretty close to destroy our environment and all humanity?
             </p>
             <p>
              As for child bearing -- also known as creating LABOR for Elites -- I think you've missed that
women are having children by the 5's, 6's, and 7's now... due to Fertility treatments.
Why is that happening?  Because men are losing the ability to produce viable sperm.
Rather than acknowledging that problem and treating men ... the solution was to go
around the problem and fertilize the eggs with accumulated sperm.
             </p>
             <p>
              Men have been working on the artificial womb since time began ... 
the fact that women have the power to create life and they don't is the reason
for their paranoia and hatred of women and Nature.

                Also, you should be aware that INCEST goes back forever ....
Father sexual abuse of daughter -- or Step-father sexual abuse of daughter ...
Females are the most common victims of incest, but also happens to males ... about 12%.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also very common among other males in families - by brothers who sexually abuse sisters and 
presumably brothers.
               </p>
               <p>
                Also, pedophilia is carried out by MALES in families, including fathers, grandfather,
uncles, male cousins, brothers -- and male friends of the family.

                <p>
                 A 1998 Study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.

                 Research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are less likely than heterosexual to sexually abuse children.

                 Perhaps the most egregious and damaging claim promulgated by anti-gay groups is the claim that homosexuality is intrinsically linked to pedophilia and child sexual abuse.  The social science research on sexual orientation and child sexual abuse clearly disproves the claim that homosexuals are more likely to molest children.
                 <br/>
                 A 1998 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 90% of pedophiles are men, and 95% of these individuals are heterosexual.  One researcher explained this statistic by noting, "Gay men desire consensual sexual relations with other adult men.  Pedophiles are usually adult men who are sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children.  They are rarely sexually attracted to other adults.  In fact, research has indicated that gay men and lesbians are LESS likely than heterosexuals to sexually abuse children.  Two studies that examined the sexual orientation of convicted child molesters found that less than 1% in one study and 0% in the other were lesbian or gay.  One psychologist reviewed the existing social science literature on the relationship between sexuality and child sexual abuse and found that "a gay man is no more likely  than a straight man to perpetrate sexual activity with children."  Further, "cases of perpetration of sexual behavior with a pre-pubescent child by an adult lesbian are virtually nonexistent."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Gay rights activists, like all advocates for children's welfare, oppose child sexual abuse and support equitable age of consent laws that help prevent and punish such abuse.
At least 110,000 children are waiting to be adopted in the US.  Approximately 588,00 children are currently in foster care.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
Children who remain in foster care for much of their childhood, as do tens of thousands of American children, are more likely to have emotional problems.  Some children in foster care live in 20 or more homes by the time they reach the age of 18.  Barring gay men and lesbians from adopting or foster parenting is not simply unjust and unethical; it also decreases the number of potential suitable homes for children in need.
Research shows that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are not disadvantaged vis-a-vis their peers raised by heterosexual parents.

                <p>
                 A review of 352 medical records of children evaluated for sexual abuse during a 12-month period at a Denver children's hospital found that less than 1% had been abused by a gay man or a lesbian.  Of 269 adult perpetrators of child abuse identified among the 352 cases of abuse, only two were  gay or lesbian.  The vast majority of the children in the study (82%) "were suspected of being abused by a man or a woman who was, or had been, in a heterosexual relationship with a relative of the child."  And the review concluded that in this sample, " a child's risk of being molested by his or her relative's heterosexual partner is over 100X greater [than the risk of being molested] by someone who might be identifiable as being homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual."

                <p>
                 Let me give you an example of why your way of thinking is so screwed up. My MOTHER left my dad, myself and my siblings when I was 10. Me and my brothers were all separated. If it were not for my DAD, I would have gone to foster care.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My dad had a great paying job, but he had to work out of town Monday thru Friday and could only be home on the weekends. He did that to take care of his family. So, when my selfish mom up and chose to fuck everyone of our lives up and left, my dad quit that great paying job. He left it all behind so he could take care of ME.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He had to start everything over. Him and I had to live in a motor home for a couple of years as he built his life back up, started his own business and got a house. All of that while he himself was devastated over what his wife did to us. While living a couple of years in a motor home, where life was really hard, he never gave me up and decided to go back to his job. He stuck it out until he started his own business and bought us a house. When I was older, I asked him why he didn't just have me stay at my grandma's (his mom who was the only female there for me). He said because I was his daughter. I was HIS responsibility. What a stand up guy!
                </p>
                <p>
                 He was my mom and dad and one of the most loving greatest people I've ever met in my life. I had to go to him for all things female related. He would do the best he could to figure it out or call my grandma for help. My dad never laid a hand on me. In fact, when I hit puberty and started developing breasts, he told me that it wasn't appropriate for me to sleep in bed with him anymore and I cried. There was only 1 bed in the motorhome. But now I see why and how he was being appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When his mom got too old to take care of herself, he built a room and bathroom onto our house and would carry her to and from the bathroom, to bed to the living room, etc.. He would doctor her foot daily and have to get up in the middle of the night to care for her.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My dad fed the homeless, never said a curse word, and if one of his friends cussed, he would tell them to watch their mouth in front of his daughter because she's a young lady. He was very respectful to women. I never heard him yell out of anger.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It was my mom who was absent, in and out of prison and a drug addict! It was my mom who would hurt us and call us names. It was my mom who, on the rare occasion I stayed the night with her, would be so drugged out of her mind that she couldn't even communicate. It was my mom who would take me to parties at 12 where I was offered cocaine, I would be so scared.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Later on when I found my husband, I found someone that was just as loving. Someone that is good and I trust 100% around children. He's a better person than I am by far. He was molested when he was 5 and 6. Terrible I know. You talk about that a lot. But, guess what? He was being molested by a WOMAN.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Other than one grandma, the ones in my life that are good. loving, and respectful people have been men. My brother is amazing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So I am so sick of your man bashing and acting like they're all aggressive and such sick pedophiles. I'm sorry if something happened to you when you were young. But all the things I've read from you for months now, where you praise gay men and trannies, and give all your ridiculous studies trying to prove how much less likely they are to to rape than regular men is getting OLD!
                </p>
                <p>
                 I don't want your idiotic reply full of studies to contradict my story. You are going to be a man hater no matter what. But you irritate the fuck out of many people here with your warped way of thinking. These Satanist that are abusing kids are women too. More than half of the people on this board are men! Most care about children and some would get upset and tell other men off here when females would be called cunts and bitches or if they were being disrespected. Not all men are sick and evil so get that thru your head!

                  Truly sad to hear that your mother was a drug addict ....
and very happy to hear that your Dad was a good guy who cared for you.

                   It was my mom who was absent, in and out of prison and a drug addict! It was my mom who would hurt us and call us names. It was my mom who, on the rare occasion I stayed the night with her, would be so drugged out of her mind that she couldn't even communicate. It was my mom who would take me to parties at 12 where I was offered cocaine, I would be so scared.

                 <p>
                  So are many men good fathers and caring human beings.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But that doesn't change science or reality about what other men do.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Yes, there are women, as well, who sexually abuse children -- most often when they are
under the influence of a heterosexual male.
                  <br/>
                  Catholic nuns, for instance. 
And, yes, while females are the majority of the victims, males are also victims of sexual abuse -- 
about 12%.  Young males are also sex trafficked.
                 </p>
                 <blockquote>
                  <p>
                   I don't want your idiotic reply full of studies to contradict my story&gt;
                  </p>
                 </blockquote>
                 <p>
                  That's certainly clear, but your personal story doesn't contradict science/studies, either.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You have only to look at current news to see females beginning to make known their sexual abuse by very powerful men -- Harvey Weinstein, for one.  His brother has also been accused of sexual harassment/abuse.  And more and more women keep coming forward.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Same was true of Bill Cosby.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  THAT doesn't make your story about your Dad untrue -- 
but neither does it make the studies on sexual abuse of children and who does it untrue, either.

                   Agreed. It's sad. I wanted to see the good in her, but she is too divisive. Cares way more about pushing her personal hatred than the kids, if her body of work is anything to go by. (and it is)

                 Yes, we know men are more sexually aggressive, what of it? Also not impressed by the study. 350 kids at a Denver children's hospital in the 90s before people were coming out in droves? That is an old study! Honestly votescam, what do you want? To rid the world of hetero men? For everyone to be gay? Btw, I sense a distinctly neopagan vibe from you. They love to drone on about "women creating life" and how men are "jealous, fearful" of this ability.  How many virgin females do you know of that give birth? It takes two.

                  But, the Family Research Council, the right wing women's organization hasn't told anyone they've changed their minds about the findings: ** i.e., "that almost all child sexual abuse is committed by men."**

                  No one gets into this world except through the body of a woman -- that includes you.
Presumably some woman cared for you, maybe even loved you.
Despite the violence of some men in their war on women, women love men.
We love them as children and care for them.  They are our lovers and partners.
We love our sons and support them as we love and support our daughters.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It no longer takes "two" to create a live -- in fact it was always true that a man 
could spill his seed on the group, into a cup, or freeze it -- and he doesn't even
have to be present -- and I think men have always known that.
                  <br/>
                  And it scares hell out of them.
If that's what the Native Americans say ... good for them ... very wise/insightful.

                 <p>
                  Women are also the majority gender on the planet -- despite efforts by patriarchy
which still continue on to maim and handicap and murder them
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The women's revolution against male violence continues on in love.

                   I meant only that anyone can look at the world and see that men are more aggressive. It's called testosterone, madam. I did not condone rape. That aggression can be directed into healthy avenues like sports, a hobby, care of one's family or nation. Men are not simply the rapists you envision. They are our sons, our brothers, our fathers, our boyfriends, our husbands, and our friends! They protect us! It's disgusting to see you so prejudiced against HALF THE PLANET! Your attitude is foolish and dangerous. I pray you wake up.

                             Also means that the ugly ideas and thinking that you post makes clear who you are and it isn't very attractive.

                              You're a terrible shill, which is why you catch so much flack. Also when you promote the genital mutilation of children it makes you a monster. That would be you. That is why you people hide. Some of us can see you. When we tell you in person to your face that we can see you your first instinct is to run. People like you have no shame.

                   <p>
                    eucalyptus --
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    There can be many reasons for the violence we see from 
males which is what we're talking about -- 
animal-eating may be one of the causes.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Aggression is much more that competitiveness ...
much more than athleticism ....
and when males are asked to fight for their country that is
one thing ... fighting for a corrupt government is another as
we saw in Vietnam and today's illegal wars of aggression.
(There's that word again.)
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    No one wants to have to expect anyone to be "aggressive" 
toward or against them.  It's a negative.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    And you've found it necessary to distort my words showing female love 
for and care for our sons, brothers, husband just as we care for our female
children and relations.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Women also protect our nation ...
there's an old saying that war is really a war on women and children.
The front lines are no more.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Rape is not sex ... it's about power and domination.
We have more than 200,000 male-on-male rapes in our prisons
every year.  And when these male rapists are released from 
prison one of the first things they do is to "rape a woman to prove
their manhood."
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It is males who have turned the world upside down with
their violence.

                     Then you may want to think about the way you come across to people. I do not have to be educated about the difference between rape and sex, madam. And may I just be honest? I have grown extremely weary of you. When I see your nickname I groan inwardly and roll my eyes. I'm not alone in that.

               God you're dumb.  Why do you think Rosie the riveter is an "iconic image" recognizeable since birth to every American? Same reason they drill the number 6 million.  BULLSHIT MANIPULATION.
              </p>
              <p>
               You'll consider a war in which a half million Americans died a GOOD COUPLE YEARS because women had to toil in munitions factories!  I bet you think the Civil War where 600k Americans died was a REAL HOOT!  And noble, saving blacks!

                The Civil War was guaranteed by Our Founders who saved and supported

                Sounds like you actually believe that the "invaders" were the Discoverers!
Of course they did nothing wrong in stealing this land from 112 million natives
here in one of the greatest bloodbaths ever to take place, challenging even
Christianity's "Inquisition/Crusades."
               </p>
               <p>
                Remind me ...
When was it that Jews held Christians in the Papal States in ghettoes, 
forced them to wear Yellow Stars on their clothing and isolated them
from societies in the Papal States?  When was it that Jews prevented
Christians from getting educations in the Papal States, prevented them
from entering the professions?
               </p>
               <p>
                Tell me about "The Inquisition" where Jews tortured Christians and murdered them
               </p>
               <p>
                When was it that the Jews ran a Christian Holocaust in Germany?
               </p>
               <p>
                Do you recall the dates when Jews railroaded millions upon millions of
Christians in Hitler's concentration camps?
               </p>
               <p>
                Why are you here other than to spread your hatreds:  your sexist, racist, homophobic, anti-Jewish hatreds?

                 Yeah the Bolsheviks, who were Jews, committed genocide against slavs.  No, Hitler didn't kill millions or start the war.  Your problem is womanly sympathy which makes you believe the Jews version over the hundreds of European communities who felt the need to expel them.

Committed genocide against 112 million native people here.
See the Papal Edits on that -- I'll look for a link for you.

                  Meanwhile, Christianity doesn't like women much, either ... the Burning Times...
the women's holocaust.

                  Columbus' most important errand was to spread Christianity here.

                  Hitler himself confesses to "only doing what the Catholic Church had already 
been doing for 1,500 years against the Jews" ... only he admits he's going
further into the "final solution."
I'll see if I can find that for you, as ell.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I'm talking about Elites/wealthy, Slavery and the Civil War because 
of their murderous violence which still goes on today.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  You're here to propagandize against Jews ... in any way you can.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Hundreds of European communities were propagandized over thousands of years
by the Roman Catholic Church with hatred for Jews ... the Papal States were 
steeped in those Catholic Church teachings.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And the Catholic Church went on for hundreds of years more preaching hatred
for Jews from their altars every Sunday.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That's why ... at the end of WWII, the Catholic Church was recognized as bearing
a "co-responsibility for the Jewish Holocaust in Germany."
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Why do you continue to hang out here, doing nothing but trying to spread hatred
for Jews ... especially when you see how many posters here ignore and reject 
your posts?

                None of you dipshits know anything about economics. Or any subject at all for that matter.  You are dumb and I am not.  Since you don't know anything you are just white knighting, which makes you a faggot.

                   Votescam has some valid points on wage gap. Women and children kept poor are easier to exploit for trafficking aside from that fact that the value of the work shouldn't be based on the gender of the worker. You don't have to be a feminist, I don't care if youre not a man.

                     <p>
                      But traffickers don’t merely hide on the internet.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      RaeAnn worked at a fast food restaurant to help her family make ends meet. A group of young adults, led by a girl RaeAnn’s age, often ordered at the drive-thru and flashed money around.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Monica, RaeAnn’s mother, said her daughter was asked how much she made.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      “She was like, ‘$7.50,’” Monica said. “They’re like, ‘Uh, you work so hard.’ They would talk to the managers and be like, ‘Y’all need to give her a raise.’”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The girl in the group later befriended Monica’s daughter on Facebook. Little did RaeAnn know, she was actually a recruiter luring new girls to be trafficked.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      They promised her a lot more money than she was making serving burgers. And RaeAnn’s family was in a difficult spot, so the extra cash sounded good. Plus, she was told she would be going to Wisconsin to sell purses.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      “That was the story,” Monica said.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      But it wasn’t purses being sold. It was RaeAnn.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      She was advertised on Backpage.com with the term “new in town,” one of many secret codes used to suggest an underage female.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      “I kept trying to call her, trying to call her, and it kept going to voicemail,” Monica said. “I felt out of control. I had no control of the situation. Helpless. I felt mad.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      RaeAnn spent eight days in hotel rooms before relatives recovered her. Monica called it a living hell for her daughter.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      “With some of the things she’s had to do,” Monica said, “some of the things she’s seen, she will never be able to undo them.”

                    I didn't read what she wrote today. Our big thing in the past was abortion. All hell broke loose with us on that subject. So it started there and if I go too far, I'll have to deal with her again. 🙄 I can see what you mean on those points. That would be pretty funny if donkey got replaced with a girl LOL. He would cringe and call her a Ccccuuu....

                    I have had a couple arguments as well with Votescam.  The last one was about Transgender.  I can't remember what aspect of it even, but I remember that it was pretty one sided and not being able to have a discussion, like most of us do.  I have had discussions and  was able to be able to agree to disagree.  Not that time.  It was like a truck was running over me.  I will stop now, because I said I can't remember what was being argued about, but think it had something to do with parents pushing their kids at an early age or something to that effect, you know like some stars putting their kids out there.  We know what they are up to.  I said I have nothing against Transgenders, I just don't like it pushed at an early age.  So, I know what you mean.

               The biggest fear of Elite Patriarchy is that women will begin to live
their lives for themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               How do those fears of males connect to the suggestion that there is "organized" sexual 
harassment of women in every workplace by males?

               Here's a story about Ike and lesbians in the military....
While Ike was still fighting WWII, the idea to root out gays in the military
took hold ... until Ike realized just how many serving under his command
were lesbians and how many valuable women he would lose.
              </p>
              <p>
               But when Ike reached the Presidency he did issue an Executive order
to ban gays from Federal employment ....

             There is an earnings gap, there is not a wage gap. Check the BBC website and you can find that offering women a lower wage than men is illegal. Women earn less money due to maternity leave and taking more time off of work/working fewer hours. If it was cheaper to hire women than it is to hire men, companies would solely employ women given they are cheaper labour. I also hear that in several states, women earn a higher wage than men (although I can't site that source, I just heard Milo say it back when he had more substance than just "feminism is cancer")

              Well, strangely enough, it is still called a "wage gap" in media and articles on internet.
This isn't about "offering" ... this is the reality that most employees don't know how much
their co-workers are making.  And this was especially true of women's paychecks vs males
until the second round of the women's movement.
             </p>
             <p>
              I don't think you mean "maternity leave" ... I think you mean raising children.
Maternity leave was at the most 6 months -- and wouldn't effect women's salaries
that much.
             </p>
             <p>
              Many women also worked only part time in order to care for children --
but if you notice what I posted to you which I will post again .....
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap:** unadjusted versus adjusted pay gap **which takes into account differences in hours worked, occupations chosen, education and job experience. For example, someone who takes time off (e.g. maternity leave) will likely not earn as much as someone who does not take time off from work. Factors like this contribute to lower yearly earnings for women,
               <strong>
                but even with all external factors have been adjusted for, a gender pay gap generally still exists
               </strong>
               .[1][2][3]
               <strong>
                Unadjusted pay gaps are much higher. In the United States, for example the unadjusted average female's annual salary has commonly been cited as being 78% of the average male salary
               </strong>
               .[4]
              </p>
              <p>
               A wide-ranging meta-analysis by Doris Weichselbaumer and Rudolf Winter-Ebmer (2005) of more than 260 published adjusted pay gap studies for over 60 countries has found that, from the 1960s to the 1990s, raw wage differentials worldwide have fallen substantially from around 65 to 30%. The bulk of this decline, however, was due to better labor market endowments of women.
               <strong>
                The 260 published estimates show that the unexplained component of the gap has not declined over time.
               </strong>
               Using their own specifications, Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer found that the yearly overall decline of the gender pay gap would amount to a slow 0.17 log points, implying a slow level of convergence between the wages of men and women.[6]
               <strong>
                According to economist Alan Manning of the London School of Economics, the process of closing the gender pay gap has slowed substantially and women could earn less than men for the next 150 years because of discrimination and ineffective government policies.[
               </strong>

               <strong>
                A 2011 study by the British CMI revealed that if pay growth continues for female executives at current rates, the gap between the earnings of female and male executives would not be closed until 2109.[10] Women Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) are paid 16% lower on average as compared to their male counterpart

                Its easier to exploit women and children when they are kept poor. Wage gap is actually super important.

            Typical narcissism ! Not gonna happen anymore! We have too much knowledge and tools at our fingertips nowadays . It only takes one person per family to convince their entire family circle of what's going on and it spreads like wild fire ! If you get  an unpleasant response from a family member that refuses to research it , then I would question that family member !

              The accusation he refers to is the set of death threats he sent to Jem777. A similar MO was found in the death threats sent to AmyJames. Wonder if its the same person.

            I work in psychological research and just to say this isn't a particularly reputable journal, it's got an impact factor of 1.9 and is ranked 28th out of all journals in the area of social psychology. Personally I think questioning the narrative we're spoonfed by the media (now proven biased beyond doubt thanks to Wikileaks) is a sign of superior intellect 🙂

             Most everything we are presented with is massaged somehow to create a fear-reaction. We have been packaged into easy-to-manipulate fear-based right-left boxes so that the manipulator can scream "boo" and cause society to move certain ways. This prevents us from looking up and down. FOX is the originator of this format going back to the beginning of the 1990s and, coincidently, FOX News is the network that emerged from 9/11, a seemingly successful mass-trauma event. Trauma being the catalyst event in the programming of split personalities. I can't say I understand what is going on but I've been paying attention to the slow frog boiling of American society since 1981.

            Imagine being so crazy as to believe the Twin Towers turned to micronized dust in 10 seconds because they were NUKED. And that the 70k cancers are Radiological induced ones. Jesse... some people are just so crazy.

             The Twin Towers formed a Pile of rubble that was ten stories high.  They were not turned into dust.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course somethings were turned to dust or in the case of drywall turned back into dust.  The walls in the WTC were drywall which is actually made of dust.  This is what gypsum looks like.  It's the primary component of Drywall.

              Oh don't worry. Others know of what you've been doing. People who don't take kindly to threatening people exposing the truth are now aware of what you did.

             <p>
              They're probably quietly gathering information right now.

                 Would be tempting, because they have been doing it for years.  But we may all be declared insane anyway.  If not, it will be our chance to speak out about the elite pedophiles, deep state organ harvesting, etc.  After that we will be put in straight jackets.

               The spreading awakening is most definitely happening and we must redouble our efforts.

The psychological pushback can be especially fierce in the most honest, high integrity people as their "world" simply disallows the existence of these horrors.
