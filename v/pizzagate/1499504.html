<p>This is what I said </p>
<p>Hello Rabbi, thank you for taking the time to read my email. I came across some information and was wondering if you could disprove it. Everything appears to be factually sourced. Could you please help me understand this? I am considering abandoning the Jewish faith.</p>
<p>&quot; First of all you must understand that there are people here that would rather suppress this information and will try to discredit this post, however please note that nobody will be able to disprove the sourced facts I\'ve presented.</p>
<p>It\'s not a coincidence that Epstein and his network is Jewish. It\'s not a coincidence that practically all the paedophile rings and Satanic cults that get busted are primarily comprised of Jews. Judaism permits paedophilia. It\'s no different than Islam in that sense, and Islam is actually based upon the five books of Moses. Islam is derived from the name Ishmael who was the son of Abraham. The conflict between Jews and Muslims is territorial, not ideological. The point I\'m making is that Judaism is like Islam in the sense that paedophilia is part of the religion.</p>
<p>Pizzagate is Jewish Khaballism. Kahalballism is Satanism which is a wing of Judaism. Anybody that says Judaism and Satanism is unrelated is a flat out liar. Anybody that says Satanism has nothing to do with pizzagate is once again simply a liar. If you want to bust the Italian mafia you must investigate the Italian community. If you wish to investigate radical Islam you must investigate the Islamic community. If you want you investigate Satanic occultism you must investigate Judaism and the Jewish community. Political correctness has no place in an investigation.</p>
<p>The Finders Cult</p>
<p>Pizzagate is nothing new. There was a Satanic cult of Jews that was busted in Florida during the 80s for kidnapping children. The police even raided a warehouse where they found pictures of children engaging in Satanic rituals. Here\'s some information I\'ve compiled on them. Like I said, Pizzagate is nothing new.</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/Amalek101/1232436">https://voat.co/v/Amalek101/1232436</a></p>
<p>I\'ve identified the first Satanic band in America and more importantly who\'s behind them. The lead singer in Coven comes from an elite politically active family and she admits this herself and even names who they are.</p>
<p>Here\'s the first Satanic band called Coven.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)</a></p>
<p>They\'re also the band that started using the devil horn hand gesture.</p>
<p><a href="http://sli.mg/senxlZ">http://sli.mg/senxlZ</a></p>
<p>Well guess what, their producer Bill Traut was Jewish, as were at least two of the band members.</p>
<p>Bill Traut Jewishhttp://wikivisually.com/lang-de/wiki/Bill_Traut</p>
<p>Guess what else? He wrote songs for them including a 13 min black mass.</p>
<p>&quot;The album concluded with a 13-minute track of chanting and Satanic prayers called &quot;Satanic Mass&quot; (written by their producer, Bill Traut, of Dunwich Productions, and described as &quot;the first Black Mass to be recorded, either in written words or in audio&quot;).&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven_(band)</a></p>
<p>So now I\'ve just proven that Jews started the Satanic music scene, which isn\'t surprising considering the fact that Satanic occultists are primarily Jews.</p>
<p>I\'m still going to do more research into all this, but I already know what\'s up. Jews are Satanists. Jews worship the devil. The Torah Jews are the common Jews which listen to the Rabbis that study the Talmud (Rabbinical Judaism) and the top Rabbis are selected to study Khaballism, which is Satanism.</p>
<p>The Torah Jews are puppets to the Talmudists who are puppets to the Khaballists. Jews are Satanic.</p>
<p>I\'m not religious, but look what Jesus said, who was a Jew btw.</p>
<p>&quot; You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father\'s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">http://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm</a></p>
<p>Ignoring all this religious stuff, the fact still remains that Jews invented Satanic music and the majority of Satanists are Jews.</p>
<p>Now here\'s a lead for you guys to investigate. The singer of Coven Jinx Dawson gave an interview where she admits her family is involved in the occult and politics and even names them.</p>
<p><a href="http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/">http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/</a></p>
<p>She ultimately says that her Grandfather was a Free Mason and it\'s common knowledge that Free Masonry is a front for Judaism. I can show you statements made by both Rabbis and Masons where they admit that Free Masonry is based upon Judaism.</p>
<p>Let\'s take a look at their lyrics now. What they\'re describing is Jewish blood libel. Jews have been accused and found guilty of doing these things all throughout history. Don\'t forget these lyrics are written by a Jew.</p>
<p>Jewish Blood Libelhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel</p>
<p>&quot; Infants\' flesh they did offer For the prince to devour. Covens join, all combine, Powers strong, thoughts align. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot; The cheif of the circle, Known as Malchius drank the blood of a young baby Offered unto him. &quot;</p>
<p>Malchus is a servant to a Jewish high priest.</p>

<p>&quot; In the book of Gideon I have read That the hoarde of evil is not dead In this place where Satan is said to dwell He leads his legions through the depths of Hell&quot;</p>
<p>Gideon was the son of Joash, leader of the Israelites, he won a decisive victory over a Midianite army despite a vast numerical disadvantage, leading a troop of 300 \'valiant\' men.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon</a></p>
<p>&quot; Beelzebub, the prince, is second in line Astaroth, the duke, is drunk with wine Lucifer, the prime minister, handles affairs General Satanachia firmly stares&quot;</p>
<p>All those demons are from the Hebrew bible.</p>
<p>This whole song describes Jewish Satanism. Remember, this was written by a Jew.</p>
<p><a href="http://genius.com/Coven-satanic-mass-lyrics">http://genius.com/Coven-satanic-mass-lyrics</a></p>
<p>Judaism is Satanism. It\'s not a coincidence that all the primary elites busted in paedophile rings are Jews. Epstein has a sacrificial alter on his private paedophile Island.</p>
<p>Anybody claiming that Judaism and Satanism are unrelated is a shill looking out for Jewish interest.</p>
<p>Judaism is Satanism. &quot;</p>
<p>This information was posted in a forum which was discussing the details surrounding  the possible  discovery of a  paedophile ring.  Either this is some top quality sophistry or it\'s accurate information , because I haven\'t been able to disprove any of these claims, and neither have any of my Jewish friends. I\'m hoping you could maybe debunk these claims.  </p>
<p>Thanks &quot;</p>
<p>And here\'s what the Rabbi said. </p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/Pe2pjm">https://sli.mg/Pe2pjm</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/LaUWHE">https://sli.mg/LaUWHE</a></p>
<p>His answer was basically &quot; don\'t think about that stuff&quot;.  The Rabbi wasn\'t able to disprove a single piece of information. </p>
<p>Here\'s what I replied with. </p>
<p><a href="https://sli.mg/oycWCv">https://sli.mg/oycWCv</a></p>
<p>I emailed this question to about 30 Rabbis and I\'ll combine to post their answers.</p>
<p>I posted information that mod Phobos_mothership didn\'t approve of. </p>
<p>This is what he said. </p>
<p>&quot; Post links and reliable sources backing up your claims and support the fact that this is related to pizzagate, and I will stop deleting these posts. But since you probably can\'t, I probably won\'t.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499094/7276952">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499094/7276952</a></p>
<p>So then I posted this and factually sourced ever single claim. </p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106#submissionTop">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106#submissionTop</a></p>
<p>Then he used this excuse instead. </p>
<p>&quot; This is not a Satanism investigation subverse. Read the rules&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499087/7276971">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499087/7276971</a></p>
<p>&quot;That is not what I said. I said prove a direct link between ANY of this bullshit and PIZZAGATE. THIS IS NOT A SATANIST INVESTIGATING SUB.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277059">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277059</a></p>
<p>So at first he said he was censoring me because I wasn\'t sourcing my claims, and then after I source everything he says that Pizza isn\'t about Satanism, which we all know is bullshit. </p>
<p>He\'s deleting other people\'s comments as well. </p>
<p>&quot; my bad, comment was deleted in error as I was deleting the post (its been a crazy day, if you look at the modlog for removals)&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1498834/7276989">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1498834/7276989</a></p>
<p>And this next comment explains his mentality. </p>
<p>&quot; the burden of proof is on you, shillfuck&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277080">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106/7277080</a></p>
<p>This is the mods attempting to control the narrative. They\'re the gatekeepers.  Funny how his first excuse was that it was wasn\'t sourced, then he says Satanism has nothing to do with child sacrifice and pedophila. </p>
<p>This is fucking disgusting. </p>
<p>Btw, I\'m fairly certain that he\'s the other mod KingKong. </p>
<p>I going to start running the mod\'s comments through a speech analysis program to identify patterns and figure out which mods are using alts to pose as different mods. </p>
<p>This subverse is compromised and I\'m going to expose everything. I won\'t give up.</p>',

           This information was posted in a forum which was discussing the details surrounding  the possible  discovery of a  paedophile ring.  Either this is some top quality sophistry or it's accurate information , because I haven't been able to disprove any of these claims, and neither have any of my Jewish friends. I'm hoping you could maybe debunk these claims.

           And here's what the Rabbi said.

           His answer was basically " don't think about that stuff".  The Rabbi wasn't able to disprove a single piece of information.

           Here's what I replied with.

           I emailed this question to about 30 Rabbis and I'll combine to post their answers.
          </p>
          <p>
           I posted information that mod Phobos_mothership didn't approve of.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is what he said.
          </p>
          <p>
           " Post links and reliable sources backing up your claims and support the fact that this is related to pizzagate, and I will stop deleting these posts. But since you probably can't, I probably won't."
          </p>

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           So then I posted this and factually sourced ever single claim.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1499106#submissionTop">

          </p>
          <p>
           Then he used this excuse instead.
          </p>
          <p>
           " This is not a Satanism investigation subverse. Read the rules"
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
           "That is not what I said. I said prove a direct link between ANY of this bullshit and PIZZAGATE. THIS IS NOT A SATANIST INVESTIGATING SUB."
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
           So at first he said he was censoring me because I wasn't sourcing my claims, and then after I source everything he says that Pizza isn't about Satanism, which we all know is bullshit.
          </p>
          <p>
           He's deleting other people's comments as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           " my bad, comment was deleted in error as I was deleting the post (its been a crazy day, if you look at the modlog for removals)"
          </p>

          <p>
           And this next comment explains his mentality.
          </p>
          <p>
           " the burden of proof is on you, shillfuck"

          <p>
           This is the mods attempting to control the narrative. They're the gatekeepers.  Funny how his first excuse was that it was wasn't sourced, then he says Satanism has nothing to do with child sacrifice and pedophila.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is fucking disgusting.
          </p>
          <p>
           Btw, I'm fairly certain that he's the other mod KingKong.
          </p>
          <p>
           I going to start running the mod's comments through a speech analysis program to identify patterns and figure out which mods are using alts to pose as different mods.

            Less is more in this case I believe. By having a strong focus on current leads related to organised and systematic child abuse in trusted institutions, and by being wary of narratives that damage credibility, there is a better chance of having a positive impact.

            I don't think you should abandon your beliefs, but I do think you should respect that this sub has a purpose not aligned with your own motivations.

              I should have added the word "government" before institutions, because the difference between systematic child abuse in a catholic or a jewish institution versus a government institution is that one actually is formally responsible for the nation state I live in. I don't disagree that it happens in other places besides government, but to me, pizzagate is about the corruption of government of a nation state.

            Obviously Jews invented Satan. That's because the idea of Satan is one of the central parts of Abrahamic religion. So the only people who could take Satanism seriously are going to be followers of an Abrahamic religion. Everyone else would do their own thing.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's pagan cults and rituals with similar themes but actual Abrahamic Satanism necessarily come from Judaism, because that's where it was invented.

              Good. But your assumption that no one else understands is preposterous from my perspective. There's plenty of people who are non-religious or atheists or some other religion where it's just taken as obvious fact. Just like it's obvious that Greeks invented Zeus and Mount Olympus.

            <p>
             How fucking simple is that? Show me how I'm wrong and I'll stop posting.
            </p>
            <p>
             People can see that there's an attempt to suppress fact. This is just another wedge for me to drive, along with censorship.

            Christian Zionism is a belief among some Christians that the return of the Jews to the Holy Land, and the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, is in accordance with Biblical prophecy. The term began to be used in the mid-20th century, superseding Christian Restorationism.
           </p>
           <p>
            They're nothing like the Jewish Zionists, which are basically the Jewish mafia at this point.

            Here's something I wrote on the Zionists.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Democrats and the left are funded by Goldman Sachs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump's victory was in response to what the left was doing.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trump is backed by Goldman Sachs and ended up putting Goldman Sachs appointees in charge of the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            Goldman Sachs created a problem, and then they gave us their solution, which was Trump and then Trump gave Goldman Sachs even more power and control over the government.
           </p>
           <p>
            See how it works? Simple as pie.

            Now first of all I assume you dismiss the claim that Zionist Jews control society. I don't want to get hung up on this too much but I'll at least preface everything I'm saying by showing you what I'm talking about. Take a look at everything they control, keeping in mind that Jews are a tiny minority (2% of the population) and network heavily with each other. The Jewish elite are almost one group.

           <p>
            Now here's an article that was written by a Jew named David Brooks who's the top political analyst for the New York Times where he admits that Jews have supplanted the Anglo Saxon elites and now control America. This article was published in the New York Times.

            Keep in mind that there are literally countless documented admissions made by prominent Jews claiming they control Western civilization. If you do your research you'll see that many prominent Jews flat out admit that their people control Western civilization. How about Jewish banker James Warburg,
           </p>
           <p>
            "He gained some notice in a February 17, 1950, appearance before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in which he said, "We shall have world government, whether or not we like it. The question is only whether world government will be achieved by consent or by conquest."

            Joe Biden thanks Jews for giving us multiculturalism, feminism, gay rights,civil rights, immigration, and for shaping America's culture with their control of the media.

            You must understand that those who print the money control politics and therefore society, and that those who control media will control culture which shapes and molds how a populous thinks and acts ( or fails to act). A very small group of tribalist Jews (Zionists) control both of these things. They hold global banking and media monopolies. A private group of tribalist Jews invent money out to thin air and loan to governments at an interest . There's nothing Federal about the Federal Reserve. It's a private institution that has been run by Jews for the last 40 years. They control the manufacturing and distribution of wealth which gives them almost unlimited power and resources. Money is power and they print it. I implore you to do your own research into this because I'm barely scraping the surface.
           </p>
           <p>
            The bankers understand the cyclical nature of politics and have given us a false revolution to retain their grip on power. They are the controlled opposition. It's called full spectrum control/dominance. Trump was nothing more than a false revolution to restore faith in the system that the same elites still control.
