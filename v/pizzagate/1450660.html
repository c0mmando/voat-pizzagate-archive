            if my baby's picture appeared anywhere with the label HOTARD on it I would be furious and ready to do whatever I could to get it taken down and the suspect charged with something.  This is supposedly his godchild.. and he makes remarks like that??

            I think it would also help if someone would address the general pedo/trafficking issues this has helped shine a light on. They just brush it aside, "fakenews" it. These are serious concerns. Real issues. If there was
            <strong>
             anyone
            </strong>
            with decency in the MSM, they could use this as an opportunity. They could even deflect it with, hey, he's not guilty, but I see why people are upset, this is a problem. But it's a problem that's not talked about, and that's why they get away with it. The fact that they brush it aside like it's nothing to be concerned about screams guilt on so many levels.

            Yes, this is the point I was making in my submission "How we know they're guilty." If the children in the suspicious Instagram photos could be identified and shown to be alive and well, it would do a great deal to prove that nothing sinister was going on. Why can't Alefantis do a filmed interview with his (alleged) god daughter beside him? Why are all the attempts to debunk Pizzagate avoiding confronting any of the central issues, such as Alefantis's photos of small children, none of whom are shown with their parents or in natural social situations - making it seem most unlikely that they are simply the children of friends.

            well, if i was one of those kids' parents and IF indeed there was no scandal and everything was fine, i could see how I would be focusing on protecting my kid and trying to get his/her face off the internet and get as far away from the whole thing as possible.  and i also am not sure that parents are gonna be net-savvy enough to even KNOW where to come out and say anything, like they'd see the MSM accounts and think "any reasonable person will know this is fake", like, if they haven't read all the detailed allegations etc.

             I'm not a parent, so I have no idea how I would react or, obviously, how anyone else would react. That being said, it would be soo easy for one of them to do an interview with CNN or wherever to say that James is in fact a good person/friend and we trust him with our child.  It just makes way more sense (to me at least) for them to stay completely silent if they are complicit/nonexistent.

               True. That makes it even more suspect though imo.  I just think its such an easy 'conspiracy' to discredit.  If one of these parents came forward and said something, it would be enough for the vast majority of people to throw the claims out as garbage.  Being silent only fuels the fire and that's why I think there is actually something to all of this.

                Right, but when people have spoken out (like Amanda on this radio show) people are just saying that they're lying shills, i can see how i'd be scared into silence (IF i was a parent and IF there really was nothing to the scandal.)

                 People call them shills, because they have never addressed anything specific. I don't think you can honestly say that they have "spoken out".
