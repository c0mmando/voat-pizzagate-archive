<p>Google searches have showed some connections, such as Chelsea Clinton (Clinton Foundation rep) was speaking at the same event as Andrew Siegel (Advance Publications rep): <a href="https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press-releases/updated-media-advisory-clinton-foundation-self-host-what-works-women-leaders">https://www.clintonfoundation.org/press-releases/updated-media-advisory-clinton-foundation-self-host-what-works-women-leaders</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/IW178">https://archive.is/IW178)</a>)</p>
<p>When I looked on Voat, I couldn\'t find this information. Maybe it\'s here somewhere, but maybe it got lost in the transfer over to Voat? Anyways, what ever came of these connections? Have they been thoroughly investigated?</p>
