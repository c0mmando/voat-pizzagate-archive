<p>A letter sent to then 2010 U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder c/o First Lady Michele Obama requesting a Federal Grand Jury investigation by a Douglas R.Millar from America\'s Bureau of Investigation and Loving Intervention for our Nation\'s Children in Santa Rosa Ca. </p>
<p>Document claims &quot;FBI protected network of Satanists for dozens of years in Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, Marin County, Mendocino County, and the San Francisco North Bay Area, California.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the author of this document, Douglas R. Millar : &quot;The FBI has notified police, including some Ive met and interviewed who had investigated hundreds of Aquino\'s identical crimes in at least eight states. \'Destroy all records on the Aquinos! This involves national security!\' We trust you and the Obamas shall be as shocked by this evidence as we are, because two of the reports given to me by the mother of one of Aquinos\' victims/survivors are titled: </p>
<pre><code>                         Exhibit A: &quot;Parade the nigger day&quot; and Exhibit B: &quot;Office of the District Attorney.&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Pulled up a website associated with the &quot;parade a nigger day&quot; that is still currently active.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.niggermania.net/forum/">http://www.niggermania.net/forum/</a></p>
<p>The letter goes on to asking Eric Holder to hold gain a federal indictment of Aquino on October 17th 2010 the anniversary of Polly Klass in our county...</p>
<p>&quot;Enclosed are dozens of pages of exhibits documenting the Aquino\'s violent crimes against children being covered up by law \'enforcers\' (Our Exhibits list and Exhibits are enclosed)&quot;</p>
<p>The document goes on to how they also prepared the exhibits and reports to AG CA Dan Lungren, who is now a former U.S. representative for California\'s 3rd district, 2005-2013. </p>
<p>The document goes onto acknowledge John De Camp\'s book The Franklin Cover-up and Bohemian Grove. </p>
<p>Douglas R. Millar states that he had worked with John De Camp on similar cases involving Aquino and the CIA network nationwide for at that time, the last 18 years. </p>
<p>At the end of the document, after Douglas\'s signature and date he leaves a P.S. with the following: &quot; PS BEWARE: San Francisco US Attorney Robert Mueller plea bargained a six-month house arrest and no fine for Santa Rosa child pornographer David Asimov , after Santa Rosa police raided his home and found 1,000 child porn videos/DVDs, 14 duplicating machines in a row, plus several cameras and evidence proving he was selling them over the internet, via the U.S. Post Office? Reward? Head of the FBI!&quot;</p>
<p>Then the document is signed by a witness just as when a person is being served with a restraining order, etc. </p>
<p>&quot;Delivery witnessed by: Peter Alexander Tscherneff, survivor of Dr. Josef Mengele\'s mind control.&quot;</p>
<p>There are many other documents to look through on the scribd link, need help looking through them if any connection.</p>
<p>Also, cannot find Douglas R Millar or his apparent organizations.

            Please link referenced document so we can help. Aquino is beyond recompense, and has been since before his time in San Fransisco and at the Presidio. We know his name, we know his crimes against children, and we work towards- and await his being brought to justice. -Until then, lets learn more about their organization/culture, and the weapons they have formed against ours, from this iconic evil archetype.

            I am always telling people to look up his MIND WARS document from 1980, as it breaks down psyops,  Q type Truth movements, and frequency weapons:
