            Unfortunately I know scant about it, other than it's been floating around since pretty much JA was discovered, and it's from his official IG account. I've also looked into one of the unsavory individuals that liked this post, Joe Wills. He's a contractor that's worked with JA on a number of different projects, including the renovation which became Pegasus and also likely pedo as well. Further than that, I don't personally know much about it the full backstory or significance. With how he likes to flaunt his extra-curricular activities, I'd say it's something significant.

            30 "men"?
           </p>
           <p>
            WTF kind of MAN does this to begin with? Even IF the the receiver of this act were a WILLING adult woman (or man)... I mean, Jesus H...those so-called "men" who readily stand in a homo-erotic line full of "excited" males awaiting their "turn" are NOTHING short of animals.
           </p>
           <p>
            Where's the REAL MEN standing up for the victim(s)???  Is valor really THAT dead? At least help the victim, child or not, escape -- or try SOMETHING other that be a complicit fk-stick of a low life. I'd rather DIE fighting these scum than live with myself knowing I could've done something other than cowering.

            I could be wrong, but I believe some investigators in here were incorrectly suggesting that it was #podestathamolesta that was connected to the pig farm. But in fact it was that creep Alefantis. Photos corroborating this via his IG

              I can't tell if you are serious or bullshitting me with the air quotes. I used the hashtag because it's helpful for others how to share information in realtime on platforms like twitter, even if you don't have a following.

            Well, she knows where this farm is so track it down. If you want to get Comet you have to start at the crime and make connections from there. We'd need police reports and whatnot from her case--but it should be doable.

            In her case it probably was a factory farm where migrant workers are exploited. But Cages? That's a whole other animal.  I think Alafantis' "farm" might be a pig farm

             Likely this, yes, but borders are a major part of a nation's national identity, and I think open borders could really be used as a way to forcing countries into losing the sovernignity that they do have left. Meaning a precursor to the roll out of the so-called NWO and the notion of a one world gov't. It'd go something like this:
            </p>
            <p>
             -Eliminate preconceived borders
            </p>
            <p>
             -Briefly open it all up
            </p>
            <p>
             -Then group countries together in new "unions" similar to the EU
            </p>
            <p>
             -Once countries are in new, smaller regions together, it becomes much easier to adopt the world gov't.

             Pedosta's first job in D.C. was slaughtering pigs at he spent two years working at Turkey Run Farm in McLean, now called the Claude Moore Colonial Farm, an 18th-century re-creation.
Talk of pig roasting and slaughter kept popping up during dinner and was the last tale Podesta told before the guests left. To earn money while attending law school at Georgetown, he spent two years working at Turkey Run Farm in McLean, now called the Claude Moore Colonial Farm, an 18th-century re-creation.
            </p>
            <p>
             He dressed in britches, a blousy linen shirt, floppy hat and homemade shoes and learned how to butcher and roast a pig.
            </p>
            <p>
             Standing in the kitchen and acting out his role, Podesta explained: “It’s best to do the butchering at 4 a.m., “because pigs should be slaughtered when it is cool, and it takes a long time to roast them. The pig is hauled on a front-end loader in order to split and gut it. It’s most important to slow the pig down by shooting it between the eyes so you can cut its throat. It makes the pig less ornery and a whole lot more cooperative than if you just stick a knife in its throat.”
            </p>
            <p>
             In homage to these skills, Podesta used to have a picture of a pig on a spit as his screen saver, but his staffers made him get rid of it, because he said: “They couldn’t stand looking into the pig’s eyes during meetings.”

             That was that Alefantis that was connected to a pig farm. Unless there is another pig farm in question that I don't know about, which I doubt. Could be an honest mistake on your part, could be a mistake on my part which I apologize now for if so, but it's incredibly important that we don't unwillingly spread misinformation or make false claims.

              Correction Alefantis has some kind of connection to a pig farm. I don't see it here yet, so I was going to go through my archives, host it and throw it in this thread as a comment reply as it's relevant to this conversation.

              He even slaughters pigs.  Allegedly he had the first pig he slaughtered as a screensaver in his office.  Yes...I know what pigs can be fed to hide evidence.

            Probably not related to the DC people, this sounds like classic Mexican drug cartel tactics.   Farms are where you would expect to find heavy concentrations of illegal migrant workers.  So that would be my guess.  The cartels try and diversify and make money wherever they can...for instance, I read somewhere that the cartels taxing trucks multiple times on their way from Mexico to the US was the reason for the spike in the price of limes in the last couple of years.

              It wasn't Scalia's ranch, it is owned by someone else and primarily used as a hunting club IIRC, and it is in Texas...but Texas is huge with many farms...and we are overrun with cartel and illegals.  Not saying don't dig...just saying with these hoofbeats, it's likely horses and not zebras...know what I mean?  Now, if this lady was from somewhere other than Central America, involvement with the DC crowd would be a lot more likely.

            Good post!
Media should now be looking into the farm. It's owner. and the money.
Someone is being paid by those men who abused this girl.
Media needs to step up and do their jobs and dig deeper into these stories.

            Comet Ping Pong has cages stacked up in the hallway outside the firewood room. Have you seen that picture? This is so sad. I remember seeing something about a migrant farm worker who was being abused by an employer. The Mexicans on farms are easy to exploit. They can't go to the authorities for fear of being deported.

               He's storing alcohol in those cages. It's common in busy cities to store alcohol in a caged/locked room. Keeps it from getting stolen by busboys/dishwashers. You can even see a case of some kind of alcohol near the bottom. I Imagine all that firewood is for his pizza ovens too. I believe he is still guilty of all the things, but I don't think that they're storing kids in those cages.

                I only know that I found it on an archive of all of James Alefantis's instagram pics. I will locate the original post where the link to the album was provided yesterday and you can look through them too. I assume they are all legit. EDIT: Here's a link to one of the pics from the photostream.

                </a>
                Still looking for the Voat post. EDIT: I looked through but since I couldn't find it on Voat, it's probably been deleted by now. But this photostream was still in my history, so maybe I can find the post in my history later.

                 I saw that post, but haven't looked through all them yet. I also presume they are legit, but I don't think we can say for certain just because he posted it to his IG that we are 100% certain that it was taken from inside CPP.

                 Also, wish he wouldn't have hosted those on fucking Flickr. Harder to cycle through them and save locally.

                   Good question, anything by fucking Flickr? Also takes longer for specific images to load. I just think the service is dogshit. Like it's for photographers and people on social media that don't want creeps to be able to steal their photos. IG is the same way, usually have to archive the page or screen shot it.

            Maybe organically farmed means grown with slave labor.  Good way to illegally cut costs.  Increase profit.

             Jesus christ. I looked through your comment history because this comment is retarded enough to raise some suspicion...
            </p>
            <p>
             And I still  don't  know if you're a shill. I'm leaning towards you're not...What I do know is that every comment you make, Is extremely counterproductive.  So much so, that I'm having trouble rationalizing how someone who's not a shill, could consistently make such retarded comments.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not saying you're retarded. I know Nothing about you other than your comments, and I'm saying those are retarded... Maybe stop?
            </p>
            <p>
             I make a lot of retarded comments myself, But I don't think any could be used as away to discredit this research... Where as almost all of yours could be.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ninja edit: and By "almost all of your comments" I mean the comments I read... Which was like 10. So maybe it's just a new thing you're doing.

              A shill wouldn't make such comments.but a morally outraged person would.
Discredit what? You do know this research is very damning to the cabal and so of course their reaction through 
Censorship and intimidation is quite actually should be expected. What concerns me is that PG researchers thinking they can actually take these people down With whatever proof you dig up. You cant.

               Alright man. I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you have no malicious motives, and I will attempt to NOT be a douche.  However, If you continue to argue your opinion, after I coherently explain how it's harmful to this research, You'll have made it overtly clear that I was correct in my original assumption.

               Yes. They would. Remember when A fucking actor walked into comet pizza with a gun?
              </p>
              <p>
               Well you suggesting that a shill wouldn't make such comments, Is the exact same thing as suggesting that an actor wouldn't walk into comet "Looking to save the children". Perhaps I shouldn't have the used "Discredit" as it implies doing something that discredits actual facts.  I simply meant that it could be used to hinder this research.  It gives the people looking to stop this research, a lot to work with.
              </p>
              <p>
               "These guys are saying we need to kill all owners of pizza parlors."
              </p>
              <p>
               You obviously didn't say that, but you should know that the media will take anything out of context, quote a few words you said, and surround the quote with whatever they want. They do this with things that aren't controversial in the slightest, and they make them controversial to their viewers.  However your comment is most certainly controversial, as it calls for violence.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you want to call for violence, Do it somewhere else. This is not an issue of Morailty or free speech.  Yes technically you have a right to say that, but you're coming dangerously close to yelling fire in a crowded theater... Put it this way, There's not a single who's actively researching, that will defend your comment.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why would they not defend your comment?  It's not because they don't agree with you, I'm sure a lot do.... But they know that nothing beneficial comes from rhetoric like that.  In fact, Only negative consequences could come from a comment like that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Please don't misconstrue this as me being a douche, but you contributed nothing by making that comment. Obviously not every comment has to be a contribution, But you're not contributing, and you're hurting those that are contributing, by potentially giving the bad guys something to work with.  You know why MLK was killed? Because he was a rational mother fucker.  He was a rational mother fucker, who knew calling for violence against the people who LOVE To use violence.  They knew how much of a threat he was, by pushing for PEACEFUL protest. Because the bad guys, in a "mostly" good society are powerless if those protesting, are doing so peacefully.
              </p>
              <p>
               You calling for violence gives the bad guys "Justification" to shut this research down.  Because of the nature of this scandal, and considering amount of good people, who either don't believe pizzagate, or don't know about pizzagate, is in the millions, They have a great chances of shutting us down, without the majority of the population giving a fuck.
              </p>
              <p>
               If no one ever made a violent comment, or commited a violent act in the name of pizzagate, there is LITERALLY NOTHING the bad guys could do to shut this down... I truly believe that the majority of people who are privay to what's actually unfolding around us, know not to give the bad guys ANYTHING to work with, so they don't.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is why they had to excute a false flag on comet ping pong. I'm sure they were hoping a legit "good guy" would do something, but they never did, because again, anyone who knows what's happening, would know how counterproductive that would be.

               Of course it should be expected.... Which is why you can't say stupid shit.  The cabal loves you when you make comments like that, They truly do. Because you give them a reason to intimidate and censor. like I said, they have no way to censor if no one calls for violence. If no one calls for violence then you can bet your ass that they will execute    more false flags, and have SHILLS on the internet calling for violence.

               Dude. I didn't read your whole comment before replying. I was just going to address you "points" as I went, but I regret not reading it all at once. Had I, I probably wouldn't have wasted 10 minutes typing that. I truly believe you are shill now, however, I will finish this without being a douhce, or attacking you. I will continue to give tou the benefit of the doubt.

               You don't know all of the facts. even the ones that have been made public, you make the overtly clear... But for every fact that has been made public, there are 10 that have not been revealed yet..  Never has a president been hated as much as trump. who is pushing the hate? The people that have been controlling everything for decades. Nothing has happened in the past because the people controlling it, didn't want it to stop, and actually wanted it to continue. That's not the current case this time.

                 i don't follow anyone... I'm too busy to follow you, as I'd be forced to comment on every retarded comment you make. I only have about an hour a day devoted to telling retarded people they're retarded...
                </p>
                <p>
                 why? Have I Commented on a different retarded comment you've made?
                </p>
                <p>
                 In fact, I don't even know what you said that lead me to write the long ass comment above, and I don't even know what is in the comment above. As I type this, I can only see the part were I call you and, your conerns, retarded.  I Completely forgot as to why...
                </p>
                <p>
                 But I know my comments are always justified.  That doesn't mean my comments are always correct.  I can be wrong in a comment, but be justified in making the comment... Meaning, Based on my interpretation of your comment, you most certainly are retarded.  But maybe my interpretation was wrong... However, in this case you've reinforced my originally assumption.  I just wanted to clarify that I'm not saying that I'm not always correct in my assumptions.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But Based on the last paragraph from my comment above. I know you're retarded. I know you're retarded, without having to waste space as to remembering why you're retarded.  With the added benefit of not having my mood affected by rereading what ever retard comment you originally made.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And As I said in the comment you didn't read. If you stop being retarded, I'll apologize, as my assumptions would be proven wrong.  My current stance is that you're actually retarded. If you stop being retarded, It means you were just saying retarded things, and by all accounts, not actually retarded.  We all say retarded things, and by no means Is that an indication one way or the other, as to whether they are legit retarded... And obviously retarded is a very broad word.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One could argue,
                 <sub>
                  and I'm sure a couple hours from now, I'll agree,
                 </sub>
                 That this comment is actually retarded... But you'd have to be a retard to assume that I'm retarded, based on this retarded comment.  It's obvious I'm not retarded, but it's equally obvious this comment is pretty retarded... Ya know what I mean?
                </p>
                <p>
                 No? Well maybe you should attempt to not be retarded, so that you can interpret retarded comments made by people who aren't retarded.

              No fucking shit. People are fed up.
And you know if they arrest all the people in charge which you do know will never happen they have enough money and black mail power to stall justice for years.  All these pizzagate researchers thinking all their exposure will put them in prison are in denial.
We must cut off the head snakes first in order to put a dent in all this. Then their cronies will be fighting to grab control and then you go in for the kill

             is Daniel Gutter. Co owner of Pizza Brain in Philadelphia. I caught him lurking the sub in the same time frame. He and Brian James Dywer (former owner) DMed me on Instagram trying to be cute.  Literally 10 minutes after I posted a submission about them exposing their bullshit. So we know they are watching very intently

              My theory with these shills is they can't conceive the CIA could be running Brownstone Operations. And even if they knew about the Brownstones it's ok because Pedophilia is like Hadrian and Antinous.
             </p>
             <p>
              George Webb described it as long as everything is compartmentalized then no one group will suspect a thing.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unfortunately they don't realize Pedophilia isn't just Handrian and Antinous. It's also poor black Haitian throw-away children.
             </p>
             <p>
              Basically they're in hard core denial because acknowledging Brownstone Ops are a possibility would literally shatter their minds given complicity.

                I stopped watching when he said Trump was involved. Not because I love Trump that much, just that if he is involved, then there is no hope at all. Did George stick with his theory about Trump?

                  Nor have I.  Awhile ago, Webb was talking about the parties held in NYC(??? was definitely not Pedo Island) with major international players in town for meetings.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Webb said the parties had three distinct stages.  The first was just a "meet and greet," cursory glad handing with the bigwigs.  Stage 3 was where the (underage?) sex action took place.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Webb emphasized several times that, while Trump did attend some of these events, he never - not once - stayed beyond Stage 1.   I think he said, Trump only stayed about 15 - 20 minutes.

                  I wish I remember what number it was. I only watched them sporadically. I think it was right after Braverman went to google. I'll try to find it when I get a chance. Maybe he was just thinking out loud?

                   I do not recall him saying that either-just that he was "concerned"  because Trump had tapped Jeff Feinberg of Dyncorp fame  to be one of his top advisers. Hopefully he is following the strategy of keeping your friends close and your enemies closer. 
 All we can do now is pray, educate ourselves and others. And keep watching George Webb. He is presenting by far the most solid case against the most evil creatures we will ever encounter.

                   He may have said it in passing or maybe theorizing Trump could be potentially bought off but George is constantly sending advice to Trump from the videos. He says stuff like "If Trump wants to get the dirt on people look here........" or "All Trump has to do is get the Meta-Data of the 650,000 emails on Weiner's laptop released......"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So no George doesn't think Trump is involved.
