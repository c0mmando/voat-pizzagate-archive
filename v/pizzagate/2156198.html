<p><strong>EXCLUSIVE: “Yes, 100%  I believe both Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington were murdered”</strong></p>
<p>Interview with music rock journalist Randy “Rocket” Cody of THE METAL DEN</p>
<p>By Monica K. Lerintiu</p>
<p>Who is Randy Cody? And why only you so serious in this very dark and confuse “Chris Cornell‘s Case?”</p>
<p><em>&quot;I am rock music journalist. I own and operate my own website called TheMetalDen.com, which is currently read in over 100 countries and is considered one of the premiere spots on the web for hard rock and heavy metal news, reviews and interviews. Over the past 2 months, on Twitter social site alone I have earned over 6 million impressions. ‘Earned’ means I did not have to pay any advertising dollars to reach that massive amount of people. I just happen to be very popular due to the work I do. It feels really awesome to have that kind of support.&quot;</em></p>
<p>What and when did you start to perceive Chris Cornell’s death as a real case, with strong and so obvious proof?</p>
<p><em>&quot;The EMT (emergency responder) that worked on Chris Cornell’s lifeless body was recorded on audio stating that Chris had “trauma to the back of head”, and “possible signs of strangulation”. chriscornellheadtrauma-1-300x261Yet, the autopsy report by Theodore Brown in Detroit makes no mention of the head wound. Despite the fact fans who watched Chris’ final concert on YouTube notice that a large chunk of hair has apparently been ripped out of his head in a violent manner. Read the comments from literally hundreds of fans, it’s not just me who sees the head wound.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Who is this <strong>Linda Ramone</strong> that I’ve heard about lately? And why so close to Chris Cornell’s family?</p>
<p><strong>Linda Ramone</strong> is the widow of Johnny Ramone, <strong>and she is an alleged satanist with ties to Courtney Love and spirit cooker Marina Abramovic</strong>, who is also friends with John Podesta, the man who is purportedly involved in child trafficking and ritual sacrifices. #Pizzagate is trending big time right now and that is tied to #Pedogate but was given a different name by the American mainstream media to try and make it look like fake news. But my extensive research shows that there is indeed a large elite evil pedophile ring active today. I was told by a source who works in the rock music biz that Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington were going to expose before they died. Now I first wrote a story on May 20 at TheMetalDen.com connecting Chris’ potential homicide to Pedogate after I was informed of his foundation’s work with abused children. That same story was later picked up by a site in the UK called NeonNettle, and then like 6 weeks later another site ran the story and it exploded into a viral sensation when Chester was found dead. That article was shared one million times off one site and then another one hundred more big news sites picked it up from there, so the views on that story I did is easily over one billion now I estimate, give or take a hundred or million or so. It is <strong>simply mind blowing</strong>.

           </p>
           <p>
            Vicky seems to walk ahead of him.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe there is a rock star reason. for this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't know.     Chris seems to  hunch over at times.
           </p>
           <p>
            Observers of Chris and friends said that Vicky led Chris around with a leash.

            Like the Rothschilds possibly. Her last name Karayiannis is one of the wealthiest families in the work. They are much more hidden but are top financiers of the globe.

            This was mentioned almost immediately after his death. His supporters and investigators believe she is complicit.....she needs further exposure

             .  Thanks can't even put it into words.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vicky was living in a Paris apartment with her mother and brother
            </p>
            <p>
             when she met Chris Cornell.  Vicky's brother arranged the introduction.
            </p>
            <p>
             I know stuff based upon my research since May 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
             A few things:
            </p>
            <p>
             Vicky has a brother named Nicholas.  He was drunk and driving.  He killed a person.  Not charged.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes it is a Greek family.
            </p>
            <p>
             The family owns a well known restaurant in Brooklyn New York.
            </p>
            <p>
             Huma's husband  Weiner was noted as a regular patron there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Read this info in a Christian Science Monitor article.  Will look for it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Will  ping you  a post germane re: Vicky, Chris widow.

            it really pisses my off about vicky, chris' wife. what a cunt for being mealy mouthed about chris' death. it's a real slap in the face to his family, friends and fans. also, his wimpy bandmates for not coming forward either. what a shitty biz.

              thanks for that! wow, just wow. it's weird, the first time i saw pics of her (right after chris' death) i had this instant negative reaction. i couldn't explain it, but now i think it was a bit of intuition.

             I agree. Yet, personally I'm not ready to throw in the towel on this particular aspect of the pizzagate narrative. I do know through my own understanding that this possibility is not beyond the norm for this sort of thing but I find a healthy amount of speculation and reservation is required for an objective rationalization, partially in essence to retain some amount of credibility within this investigation because this is one of those aspects that simply stuns the crowd and automatically creates a sort of cognitive dissonance.

               Yeah I figured that's what you meant but thought you should clarify since it wasn't completely clear.

            So I know this might sound either naive or dumb, but has anyone considered that Kurt Cobains death could've been related to PG via Courtney Love?
           </p>
           <p>
            If someone has already speculated on this and you have a link to some info that'd be great. I've always thought she was the direct reason behind his death, but being PG related would make a ton of sense.

             The Cobain and Courtney Love angle is huge. Courtney herself has to be a monarch trained finder. Her father Hank Harrison at one time managed the Grateful Dead. He'll even toss his daughter under the bus when it comes to Cobain's death. This is the note that was found in Cobain's wallet after his death: 'Do you Kurt Cobain take Courtney Michelle Love to be your lawful shredded wife,' the note begins, 'even when she’s a bitch with zits and siphoning all (your) money for doping and whoring.'
            </p>
            <p>
             "Adding to the scuzzy appeal of the note, it is written on paper from the Phoenx Hotel in San Francisco's gritty, crime-infested Tenderloin district."

              Rockstar digs percolating with transient energies; if only these walls could talk!
             </p>
             <p>
              Been here a number of times. The lounge is cozy, hip, and chock full of shelves crammed full of vinyl. Funny, I didn't see any turntables anywhere...
             </p>
             <p>
              Hotel room 61 is as remarkably charged (vibe-wise) as I remember it from years and years ago. I think that bullet hole in the sliding glass door leading to the veranda is fresh, however (my limited detective skills determined that the shot apparently came from INSIDE the bedroom). Said veranda reeks eversoslightly of nicotine and there is a charming altar-esque scorch mark on the living room ceiling what conjures up scenes reminiscent of Jimmy Page's fascination with Satanism and occult guru Aleister Crowley (see: Zeppelin hey-day tour chronicle Hammer of the Gods wherein Page's penchant for ritualistically holing up in candle-lit hotel rooms with very underage "acolytes" is detailed greatly). The fact that real-world crack deals and ladies of the evening brandish their vendibles in full view from the glass-enclosed confines of the veranda's overlook almost invalidates the existence of the flat screen TV that comes with the room. Of course, the heated pool further eliminates the need to pay any heed to either TV or the bitter realities that lurk just a few feet from the Phoenix's backdoor. It IS possible to really stay-cation here, even if you call the tenderloin home.
             </p>
             <p>
              Be advised that one of the best, reasonably priced, and egregiously overlooked (in my opinion) Vietnamese eateries lies just across the street from the hotel. After the lounge pulls your pants down over the price of their scrummy cocktails, forgo further financial fudge-packing by filling your bellyat Vietnam House where you feed a family of five for the price of two, maybe three small plates at the Phoenix's lounge. Or don't go out at all; the brussel sprouts &amp; bacon small plate is yummy and kiiiind of filling, but not.__-----
This is a review of the Phoenix Hotel. It is in the Tenderloin but is a famous rock and roll hot spot. Plenty of occult art, swimming pool decorated with six six six.

            It is strange that all of the Ramones died one by one. Linda sacrificing them makes sense. I believe Joey was brought up in a satanic household and was actually female.

            I'll say this much. If fake, it is an expertly woven tale. I never believed for a moment that Chris OR Chester committed suicide. I need to hear more before I can accept this, but as I said, if fake, they did a great job compiling those bits and pieces and creating a plausible narrative.

            Sounds exactly like the thuggee cult, where we get the word thug.  They would befriend people along a trail, then suddenly strangle them.  A movie was made about this with Pierce Brosnan.  Its rooted in islam.  Most of these deaths seem connected to so-called 'friends'.  Finding out who these people were with that day would narrow it down.  The islamophile would be a first clue.  Look at Chris Kyle, Breitbart, Seth Rich etc were all out with 'friends' earlier.

            <p>
             Sung together at The Beacon Theatre in New York City on October 19, 2015.

             Worth a listen.

             Seems  prophetic.  Stop killing our prophets.

                My point was it wasn't just a song he sang.  It's the quite famous Redemption Song.

               About a week and a half ago, someone discovered that Vicky, Linda Ramone, &amp; Alexandra Osipow Vissicchio had all been removed from the listing of the board of directors, and only Chris remains.

              Also, someone named Jessica Diep is now listed as owner. They are now operating as a "civic &amp; social association" since they lost the 501c3 status."

             "Again, “Pizzagate” was a controversy that started once “Pedogate” stories began to break out in America, tying Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign manager, John Podesta, to a pizza parlor that allegedly hosts “pizza parties” which is pedophile lingo for having sex with innocent kids. A guy named Seth Rich leaked the scary details in emails via wikileaks last year and then shortly afterward he was found dead. He was at one time employed by the DNC, in charge of maintaining their computers."

             "All I can tell you is that I am former United States Marine, with an honorable record, and I am not being paid at all to do this work. My site does not allow mainstream ads or take part in click bait. I am even blocked now from my videos being monetized on YouTube, they will not pay me my percentage of ad revenue dollars earned because they deem anyone who reports on either “Pedogate” or “Pizzagate” to be fake news. TMDlogoWhen the truth is, this scandal is very real. Kids are being plucked out of their homes and put in pedophile foster care… many are killed in satanic sacrifices, as hard as that is to believe. All you have to do is go online and start doing some basic research. Although,Facebook and Twitter are censoring “truthers” like me now too, and trying to hide this content from the public, you can still find it. There is a ton of evidence and proof the scandal is real, as long as you are willing to keep an open mind."

            <strong>
             I do not understand the relation between Illuminati and Chris Cornell? Illuminati does really exist? Why in America? They are Americans?
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <em>
             "Good question. I know a lot of people feel that the Illuminati is a myth, but unfortunately it is very real, and the freemasons (the Illuminati) who founded America, are claimed to be comprised of many of the current elite people in politics, business, Hollywood and music taking part in satanic rituals as part of their secret society at a place called Bohemian Grove, among other spots. It is said, amid this secret society, that many past US presidents are alleged to have also been fully involved. They are attempting to take over the world. They are the fallen angels who are trying to bring in the Luciferian [Satanic] agenda to our society and a New World Order around the globe. These diabolical monsters are known to sacrifice babies who are not even one year old yet. That is why there are so many missing kids in America over last 30 years. They harvest the blood of the young for what is called “Parabiosis” blood transfusion. They drink and bathe in the blood too. They snuff out the innocent kids they snatch from homes and then sacrifice their body in a satanic ceremony. Many times they also film this and sell the “snuff film’ to the elite of society. Many have reported seeing these types of gruesome films on the dark web, although I have never seen one myself. It is said this kind of thing occurs regularly in pedophile rings."
