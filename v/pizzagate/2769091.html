<p>Three women from La Dorada, Caldas were arrested on charges that for 10 years they had recruited girls and women between 15 and 19 from the small town with promises they would be able to find work abroad.</p>
<p>The girls were then sent to Trinidad and Tobago, and forced to work in the Caribbean country’ sex industry, the Prosecutor General’s Office said in a press release.</p>
<p>The suspected recruiters of the human trafficking ring were sent to jail in Ibague, Tolima while awaiting trial on human trafficking charges.</p>
<p>The Prosecutor General’s Office said it had filed an international arrest warrant for a fourth suspect, who allegedly received the victims and put them to work in Trinidad and Tobago. The woman is suspected of being the mastermind of the sex trafficking operation.</p>
<p>According to the prosecution, the prime suspect would report victims who refused to work or fell ill with authorities of the Caribbean nation state, securing their arrest and imprisonment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the most recent statement received in Colombia, one of the victims of this structure pointed out that in the immigration service she was with 28 young Colombian women recruited in the same way and that in prison she shared a cell with nearly 80 women, all victims to the human trafficking network.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Mario Gomez of the prosecution unit in charges of crimes against children and adolescents urged women and girls to “not believe in foreign job offers with exorbitant salaries, this is a fable.”</p>

<p>According to the United States’ Department of State, which monitors global human trafficking, Colombian authorities had “identified 96 trafficking victims” last year.</p>
<p>“Of these, 69 were exploited in sex trafficking, 12 in forced labor, two in forced begging, and 13 were unknown,” the State Department said in its 2018 report.</p>
<p>“NGOs acknowledged improved coordination, but criticized delays in service delivery, lack of long-term victim assistance, lack of attention to vulnerable populations, and lack of systematic verification of quality of care,” the report said.</p>
<p>Colombia is both a source, destination and transit country for human traffickers who subject their victims “to sex trafficking and forced labor in Colombia and throughout Latin America, Asia, and Europe,” said the State Department.</p>

            These "NGOs'" need to stop paying 100k plus salaries to their top people. Instead use the charitable donations and tax exemption status to push governments into making tougher laws against violators and actually use the received donations to help the survivors, instead of running public relations champagnes and expensive diner parties.

              I'm well aware of how it works in reality. If people keep donating, their schemes, keep going on..........
             </p>
             <p>
              You left out how those tax exempt donations are also used to fund political parties. Why do you think so many politicians are related to people working in NGOs'?

            WOW.   This is a horrible case of abuse, and who knows how horrid the abuse was.  Some may even have been subjected to SRA for all we know.  Thank God another ring has been broken and that the Children and Women were rescued.

            I cant wait to find out the name of that woman.  Will it be someone connected to a High Level Office in the US or EU? My suspense is mounting.

             ,,,,,Clinton has helped Frank Giustra, biggest donors to the C G I, score meetings with high-ranking Colombian officials. Giustra has several business interests in the country, both he and Clinton have collaborated on an effort to fight poverty by partnering up with mining companies in Colombia and elsewhere. and whom Bill personally introduced to Colombian President Uribe (Giustra is the same guy Clinton helped land a uranium deal in Kazakhstan.
            </p>
            <p>
             2007, Clinton received an award from President Uribe for his efforts to reverse the country’s image in the United States. t “the Colombia government [was] trying to counter its negative image among Washington Democrats and secure congressional passage of a free trade agreement.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Bill hosted a “philanthropic event” with the Colombian leaders in Sept 2005. The purpose, , was to introduce Uribe to Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining tycoon who was interested both in mineral rights and Colombian oil, a position that lent itself to a more open-trade environment.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Clinton WH used a poll commissioned by a very interested party to help provide cover for the Colombian initiative
            </p>
            <p>
             . Here’s how it worked:
            </p>
            <p>
             defense contractor Lockheed Martin commissioned Democratic pollster Mark Mellman to conduct a poll which concluded that 56 percent of registered voters would support $2 billion being spent on “tracking planes to be flown in drug-producing areas.” Lockheed’s smart bomb hit its mark: five months after this manufactured mandate was presented to the president, he proposed the $1.3 billion package, confident that he could shake “the will of the people” (or at least the 800 people Mellman offered his tailor-made questions to) in the face of opponents.

              I remember at the time of the uranium deal that BC was reported to be flying around with someone in a plane.  Must have been Giustra, also believe it was some High Level Guy from Kazakhstan.  I can't understand how they can keep all this in their heads.  They have so many irons in the fire, it would blow my mind.  It's beyond comprehensible to me.  I know Giustra is Super Dirty

               As for Guistra, Read this entire article. Its now behind a paywall at the NYT, but here's an archived copy, and an exerpt from it. I can't believe it was published by the NYT as its so damning for the Clintons.

               The path to a Russian acquisition of American uranium deposits began in 2005 in Kazakhstan, where the Canadian mining financier Frank Giustra orchestrated his first big uranium deal, with Mr. Clinton at his side.
The two men had flown aboard Mr. Giustra’s private jet to Almaty, Kazakhstan, where they dined with the authoritarian president, Nursultan A. Nazarbayev. Mr. Clinton handed the Kazakh president a propaganda coup when he expressed support for Mr. Nazarbayev’s bid to head an international elections monitoring group, undercutting American foreign policy and criticism of Kazakhstan’s poor human rights record by, among others, his wife, then a senator.
Within days of the visit, Mr. Giustra’s fledgling company, UrAsia Energy Ltd., signed a preliminary deal giving it stakes in three uranium mines controlled by the state-run uranium agency Kazatomprom.
If the Kazakh deal was a major victory, UrAsia did not wait long before resuming the hunt. In 2007, it merged with Uranium One, a South African company with assets in Africa and Australia, in what was described as a $3.5 billion transaction. The new company, which kept the Uranium One name, was controlled by UrAsia investors including Ian Telfer, a Canadian who became chairman. Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Giustra, whose personal stake in the deal was estimated at about $45 million, said he sold his stake in 2007.
Soon, Uranium One began to snap up companies with assets in the United States. In April 2007, it announced the purchase of a uranium mill in Utah and more than 38,000 acres of uranium exploration properties in four Western states, followed quickly by the acquisition of the Energy Metals Corporation and its uranium holdings in Wyoming, Texas and Utah. That deal made clear that Uranium One was intent on becoming “a powerhouse in the United States uranium sector with the potential to become the domestic supplier of choice for U.S. utilities,” the company declared.
              </p>
              <p>
               Still, the company’s story was hardly front-page news in the United States — until early 2008, in the midst of Mrs. Clinton’s failed presidential campaign, when The Times published an article revealing the 2005 trip’s link to Mr. Giustra’s Kazakhstan mining deal. It also reported that several months later, Mr. Giustra had donated $31.3 million to Mr. Clinton’s foundation.
(In a statement issued after this article appeared online, Mr. Giustra said he was “extremely proud” of his charitable work with Mr. Clinton, and he urged the media to focus on poverty, health care and “the real challenges of the world.”)
Though the 2008 article quoted the former head of Kazatomprom, Moukhtar Dzhakishev, as saying that the deal required government approval and was discussed at a dinner with the president, Mr. Giustra insisted that it was a private transaction, with no need for Mr. Clinton’s influence with Kazakh officials. He described his relationship with Mr. Clinton as motivated solely by a shared interest in philanthropy.

                 Did you hear about the Chinese microchips in every frickin computer in government and industry.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                 <p>
                  Nested on the servers’ motherboards, the testers found a tiny microchip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, that wasn’t part of the boards’ original design. Amazon reported the discovery to U.S. authorities, sending a shudder through the intelligence community. Elemental’s servers could be found in Department of Defense data centers, the CIA’s drone operations, and the onboard networks of Navy warships. And Elemental was just one of hundreds of Supermicro customers.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  During the ensuing top-secret probe, which remains open more than three years later, investigators determined that the chips allowed the attackers to create a stealth doorway into any network that included the altered machines. Multiple people familiar with the matter say investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China.
