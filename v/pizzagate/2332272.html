<p>From all that is coming out he appears to be an obvious sociopath and much is coming out about his lies and manipulations. it is true that he pissed off Scientology but my question is how much did that \'church\' cover for him during his 35 years in it. I am not the best researcher so i am posting this on Voat Pizzaagate as we know what the Clinton Foundation got up to there and we know about what has happened to many children there under the auspicious lie of helping them. He connects to many of the dirty Hollywood \'deletes\' and one woman commented in one of the articles that she heard more about his abuses in Hollywood than Weinstein\'s. Throwing it out there and I am fully aware that everyone should be given a fair trial. Innocent until proven guilty but the shit is just racking up up up on him. 
p.s. I personally know him to be a liar. However, i am as shocked as anyone by the amount of crap coming up about him.</p>',

            A very interesting development, and I agree that he displays sociopathic traits.  Even before his first rape accusation, he was minimizing and deflecting for Harvey W., possibly massaging the message in case he met the same fate.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Here's his significantly less than full-throated denouncement of Weinstein before he himself was accused:
            <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/21/hollywood-finished-paul-haggis-harvey-weinstein-scandal">
             https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/21/hollywood-finished-paul-haggis-harvey-weinstein-scandal
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             "Although everyone thinks it is vile behavior, you have got to focus on those who may have colluded and protected him.  For me, they are as guilty as he is and in some cases more so, if I can say that. I mean, he was a predator and a predator is a predator. But what about those who would rather look the other way?"
            </strong>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            And his rather dispassionate take on pedophilia in Hollywood from the same article:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             "Most of this behaviour has been aimed at women, but I am sure that former child stars such as Corey Feldman and Corey Haim, who have both made allegations in the past that no one took seriously, are worth considering, too.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             “Were people covering for paedophiles, too? We have to think that may have happened as well, because no one speaks out about being abused just to benefit their career. I find it particularly terrible that people had their dreams held to ransom in that way.”
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Hollywood, Haggis believes, always invites newcomers to sell their souls.
            <strong>
             “People make compromises, but you don’t have to. I did sometimes, of course, especially in my early TV days..."
            </strong>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Also from the article:
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             "Haggis does not think sexual harassment and abuse are endemic in Hollywood, but admitted it is a “fairly sexist” town. “It is not an innocent place and never has been."
            </strong>
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            This guy has both feet on banana peels.  If a hard fall does come, the question is whether abused children will factor in.  His heavy involvement with kids in a chaotic foreign land with a history of human trafficking does make you wonder.  Could he really be a ruthless rapist of women and yet a kind and loving benefactor to vulnerable children in a place like Haiti? We will see what unfolds for Mr. Haggis.
           </p>

            Not to be a dick but is this normal?? I mean really?? Jan 6 almost every newspaper and MSM covers a story about 3 more women coming out with allegations, one claiming she was raped by Paul Haggis, which makes it now 2 women claiming that. Yet, on Jan 8 Paul posts this on his twitter???!! Like, look at me and my family, we are all okay!! It just seems so odd. let's say you are innocent and that Scientology made up lies about you with women being coerced into lying about you raping them. I would be, as well as my family, devastated. I would not be thinking of a photo op. Something very very weird here. Fire your fucking publicist Paul, that bullshit manipulation doesn't work anymore. You are fucked! Even has the ex wife who he fucked around on in the photo! Wow!!

             Glad ya like it. It has a ring to it and people calling them 'elites' has always bothered me. The DELETES!!  That's way more appropriate for the scum they are. 'Trailer park trash' but I actually have had friends that lived on trailer parks and it does them a disservice. People that abuse women and children and then lie lie lie! Delete these clowns

            In the comments under a TMZ article about him is this:  " I work in Hollywood and I heard haggis name come up more than Weinsteins. Trust me, he's done this with dozens to hundreds of women for the last ten years with the promise of help in the business"

            I understand, back in December with the first victim coming forward,  most of us suspected Scientology was behind the attack on him but then 3 more came forth and it appears more may be on the way. Where there is smoke...

            "Paul admits in your article that he came to Scientology a very flawed individual. He halfheartedly confesses to a murky, if not criminal past, calling himself “a bad kid.” At this point in Mr. Wright’s mind-numbingly protracted article I was surprised to see an unexpected kernel of truth appear. Paul’s admission of a long term inability to stop himself from committing harmful acts against others is the most honest comment I have ever heard him make, and while I commend any effort to come clean to any extent, just the fact that he worked so hard to excuse and obscure what more there is to tell suggests a Titanic-size iceberg still remains below the surface".
           </p>
           <p>
            This from a blog that was taken down shortly after his sister Kathy unfortunately died. Here is the recovered blog
            <a href="https://kathyhaggis.com/">
             https://kathyhaggis.com/
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently Kathy was also in Scientology but keep in mind this was her brother. Reading through the many posts it becomes clear(to me anyway) that apart from her being in that goofy church she really spills the beans on him. Even if half of it was her protecting that 'church' it still doesn't discount or invalidate many of the claims as they also ring true for me and my albeit few exchanges with him. My hope is that at least his charity(which he has resigned from) was a little bit on the up and up and that outside pressure had him create something that does benefit the people of Haiti. My heart tells me that more than likely, as he always does, he started the organization so as to appear to be a good guy. This is his primary modus operandi. Sadly that church can't cover for him anymore and I doubt he can lie his way out of this mess. My advice Paul, just come clean about all your manipulations. The people you have intentionally hurt and scarred. Start with your first wife. Then move on to ideas you have stolen from others and trickery you have been a part of.
You have been so busy for so long destroying other people's lives and their livelihoods you are NOT beyond reproach. Personally I don't think you are 100 per cent evil, just a run of the mill sociopath

             In an in-depth 2011 interview for The New Yorker, here are some of the things Haggis said about himself:
            </p>
            <p>
             “I was a bad kid,” he said. “I didn’t kill anybody. Not that I didn’t try.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “I did experience gains [with Scientology E-meter audits]. I would feel relief from arguments I’d had with my dad, things I’d done as a teen-ager that I didn’t feel good about. I think I did, in some ways, become a better person. I did develop more empathy for others.” Then again, he admitted, “I tried to find ways to be a better husband, but I never really did. I was still the selfish bastard I always was.”
            </p>
            <p>
             “I’m a deeply broken person, and broken institutions fascinate me.”
            </p>

            Wow,  the kind of people we keep digging up that always 'appear' to want to help you would never let through your own front door,  never ceases to amaze me what 'men' we have in power.

             Yeah, what could be wrong here.  This involves Harassment, Rape, Haiti the CF and the Church of Scientology.  What a movie that would make.  What a movie that would make.  Starring all those that have been outed by CDAN.

              Yeah, he seems to have a big toe in all of them. Could this explain some of his success? The Academy award for, in fairness, not the worst film but really, a mediocre one. Also, who picked up distribution on that film Crash?? Oh no, could it have been Lionsgate-Frank Giustra? Yup. Another toe...

               I think Giustra is going to get his soon.  He is tied to the CF and The Boys Club in LA along with George Clooney.
