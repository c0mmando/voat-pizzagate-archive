They are all fascists and criminals.

              The seat of evil exists with Elites ...
             </p>
             <p>
              Organized patriarchal religions/Christianity underpins Elitism/wealthy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thugs kidnap children and usually sexually abuse them before they're turned
over to Elite rings --
             </p>
             <p>
              The Satanic overtones are there to frighten you -- not that the violence
isn't real.  Eventually the thugs also become crazed.  And that's what
we're dealing with ... crazed people.
             </p>
             <p>
              You have to understand that ALL of those supporting criminal activities are in one
way or another supporting the work of sex trafficking.
             </p>
             <p>
              If our military is truly involved in drug trafficking -- and it looks like child trafficking and organ trafficking
parallels the movement of drugs across the nation and internationally -- then our Congress is funding it.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's the aim of Elites, to control our government ... it's policies ... its wealth ... the wealth of the nation.

on them, as well.

               <p>

               <p>
                NO "boogey-men" created by organized patriarchal religions to frighten their members.
               </p>
               <p>
                The violence is real, because those who organize these religions need violence to
frighten the public and to keep them from actually looking at the reality of male-supremacist
religions and the scam they've been running for 2,000 years.

                 Saving one of his most audacious initiatives for the twilight of his papacy, John Paul II yesterday attempted to purify the soul of the Roman Catholic church by making a sweeping apology for 2,000 years of violence, persecution and blunders. 
From the altar of St Peter's Basilica in Rome he led Catholicism into unchartered territory by seeking forgiveness for sins committed against Jews, heretics, women, Gypsies and native peoples.

                 Guess the Pope is confused about the HISTORY of Christianity. . . eh, ESO?

                 No shit sherlock. But when you say "patriarchy" you are using a word invented by evil people. Use names . State specific crimes. These people have names and their name is not "patriarchy"

                  Think maybe you should take that up with Merriam-Webster --
but you're need to deny the existence of Elite patriarchy and patriarchal societies
is revealing.  Much like your views on abortion -- even late term abortion to save
the health and life -- and future fertility -- of a pregnant female with a problem pregnancy.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  BOTH seem to suggest that you're distanced from females and female relationships.

                It came out before Gab but for whatever reason wasn't as popular. It's pro free speech and a good community IMO. When ((David Seaman)) kept pushing for Gab it made me kind of skeptical that it was the best Twitter alternative. So I'm glad I have two haha.
