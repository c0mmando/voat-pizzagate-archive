<h2>Kids not in an adoption process being exported by former PA Governor Ed Rendell</h2>
<p>I found this article very interesting. I took pieces of this persons blog copy and pasted them below but I really recommend you reading the whole thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.babylovechild.org/2010/01/25/haiti-series-it-is-madness-it-is-insane-bribes-bullies-and-traffickers-extract-kids-part-4/">http://www.babylovechild.org/2010/01/25/haiti-series-it-is-madness-it-is-insane-bribes-bullies-and-traffickers-extract-kids-part-4/</a></p>
<p>This important article from United Adoptees International <a href="http://uai-news.blogspot.com/2010/01/illegal-adoption-now-legalised-by-dutch.html">http://uai-news.blogspot.com/2010/01/illegal-adoption-now-legalised-by-dutch.html</a> describes how the 109 Haitian kids taken to the Netherlands have been divided into three categories, resulting in 53 of the kids having left the country without any form of Haitian finalization. Of the kids who went to Luxembourg, some of them are considered “category 2″ or not finalized by Haitian authorities as well.</p>
<p>Under this classification America has kids from all three groups as well, despite the government’s statements saying no class 3, or completely unmatched kids would be accepted. Other kids are being taken across the relatively open border to the Dominican Republic with promises of returning them to Haiti and reuniting “some” of them with family later. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/17/haiti.orphans/index.html?hpt=T1">http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/17/haiti.orphans/index.html?hpt=T1</a></p>
<p>On the American end, after the Department of Homeland Security announced the  Humanitarian Parole policy, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2010/01/18/secretary-announces-humanitarian-parole-policy-certain-haitian-orphans">https://www.dhs.gov/news/2010/01/18/secretary-announces-humanitarian-parole-policy-certain-haitian-orphans</a> the flights began almost immediately. Extending Humanitarian Parole status like this is completely unprecedented in inter-country adoptions, we’re off the edge of any map.</p>
<p>Once that status had been conferred, <strong>someone had to test the limits of the policy.</strong> While the American government was insisting that only kids already in an adoption process would be accepted, many questioned what would happen if a child not in process landed on American soil. Would they be sent back? Or would they be kept and slid into the American adoption process?</p>
<p><strong>Enter Ed Rendell and a cast of cronies.</strong></p>
<p>I’m not going to do full coverage on this story, as it’s simply too large and won’t fit within the scope of what I’m trying to accomplish here. Instead I’ll provide merely an overview and encourage readers to do some research on their own. <strong>Bear in mind that all of this was taking place against the backdrop of a political context of heavy lobbying to let the Haitian kids in and to expedite the adoptions.</strong> Take the Jan. 19th letter to Secretary of State Clinton (link opens a PDF) <a href="http://www.ccainstitute.org/images/stories/final%20-%20haiti%20letter%20to%20sec%20clinton%201.19.2010%20small.pdf">http://www.ccainstitute.org/images/stories/final%20-%20haiti%20letter%20to%20sec%20clinton%201.19.2010%20small.pdf</a> and the letter from the 20th (link opens a PDF) <a href="http://www.ccainstitute.org/images/stories/haitian%20orphan%20safety-letter%20from%20mocs%201.21.2010%20small.pdf">http://www.ccainstitute.org/images/stories/haitian%20orphan%20safety-letter%20from%20mocs%201.21.2010%20small.pdf</a> by way of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute as just two tangible examples.</p>
<p>The ‘Rendell Raid’ taking place over the 18th and 19th was the first flight bringing the Haitian children to the United States, the test case.</p>
<p>In, a heavily publicized set of flights Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell headed off to Haiti to <strong>extract kids from the BRESMA “orphanage” in a privately donated plane</strong> .
The airport of course, has been non-stop and so to up the chances of actually getting in country, pure political clout was used to muscle their way into the queue, making other planes loaded with humanitarian relief supplies wait in the pattern.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, here’s the crucial piece, this flight back to the States is the first flight with kids being exported from Haiti, it’s the test case, and it’s <strong>transporting 7 kids who are not in any way shape or form already in an adoption process.</strong></p>
<p>The private plane leaves (convenient that, it certainly sidestepped several potential liability issues there) and the group ends up hitching a ride on a U.S. military transport plane.</p>
<p>Which is to say the U.S. Military ended up doing the actual exporting of the kids. </p>
<p>See photos of the kids on the Military plane here. <a href="http://www.livesayhaiti.com/2010/01/what-day-is-it.html">http://www.livesayhaiti.com/2010/01/what-day-is-it.html</a></p>
<p>Once the group was on the ground in Florida, they rejoined their donated plane and flew on to Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>Here’s Governor Rendell bragging about the raid in his version of the flight. <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/01/rendell_recounts_22-hour_trip.html">http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/01/rendell_recounts_22-hour_trip.html</a> </p>
<p>It’s not as if Rendell didn’t know he was exporting kids not in process, in this CNN piece, <strong>Gov. Rendell himself admits 7 of the kids were not in process, but American adoptive parents will be sought (now that they’re here.)</strong> emphasis added: According to Rendell, adoption cases are under way for 47 of the children. Of these, 40 will be U.S. adoptions, four children will go to Spain and three to Canada. Adoptive parents will be sought for the remaining seven children.</p>
<hr />
<p>Having lobbied the White House for several days, the Pennsylvania delegation had obtained United States visas for the children and had expected to be on the ground one hour. But Haitian officials would let only 28 of the 54 orphans the sisters had brought to the airport to leave; the rest had not cleared all the hurdles for adoption. Seven had yet to be matched with adoptive parents, the Haitians said.</p>
<p>Then the sisters dug in their heels. “They just said no, they wouldn’t leave without all of them,” Mr. Altmire said.
For five hours, the delegation worked furiously to get the Haitian government to agree to let all the children go. <strong>The governor’s wife, Judge Marjorie O. Rendell of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, went to Port-au-Prince to meet with American diplomats</strong>. Mr. Rendell and Mr. Altmire lobbied the White House, which pressured Haitian officials.</p>

          <p>
           Which is to say the U.S. Military ended up doing the actual exporting of the kids.
          </p>
          <p>
           See photos of the kids on the Military plane here.

           Once the group was on the ground in Florida, they rejoined their donated plane and flew on to Pennsylvania.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here’s Governor Rendell bragging about the raid in his version of the flight.
           <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/01/rendell_recounts_22-hour_trip.html">
            http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2010/01/rendell_recounts_22-hour_trip.html
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           It’s not as if Rendell didn’t know he was exporting kids not in process, in this CNN piece,
           <strong>
            Gov. Rendell himself admits 7 of the kids were not in process, but American adoptive parents will be sought (now that they’re here.)
           </strong>
           emphasis added: According to Rendell, adoption cases are under way for 47 of the children. Of these, 40 will be U.S. adoptions, four children will go to Spain and three to Canada. Adoptive parents will be sought for the remaining seven children.
          </p>
          <hr/>
          <p>
           Having lobbied the White House for several days, the Pennsylvania delegation had obtained United States visas for the children and had expected to be on the ground one hour. But Haitian officials would let only 28 of the 54 orphans the sisters had brought to the airport to leave; the rest had not cleared all the hurdles for adoption. Seven had yet to be matched with adoptive parents, the Haitians said.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then the sisters dug in their heels. “They just said no, they wouldn’t leave without all of them,” Mr. Altmire said.
For five hours, the delegation worked furiously to get the Haitian government to agree to let all the children go.
           <strong>
            The governor’s wife, Judge Marjorie O. Rendell of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, went to Port-au-Prince to meet with American diplomats
           </strong>
           . Mr. Rendell and Mr. Altmire lobbied the White House, which pressured Haitian officials.

            Wow, all that dirtiness in Pennsylvania. Savitz was one sick f@cker.  It seems that the one good person in Pennsylvania, AG, Kathleen  Kane was indicted for releasing the porn images that showed commonwealth supreme court justices, state prosecutors assigned to investigate Sandusky and his pedophile ring at Penn State, and state police officials sent and received.

             I haven't really looked into it much. Not sure what's going on with the cage. Possibly mentally unstable? I'm not sure. I did a quick look but haven't noticed anything that caught my attention. I could be wrong but I'll try looking into it when I have more time.

            Haven't finished reading your post as yet, but knew the name of police officer, Daniel Faulkner sounded familiar.
That goes back to the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal (1982) -- a journalist -- who was convicted of having murdered the officer Faulkner though many suggested he was corrupt and involved in criminal activities.  Looks like they were right!
Abu-Jamal has been in prison almost 35 years for this crime which no one believes he committed!!

            I'd like to know how the Governor could assure the officials the children would be well cared for when there is a high percentage of abuse in the foster care system &amp; adoptions in the US and the reported abuses fall on deaf ears.

             What looks shady to me is like what G Webb says, these 'white hats' do good in the day, but at night is when they round up all the children they are illegally taking.  Notice how these flights are all at night?  And it seems strange that they have so many guards/security surrounding them...

            Awesome work OP.  I don't know why people aren't all over this one.  It's more than obvious there's child trafficking going on here connected to the White House &amp; the Podestas.  And it just so happens that 47 of these 54 children were in the adoption process and it just so happens that all from were from the same BRESMA orphanage?  Really???  Well, I for one am not falling for their claims.

             I mean it's definitely something to look into. Things don't add up, at least to me. This reminds me of Silsby (another article I found on this)...
            </p>
            <p>
             " Using contacts in the White House, Homeland Security and the US military, Rendell and his wife, a federal judge, chartered a jet and flew into Haiti’s packed airport[xx]  The rescue mission and the plight of Haitian children went politically viral. The next day, while Rendell, his wife, the McMurtrie sisters and the 53 Haitian orphans were in what the governor described as a “tense standoff” with Haitian officials, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was back home announcing that, “One area we are urgently focused on is the plight of Haitian Orphans,” and that “we will not let red tape stand in the way of helping those in need.” The French president Sarkozy was organizing his own rescue missions as were the Dutch and even Florida Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart.
            </p>
            <p>
             If anyone had been scrutinizing the situation they would have noticed some problems.
             <strong>
              The Bresma  orphanage that was SMS’ing for help was not destroyed. None of the children were killed or even hurt. And as those of us in Haiti at the time knew, if they needed food they could have bought it just about anywhere: on the street, at the wholesalers in Petion Ville, or in any of the supermarkets that reopened within a week of the earthquake. It would turn out that all of the orphans had at least one parent, some of whom didn’t even know their children were being taken out of Haiti
             </strong>
             . No one knew how much money was exchanging hands or bothered to ask, but with total fees reputedly as high as US30,000 per child, it must have been a massive windfall for someone, perhaps the McMutrie sisters who claimed to own the orphanage or, if not them, the Haitian woman, Margarette Saint Fleur, who really did own it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Something was indeed rotten about the orphan crisis and no one knew better than UNICEF and the child protections agencies that had initially exaggerated the numbers and panicked us all with images of traffickers prowling the rubble. But by the time Rendell had safely landed back in Pennsylvania on January 19th, politicians from President Obama to his French counter part Nicolas Sarkozy were jumping on the bandwagon. The Haitian Government conceded as well."

              Exactly, the pics of the Bresma orphanage looked like it was all intact and it's a well known fact that many in Haiti put their children in orphanages when they are having difficulties with caring for them financially.  I read an article where it stated most of the children in orphanages in Haiti have at least one living parent so to remove so many from one orphanage gives one pause as to whether they actually were orphans to begin with.
