excerpt from \'about the database\' (no date given for entry)
&quot;The number of British-born children identified as targets for sexual abuse by traffickers more than doubled last year.
The National Crime Agency’s trafficking data shows a 155 per cent rise in under-18s identified as potential victims.
Out of 112 countries, British children were the nationality second most likely to be preyed upon, behind those in Vietnam.
The NCA identified 56 children targeted specifically for sexual exploitation last year – 50 were girls.
Chloe Setter, from ECPAT UK, which campaigns to end child sexual exploitation and trafficking, said two-thirds of all potential victims did not come to the attention of the authorities, so the scale of the problem was even more worrying.
‘There is a culture of disbelief in this country about trafficking but we need to wake up to it and the government must ensure its proposed modern slavery bill contains the tools to actually protect victims and prosecute offenders,’ she said.
The NCA said 1,746 people from 112 different countries were highlighted as potential victims of traffickers in 2013 – up almost 50 per cent in a year. Of those, 1,122 were women and 624 were men, while the cases involving Britons rose 173 per cent to 90 – with 63 of them children.
Home Office minister Karen Bradley admitted the figures were unlikely to show the full scale of modern slavery.&quot;</p>',

            Katharine and Arul Savio Gaspar are the ones that need to take a lie detector test. Those bitches effective ruined someone's life by concocting a fictionalized narrative targeting one of the McCann's friends as a pedophile. Think about it. Arul Savio remains friends with Kate McCann ... reconnecting when Kate gets married. Then Arul gets married to a woman (Katharine) with the same name (Katherine / Kate), and one that resembles Kate in coloring, height, and weight. Something is very off. They were the only two that "noticed" the odd gesture someone supposedly made. They also went on vacatioins and connected on children's birthdays. I've always thought it was someone close to the McCann's that put the bug in her ear about going to Portugal, a place Savio knew like the back of his hand. Focus on them and you'll find Madeleine.

             Interesting angle, the place was a pedo haven apparently and it's not a stretch to think that someone who knew it 'like the back of his hand' would be aware of that.
Will read up about them (or reread the account about the 'odd gesture'. Thanks.

            Lie Detector tests are not used in the UK or Commonwealth countries, or in fact, the vast majority of countries in the world, as they have been proven to be unreliable and able to be beaten.

             No kidding, Hillary has known that since her first case in 1975. "It was a fascinating case, it was a very interesting case,” Clinton says in the recording. “This guy was accused of raping a 12-year-old. Course he claimed that he didn’t, and all this stuff...”
            </p>
            <p>
             Describing the events almost a decade after they had occurred, Clinton’s struck a casual and complacent attitude toward her client and the trial for rape of a minor.
“I had him take a polygraph, which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,” she added with a laugh."

            How is this related to the title of this post regarding the McCann's taking a lie detector petition? A petition of a million signatures can't force someone to take a lie detector in the US, and one likely cannot be forced to take one in the UK, regardless of the political pressure the petition is intended to force.

             Well the link is a database of sex offenders in the UK and Ireland and really that is why I posted it as a resource.  The McCann case mention was secondary, I just happened to spot it, and I was thinking mentioning that page would be of help in following the PG rules.  Sorry if the heading is misleading, not intentional.

             I've been looking into the ties between Clement Freud, the McCanns and Richard Branson the last couple nights, so that case was on my mind.  The whole story seems very strange given some of the quotes from Kate's book about her new 'friend' Freud.  The "best risotto I ever had"...I'm thinking, okay, many people really lose their appetites and appreciation for food when they are in distress and mourning and loss, but okay.  And the jogging around his house, the quote about him being like visiting a dear relative after a really bad day in school (he was in his boxers or jammies whatever).  A "really bad day in school"?!  Okay...and then there was the quote of what Freud said to her about the cadaver dog signaling a positive hit...I can't recall the wording now, but it was very odd.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was speculating (to myself) on whether they were members of a club or secret society, because the Freud and Branson thing just doesn't make sense to me.  Clement Freud was on Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic maiden voyage, so those two knew each other for a long time.  So the McCann case comes back to the spot light, and who does Obama vacation with?  Richard Branson.

               Here is the quote from Clement Freud that struck me as odd, along with account of Kate's reaction, written in this article:

               </a>
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              "When the couple told Freud how sniffer dogs were supposed to have detected signs that someone had died in their apartment, he replied laconically: ‘So what are they going to do? Put them on the stand? One bark for yes, two for no?’
             </p>
             <p>
              To Kate, who could have no idea about the kind of man they were consorting with, this was just the tonic she needed: Freud’s ‘way of making everything seem a little less terrible’.
             </p>
             <p>
              According to Clarence Mitchell, she and her husband were ‘shocked and appalled’ when they learnt the truth about him a few days ago.
              <em>
               June 2016?
              </em>
              Yet, on the basis of all they know so far, he says they ‘can see no reason to believe’ he may have had knowledge of Madeleine’s disappearance."
             </p>
             <p>
              Earlier in the article we learned that Clarence Mitchell was the McCann's PR advisor early on (briefly) and then again after Justine McGuinness quit.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The McCanns attended the luncheon accompanied by Gerry’s sister, Trisha Cameron, and her husband Sandy, and their then PR adviser Justine McGuinness, a former Liberal-Democrat parliamentary candidate. Though McGuinness and Freud had a political affinity, I am assured that the pair had never previously met and she did not fix the meeting.
             </p>
             <p>
              McCann watchers suggest, however, that some part might have been played by Clarence Mitchell, who briefly handled the couple’s PR before McGuinness and would become their mouthpiece after she quit the role.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is because Mitchell entered into a consultancy contract with Matthew Freud’s company a few months later. From his office in Brighton this week, Mitchell insisted this was a coincidence.
             </p>
             <p>
              As Kate describes colorfully in her book, the lunch was an odd affair. Freud’s opening gambit was to offer his guests shots of strawberry vodka, though it was only just midday. He then prepared them, as Kate recalled, a ‘bloody marvellous’ watercress salad followed by mushroom risotto — ‘the best we’ve ever tasted’ — and regaled them with his trademark wit."
             </p>
             <p>
              Sounds like a lovely lunch was had by all.

              Ah, ok, I see. Your comment that I'm replying to is great. I don't think the Branson, McCann, Freud relationship has been explored in depth, if much at all. I was also trying to find a connection between Branson and Epstein. There must be one. Both have islands in the Caribbean, and Epstein for sure, and Branson possibly is involved in illegal activities. Commerce, communication, sharing of employees between the islands? Money trail between the two, or pictures of them together? I haven't seen any, except for Matthew Freud, Clement's son, who is listed in Epstein's black book along with Branson. Anyway nice work.

               Thank you...some extra trivia on the subject of Branson and Freud...and this may seem odd but..Uri Geller was also on that flight I mentioned:
               <a href="http://www.urigeller.com/clement_freud_andrey_malakhov__mark_townsend_/">
                http://www.urigeller.com/clement_freud_andrey_malakhov__mark_townsend_/
               </a>
               although he wasn't in this picture:
               <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/virgin-atlantic-inaugural-flight/">
                http://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/virgin-atlantic-inaugural-flight/
               </a>
               (BTW: the woman who tells about Freud raping her says he did so once while at the horse races).
              </p>
              <p>
               Turns out, according to the article, that Uri and Freud are distant cousins, and both were guests of Richard Bransons' maiden flight of the Virgin Atlantic. (Branson,
               <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/richard-branson-9224520">
                http://www.biography.com/people/richard-branson-9224520
               </a>
               ,  knew a lot of people. He helped launch the career of 'Tubular Bells' Mike Oldfield).  Uri also went to Freud's 80th Birthday party.  I just so happened to run across this tonight:

               and have yet to dig through it all.
              </p>
              <p>
               One other thing unconfirmed, unrelated but just odd, on the database I posted was a case of a missing boy, and there was an artist's drawing of a man seen with him...who happens to look uncannily like one of the people in the photo of the Virgin Atlantic maiden voyage!  So weird...I'm checking it out before naming names, don't want to disparage the person because of a strange coincidence.

            Hey kestrel9,

           <p>
            Voat protip: You have to hit carriage return 2x to get a paragraph break. Or, you can click the 8th formatting button to get a large paragraph break. You can hit Preview to see how it will look.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you highly something you want to pull into a quote box and click the " button (#4), it will indent that text. You have to do this in front of each new line following a carriage return, or it goes back to regular text. You can also add subheads (the "H") button, and horizontal lines.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you can't see the formatting buttons, it may be because you are on mobile. Choose "view desktop site" and they should show.
           </p>
           <p>
            This post would be much more readable  (and upvoatable) if you deployed some of the formatting features. :-)  Check 'em out.

            Gerry's a psycho, he'd probably lie and still pass. Kate would be silent for 49 of the questions.

             I haven't scoured the case, but one thing I read recently made me wonder if the McCann's gave the kids something to knock them out, and that's why they weren't concerned leaving 3 young children alone in hotel while they were 75 ft. away, across a pool in a Tapas Bar.  Perhaps Maddie never woke up and the abduction story was a cover for neglect.

              That is a strong theory and the one I tend to believe. There is a lot of evidence which supports it.

               It's a possibility, but where's the body? Why did the entire party seemingly enter into an unbreakable pact? Why did the British government and Security Services become involved so quickly? Why were the Portuguese police influenced and stifled as much as they were? Why has so much taxpayers' money been spent on a case where there is no proof that Madeleine was even in 5a at all? What concern did Freud have, being a convicted paedophile of course? Was John Podesta in the area around the time? Who did Gerry play tennis with (or indeed against in a tournament)? These questions require to be sufficiently answered.

            Given all the pedo ring cover-ups that ARE known...how is there 'a culture of disbelief' in the UK?!  Sometimes I feel they are the modern day ground zero for pedo rings!  If they are in such denial as a society, it shows the difficulty ahead for Americans to wake up.  People may suspect or even know but continue to 'not want to know' or 'don't want to hear it' because it's too ugly, to 'inhuman' to face.  It's so much easier to put on a knit pink cap and scream about vaginas, thinking that's what makes a difference in the world.

             Believe me now, the UK is in denial. My entire city thinks I'm the bad guy for trying to wake everybody up. Yes, I have my entire city's attention and everybody still denies there's anything going on. That's how bad it is.

              I want to say 'Unbelievable' but it is believable, given what we've learned about the countless cover ups and years of hearing government lies. People simply will not acknowledge the extent of the problem, and here in the US, a percentage of the population has been dumbed down through systemic propaganda, trained to bark when commanded to, lest they hear the truth and think about it.
