            This is a fraud lawsuit filed by Democrats to attack Trump.   'trumpisPizza' = David Brock's 'Correct the Record' group of paid shills who go on groups like this where actual citizens are exercising their First Amendment rights and attempt to derail the research and conversation.   ANY person can file a lawsuit in America against anyone and make outlandish claims ('TrumpisPizza is an alias for a goat fucking Communist').  What did that prove?    Where's the evidence?   Why'd the lawsuit (lawsuits) never go anywhere?   They were shakedowns and then dirty political tricks.
           </p>
           <p>
            YOU LOST.  GET OVER IT.  HILLARY IS GOING TO JAIL SOON AND YOU WILL BE AUDITED BY TRUMP'S IRS.  GO THE FUCK AWAY, YOU BABY KILLING LEFTIST GLOBALIST ANTICHRIST SCUMBAG.

            The hypocrite Trump cock suckers who eat trumps SHIT ask for proof, ... proof that TRUMP is a serial sex offender and rapist of little girls.
           </p>
           <p>
            NBC legal analyst, Lisa Bloom, makes a compelling argument as to why the MSM should not ignore the recent child rape case filed by “Jane Doe” against Donald Trump.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jane Doe reports she was raped more than once by Donald Trump when she was 13 years old. The entire piece is worth a read because it cites other rape cases filed against Trump (link below).
           </p>
           <p>
            However, in this diary I want to focus on the recent Jane Doe case because, as Bloom points out: “It is exceedingly rare for a sexual assault victim to have a witness.”
           </p>
           <p>
            From article:
           </p>
           <pre><code>Two unusual documents are attached to Jane Doe’s complaints - sworn declarations attesting to the facts. The first is from Jane Doe herself, telling her horrific story, including the allegation that Jeffrey Epstein also raped her and threatened her into silence, and this stunner:

Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump . . .

And this one:

Defendant Trump stated that I shouldn’t ever say anything if I didn’t want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having my whole family killed.

          The second declaration is even more astonishing, because it is signed by “Tiffany Doe”, Mr. Epstein’s “party planner” from 1991-2000. Tiffany Doe says that her duties were “to get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties.” (Adolescents are, legally, children.)

          Tiffany Doe says that she recruited Jane Doe at the Port Authority in New York, persuaded her to attend Mr. Epstein’s parties, and actually witnessed the sexual assaults on Jane Doe:

I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was 13 years old.

          It is exceedingly rare for a sexual assault victim to have a witness. But Tiffany Doe says:

I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop.

          Tiffany Doe corroborates, based on her own personal observations, just about everything in Jane Doe’s complaint: that twelve year old Maria was involved in a sex act with Mr. Trump, that Mr. Trump threatened the life of Jane Doe if she ever revealed what happened, and that she would “disappear” like Maria if she did.

          Tiffany Doe herself says that she is in mortal fear of Mr. Trump to this day:

I am coming forward to swear to the truthfulness of the physical and sexual abuse that I personally witnessed of minor females at the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein . . . I swear to these facts under the penalty for perjury even though I fully understand that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger.

SEE: www.huffingtonpost.com/...
</code></pre>
           <p>
            In relation to why the media is avoiding this story, Lisa Bloom is fair handed. But I don’t think the MSM deserves a fair shake. In my opinion, the media wants to keep Trump viable to create a high-tension, general election horse race and anything that threatens Trump’s viability is ignored.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly. since Trump was a pal of convicted child rapist, Jeffrey Epstein, it's not a stretch to think Trump is one too. Like my dearly departed Mom used to say, “Tell me who your friends are and I will tell you who you are.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Do I believe Jane Doe and Tiffany Doe are telling the truth? Absolutely — yes.

             Brock and Soros can only find "defenders" who will pay them like you Shill.
We don't get paid to post here. 
You are fake bought news.
We are the real and there are almost 6k here now, it was 5k last week. We're growing, soon your money will dry up, we will never dry up.

             I was starting to consider this side of things until I realized who is behind the smears in this election cycle.
DavidBrock Alefantis' boyfriend is behind the smears in this cycle.
I wouldn't put it past Brock to pay or threaten a "witness" against Trump.
I'll consider it again if more evidence comes out but as of yet, I only see another "witness" which isn't proof when your dealing with Brock and an unlimited amount of money to pay off "witnesses"
Big charges need big evidence.

             I'm inclined to believe her, but considering everything that is going on with the Clinton's at the moment and their very close relationship with Epstein, they could just be trying to rope Trump into all of this.

            This was the third lawsuit filed by Katie Johnson (AKA "Jane Doe"). 1st one was in a California federal court, 2nd one was in a NY state court, and the 3rd one in a NY federal court. The first was thrown out, as well as the second one for failing to serve process.

            Oddly enough, the one you posted was voluntarily withdrawn at 5:59pm the Friday before Election Day. Talk about a strategic move there.

              I'm no trump supporter but I'm pretty sure the odds of not a single one of those '1000+'  victims not going to the police are astronomically low.

              Okaaaay...so where's the proof of this?  You're telling me that given the mountains of circumstantial evidence about CPP you doubt it, but yet you'll jump up and down about Trump being some sort of monster without anything more than a petition that's been thrown out/withdrawn three times?  That makes perfect sense. GTFOH.

            Keep up the good work, remember we have the truth on our side the #PizzaGate is 100% lies, easy to debunk only a fucking idiot buys the story which is why only fools on the net and assholes like Alex Jones are still talking about it in public.
Here on this forum you have a lot of bots ( non human programmable agents ) that just need to be re-tasked.
They chase comet-pizza where there was no crime, but if they spent 10% of the effort they could find 1,000's of children raped violently by Trump/Epstein. They were crazy pair together in 1980's taking virginity from children at nightly cocaine party's 1980-1999.

              Do you have any proof that a child was harmed at comet-pizza? Hell No. Does it stop #PizzaGate from recurring insanity? Nope
The truth is you don't care about proof, the proof is in this complaint filed with the court.

               the investigation has not said outright that Comet Pizza is guilty. It is a point of interest, though. There a lot of points of interest. That's why it's on-going. You can't find the truth if you don't investigate it and rule out each and every detail.
