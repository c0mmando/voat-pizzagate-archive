            This is highly concerning and should be a warning sign to all of us! We have to be vigilant and should consider the risks carefully. This now is the next stage of this battle to get the evidence out to the Public. The opposition is forced to act they can't ignore this any longer. They are going to be be smart, well organised and sly about it. Remember it's a game they have been playing for a long time and there defence is going to be close to impeccable. They are going to cherry Pick a bunch of silly "nutjobs" to humiliate them on television (and it's going to be hilarious), thinking we could achieve anything using their medium is delusional. They have a lot of dirt on this guy the'll make an example of him, to discredit all of us. I watched a lot of his videos which are on the most part very well researched and factual. But on the other hand although i wouldn't call him an extremist he made some troublesome remarks considering violence and homosexuals, this guy has several channels with hundreds of videos. this should give the Media plenty enough to make him look like a Terrorist-hitler-gayhating-fascist-antichrist they need so desperately to calm the situation down and there's nothing we can do about it. What we can take away from this is that we have to stay factual, calm and reposed, don't give them free leverage (the guy posted Images of himself on Facebook with guns in both). The elite can frame you, produce fake evidence etc. they have unlimited resources. But we have the Advantage of numbers, legitimacy, logic, actual Journalism and an overwhelming amount of Evidence that keeps piling up. If we stick to our guns (internet, journalism, anonymity, free speech(or what is left of it)) and keep the ball of information rolling, it eventually will become an avalanche of such a growth that no force on earth is going to be able to stop it!!
