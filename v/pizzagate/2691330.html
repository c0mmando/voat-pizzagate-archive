<p>The shocking revelation of the details surrounding University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbett\'s murder last week raises questions about why her viciously hacked body was left in an Iowa cornfield, and whether she was the victim of satanic abuse and if she were targeted specifically by the murderer. The strange coincidence of former FBI chief James Comey\'s tweets from an Iowa cornfield the day before Mollie disappeared also add to the mystery.</p>
<p>JAMES COMEY\'S TWEETS FROM IOWA</p>
<p>James Comey was in Iowa on Oct 20 and tweeted a picture of himself standing in a field of dead corn at sunset (8:41 pm), remarking: &quot;Good to be back in Iowa.&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/Comey/status/921536987072483328">https://twitter.com/Comey/status/921536987072483328</a> There <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2017/10/23/james-comey-was-in-iowa-over-the-weekend/790830001/">was speculation</a> that he was in Iowa for the weekend to celebrate his wife\'s father\'s birthday.</p>
<p>On July 15 of this year, Comey was back in Iowa again and<a href="https://twitter.com/Comey/status/1007721729148547072"> tweeted</a> a picture of himself next to a 15-foot concrete painted gnome named Elwood at Reiman Garden on the Iowa State University campus, with the pun: &quot;I hardly gnome.&quot; (I hardly know \'em.)</p>
<p>The next day, Comey <a href="https://twitter.com/Comey/status/1008040710283628544">tweeted</a> a picture of himself in a field with rows of new corn, remarking: &quot;So good to see new growth in Iowa and across the country.&quot;</p>
<p>ELWOOD THE GIANT GNOME</p>
<p>The concrete gnome in Reiman Garden is not universally loved by visitors and is kept in an out-of-the-way corner. Its size (like Comey\'s size) is unusual for a gnome since they are historically considered to be dwarfish and small in stature. The name &quot;gnome&quot; is thought to be derived from the mythologist Paracelsus\'s Latin term: genomus, meaning one who dwells in the ground. <em>Genomus</em> is also related to the term genome, or genetic trait which could explain why the giant gnome is considered a talisman of the Reiman Garden since it is is known for its genetic experimentation with plant hybrids, especially of corn.</p>
<p>The name Elwood is associated with<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1987559/"> a recent TV show based on a book written</a> by Louis Mandylor who describes the plot thus: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wheels turn within wheels. An infinity of parallel worlds. In Elwood, animal genetics have evolved, so that cats and dogs walk tall amongst humans. After the death of Delaney Fargas, the original &quot;Godfather&quot; of Elwood, Louie the Jaw, a human pit-bull and Delaney\'s right hand, is expected to take his place - as ruler of Elwood and as protector of Delaney\'s beautiful daughter Angelica. It is now Louie\'s responsibility to handle the power struggles between gangsters and politicians, deal with deviated visitors and protect those in need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The theme of genetic experimentation is carried on in another important sculpture in the Reiman Gardens: three menacing bronze rabbit heads called &quot;Rabbit Hill&quot; by Deborah Matsuoka. <a href="https://archive.inside.iastate.edu/2005/0429/img/rabbits.jpg">https://archive.inside.iastate.edu/2005/0429/img/rabbits.jpg</a> An intriguing description of this 2005 work of art: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each sculpture weighs 150 pounds and is several feet tall – and that’s just the head poking up out of the ground. The typical prey becomes the predator. </p>
<p>Each head is two faced, with one menacing eye regarding its visitors and painted earth tones that are just a bit too bright. This explores the contrast between how we typically see rabbits (as soft, vulnerable creatures) and as they really can be (ravenous garden predators, capable of causing a garden‘s destruction). This is not unlike the dual nature of Reiman Gardens, which celebrate both the natural Iowa landscape and the hybrids so commonly created in the research laboratories of Iowa State. </p>
<p>The rabbits stand solitary and quiet in the far reaches of Reiman Gardens, both attracting people in to the prairie that was once less traveled, and repelling them away. The initial reaction to the menacing creatures was not overwhelmingly positive, but visitors have since grown to appreciate the predatory guardians. 
.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;dual nature&quot; of the Reiman Gardens is of special note: the fact that the Gardens exhibit natural, wild plant species and also hybridize, or mutate, plants in their research gardens, which she depicts as an alarming, frightening side of the Gardens, like the 
sinister, threatening side of the rabbit heads. Rabbits, of course, are common lab specimens, prized for their ability to reproduce quickly in genetic experimentation.</p>
<p>The Iowa State University campus in Ames has other genetic-themed statues---also not well received by the public. These are the G-nome (genome) sculptures atop the Molecular Biology building. These four controversial statues (<a href="https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/g-nomes-still.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200">https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/g-nomes-still.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200)</a>) were recently replaced with aluminum copies since the clay originals were disintegrating. Video <a href="https://whotv.com/2016/07/11/iowa-state-university-to-replace-g-nome-statues/">here</a>. More images of the G-nomes <a href="https://rdgusa.com/projects/isu-molecular-biology-building-integrated-art">here:</a> </p>
<p>IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY RECEIVED A GRANT THIS YEAR TO MAP GENOMES OF CORN</p>
<p>Was Comey inspecting the new crops of genetically modified corn in Iowa State\'s newly funded<a href="https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2018/01/17/corngenomesnsf"> corn genome project</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iowa State University scientists will contribute to a new effort to map the genomes of 26 lines of corn, an ambitious project that will allow plant breeders and farmers to harness the crop’s vast genetic diversity . . . Detailed sequencing of the 26 lines identified for the project will unlock deeper understanding of corn genetics and open up a wider diversity of genes for plant breeders. Hufford’s lab has already grown some of the corn lines in a greenhouse in Bessey Hall, and those plants will provide the material used to perform the genome assemblies and to construct maps to improve these assemblies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It\'s not surprising that Iowa State researchers were trying to debunk criticism of their GMO corn research, but it is a bit hilarious that they blame the----guess who?---Russians for initiating the anti-GMO conspiracy. This Feb. 2018 article, coming shortly after Iowa State received its grant, shows the ISU researchers on the warpath against Russian publications RT and Sputnik spreading anti-GMO arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“RT and Sputnik overwhelmingly portrayed genetic modification in a negative light,” the researchers wrote. “Among U.S. news organizations, the left-leaning Huffington Post produced the most ‘anti’ articles, followed by CNN. Fox News produced the most neutral or mixed coverage of GMOs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UNIVERSITY OF IOWA PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT IN THE NEWS</p>
<p>The University of Iowa shares ISU\'s fervent interest in plant and animal genetics. Both universities also have an obsession with gnomes, which are an official mascot of their sports teams, so it\'s not a stretch to wonder if gnomes (genomes) have become an icon for genetic mutation research. </p>
<p>Mollie Tibbetts was a psychology major at the University of Iowa, and the psychology department released a statement about her on <a href="https://psychology.uiowa.edu/">their webpage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>STATEMENT ON MOLLIE TIBBETTS
The faculty, staff, and students of the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences offer their condolences to the family and friends of Mollie Tibbetts. Mollie was one of our own and we are deeply saddened by her loss. To anyone seeking support in the wake of this tragedy, please consult this University of Iowa website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The University of Iowa Psychology Department was notorious for being the subject of a raid by the Animal Liberation Front in 2004. The ALF claimed responsibility for breaking and entering the Spence Labs and liberating dozens of animals in cages in the vivisection lab and other labs. Horrifiying details of abused and drug-addicted animals <a href="http://www.animalliberationfront.com/ALFront/Actions-USA/iowabreakin.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>In May of this year, the University of Iowa was<a href="http://daily-iowan.com/2018/05/08/the-ui-is-accused-of-neglecting-the-death-of-244-animals-in-lab-experiments/"> accused</a> by an animal rights org with the deaths of 244 animals from neglect and abuse, a charge the university vigorously denied. Animal rights organizations began focusing attention on UI when a photo of an escaped goat running through the campus was publicized: <a href="https://assets.change.org/photos/4/ze/dn/SozeDnPSrMFvXdr-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1455034506">https://assets.change.org/photos/4/ze/dn/SozeDnPSrMFvXdr-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1455034506</a></p>
<p>HUGE UNDERGROUND TUNNELS UNDER BOTH UNIVERSITIES
It should be noted that both Iowa State University in Ames and University of Iowa in Iowa City have vast underground steam tunnels under their respective campuses. This is of special interest because the nature of animal genetic research and genetically modified plant research is highly controversial and hidden facilities could possibly be useful to mad scientists, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION
I don\'t claim that there is a connection between James Comey\'s cornfield tweets, Elwood the Gnome, genome sequencing projects, GMO corn, mutated animals and UI psychology student Mollie Tibbetts, but it is essential background information for anyone to consider when researching further into her murder. An Iowa cornfield may not be as innocent and harmless as it seems on first thought. Iowa cornfields could actually be field laboratories for science-fiction type mad scientists who want to redesign plants, animals and people into the image and likeness of their choosing.</p>

           <a href="http://daily-iowan.com/2018/05/08/the-ui-is-accused-of-neglecting-the-death-of-244-animals-in-lab-experiments/">
            accused
           </a>
           by an animal rights org with the deaths of 244 animals from neglect and abuse, a charge the university vigorously denied. Animal rights organizations began focusing attention on UI when a photo of an escaped goat running through the campus was publicized:

            https://assets.change.org/photos/4/ze/dn/SozeDnPSrMFvXdr-1600x900-noPad.jpg?1455034506
           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           HUGE UNDERGROUND TUNNELS UNDER BOTH UNIVERSITIES
It should be noted that both Iowa State University in Ames and University of Iowa in Iowa City have vast underground steam tunnels under their respective campuses. This is of special interest because the nature of animal genetic research and genetically modified plant research is highly controversial and hidden facilities could possibly be useful to mad scientists, if you know what I mean.
          </p>
          <p>
           CONCLUSION
I don't claim that there is a connection between James Comey's cornfield tweets, Elwood the Gnome, genome sequencing projects, GMO corn, mutated animals and UI psychology student Mollie Tibbetts, but it is essential background information for anyone to consider when researching further into her murder. An Iowa cornfield may not be as innocent and harmless as it seems on first thought. Iowa cornfields could actually be field laboratories for science-fiction type mad scientists who want to redesign plants, animals and people into the image and likeness of their choosing.

            Sure I've read they use garden gnomes at homes to indicate that they are selling their kids off for sexual abuse, as well as children's drawings in windows.

             Sounds perfectly plausible. Iowa State University is very proud of its Maize Genome Database which is described as "a national center for agricultural bioinformatics, housing the USDA National Bioinformatics Coordinator for all animal species. In addition to the animal genome projects housed at ISU, internationally-recognized plant and microbial genome research projects are available to researchers as well."

             Take a look at the G-nome gargoyle statues on top of Iowa State University (the same campus Comey visited when pictured with the giant gnome) if you don't think there is dysfunctional cuckery afoot in Iowa:

            ADDENDUM: I've read several articles about how the FBI has been investigating the incidents involving Animal Liberation Front (who raided the University of Iowa and rescued 400 animals and destroyed years of research at the Psychology Dept's animal testing labs in Nov., 2004) for years.
           </p>
           <p>
            In May, 2004, John Lewis, FBI Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI testified before the Senate on the ALF and said the following:
           </p>
           <p>
            "In recent years, the Animal Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front have become the most active criminal extremist elements in the United States."
           </p>
           <p>
            He concluded:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             "In conclusion, the FBI has made the prevention and investigation of animal rights extremists/eco-terrorism matters a domestic terrorism investigative priority. The FBI and all of our federal, state and local law enforcement partners will continue to strive to address the difficult and unique challenges posed by animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists. Despite the continued focus on international terrorism, we in the FBI remain fully cognizant of the full range of threats that confront the United States."
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Nonetheless, despite their strong talk, the FBI was unable to uncover any leads in the Iowa University raid which occurred a few months later, which has been called one of the largest and most successful on a university research lab. Six years after the raid, the FBI admitted that their investigation had stalled and had produced no conviction even though the case was said to be "a priority for the FBI, which collaborated with federal prosecutors, UI police and the Joint Terrorism Task Force. Hundreds of interviews were conducted, and investigators collected and analyzed extensive amounts of evidence."
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://globegazette.com/news/iowa/article_11bfb302-fbf6-11df-bd05-001cc4c002e0.html">
             https://globegazette.com/news/iowa/article_11bfb302-fbf6-11df-bd05-001cc4c002e0.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Sounds like the FBI was enormously invested in finding the culprits.
