<p><strong>BETHELLEHM STEEL FIRE, LACKAWANA NEW YORK, HOURS AFTER ELECTION, FACTS about BUILDING, and FIRE ITSELF</strong> </p>
<p>(OWNER OF THE BUILDING, And CLINTON FOUNDATION CORRELATION WILL BE NEXt)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUvtOY8cvJk">video of fire </a> another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut_hkhv2wUs">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This fire was  actually at the Site of the old Bethlehem steel factory. </p>
<ul>
<li>Bethlehem steel was one time the Second biggest Steel manufacture in the country...</li>
<li>As Well as America\'s second-largest shipbuilder... <em>Guess As to who number one was? &quot;KAISER PERHAPS? HE WAS THE FATHER OF SHIPBUILDING&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long story short, bethlehem steel was bought up awhile ago, and has a long history;</p>
<ul>
<li>Involving International Steel Group in 2003. </li>
<li>In 2005, ISG merged with Mittal Steel, ending American ownership of the assets of Bethlehem Steel. </li>
<li>That latter went on to be Arcelarmittal. After Acrel Steel Bought Mittal Steel</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>LACKAWAN NY LOCATION SPECIFICALLY.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The company that now owns the building itself, In lackawanna, is <strong>GREAT LAKES INDUSTRIAL</strong>, and the owner has some facts about him, that correlate with facts about the Clinton foundation... Which I\'ll Clearly show, after the remaining facts about the fire itself...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>.<strong>THE OLD</strong> Bethlehem steel plant in NY, caught fire <strong>HOURS after</strong> the election was called for Trump. <em>I am not making this a a political issue, These are simply facts.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>burned for 5 days, requiring 100 Fire fighters, and multiple Precincts from around the state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I Think it was the mayor, If not, it was Governor Cuomo Declared a <strong>State of Emergency for Lackawana New york</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mandatory Evacuation Was ordered for the surrounding neighborhoods.</strong> <em>should be noted that there was zero chance of the fire spreading past the property it was on.  Fire was not a risk for the houses.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The never worked to extinguish the fire, but rather &quot;Contain It&quot;.  Even Though it was producing MASSIVE amounts of TOXIC fumes. I\'d imagine this was their excuse for the mandatory Evacuation for the 300 Homes...( <em>I am know Health, or fire expert, but it seemed strange to me that homes would be evacuted because of this.  The smoke was not settling in the slightest, and In fact is was blowing away from the neighborhood, as seen in the fires.  I\'m confused as to how evacuating people down the street would be effective.</em> Perhaps someone has a logical answer for this.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>WHAT THE OFFICIALS SAID, DURING AND AFTER THE FIRE.</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;It\'s been standing there for 80 years, haven\'t had any issues with any of these buildings so far... and then this happened this morning&quot;</em> - Mayor of Lackawana when asked about sprinklers being installed, and recent fire inspections.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The mayor spoke to the news the day of the fire, but not until being pulled aside and directed what to say, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4oBWL-6tRE">by the city\'s building developer</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzJjpBzYj1A">The Governor of new york, Came and gave a press conference</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Go between fire deputy also stated they were demolishing immediately after, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwS0sWYEVMQ">actually it was still burning In some places.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The also said that it was inspected 2 months agoYouTube, and two days later it was they said that it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMnlSdychnY">actually two years ago.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The day of the fire, The Deputy Fire liaison (Person communitcating what\'s happening to the press) said they were already starting demolition, and would continue as soon as fire was extinguished. <em>this seemed strange to me, as I heard the day it happened, Because I couldn\'t understand how they would rationalize demolition so soon, when they didn\'t even know for sure, what started it..</em> (Working on finding link) </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89-EHLu4EL8">Two days later they &quot;clarified&quot; </a>  Saying that that the were only doing demolition that was needed to help extinguish the fire... <em>But remember they said the day before, they were only attempting to contain it... Change of plans?</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>So What caused this fire? Almost immediately after the fire started, All news outlets said <strong>A FUCKING LIGHT BULB HEATED UP SOME FUCKING CARDBOARD</strong> <em>remember the Mayors quote at the start of this?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They said this is what was conveyed by <strong>THE</strong>(singular) employee in the building, </p>
<ul>
<li>Remember, originally they also said they were demolishing... </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next day they said they didn\'t know the cause and needed to investigate. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>but if they don\'t know what caused it, and they are demolishing already, how will they ever know?</em>  
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The answer is, they wouldn\'t.. But don\'t worry, the Next Day they revised their comments, so that the new story made sense.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

               <em>
                I am know Health, or fire expert, but it seemed strange to me that homes would be evacuted because of this.  The smoke was not settling in the slightest, and In fact is was blowing away from the neighborhood, as seen in the fires.  I'm confused as to how evacuating people down the street would be effective.

            Yeah. I agree as well...I will say, The owner Of the property, also OWNS a DIFFERENT COMPANY, That works in demolition.  The Mayor said a local team had to come clean up the site and that it needed  to have specific equipment... David F(the owner of the building that was destroyed) Owns a local clean up demolition company.

            I wasted 10 minutes explaining what " Someone like you, couldn't understand after 45 mins reading"   Do you understand the connection yet? or were you just a douche asking questions, knowing you wouldn't read the answers.

            Since I don't trust your interpreatation of this comment, I'll clarify.  I DO NOT KNOW, if this is connected or not.  I'm simply show the possibility that it might be.... With a lot of "Coincidental" facts, and Suspicious circumstances.

            Dude. And the fact that they even knew it was a light bulb... Like, If you see a light bulb heat up some cardboard... You bought it out. Just like you said, fires don't spread instantly... So either you say the initial Light bulb set the fire, in which you could easily stop it from spreading... Or you didn't see shit.

            That being said, It very well could be an insurance scam unrelated to pizzagate. But then you have to factor in some of the other coincidences highlighted.

            So did anyone know that this Dave Flinstone (Island Distillers) also has a foundation in the same name? Why would a small distiller have a foundation? Why do so many of these people have a foundation?

            Re: the fire
Maybe suspicious maybe not. In a foundry operation using huge amounts of iron and steel at 2500+ temps plus oxygen other chemicals and enough  electricity to
power a small town, there is always a risk of fire. Fighting such a fire requires evacuation,  fumes could actually kill people in a good radius. Demolition followed by site cleanup is part of making it safe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Timing is the most suspicious: connected to CF, CF doing poorly, therefore any bribes paid will not be recouped, business may fail would be the logic.
Re: connections via corporate agents, registrations addresses etc.
Are these connections merely because of using typical business service agencies who provide legal presence, addresses, and legal shells to 100's of business clients?
If so, the connections are probably bogus, due to coincidence.
For example, how many other options than the one chosen do the companies/people have to get the same service in the same area?
Is it like being connected by buying groceries at the only store in town?
Or by buying crack in the same back alley?
Convince yourself, and us, which it is.
           </p>
           <p>
            I find it totally plausible that a crooked CF crony would pull an insurance scam  in this timeframe, rats leave sinking ships...

            I love this and I love your sarcasm. I can see that you were finding things and trying to keep it coherent but there are so many facets to the CF connections that it's hard not to go off on tangents. Well done and thank you.

            One general piece of feedback: you leap from point to point without developing / backing sufficiently (if at all) the connection, take tangents, then teleport back to another point you just remembered from one of the previous posts you made. You also edit back info in old posts so people who already read your post don't know what you are talking about because they didn't read the last update. And you also put some important suff in the comments. It may sound logical to you as the nature of the connection is clear in your mind, but that makes it very difficult to follow for anyone else.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have the feeling that you are really onto something, but at the moment it's too scattered around and I really can't wrap my head around what you are trying to prove. Please gather all your notes from all your other posts as well as the original Hawaii post on which you started commenting, and make one clear expose of how everything connects together. Don't hesistate to over-explain. You can add tags like "(1), (2), (3) etc." to also point back to earlier references in the post. And also make sure that every fact that's needed to connect things together is backed by solid evidence. When you say things are side by side, an annotated google map snapshot would help a lot and save everyone the hassle of having to retrace all of your investigation step by step before they even know if it holds any water. I know there is a character limitation in Voat. Maybe you can make a post on Steemit (recommended as censorship resistant) or Medium and then link to your post from here.

             I'm just reading this comment now... And I agree with you 100%  I Ran out of room in my post to add all of the Updates, So I had to determine what I thought to be the most important... I should have just made a new comment, But I was worried it wouldn't be seen.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've done A LOT of research, and uncovered A LOT of relevant infromation.  Information I'm more certain about then the information in these posts...
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately I  decided my first attempt at conveying my findings, would be with the information I'm least certain about, and hardest to explain... This was a few days ago, So I forgot what my motivation at the time was, But I remember thinking,
             <em>
              "Now would be a good time, to drop this, Even though I'm not done researching myself."
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              But I just want to say, I'm trying to prove the extremely evil government corruption facing this country.
             </strong>
             Not every post, Needs clear cut, "This is exactly what happened, here is the concrete evidence".   Most of us are not presenting Information to a jury, as a prosecutor...
            </p>
            <p>
             FIrst we need to figure out what the fuck needs to be researched more.   I was simply stating some facts, that connect my information, to the clinton foundation... Some facts that have never been mentioned and angles that have not have been looked into (To my knowledge.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Maybe people did look into some of these angles, prior to my post, But never mentioned them becuse they didn't deem it relevant... Or maybe they weren't looked into at all.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not my responsibility to Know with 100% certainty before posting...It is my responsibility to post information that I feel need to be looked in more thoroughly, If I can at least provide information as to why I feel that way.  As you've stated and I agreed to, It was disorganized as fuck... But I Believe I provided enough information, To justify my making of this post.
            </p>
            <p>
             But Like I said, I agree with you when you say it was disorganized and I was jumping around, In addition to letting "the clarity" in my head, affect my presentation of how this is relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
             I've learned my lesson, and will Undoubtedly make sure all future posts  are clear, and concise.

            Alas he might have a point or he might not but he is so bad at presenting his case and so "prickly" (understatement) to deal with to get answers, I know I won't be the one to help him cheer-lead his case.  If I had admin privileges he would be kicked or severely warned.

            And Thank you. that's a good IDea. But if you defend a shill. you're  not helping me. I really dislike shill's and shill defenders. I admit it's hard to tell true shills nowa days... But that's why I said at the beginning of my post. I will tolerate people who are cunts for no reason, you have no excuse to be a cunt if we're on the same side.

           </p>
           <p>
            Ok? Can you follow that much? We'll go from there. But I Feel you need special help. so we'll go step by step.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT: Fuck it.
           </p>
           <p>
            So There we gave you about 8 examples of how the kaiser foundation and clinton foundation are connected. I picked 8 because it' my favorite number, Feel free to continue to research clinton kaiser connection on your own.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you've already forgotten why kaiser is relevant, I'll refresh your memory.
           </p>
           <p>
            WEll The Hawaii Address OF david Flintstone, That is address that is On it's own power grid, Seperate from the rest of the county.  Also Has an astounding number of other Industrial marvels, For such a simple place in hawaii. I believe it's own Drainage system. The own that was there prior to Flintstones purchase, Was removed. That's a tough feet. It's weird He's able to do all of these things IN hawaii!! they have insane Zoning laws. I think it's only worse TO California? DOn't quote me on that. But take a look at the link I have in my post.
           </p>
           <p>
            So that address Is located In the town Founded by Henry Kaiser. and 8 of the closest buildings from the flintstone address are named after Henry Kaiser.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, You said you wanted me to focus on the connect between Kasier, and Bethlehem? Because Even you could see that it was weird connections bethlehms owner has with clinton.
           </p>
           <p>
            So you're right in saying that the Betheleh and kasier connection is the weakest point. I never Once insinuated otherwise.  But lets see what we have
           </p>
           <p>
            Bethlehm steel plant location, Was bought By david Franjoine He too specializes In steel, STEELWORKS actually. Kasier also specializes In Steel, Kaiser Steel, and again, Clinton has the same address as david in 4 states, and close proximity in others.
           </p>
           <p>
            So What Else Does David Franjoine do? Well He has Companies specializing IN Construction, Mining, Steel manufacturing, Demolitions,
            <strong>
             PIPELINES
            </strong>
            . Real estate. ETC. ETC
           </p>
           <p>
            Basically Everything. They all specalize in everything. David Franjoine, Kaiser,  and here's a fun fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            This fire was actually at the Site of the old Bethlehem steel factory.
           </p>
           <p>
            Bethlehem steel was one time the Second biggest Steel manufacture in the country...
As Well as America's second-largest shipbuilder... Guess As to who number one was? "KAISER PERHAPS? HE WAS THE FATHER OF SHIPBUILDING"  Yeah both Bethelehem and Kasier Worked On producing and manufacturing ships for world II
           </p>
           <p>
            They also Collaborated On The Hoover DaM and Golden gate bridge... Wait, Don't quote me on the bridge, I'll double check . But w.e They basically were two of the biggest best in their areas of expertise.
           </p>
           <p>
            And like I said, The Kaiser connection to David Franjoine, Is by far the weakest link in the post. So maybe Don't worry about that connection as much as the other ones that are super suspect.

            Dude. that's exactly one of the reasons I'm not certain... But then it's two... and the then three.. and then 4 states with the same fucking address.
           </p>
           <p>
            But no I agree with what you're saying. My only goal was to make this known, and see where it goes. Honestly; I probably should ahve just made separate posts, and then linked them in order since theres so many different components.

            There are 2 things  One is the evidence you are trying to present, the other is the picture you are drawing with that evidence.  I don't understand what you are claiming, what is the motive?  Are you hoping we will find out for you?   Why is this in Pizzagate?   Even if the intentionally touched a building because trump won, I don't get why, why does it matter?

             Think of it like a spool. The Clinton foundation as a wheel,  the center of it at the moment it's pizza gate but everything walks out from there.  We started with the emails it brought us to Comet,  we see all the faces that interact with it,  it can be traced snail step by snail step and it leads to this.  The OP has left no space in between the breadcrumbs. Bravo!   If you don't think a fire of this magnitude linked to the entities that are the CF, I  can't  help you. If you have read all of the material, that is!

WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE !? WHAT ARE YOU FUCKING TALKING ABOUT. I'm PRESENTING FACTS YOU STUPID FUCK. Can You not comprehened why this may or may not be relevant? You're legit flabbergasted? jesus fuck.

             Dude. I don't know why bother answering this. But why would a company, That shares the same address with clinton foundation, In 4 different states, and in two states a half mile apart, matter?
            </p>
            <p>
             Why would it matter that David Franjoine, who shares an address with the clinton foundation in 4 states, and is Half a mile a part in two other,
             <strong>
              HAD HIS BUILDING BURN DOWN, WHEN THE PERSON WHO HE SHARES AN ADDRESSES WITH IN 4 SSTATES,  LOST A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION!  THIS IS YOUR FUCKING QUESTION YOU NEED CLARIFIED?

              No reason to attack.  I wasted ten minutes of my life reading this and I have no idea what the point is.    It doesn't help to be insulting.   If you are not able to concisely point out what the claim is, can somebody else step in?   This might not have anything to do with Pizzagate but this sounds like it might be another big scandal with the CF.

               Have you realized that clinton foundation is the focal point of  pizzagate yet?   If you didn't realize this at the time of you comment, I can't imagine anythings changed.  If you have, Good on you.  More eyes the better, Just don't need those eyes focused solely on pizza, Since it's simply one piece of this 10,000 piece puzzle.
              </p>
              <p>
               And I'm not saying you should pay attention this post, I'm just saying you should get a grasp of what you're supposed to be researching. (As IN EVERYTHING, that is connected to the clinton foundation... Everyone that is connected to clinton foundation.)

               You're a fucking moron if you think pizza gate doesn't involve CF. I'm only insulting to those who speak down to me. I have all the time in the world to answer legitmate questions. If you're a condescending douche before saying anything of substance, I have no time for that.

              Just to clarify, the major implication is that the Bethlehem fire is insurance fraud? Or is it an excuse to release toxic fumes somehow? If there were more ties to insurance or a summary of how Clinton directly stood to benefit from this, it may make it a bit more clear. Not everyone's a shill, some of us either can connect the dots but want credible sources to point others to who may not have the same background, or have a hard time following many parallel investigations without good executive summaries. We all need to explore our own rabbit holes, but provide concise conclusions for others to avoid duplicating work.

               Dude. What you're asking is out outrageous.  Why the fuck would I speculate on something like that. I'm just giving the facts.if you can't see them as relevant, then carry on. I don't understand why you're trying to figure out a motive before you solve the crime. That's the stupidest shit i've ever heard. That's how you fuck shit up, That's why i wasn;t doing it.

             DUDE! WHAT IS THE MOTIVE FOR WHAT. there is no single answer to a single question man. Come on. I said, Just spent time writing a thoughtful fucking response to you're originally idiotic question, asking you to please clarify what YOU want clarified, and you reply with the same fucking thing you said in your first comment.. What the fuck. I don't have time for this shit. ASK A QUESTION ABOUT A SPECIFIC PART .  I Just presented a shit ton of different parts, it's insane for you to  inquire a single answer with that question.

            I don't get why this is in Pizzagate?  You obviously believe it belongs here but after reading the whole first post it feels like a shaggy dog story.  Could you not start out with a synopsis first?   Why would they set fire to this?    Was it part of a child trafficking ring?

             Dude. Child Trafficking is a single aspect of what this all entails. You know that. You know it's Trafficking of every kind. If you didn't know that, now you do. If someone in the future  to tell you that Child tracking is what this is all about, be weary of what else they say, without knowing this crucial fact.
            </p>
            <p>
             That being said,  All I'm looking for is whether or not people think this is important or relevant to anything else.  I'm not asking if after they read this post, Do they think a trafficking ring is under way.  I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything.
            </p>
            <p>
             Personally, I do feel like this is could be very relevant, based on the facts I've found. I don't know what the end outcome is, and I'm sure no one does.
            </p>
            <p>
             OK. as argumentative as this might sound, I'm truly not trying to be. IN fact my motive was to get feed back as to whether or not these facts seem relevant to everything that's come before these facts. OR if they thought it did not, and could say why.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't feel comfortable making allegations about specific things I have no way verifying... I am trying to stick things that are undeniably facts.*  I'm not going to attempt to Say what was burned. That facts, Should lead you to a a possibility of why there was a fire though, Correct?
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              I am happy to try and clarify specific questions you have, Because I'm sure you're not the only one.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              But you need to give me a specific example of part you're confused on. Or a few, Or as many as you want. But just pick one, at a time and I'll explain that part.  But I Can't explain the entire post, MORE SPECIFICALLY In a comment to you.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Ya know? So I am happy to clairfy your questions, But it needs to go past " I don't get it"

              You are incredibly prickly.  I tried to understand your case and you might have one or not, I can't tell, but the way you speak to people, ugh.  Take a chill pill and figure out how to tell your story more clearly.  First just lay out the basic claim, don't worry about evidence just give the basic outline of what you are accusing them of.  Make this the top of your post.
Then below provide the evidence that hopefully backs up what you are trying to say.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also there ARE some shills here and idiots no doubt, but don't assume someone is one of trying to undermine you automatically just because they don't get what you are saying.  I am not a shill, and I am not the only person to fail to quickly and easily comprehend the nature of your claim (besides some arson for initially unclear reasons).
Also you say there is more that child trafficking etc...  But PizzaGate is about that and so ideal posts should be on that subject and if they somehow aren't and are still posted here is should mention that it is mildly off topic (Clinton related but not to Pizzagate).

               DUDE listen. I honestly think I got confused In my replies... I'm sorry, I was like replying to three different threads, and weaving in and out of conversations. I don't even know. I'm sorry, If I was dick. I honestly don't even know waht I said to you because its so fucking hard to back track conversations on voat... (My only critique, and maybe I just havent figured it out yet)
              </p>
              <p>
               I will say. I believe either you or I have a misunderstanding of what pizza gate entails... CLINTON FOUNDATION Is the one of  biggest part of pizzagate. Pizza gate is the shitty title we got stuck with via  bad voting process. PIzza gate has pizza and pedophilia involved, but by no means is that the entirety of this situation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Or am I confused about what pizza gate entails. IF It is in fact, only pizza pedophila related, Then we need an emergency conference thread changing that. Or is there a third possibility Im not considering?

                Thanks for that. Yes Voat is bad for trying to back track conversations.

               <p>
                IMO Pizzagate is about the Pedophilia connection and the creepy would connected to it, which seems to include cannibalism.
I agree it's not a great name and it isn't as all inclusive of other connected areas of corruption connected to this corrupt scum.
               </p>
               <p>
                But I think it's too late to change the name, however another name should be found for the other subjects that are not directly related to children or pizza in some way.

             Could be the fire and moving all the people out of the neighborhood was a cover for moving something out of the warehouse? But what? Arms, people, something other people would likely notice being moved? So something needing large trucks? Why after Trump was elected?  It is curious.

            This smells rotten to me.  Anyone not even being a detective can see through the lines that they don't really want to release any real information.  It seems they change the story right after they give the facts (although probably not true) when they are not even doing any real investigation.  Where there is smoke  there is usually a fire, I think it is obvious the building was in the way.  Only to prove it.

            I'm trying to comprehend all this but it's a real mess.. for starters you spelled "Bethlehem" about 9 different ways, you slipped in a lot of crass jokes.. it makes it very hard to actually read and digest. I'll try again later when my headache subsides.. maybe you should just list 10 or so relevant key points without explanation, and then we can go and look at the explanation if we want to.

 Don't lie when addressing my post please. I don't want people persuaded by your dishonest analysis. I don't make a lot of crass jokes, I do not spell betqxqwqlaham nine different ways. I used the word twelve  times, Added an extra L once, and typo the other.
            </p>
            <p>
             IF you actually wanted to contribute anything of relevance, You could have. But you didn;t do anything. you gave a horrible suggestion and acted like a douche.  I agree It can be more organized. BUt it's not like " OH MY GOD WHAT IS ALL OF THIS AHHHH MY HEAD HURTS"  No. Chances are you;re just a douche bag, Or you're just retarded. Obviously both is a possibility.
            </p>
            <p>
             You could go line by line, and tell me things that are factually wrong or don't make sense, OR hard to follow etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             But do you not understand that you're being a dick for no reason, and not actually saying anything worth listening to?
            </p>
            <p>
             And mostly because you're a dick.  I mean, The list of 10 things isn't a horrible idea... But it's not great, and it's for not great enough to ignore the part where you were an unnecessarily condescending dick.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's called constructive criticism.  It makes people better people.  Your chose of communication, doesn't it hurts everyone. Now I'm wasting time and energy, being annoyed with you.  And that factor means theres no good outcome for you either.
            </p>
            <p>
             You know what I mean? What did you actually expect to happen, after making that comment.
            </p>
            <p>
             IF you have  an opinion on the information itself, Or have a suggestion without being a cunt., I"m all ears. But I've got no ears for unnecessarily douchey douche bags, like yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tell me how to make this better, But I'm not going to listen if it comes from a dick.

              I've read and re-read what you posted. You seem very, very proud of your work and I can tell you spent a lot of time researching this and and looking for kudos, so I will give you some. Kudos to you, good job making these connections..
But please, for those of us who clearly aren't as intelligent as you are, can you break it down all simple-like?
             </p>
             <p>
              You've presented a massive wall of facts, and given no reason for doing so. You've linked all these people and businesses to the Clinton Foundation, but I can't seem to find where you are providing any kind of theory, claim, or even asking any more questions. Please clarify what's in your head, clearly there's a lot running through your brain and we are not psychic.

              dude you need to calm down. You found great stuff with finding a link between them, dont let it get discredited because you were tired when you wrote it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Rearrange reorganize spellcheck and post again when this thread gets buried (which it will on this voat mess) this need to be seen. For now people are discreting the link between the CF and Haiti, if we can link them to Kaisers were closer to the goal.

               Oh. In regards to CF Haiti and kaiser, My guess Is It'll be in regards to the Global HIV/AIDS initiative.  I'm saying that Based on doing zero reserach about those specfics, but that's where I'll probably start tomorrow.

               Thank you. I Will do that for sure..

               But you know you can't tell people to calm down, when the person you're telling to call down, thinks they are justified in being not calm.(Regardless IF they are or not)/
              </p>
              <p>
               And I think I am. Fuck those people. I don't need to calm down. Because fuck them. There are two types of people involved in this.  People that are trying to find truth, and those trying distribute it.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you're going to comment on a post like this, being a cunt for no reason, before you even say anything of substance. You're in the latter group. Tensions are too high, and this shit is too unprecedented for fucks to be getting in the way by being dicks. Regardless of what their true intentions are.  If you think this post is nonsense, But you also want to find the truth, Then convey that without being a douche. Because there's nothing positive that can possibly come from being a cunt for no reason.  If I see a post that I disagree with, I explain it to them, I'm not a dick to them, because I know we're trying to accomplish the same thing, and I know what Might not make sense to me right away, Makes perfect sense with proper context.
              </p>
              <p>
               EIther be cordial, Or be assumed to be a shill. Because if you're not a shill but you're not at least cordial, Then you're part of the problem too. I've spent way too much time and effort on this, not to mention the shit I've done prior to this, To give any cunt the time of day... Ok, well that's not true because I usually spend 5 minutes bitching them out. I'm just saying. Lets not be cunts to each other, if we're actually trying to accomplish the same thing.
              </p>
              <p>
               **The thing is. Even If you don't think something relevant, You have no right to be a cunt, or dismissive about that theory. Chances are, you don't know the whole picture, (as these fucks had made perfectly clear,) Because every fucking theory at the forefront of this research, was dismissed time and time again, some of mine included.  Many of which would never have been known if it werent for random luck.
              </p>
              <p>
               So that's why I get fed up with these fucks.  I know anyone actually worthwhile in this research, wouldn't address me and this research in the manner those cunts have. Done
End rant.
              </p>
              <p>
               That being said, I appreciate your comment. I have a lot of shit that Can now be added and hopefully tomorrow I will have time to organize it thoroughly.

                I say that because I can clearly read out of the language you use and the capslock and all that you are highly agitated, and I just had to take 1 day off of this ride, to secure my own health. That state is ofc highly appropriate. But we have to stay functional, to stay good soldiers in this.
               </p>
               <p>
                The best method I yet found to sabotage shills is forcing constructive discussion at all situations. That makes most of their tactics unusable, except planting false leads. And we are so many people that these dont stay long.

                 Oh my god,  I know I'm embarrassed... I mean, not about the irrational anger, but the excessive use of caps lock :/  I look back at some comments and just cringe.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In my defense... I got in a bad caps lock habit while making this post. ya know, so that it's some what easier to follow certain key things, lol. But yes. you read me like a book. Woo Sa. And hopefully you know none of that was directed at you.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And I agree with everything you say... In there defense, I don't even know if they were actual shills, But I just wanted to convey the point that being a dick from the start will make you look like a shill. Or I don't even know what my fucking point was anymore. Tomorrow's a new day.

            I know. I will.  Honestly dude, I had plans to do a lot of shit after this, BUt I was just trying to gauge other peoples thoughts before going head first only to have it be nothing. I've started to do that like 10 times, with 10 different projects. I'm a disorganized cunt.  Do you have any suggestions for programs or apps that would be the best way to go about doing that?

             Dude. This shit ain't going anywhere. And I'm having a hard time understanding why not... TO the point I feel like I'm crazy or something.... BUT THEN SOMEONE AT LEAST SAY THAT, we can't just ignore shit like this. It's either a crazy good lead, or a waste of time. Any feedback is appreciated.  Feel free to repost at will. I've tried too many times, granted I only tried the easy to follow version once.

              It seems fishy to me. Like they are hiding evidence They demolished the building before their was even an investigation? Really weird the way their story changed. Weird that they evacuated the neighborhood. I think you're on to something! Great research!

            I couldn;t even add this part to my post, (over character limit)
I am by no means Spamming, But This is a much more digestable, easy to follow version, Of my post from 5 hours ago. IF you've read that post in the last hour, I've edited it to be the same as you see here.  If you have not read my last post in the last hour, this has more info and sources. SORRY. and thank you.

            *EDIT: Alrght, I'm going to be an annoying cunt one last time.... I know everyone is busy as fuck with a variety of shit...but I REALLY would appreciate ANY input, Because I have a lot of other things, That might be relevant, But It's almost impossible for me to explain how or why, without being called a shill, or retarded, in addtion to needing to make post 10 times as long as this, I guarantee no one wants that...
           </p>
           <p>
            Good, bad neutral... All Is extremely welcome. Seriously, Bad is good in my book, so i can move on... but you just have to explain why. Some of Biggest my nonsensical ramblings that have have been dismissed with out justification, have unfrotunalety ended up validated.  So please tell me why I'm, or what is wrong.

             This is a really important contribution. One suggestion -
Start with the information that the CF has the same registered addresses as the other companies in multiple states. This would help a reader to determine where this is going. Right now, there is a lot of information that seems to not have a clearly defined purpose, and then you unload the most pertinent info at the very end.
            </p>
            <p>
             Start with the common address information. That raises a lot of red flags. Then start to define what the allied businesses are and the releveant company infor.
            </p>
            <p>
             Really great info here. Don't get frustrated and give up. It looks to me like you hit on some major ties with potentially lots of good leads.

               Just wanted to touch base with you about this so you don't drop it. I think you are doing the right thing focussing in on the CF in ways that no one else is.

               Try to find out what if anything might have been stored there that would have needed to be moved post Trump election, and that they'd need the cover of a fire as excuse to get neighbors out of the way. Arms? Drugs? People? If they were up to something perhaps there are police reports by neighbors, complaints, etc?
