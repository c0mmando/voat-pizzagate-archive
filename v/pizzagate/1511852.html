            Get this guy out of pizzagate. Every damn thing he posts is either regurgitated or a distraction. I see you DonaldMcRonald you Saul Alinsky playbook (badly I might add) follower. This is NO holy grail of anything  It is an old research report done by your lovely truthful DOJ and universities that we are told to hold in such high esteem. Want references for universities and their participation in MK ULTRA and more modern mind control. This guy hooks you in with the clickbait though doesn't he?she?? Old news and the numbers they site are way below the truth of how many children are actually being abducted. What Holy Grail???? Plus all of this is available online!!!

            You are being debunked because you are a shill head. Nothing you have posted(I have looked through your crap) means anything and keep fighting me because it will become more and more evident to others what a shill you are! Time waste and taking up space! You try to take up as much time as you can with these click bait bullshit posts.Post something real dickhead not regurgitated crap. Oops that right, you are just doing your job. Distracting from the real issues.  A cheerleader for the DOJ and the FBI and the universities that were involved and maybe still are, in the programming of children and promoting of child abuse and programming

Too much of a baby to read up on ritual abuse?  Bitch boy for satanists??? What?? What do you think ritual abuse is about??

The Truth about Satanic Ritual Abuse
A Rebuttal to Wikipedia’s Portrayal of Satanic Ritual Abuse
November 2, 2008  By Wanda Karriker, PhD
           </p>
           <p>
            Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) is NOT a moral panic.
SRA is a subset of Ritual Abuse (RA).
Ritual abuse is defined in the Dictionary of Psychology as “A method of control of people of all ages consisting of physical, sexual, and psychological mistreatment through the use of rituals” (Corsini, 1999, p. 848).
Young, Sacks, Braun &amp; Watkins (1991) use the term “satanic ritual abuse” to describe ritual abuse associated with satanic worship. Becker and Fröhling (1998) caution that (1) a ritual can be staged to make a victim believe that the ideological background is real, i.e., a child is made to think she has murdered a baby as a sacrifice to Satan or another deity, (2) that whether or not a ritual is staged, the victim is bound into the real or faked belief system of the perpetrator(s).
A June 2007 review of psychological and medical peer-reviewed journals yielded 47 empirical studies of the RA phenomenon.
Bottoms, Shaver, and Goodman (1996) indicate that the majority of surveyed therapists who have treated at least one alleged survivor believe their clients’ claims of ritual abuse. Schmuttermaier and Veno (1999) report that none of the counselors in their Australian study believe that their clients intentionally fabricated claims of ritual abuse.
Bottoms et al. constructed a prototype of 386 cases from the decade of the 1980’s based on the particular features of abuse that clinical psychologists had heard from their clients. They found the following:
The most common feature of ritual cases was “forced sex.” The next most common was “repeated practices.” . . . Also common, however, were abuse by a member of a cult-like group; abuse related to symbols associated with the devil; abuse involving sacrifice or torture of animals; abuse involving excrement or blood; and abuse involving knives, altars, and candles. . . . The least common features of ritualistic cases were abuse related to the breeding of infants for ritual sacrifice, abuse involving cannibalism, child pornography, and amnesic periods or preoccupation with dates. (p. 10)
Young et al. (1991) describe 37 adult patients, all diagnosed with multiple personality disorder (MPD) or dissociative disorder not otherwise specified who reported similar abuses by satanic cults. Apparently, most of the data were collected while the patients were in treatment with the authors. The article lists ten types of ritual abuse and the percentage of subjects who reported each type: sexual abuse (100%), witnessing and receiving physical abuse/torture (100%), witnessing animal mutilation/killings (100%), death threats (100%), forced drug usage (97%), witnessing and forced participation in human adult and infant sacrifice (83%), forced cannibalism (81%), marriage to Satan (78%), buried alive in coffins or graves (72%), forced impregnation and sacrifice of own child (60%).
Shaffer and Cozolino (1992) interviewed 19 women and one man who reported types and aftereffects of ritualistic abuse consistent with those reported by Young et al. All subjects reported witnessing the murder of animals, infants, children and/or adults. All reported suicidal ideation and half reported suicide attempts. The majority reported severe and sadistic forms of abuse by multiple perpetrators. Some reported continued recontact/revictimization into their adult years.
Satanic Ritual Abuse is an international  phenomenon. Van der Hart, Boon, and Heijtmajer (1997) describe reports of SRA in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States; Kent (1997), in Canada; and Schmuttermaier and Veno (1999), in Australia. An organization, Advocates for Survivors of Child Abuse (2006), also includes reports of SRA in Australia.
In Ritual Abuse in the Twenty-First Century, German journalist, Ulla Fröhling (2008), writes about her study that was published as a book in 1996 titled  Vater unser in der Hölle (Our Father Who Art in Hell). Reprinted in 2008, it is about the life of a German woman with a background of satanic ritual abuse:
The book had an impact: victims found a corroboration of their experiences in it, and doctors and trauma therapists who work with dissociative patients use it for workshops and training courses. A parliamentary inquiry examined the topic of ritual abuse, as did the Parliamentary select committee “Sects and Psycho-Groups,” which mentions the book several times in its concluding report. Three surveys on ritual abuse were carried out. Together with Michaela Huber’s textbook Multiple Personlichkeiten  (Multiple Personalities), it changed the German public’s perception of one of the darkest areas of organized violence. (p. 355)
Becker (2008) reported unpublished data from one of the above mentioned surveys, a 1997 study by Fröhling and German psychotherapist Michaela Huber. Of 354 cases in treatment for the aftereffects of ritual abuse by 126 therapists and counselors from 61 locations in Germany, 58% reported that they had been ritually abused in a satanic cult.
Results from the 2007 International Extreme Abuse Surveys offered in English and German indicate that ritual abuse (including SRA) is widespread. More than 2000 persons from 40 countries responded to one or more of the surveys for adult survivors of extreme abuse in childhood (EAS), for professionals who work with survivors who report extreme abuse (P-EAS), and for caregivers of children who disclose ritual abuse and its associated mind control. SRA related data are reported by Becker, Karriker, Overkamp, and Rutz (2008):
On the EAS, 543 respondents reported that they were ritually abused in a satanic cult: 360 from the United States, 33 from Canada, 97 from Europe, and 53 from other countries. (p. 41)
Respondents on the P-EAS were asked to report the approximate number of their adult clients who had reported memories consistent with the abuses/tortures listed. Of 219 professionals who responded to the item: “Ritual abuse in a satanic cult,” 20 reported none, 56 reported 1, 74 reported between 2 and 10; 28 reported between 11 and 20; 41 reported more than 20. (p. 44)
On the C-EAS, 55 caregivers reported that the child or children under their care had alleged a satanic cult as their perpetrator group. (p. 43)
Two web-based archives show legal proceedings and convictions related to SRA and other forms of RA.

            No, I have had family members subjected to ritual abuse. I have seen victims suicide over not being believed because of so called experts denying the existence of ritual abuse.You have a lot of nerve accusing me of 'talking about things no one knows about or even cares about". You site a Federal Justice System sponsoring a study?? Yeah, how is that justice system working out for you? Huh? Not a lot of help on Pizzagate is it. You put your fat foot in your own mouth. Stop eating the pablum fed to you and realize why there is a cover up. If the justice system is sponsoring it then nothing will get out about the realities of ritual abuse . I've read it. It is scratching the surface, a few bones thrown out. CNN reported on it, hahaha! Wow! Guess that means something to you? Get your head out of your ass

            I didn't want to start a new thread. I just wanted to ask a favor. I have people coming over today. I've been trying to tell them about pizzagate. They haven't even heard about it. I want to show them a video or documentary about it. Can you guys recommend a good video that easily explains everything and is up to date? Like all of it. From Podesta, to spirit cooking, to Hillary Clinton and all those sick fucks and their satanic ritual abuse. There are soooo many videos that I can't go thru them all to find out the best. Thank you!

            Wow!! Pizzagate has everything to do with ritual Abuse and when the best defense against that is citing a 1992 report by Lanning is what?Some kind of truth?? Talk to a survivor of ritual abuse. There are thousands of testimonials online, hundreds of books written about it. Oh because he's FBI he must be unbiased. Bull shit!! What does it tell you that if you google 'ritual abuse' you get a Wikipedia page called Satanic Ritual abuse that of course sites Lanning's report. A report form 1992??(

            The) people perpetrating this are scared to death that you, the general public, figure it out. Ritual abuse is real!!Lately an unusual amount of attention has been given to this Lanning report and I have to question why?? Are these shills in here, trying to dissuade anyone from realizing the truth about ritual abuse? This more than anything else convinced me that Wikipedia is nothing but a mouth piece for the scum committing these crimes. Downvote me all you want, I can see you and your little psyop. Another phony group is The False Memory Syndrome. It is a CIA front.

            Here is MY PERSONAL OPINON of the the htm 1992 FBI report - Satanic Ritual Abuse by Kenneth V. Lanning -
            <a href="http://www.skeptictank.org/fbi1992.htm">
             http://www.skeptictank.org/fbi1992.htm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            at first glance and here's why.
           </p>
           <pre><code>          1. It's Lanning biased junk. 
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Lanning refers to and quotes idiotic authors such as Rebecca Brown M.D. who's written a book titled "Prepare for war". He writes:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             ... she lists among the 'doorways' to satanic power and/or demon infestation the following: fortune tellers, horoscopes, fraternity oaths, vegetarianism, yoga, self-hypnosis, relaxation tapes, acupuncture, biofeedback, fantasy role-playing games, adultery, homosexuality, pornography, judo, karate, and rock music. Dr. Brown states that rock music "was a carefully masterminded plan by none other than Satan himself" (p. 84.)
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            In the same paragraph, K. Lanning goes on to say:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In books, lectures, handout material, and conversations, I have heard all of the following referred to as satanism:
            </p>
            <p>
             -- Church of Satan
-- Ordo Templi Orientis
-- Temple of Set
-- Demonology
-- Witchcraft
-- Occult
-- Paganism
-- Santeria
-- Voodoo
-- Rosicrucians
-- Freemasonry
-- Knights Templar
-- Stoner Gangs
-- Heavy Metal Music
-- Rock Music
-- KKK
-- Nazis
-- Skinheads
-- Scientology
-- Unification Church
-- The Way
-- Hare Krishna
-- Rajneesh
-- Religious Cults
-- New Age
-- Astrology
-- Channeling
-- Transcendental Meditation
-- Holistic Medicine
-- Buddhism
-- Hinduism
-- Mormonism
-- Islam
-- Orthodox Church
-- Roman Catholicism
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            So, almost every religion except Judaism, Jehovah witnesses and all Christian denominations except for Orthodox and Roman Catholic are not considered satanic anywhere in books, lectures, material or conversations. Really?! How biased is that...
           </p>
           <pre><code>  2. I believe it's a brainwashing tool for FBI and probably other American Intelligence agencies.
</code></pre>
           <p>
            In the same 'Definitions' paragraph, Lanning goes on to write:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The ideas expressed in Dr. Brown's book may seem extreme and even humorous. This book, however, has been recommended as a serious reference in law enforcement training material on this topic.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Really?
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             At law enforcement training conferences, it is witchcraft, Santeria, paganism, and the occult that are most often referred to as forms of satanism. It may be a matter of definition, but these things are not necessarily the same as traditional satanism. **The worship of lunar goddesses and nature and the practice of fertility rituals are not satanism. **Santeria is a combination of 17th century Roman Catholicism and African paganism.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            I repeat myself: totally biased and a clear brainwashing tool. And if you go on to read the other points such as 'what is ritual child abuse' and 'what makes a crime satanic, occult or ritualistic, most of you will be shocked at Lanning's interpretations of these terms, in a negative way.

             Are you stating Santeria has nothing to do with basic teachings of demonology (luciferianism / satanism) ?? If so you are totally wrong one of the main forces used in favor of the Santero is Papa Legba ( some say it's a demon some high priest say it's the devil himself )  source: Yo soy cubano mi abuela está bien metida en la santería / I'm Cuban my grandma is very fond to Santeria as most Cuban older generations

             You have clearly misunderstood - he is referencing an author who has written things that are apparently used by law enforcement to understand satanism or these kinds of abuses. Even if the book is idiotic, it is not wrong of him to reference it if it is relevant to what he's writing about, which it is. He isn't saying he agrees with her, he isn't holding the book up as the ultimate arbiter of truth, he's showing what kind of things have been described in the literature as doorways to satanic power.
            </p>
            <p>
             The second point - the religions he lists he says are ones he has heard referred to as satanism, not that they are not satanism, so you've totally confused that. Orthodox and Roman Catholicism HAVE been referred to as satanism. The rest of Christian denominations, Judaism etc have NOT been referred to as satanism anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, he is just saying what's going on - that this other book by Brown has been used by law enforcement, he's not saying it should be, he's describing the way things are.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is not biased from what you've put here and not brainwashing at all. Sounds like a normal academic text, which by necessity will discuss various aspects of a topic and previous writings on it, how those writings are interpreted and used, without necessarily endorsing those ideas and opinions.

              When I read something completely biased as this here, which is HIS own personal view, I know that his intentions are not as pure as we might want to believe.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               Most, however, would probably answer that what makes a crime satanic, occult, or ritualistic is the motivation for the crime. It is a crime that is spiritually motivated by a religious belief system. **How then do we label the following true crimes?
**
              </p>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              The first two "true crimes" on his list:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <ol>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Parents defy a court order and send their children to an unlicensed Christian school.

               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 Parents refuse to send their children to any school because they are waiting for the second coming of Christ.
                </p>
               </li>
              </ol>
             </blockquote>
             <p>
              How are these defined as true satanic, occult or ritualistic crimes? Do I really have to put up a link or something to make you see how he's being biased? Use your common sense for God's sake. And don't tell me that when he writes: "How then do we label the following true crimes", he's referring to someone other than himself, because he doesn't point that out anywhere. You just want to believe he does.

               I just think you aren't familiar with reading academic texts/arguments. He is not being biased at all, he is pointing out the complexities of crimes that are motivated by religious belief. He isn't saying that those examples are satanic crimes, he's saying that they are crimes in that they break the law, and that they are motivated by firm religious belief, as in Christian belief, not satanic belief!

                 I'm not making any judgement either way about Lanning, I don't know. I'm just saying what you've provided as evidence isn't evidence of what you're claiming, that's all.

                  I read the entire report and it left me with the clear impression that he was being biased and manipulative in his ideas and presentation. There is no way for me to bring up evidence except quote him. I simply used common sense. Anyway, the message was clear to me, but it might not have been as evident to others, which in my opinion, made him even more dangerous. I was just trying to warn people. Peace.

            <p>
             The "counterculture movement" described as gaining momentum may more accurately be described as a subculture rather than a counterculture. Research indicates that some incest and pedophile activity is a result of the family socialization process and is learned behavior passed down from generation to generation and is believed by its participants to be acceptable behavior as defined by the subculture. Rather than rebelling against culture, the individuals participating in the incest/pedophile subculture are merely conforming to a different culture. The F.B.I. was remiss in failing to identify and investigate the presence of an incest/pedophile subculture active in America. Perhaps the subculture has been so successful in its enculturation process that the F.B.I. is unaware of its existance or that the F.B.I. lacks the resources and capacity to break through the subculture's barriers between itself and the greater society.

             The author is clearly part of this subculture and his reports are regarded as a reference tool in law enforcement institutions. How can they see that anything is wrong with this movement when they're into it themselves? It's like asking a Christian to arrest someone for having a bible and a crucifix in his home and convicting him for sending his children to a Chrisitan school or circumcising his son. Lanning &amp; co are satanists.

              What makes you think that though You need to provide some kind of rationalisation for why people should believe you, or some proof or evidence that the authors are part of the whole thing.

               Hahaha, nice try. You can't plug all of the holes that are leaking out and spilling the truth about ritual abuse. You want evidence do you?? Sounds vaguely familiar and for your evidence go google ritual abuse testimonies. You'r not a child are you? Funny I have provided links and 'evidence' to you people but you ignore it. This thread of so full of shit they might just as well call this 'CIA trying to Cover it's Tracks' but here ya go shill

                What? You're not making sense - I completely agree that ritual abuse goes on and I want nothing more than to expose these monsters. But it's just a fact of trying to expose people for wrongdoing, that you need to provide evidence, or no one will believe you. And specific evidence that this person has been involved, not just general evidence that this type of abuse happens. I don't get how you don't understand that?
               </p>
               <p>
                Asking for evidence doesn't make you a shill- stating claims without any evidence and acting weird and nasty when someone asks for it is more shill-like behaviour. Of course those of us who want all this to be exposed and for justice to be done want everything to be evidenced and done properly -  otherwise the investigation loses credibility and is more likely to fail. So why is it that you aren't concerned with evidence?

            Ah that happened to me before, you gotta make an account to upload an album, otherwise it'll just show the first pic you uploaded and leave the rest.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wait, but all the "full reports" everyone is uploading only shows the Table of Contents. This is really suss,
           </p>

            Well I managed to find it on Google anyway, so that's ok. But why isn't on the University website?

               Ted Gunderson, ex F.B.I. bureau chief for Los Angeles told me about Kenneth Lanning back in 1996. He specifically cited Lanning as dis-info. There, need more proof? How about the only 2 sources that are used to testify against the existence of ritual Abuse are Lanning's report and The False Memory Syndrome Foundation.

              Some sure, but also only some dems.  The Clintons are a criminal gang.  All politicians might be in some gang but they all are definately not a part of the same gang.  Clinton's gang is very specific to human trafficing and some republican might be helping some small business embezzle money in his own gang.
             </p>
             <p>
              Sometimes a republican ends up in a pedo gang but I do think it is a different group within the same industry.  Clinton's group is too tight knit to let everyone in.

             <p>
              No one has implicated Bernie in this specific pizzagate issue.   Not everyone is in it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Politicians are criminals in general but I don't think there has been any as dangerous or disgusting as Clinton.  Do we have any example of an elected or appointed official using war as a cover for human trafficing, the way it is suspected in Libya and Syria?  I've never even heard even an implication for anyone else in all the corrupt mistakes we've seen in the past.  Hillary is an angel of death while others are just corrupt people sometimes with sick flaws and can sometimes make poor calculations about the value of human life.  Hillary is a step above.  There's no case for even Franklin using war or selling stolen body parts like there is a case for Hillary.  This Clinton - Podesta - Blumenthal group is hell on Earth.

               Oh yeah I completely agree they are hell on earth and the most despicable inhuman monsters that have ever lived. But I suspect that the tendrils of their evil reach far and wide among political elites. I believe that UK politicians (not all of them) are very much involved in this kind of thing. I expect that the Bush family are very connected into it as well - the Bushes and Clintons seem to get on well and set up all kinds of foundations and initiatives together. I suspect that there is a group of disgustingly evil people that have infiltrated many parts of government at all levels in many countries, and those people will make sure they have some of their number on both sides of the political spectrum. And high up in corporations, too. We can't forget about the corporations, who are engaged with government in a back-scratching exercise that leaves the rest of us covered in their filthy poisonous diseased skin flakes.
              </p>
              <p>
               But of course not everyone is part of it even at high levels, although I suspect many know about it or suspect, but are too frightened to do anything about it, or just pretend to themselves that they don't know. I think most of the media probably just don't believe it and that's why they report as they do, not that it's a big deliberate cover up - these journalists these days are all in their jobs due to nepotism and being lazy and not employed for things like journalistic integrity or investigative skills. They are in a big bubble in which they truly believe that PG is just a bunch of crazy racist fascist alt-right nut jobs. I was in that bubble for a bit, but I love finding out why other people think differently than I do, so that's how I discovered that it was all true. These people don't delve into anything or see for themselves, they just believe whatever some colleague they think has cool hair told them.

             To be fair, it might be better than the kid having no abortions and 7 children. Or doing the abortions with a coat hanger. I do think the doctors should should keep an eye open for abuse though.

              But why those specific policies?  A 16 year old can't attend a history class without their being some record of it.  If any aspect of the policy were adjusted in any dimension it would have a substancial impact on human trafficing but now the law facilitates them to that industries exact need.
             </p>
             <p>
              Also in terms of the sanctity of life I disagree.  I'm not saying that to start a different discussion but I just have to be open on where I stand.  But don't you think that the expectation that abortions being anonymous even from police is a little extreme to claim as a rights issue when the same party says you can't have a soda of a certain size and is all for tracking other people?

              This is just a matter of compiling information that has investigative utility.  Payment could be a data point.  The person going in could be a data point.

               lol if it did have any malware in it, sure as hell any software you download won't be able to detect it. If these guys can mass sensor pizzagate from all blocks of the internet than I wouldn't put it past them to have undetectable malware.
