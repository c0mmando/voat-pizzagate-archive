A few voaters are in the early phases of beginning a consolidation process. This post is a suggestion for approaching the consolidation of the IT and IS posts of our knowledge base in order to improve our understanding of the current technological and organisational systems in place for tackling crimes related to children.</em></p>
<p>As an example, THORN has recently been in the news with its announcement that it is currently developing an AI system in partnership with other private tech companies to ‘help’ government organisations. [Voat threads: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1651918;">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1651918;</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1651544">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1651544</a>].  Another example is the role that the private company NCME plays as an information clearing house. [<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1439876;">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1439876;</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1512525;">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1512525;</a> <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1667307">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1667307</a>]. We have several posts here already raising concerns within these areas. I have been looking at the technology ecosystems from which some of these new ventures are emerging, and many here on voat are concerned by the connections that some of these corporations and private companies have within the chain of government organisations and departments. The public is largely unaware when there are conflicts of interest, or business partnerships. We have a lot of information here that they need to know. So, I’m suggesting a couple of conventions to be used in technology related posts which can also quickly galvanize the people within this community who are particularly interested in and/or knowledgeable in this area.</p>
<p><strong>AIMS</strong> of this taskforce:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Provide a more focused ‘water cooler effect’ within the pizzagate subverse for an IT systems examination</li>
<li>
To map the technological infrastructure of the CP reporting system</li>
<li>
Map partnerships of external organisations with the tech system</li>
<li>
Identify weaknesses within the current system</li>
<li>
Call for more transparency within the system</li>
<li>
Develop easily understandable infographics to PUSH to pizzagate activists on other platforms such as Twitter, Youtube, alt websites, etc</li>
<li>
Build stronger connections with activists on other platforms to facilitate the pushing of information</li>
</ul>

<p>As we have so many posts here on voat on a daily basis, I am suggesting a couple of conventions for interested parties and contributors to use in order for the relevant posts to get to the people who need to see them.</p>

<li>
<p>Use the tag <strong>TechNews</strong> in the body or subject title of the post (makes searching for posts easy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have started compiling technology and systems related posts in ‘pizzagatewhatever’ to be used as a reference source. I will reorganize it when it is more complete. But for now, it can be found here: <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1667157">https://voat.co/v/pizzagatewhatever/1667157</a> . Please feel free to add other posts that I will have missed in the comments section and I will update the list as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have quickly compiled a list (incomplete I’m sure) of user handles of people who have posted and commented in the past within this subject area, and added at the end of this message as a subscription list. If we do this as a convention, then this obviously ensures that interested parties do not miss a post.</p>

            cantsleepawink, I just saw this great post of yours thanks to derram, and want to say that your ability and will to leverage the system are impressive. I agree 1000% with the approach you are taking and will support in any way I can. I admire the creative ways you've come up with to communicate within the Voat Labyrinth. :-)  It pains me that moderators may be hindering efforts; that is not our intent at all.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the problems we have had with moderating
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            is that most of the really sharp folks who are the most knowledgeable and the most keen investigators whom we have invited to mod, turn us down. Many others have responded to removals in ways that makes it impossible to tell who can be trusted to invite to mod, especially after the numbcuck fiasco. Several of us modding now have been doing so daily for months, and like cops and EMTs, we don't primarily spend time with the responsible, hardworking, successful members of the community. Our majority exposure is to noobs, shills, trolls and oppositional users who can't be bothered with the submission guidelines. It can be VERY hard to sort out who we are dealing with, all we basically have is the submission guidelines and how folks respond to being asked to uphold them. The unfortunate byproduct is mods who aren't in tune with all the research, the majority of whose interactions are with toxic users, trying to vet scores of posts daily, often amongst a barrage of deliberate forum-sliding shitposts, which lead to dozens of modmail reports and inbox pings that the board is going to shit and we aren't doing our jobs. Serious users posting lesser-known developments of ongoing research who don't spell out the connection to PG are not necessarily going to be distinguishable to mods. And so here we are.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, all that said, I am very interested in making sure there is a home for the research of citizen investigators, in spreading our most powerful evidence beyond Voat, and helping people collaborate. It's why I said yes to the invitation to mod and why I come back night after night to man the barricades. Please let me know if there is something I can do to improve things or help.

             Thank you for the very thoughtful comment.  I've been away from voat for a few days because I needed to take a break to restore my batteries and attend to my own life which was starting to fall apart due to my obsession here :)  I'll definitely let you know if I think of anything.  Nice to know that a moderator is backing us. :)

Also, please let me know of any users you feel would make good mods; as this forum continues to grow (we've added another couple thousand users over the past few weeks), and as the investigation gains traction and stirs up the shills, we need knowledgable, discerning mods to man the oars, especially at night. Keep up the great work!

            I'm not very tech saavy and a lot of this went over my head (lol), but I would love to help in any way that I can. I have been working on compiling and archiving all Pizzagate links I can find (see my post here

            although I have more than double now what I had then, just have not posted it yet), so if that could be of any use as well, please let me know.

             What puzzles me if some old flasher in a mac can go on the internet and find child porn, rent or buy infants or toddlers for an hour [or whatever], pay for them to be raped over Skype [Philippines get a bad rap for this] how cannot the brains trust of the internet - some hanging here - hunt them down and lock them up?  Or at least report them to the authorities?  On the face if it, it seems so simple.

             I have heard no more from the dark net data dump a couple of weeks ago, where several potential perps were identified by name.

             Great to have you on board.  We need people with all ranges of skills.  Most importantly, people willing to participate actively and constructively.  I just started with the area of technology because I know a bit about it and I've noticed that despite the range of talent in voat, we do not compile our work and drill down enough.  Sometimes valuable posts don't get upvoated enough if they become technical.  Yet these posts are critical too.  I intend to start putting a sort of weekly taskforce newsletter together soon, summarising new information as it becomes available.  I'll add you to the subscription list.

            Yes. Yes yes yes. 100%. I'm in, let me know how I can help. I'm working on a massive collection of Pizzagate links (I posted a "this is what I have so far" text file:

            By the way, some entity going (even physically) dark with site-wide archives (as many vetted sources as possible so important parts of Reddit, most of Voat, 4chan, 8ch, steemit, etc.) until desperately needed or until this is as over as it can get would be an invaluable asset.
           </p>

            Maybe there's been other parties to suggest and follow through with this, but hell, the more the merrier.

            Is there a process by which the considered candidates will be vetted?

            I'm also concerned about insiders. Voat's gotten a bit of attention lately.

             Yes. But I can't say more than that.  Atm it is open to everyone.  Obviously we don't want timewasters.  And everyone has to be aware that this is a public forum and take that into consideration.  All we are really doing is streamlining and concentrating certain information channels that already exist within the subverse.  And hopefully attract high quality investigation and analysis.  I'm thinking of also getting a system going whereby, every day the relevant posts are collated and turned into a single post/newsletter for subscribers and then a weekly summation of the important findings. This can be archived and used as a resource and also pushed out to other pizzagters on other platforms.

              Good. Don't reveal the vetting process and mix up certain facets of the process with each new individual if at all possible.

               This aspect is discussed extensively in lots of posts within the pizzagate subverse.  Indeed it is one of the areas most frequently discussed, to greater and lesser degrees of success, across the internet.  The taskforce I am envisaging is specific to technology and business organisation, and therefore, also encompassing politics and finance.  That is, the drier but more technical aspects of this issue.  It is also the more neglected.  I hear what you are saying but this taskforce has a particular focus.  And, that focus will target the material world. Cold, undeniable factual information.

            All your VOAT links have semi-colons which make the links not work.   If you would like to check them out and edit the ;s out the links will work.

            Please add link for "we need to mainstream pizzagate now" if you have it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stand your system by, just in case the pizzagate caravan has to move on from voat.  There has been some negative posting about Peter(?) Thiel, who I gather owns voat and can presumably identify a poster's computer ip number and location - can they (you) do this to a street number or just a city?
           </p>
           <p>
            If we all moved to your platform, then you could do this too.  You sound like a white hat, but white hats [Syria] are not necessarily the good guys.  The whole "fake news" syndrome.  Nothing is what it seems any more - perhaps never was!
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't fancy being targeted for a FEMA camp or worse.
           </p>
           <p>
            You sound like a good guy, but your equipment sounds like something the alphabet agencies would have - or would love to have if they don't already.
           </p>
           <p>
            "I could support all of this and wrote aboutit all two weeks ago,"  Do you have a link to that post, perchance?
           </p>
           <p>
            Can your system just crawl the pizzagate board and analyse the information here and links to off-board web pages that are cited in threads?
           </p>
           <p>
            Only today, I was contemplating how an investment bank full of employees, all reading company reports, looking at screens, watercoolering etc. crunches and communicates all that information into a "best investment."
           </p>
           <p>
            Apparently there are computers that "read" the news wires, company reports, watch all trades made on all the exchanges - real time - and instantly trade.  Occasionally they cause a market crash in a sort of feedback loop.
           </p>
           <p>
            If you can do it, just do!  Post your results.  Pick up the ball and run with it.  We're all cheering you on - at least most of us!

            Added.  Interesting.  Several people have said that they posted similar comments.  This post too was originally deleted but because I've added pizzagate suvbverse links within my post, I was able to get round the meta post Rule.  I've also posted to pizzagatewhatever, though it has far lower subscription. Anyway, it's obvious that it's time for us to move into another phase. Many people feel the way you do.  I agree that compartmentalization is what we want to avoid and that is why I came up with the posting conventions of tagging and a subscription list at the bottom.  This allows the post to be available to the entire subverse  while targeting interested parties at the same time. I agree that we need a plethora of different skills and already I'm getting input from people across the board in terms of skill range.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just read your  WE NEED TO MAINSTREAM PIZZAGATE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE post and I agree with everything you wrote.  Even though I'm subscribed to that subverse I didn't see it.  Even though I'm on voat for far too many hours every day, I missed it.  And today, I decided to find a solution to make your type of posts more efficient.  I can't continue to spend the hours on here that I have so, I now want to work smart. Your post highlights the fcat that we need rebranding in a sense..and I agree that's why I wrote about a Taskforce. Seeing it as a node within the pizzagate discourse.  I am sure we have many talented desktop designers and other more media oriented people here for public shoots.  Hell, I even love to do that stuff myself.  But my priority is to help to develop a more cohesive horizontal structure within this crowdsourced environment.  Much more to come.  We need people like you.  As a diverse group we can develop a multi-pronged approach. Many strategies...many levels...more to come.  In the meantime, use the subscription list I've started.

             Count me in please!! We definitely need a site that doesn't delete our valuable research. This place has discouraged investigators to research.  People are saying, "Why bother, it will just be deleted." Even these mods have recently said the research has dropped off significantly. I like the idea of UmmWTF has graciously offered to do for us. This is the shot in the arm we need to take us to the next level.

              It is not deleted, but becomes pretty invisible.  It can be found in Moderation logs - submissions deleted at the bottom of the column on the RHS.  I must say I find the mods on

              perverse, but I think they are attempting to maintain some order in a torrent of information.  I feel they should just leave it to the upvotes, myself.

              But I am getting bogged down in process.  The goal is to stop what I believe is horrific abuse, particularly of infants and children.  And public awareness and outrage would seem to be key.  I haven't emailed my congressman yet.  Perhaps I should.
