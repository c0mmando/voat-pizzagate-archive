<p>After reviewing the many threads that emanate from the Strongsville FBI raid on the European Adoption Consultants agency in February, I think it\'s safe to conclude that this incident was hopefully an enormous blow to the child trafficking network in America. If you browse through the VOAT threads you will see there are links from it to the Clinton Foundation, to Russia, to SEIU, to the LGBT community, and to the vast Les Wexner conglomerate in the Columbus area. </p>
<p>There is also a possible link to the use of subterranean transit and international smuggling operations in other cities such as the Brooklyn Heights area near the Clinton for America HQ which is within throwing distance of an EAC office and a foster care center, on Joralemon St., located directly above a system of subway tunnels with direct access to piers which are international shipping terminals.</p>
<p>Another implication we can draw from this ongoing federal investigation into the Strongsvilled EAC office: <strong>Research into other EAC offices is highly recommended!</strong></p>
<p>When one peruses the historical  background fact on Strongsville, OH, some fascinating facts emerge:</p>
<p>Strongville was once nicknamed &quot;The Crossroads of the Nation&quot; because of the railroad lines that intersected there. It was also a prominent stop for fugitive slaves along the secret Underground Railroad in antebellum times. </p>
<p>Could it be Strongsville, OH, is the focus of so much attention by the Trump Administration because it was the nerve center of a modern-day child-trafficking/smuggling/slavery Underground Railroad?</p>',

            I was angry at my Church for quite some time and still am, and did not pray too often.  I am back to it now, knowing who the real Criminals are. I stand in front of her every day and pray in Spanish (I am not Hispanic but love the language).  I can say the Hail Mary in Spanish, English and French and German. She understands all of them.  Do you not think that with our help and hers that we will be victorious?   I very much do.

            Thank you. I know we have suspected them in other things, but this is shocking to me.  But not surprising.  They will stoop to anything to make money.  Evil Devils Work is what this is.  I am going to pray harder.  I hate my Church but I love God. I will pray to Mary on this one, the Mother of Jesus.  She will not like what they have done.We must ask for help as we work to take these Criminals down.

            You mention Lex Wexner, who was born, raised and schooled in Ohio and is Ohio's wealthiest citizen having started The Limited clothing company and later owned Victoria's Secret.  At one time, Jeffrey Epstein managed his finances and it was believed that Wexner was Epstein's only client. According to Wikipedia, Wexner broke off his relationship with Epstein as a result of Epstein' s  sex scandal, which begs the question: How is Epstein making his money now?

             I met Leslie Wexner at a Victoria's Secret while working there. He seemed very personable.  He at the time was building his huge home in Ohio and they said it had a dining room that could be made to go up and down like an elevator.  That means the whole floor.  Imagine the wealth of this man.  I also read in an article that Epstein bought his huge NY City mansion form Wexner for $1.  I am sure that Wexner and Margaret Cole  of the EAC have met at some point.  These evil doers all work hand in hand to keep their well oiled machines in working order.  We know she had ties to the CF and Hillary.

            Bilateral adoption agreement by HRC 2012:

            previous Hague Adoption Convention (major differences with agencies allowed to participate):

             https://travel.state.gov/content/adoptionsabroad/en/hague-convention/understanding-the-hague-convention.html
            </a>
            I also found a comparison sheet that points out the differences between the two adoption agreements. The one HRC did takes away much of the regulation.
