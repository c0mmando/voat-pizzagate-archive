            I doubt it. His history shows that Alias was never one to dabble in the pizzagate stuff.

            If my memory serves me correctly, I thought someone had posted on here that a big donor of  Clinton owned Bethlehem Steel, also shipping connections were involved in that post. Could be worth taking another look at.
