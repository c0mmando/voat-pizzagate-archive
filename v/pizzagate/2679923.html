<p>&quot;Arthur J. and The Gold Cups was named after two Hollywood coffee shops that catered to gays; Arthur J.\'s was on the corner of Santa Monica and Highland - it\'s now a strip mall. The Gold Cup was on the corner of Hollywood and Las Palmas and it\'s now a trendy tourist trap tattoo parlor. Both establishments provided late night hustlers and Quaaludes.</p>
<p>One block away from the The Gold Cup was a tiny alley off Cherokee Avenue with a huge steel doorway that took you down to a basement that held several rehearsal rooms; a long, cavernous room with a stage; and tons more space for anyone to do whatever they liked. This was The Masque, leased and operated by Brendan Mullen, founder and drummer of Arthur J. and The Gold Cups.&quot;</p>
<p>On this website it says Arthur J was a &quot;big chicken hawk hangout&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Depending on who you talk to this was a pioneering &quot;punk rock big band&quot; who was 20 years ahead of its time or a “godawful” absurdist joke. Name came from an amalgam of infamous local haunts for male hustlers: Arthur J.’s was a “big chicken hawk hangout” on the corner of Highland and Santa Monica Boulevard; The Gold Cup was “a sleazy coffee shop” located on Hollywood Boulevard and Las Palmas near the punk club THE MASQUE and its attendant squatter’s tenement THE CANTERBURY and was the subject of the scum-punk song “Trouble at the Cup” by DANGERHOUSE RECORDS chairman Black Randy. Considered by some to be the house band for The Masque, as it first emerged out of jam sessions at the club.&quot;</p>
<p>A new Arthur J opened up in Manhattan Beach, California in 2015.</p>

<p>The man who founded the restaurants, Arthur J catered to elites and worked for MGM Studios. From The Arthur J steakhouse Manhattan Beach website.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thearthurj.com/">http://www.thearthurj.com/</a></p>
<p>&quot;A product of the Great Depression and a Bombardier and navigator during World War II, Arthur J had an insatiable appetite for living each day with gusto. Armed with a big personality and a penchant for risky endeavors, Arthur J (as everyone, including his children and grandchildren called him) was introduced to the restaurant business through his father-in-law’s coffee shops in Chicago upon his return from military service.</p>
<p>He moved his family to Los Angeles in 1948 and quickly landed a position running the commissary at MGM Studios, where his infectious zeal was enjoyed by the elite Hollywood clientele. Hooked on providing hospitality, Arthur J opened the first (of what would be many) Ben Frank’s coffee shops in 1952, on the Sunset Strip.</p>
<p>In 1974, now joined by his son Tom, The French Quarter in West Hollywood and The Kettle in Manhattan Beach were launched, before founding the first Mimi’s Café in Anaheim in 1978. Now thirty-seven years later, Arthur J’s two younger sons, and his grandchildren carry on the family business of legendary hospitality, expressed most recently through this namesake dining room in the community where he planted roots.&quot;</p>
<p>Let this be proof. No matter how crazy they tell us we are or lie to us, we know many businesses have been front\'s by pedophiles for children to be prostituted and used to make CP. This is the icing the cake and proof from the past.</p>

            The symbols are everywhere... the terms CP and KP as well as all the code words, I think that people intentionally use them in screenplays and celebrity pseudonyms. And it's true that restaurants are often fronts... There are people in my town who work at a pizza place who are registered sex offender baby rapists and they all seem to know each other. It's like they know where to get hired and they are buddies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Katy Perry = KP = kiddie porn
Comet Ping Pong = CP / Comet Pizza = CP = Child Porn
etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was watching Supernatural (season 6 I believe) and they showed a bunch of victims who were all around age 17, Dean said "They're cute" and Sam gave him a look like he's a perv, Dean said "Ice cream comes in all different flavors"
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, in the AG system if you have been divorced with children, you'll note that the custodial parent is the CP.
           </p>
           <p>
            Personally I'd like to ban those initials from use on any type of legal designation.

             Thank's for finding that. Tom J. Lefevre owes me, and lot's of other people money in Sarasota from his failed Bob's Boathouse on Phillippi creek and US 41. He said his other seafood restaurant was in Michigan, but then again he is quite the liar.

               Not so sure about getting the money back without a beating stick in hand, and no one looking, but I am starting to wonder about the relationship with the Simms. Could they be the grandchildren? J as middle name, all into restaurants. Tom had a backroom in the restaurant built with bunkbeds and a shower in Sarasota. He said it was for when he had his sons there, and to manage the place when he was in town and not pay hotel fees. He paid $77,000  in late utility fees to try to keep the place afloat. Also interesting is that the manhattan beach AJ started right after the collapse of the housing market when most restaurants were having extreme problems, or closing. From Madison, Wisconsin, two Asians working there as well. Something is up with this crowd. How does one go from busboy to running the show in two years? Neat trick.

                Do you mean the LeFevres could be Simms' grandchildren?  Hard to say.  Don't even know whether Tom is related to David LeFevre, the Simms' partner.

                 Thanks again, and I wish I had a way to archive this for later. Although he is indeed a liar, he was telling the truth about his restaurant in Mi. The main one is right next to a Air force Golf Club.         He has Canadian contacts ... I just know it! The menu corroborates my theory too. Every location in Sarasota had multiple exit plans. The one right next to the marina is most suspect.  The other one that is literally right up the street from the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House got me thinking that this has been going on for a while now

                  I forgot to add that you have to pass the Clinton River to get to the Airport next to the restaurant. William Jefferson Clinton (born William Jefferson Blythe III;) sounds like the road to both places, Because you have to go down Jefferson Road to get there. Blythe is s Sheffield English name and has many Canadian infiltrators of the Crown living up there. I am not sure that Bill Clinton is who he say's he is anymore than bath house Barry at this point. I never checked, and I am not sure anyone else did either!

             I know they are raped. It is prostituting them though, these children are sold for profit. That does not mean it is not child rape it means the people are selling them. I know my language.

              Some were willing. Or rather, some wanted to make money for rent, drugs, instruments, shows, etc. Many were runaways from abusive homes, or kicked out for being gay.

              Both Lexicon Devil and We Got the Neutron Bomb have interviews with them (both books are oral histories). They considered it just a part of their lives.

              I'm NOT saying that it was okay or acceptable, only that people did things like that back in the 70s and early 80s. They preferred servicing a couple of Johns to getting a "straight" job.

              The 70s and early 80s were a very weird time.

            This has me thinking... A LOT of celebrities have restaurants... DeNiro has "Nobu"... Justin Timberlake and "Southern Hospitality", Jennifer Lopez... I mean there are so many. I just googled and pulled an article, Jay Z owns a restaurant... so many others. A restaurant is not an easy business to run. Very easy for employees to steal etc. Not saying all are nefarious, but something to think about...
