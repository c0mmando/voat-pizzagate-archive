<p>Short version from August 28 2017 article: <strong>Lawyers for two of Epstein\'s  underage sex victims have lodged &quot;final written pleas aimed at spurring US District Judge Kenneth Marra to force federal officials to reopen their investigation.&quot;</strong> The basis of the women\'s argument for re-opening the federal investigation of Epstein,  <strong>is that  &quot;...U.S. prosecutors violated the federal Crime Victims’ Rights Act by failing to alert Epstein’s victims of the terms of what some describe as a “sweetheart deal” before the deal was put into action.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>We know that Jeff Epstein\'s plea deal got him a ridiculously lenient sentence, he was literally allowed to leave jail during the day to go to work, and only had to spend the night in jail. My guess is, the prosecutors in the Epstein case didn\'t tell Epstein\'s victims that he would be allowed out in public, or where he would be during the day, which is legally required federally per the Crime Victims\' Rights Act.</p>
<p>With this development, there could be a real legal case for getting the whole Epstein pedophile case once again re-opened to federal investigators. Who knows what other powerful figures could get implicated (Bill Clinton at the top of the list), if this case is actually opened to a serious investigation?</p>
<p><strong>The August 28 article says the government prosecutors are scheduled to defend themselves (and try to stop the case from being re-opened) at a hearing this past September, and Federal Judge Kenneth Marra could make a decision whether or not to re-open the case &quot;as early as the fall.&quot; So I searched for any follow-up articles, this being October, and I haven\'t found anything about the September hearing or whether or not Judge Marra has made a decision to re-open the Epstein case.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyone able to find any updates??</strong> I think this a very important case to keep track of in this community, the implications of re-opening the Jeff Epstein case could be huge, potentially connecting directly to Pizzagate or any number of Pedogate scandals involving child sex trafficking by the elite. Thanks everyone.</p>',

            You know I thought I saw Jeffrey Epstein get out of a Taxi last night?
           </p>
           <p>
            How tall is he?  this guy was probaby 5'9"
           </p>
           <p>
            Conincidentally enough, a vendor had taken the team out to dinner, so it was just after I ate at a high-end pizza place.
