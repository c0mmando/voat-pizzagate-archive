<p>Dear people wanting Pizzagate to fade away into the darkness:</p>
<p>Why do you never address the super creepy instragram pictures James Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong Pizza, and one of the 50 most influential people in DC posted? Seriously, if you\'d just respond about them (beyond Ben Swann\'s &quot;we can\'t even show them on TV&quot; comment) you\'d be taking a lot of the citizen investigators fuel away from them. But you never do. Why is that? Is it because associating anal sex with an infant makes the needle on the creep-o-meter go all wonky?</p>

<p>Please, mainstream media, answer the questions we investigators have when it comes to the instagram. Or keep quiet, give us fodder for discussion with family and friends, and make your asses look like useless tools because we see the propaganda playing out. Your choice.</p>
<p>I am going to send this post\'s link to every piece of shit talking head that glosses over the icky bits to say, &quot;Thinking Alefantis is creepy is just in your peasant heads&quot;.... meanwhile, we look at these pictures and know something is rotten in the United States. Normal adults don\'t joke about kids and sex. Especially on a regular basis, while Alefantis and crew... well, let\'s just say they\'ve earned a massive side-eye from a bigger chunk of America than you think.</p>
<p>Time to face facts; we knew the Russia bullshit was just that; and mainstream media finally admitted it was all for ratings. That same persistence and disbelief at the &quot;official narrative&quot; will reign supreme again. And again, you talking heads will look like lying sacks of excrement in human form, publicly, for all the world to see. You assholes make America a laughingstock.</p>
<p>It\'s disgusting how people will ignore child abuse (or potential child abuse) to protect adults. It\'s sickening how the American Government has exploited people for sexual and financial purposes. This has been amply documented, yet again, the media fails to do it\'s duty and inform America with the same vigor they had for both Trump pre-election and Russia post-election.</p>
