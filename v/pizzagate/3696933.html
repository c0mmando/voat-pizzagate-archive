<p>A pastebin of videos, tweets and reaction to todays releases: <a href="https://pastebin.com/b6BhMHgc">https://pastebin.com/b6BhMHgc</a></p>
<p>Edit 1: Corey has advised that the stream has been delayed by hackers, but expects this stream to still go ahead.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Seems like he\'s given up on the release today, blaming this on hackers who \'don\'t want the truth to get out\'. I\'d take this with a grain of salt as he\'ll likely be happy with the extra publicity/buys this will bring. The idea is that there will be another livestream tomorrow. Of note, around 15 minutes of the beginning of the documentary has been released on some peoples accounts (twitter is a good place to look). He told the crowd that he wasn\'t going to play the whole thing out of respect for the rest of the world who paid and wouldn\'t get to see it today.</p>
<p>Edit 3: The 15 minutes in question begins with the phonecall Corey Haim\'s mother made to 911. A discussion by people that knew Corey and his problems with drug abuse and the problems they had together filming for their reality tv show, \'The Two Coreys\'. The movie title screen shows, and then we see Haims gravestone, and then a discussion about both Corey\'s working with a movie producer. A big red banner interrupts saying \'Second Worldwide Event Screening\' and this is as far as we got. No names, no information of anything new.</p>
<p>Edit 4: This will be my final edit for the day. A former colleague of Feldman has noted some of the names that will be pointed out include a few Hoffmans, a Weiss, and supposedly Charlie Sheen is meant to be implicated. This is all conjecture but she has what seems like an encyclopedic understanding of Feldman and she considers him a con artist who uses people. She has a youtube channel, and her more relevant interview was done four days ago: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ2Z9YbTc_M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ2Z9YbTc_M</a></p>',

            Everyone knows Corey Feldman is Gloria Allred's pet at this point. He doesn't dare address the real pedos like Steven Spielberg. Corey was bought off, nothing of real consequence will be said by Sellout Feldman.

            Look, if Corey Feldman was going to do something to jeapordise these people he'd have been bumped off already. He's one of them and is a tool of them.

            Getting people to pay for this effort is all about control and turning people into consumerist trash. They are highly intelligent people who know you more than you know yourself and are masters in the art of manipulating the public and mass mind control.

            . Thanks for the post. Could you check out our submission rules, and add a link to Feldman's page, or a previous Voat submission about this? We require at least one supporting link in ever submission. I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace Flair, so you can edit. Thanks.

              You had the same opportunity to provide supporting links. Other users provided many and you
              <em>
               refused
              </em>
              to edit them in. Unlike the OP here, who did take the small amount of effort require to do so.

              Your pathetic narrative is completely inconsequential. Go cry to SBBH/PV.

               No, you didn't. You made a deliberately rule-breaking post and refused to make even the tiniest effort to include supporting links - of which many were provided by both myself and a suspected ESOTERICshade alt.

                   No, it's a garbage narrative cooked up by degenerates you follow like a good little sheep. Further to that point, you're repetition of words like "schlomo" just bolsters the point that you're an unoriginal twat. You have no sway here, especially when you rely on brainless vernacular like that.

                      I battle them. Like every other legit user. Funny how you don't seem to have a problem with having one(the one) being a mod here. Funny indeed.

                       You're so full of shit, it's laughable. It is quite demonstrable that no mod here has an allegiance to SBBH, whereas the same cannot be said for you at all. You push their narratives like, again, a good little sheep.

                      <p>
                       You refuse to follow the most basi rules of the subverse even when others, including your own cohorts, provide assistance. Instead you choose to bitch at the moderator who gave you more than 24 hrs (contrary to the flair) to rectify the misgivings of your post.

                      <p>
                       You are only here to stir shit and, again, anyone with two brain cells to rub together can see that. Your presence here is worth less than a shit stain in a public toilet bowl.

                          A week ago I couldn't have cared less about what you kid diddlers did here. Now I know your are just another SBBH controlled sub. No a smart move on your part. I know you tards get nervous when I start poking around with a user or sub that I think is bogus, but you could try to hide it better.

                            alt? Why is it being left alone? No 24hr flair, no demands for links...nothing to see there either, right?

                           as another SBBH alt deliberately breaking subverse rules. I'd hazard a guess it slipped past the mods given the amount of shit going on elsewhere.

                                Yeah, I found a secret ban page you can only access by [REDACTED].  He's on that page.  That's why he can't post to SBBH anymore.

                                 I used to think you were amusing and maybe, just maybe, not part of malicious elements of SBBH, gabara. But it's clear now, if not earlier, that I was wrong. Kindly fuck off and never contact me again.

                                     That has already been shot down as a gross misrepresentation. Deliberate at this point, given your sheer ignorance as to the definition/access of a moderator. Keep trying to sell that one, though.

             Yeah this is like that whole thing a few months back where someone had evidence of a major conspiracy but they were
             <s>
              holding out for someone to pay them to supress it
             </s>
             giving the conspirators a chance to fess up before they released it for free.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of cpurse no one paid them shit, and the info never came out.... BECAUSE IT WAS A SCAM
