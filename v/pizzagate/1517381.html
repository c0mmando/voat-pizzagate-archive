new leaves bloom, old game rooms, full steam where, nowhere, always there to see, how it all turns out, we\'re going to show for free, from the inside out, every day and everywhere, right now, that was the main street, last years old beat, all to new best freinds, we stop growing, never knowing, when papa says (SHANELLE), all is here to see,

<p>I can\'t make out the background vocals at the end of the song. Any help?

I\'ll be posting lyrics to some of their other songs soon. The key to hearing the words of their lyrics is given in the song (small headphones, let\'s slow tunes).

            played slow tunes

            "Chanel" which is a widely known brand, may actually be a key word or access key. Difficult to say without having anything to try it against.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr Watcher may be a dark-web voyeur site, with pedo flavored "doctor" videos or some shit like that. Who knows. But if you were going to hide a key, then you'd hide it somewhere obvious, and you seem to have keyed in on that word (chanel) naturally, so that's a clue. "Papa says" may also be a code, like "Simon says...", with whatever following being the code or access word.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good work, now perhaps someone needs to "suit up" and dive the dark web and find this shit. SAFELY.

             Epstein seemed to specialize in young teens - these freaks would be dealing in pre-teens, toddlers and infants, imho - which makes them "extra sick" and pegging the paedo-meter at a solid 12 (on a scale of 10)...
