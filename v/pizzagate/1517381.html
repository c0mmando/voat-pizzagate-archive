            "Chanel" which is a widely known brand, may actually be a key word or access key. Difficult to say without having anything to try it against.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dr Watcher may be a dark-web voyeur site, with pedo flavored "doctor" videos or some shit like that. Who knows. But if you were going to hide a key, then you'd hide it somewhere obvious, and you seem to have keyed in on that word (chanel) naturally, so that's a clue. "Papa says" may also be a code, like "Simon says...", with whatever following being the code or access word.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good work, now perhaps someone needs to "suit up" and dive the dark web and find this shit. SAFELY.
