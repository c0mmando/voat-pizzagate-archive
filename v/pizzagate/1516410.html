            Per the article it seems they are complaining about two different things.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first being complaining about having their artwork and everything they put on the internet being analyzed by other people, which is a pretty ridiculous complaint, all things considered in this specific scenario, especially.
           </p>
           <p>
            The second being complaining about alleged threats being received, which is a separate matter and should be reported to law enforcement.
           </p>
           <p>
            Trying to lump the two together is manipulative at best.
           </p>
           <p>
            People have the right to their opinions and perceptions. Products and businesses and professionals receive reviews online all the time, for all sorts of reasons, ranging from glowing to scathing. These individuals are not special exceptions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Threats of violence are obviously a separate matter. So if certain people are making threats of violence, then they should, again, be dealt with by law enforcement, the same as any other case of people making violent threats.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having a negative opinion of someone and/or their work/business, even if that person is famous or has political connections or whatever, is not the same thing as making threats of violence. These 'artists' probably think themselves clever for trying to imply otherwise.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are rap artists who have received way more flack over their degenerate lyrics glorifying murder, domestic violence and promoting hard drugs, and you don't see those rappers doing interviews bitching and moaning about being targeted by "mob censorship". Good grief.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think that businesses, artists, musicians, etc who use their own symbolism to sexualize children, who 'joke' about child sexual abuse Mr "we all have our preferences" etc are filth. I think the people who support such filth vicariously have very questionable character at best. If they don't like my opinion, well congratulations, we both have the right to our opinions, don't we? Though opinions like mine tend to get
            <em>
             actually
            </em>
            censored online. So what was that about "mob censorship"?

            Ah that will be the angle. He describes it as a far right extremist plot to take away freedom of expression. While simultaneously censoring the right lol classic. Expect more from this angle

            Notice it's linked to as a "queerphobic" movement.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a group, we really need to de-emphasize any homosexual element that may seem to be present because

              It's not going to help stop the culprits or lead any further in the investigation.

            It is, however, going to be continued to be used against this investigation the same way Trump was destroyed by soundbites during the election season.

             I disagree with the idea that the character of the investigation needs to change to pander to the misrepresentations of Pizzagate critics, many of whom seem to be just trying to distract attention from the fact that they are implicated themselves.

             <p>
              And the investigation is not against homosexuals, it's against pedophiles. Attempting to conflate the issue is an obvious shill tactic. Most pedophiles self-identify as hetero, so there is nothing backing up your idea that what I suggested is going to "change the character of our investigation," you fucking shill.

            poor guy is trying to turn pizzagate into homophobia - which is typical CIA disinfo.
           </p>
           <p>
            They LOVE blaming paedophilia on homos, even though well more than 90 percent of paedos SELF-IDENTIFY as "hetero-normative", regardless of the sex of their child victims.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fact. Which is why there is always a huge and HIGHLY VISIBLE CONTINGENT of NAMBLA at all the Pride parades, to publicly shame queers and thus associate homosexuality with paedophilia in the public mind - even though more than a few in the LGBT crowd are definitely, demonstrably, documented VICTIMS of these child-f**king paedo torture-rapists.
           </p>
           <p>
            Pure CIA disinformation. Poor, poor paedo-friendly artist... poor guy. With his decapitated heads an shit. What a cunt. Maybe some day someone will rip a paedo's head off and defacate down their bleeding throat... but until THAT day arrives, we have this paedo-friendly cunt's art to console us.
           </p>
          </p>

            Waaaaa, poor artists.  The comments alone are telling.
I'm beginning to despise modern art.  Yes, let's take a dump on the floor and call it art.

            Another POS playing victim. Creates another mural where the decapitated head of the President-elect is held and scrutinized, but expects no reaction except positive. Isn't that mural threatening? What is the person whose head you symbolically decapitated supposed to think of what he's saying? Isn't he trying to silence that person? Frighten him? Warn him that if he keeps it up, he'll end up figuratively or literally the way he's portrayed? Really, so stupid. It's as absurd as Marina Abramovic whining about the outrage she's incurring.

              Exactly. Let me get out the violins. And let's add in Brock ... another poor innocent victim. He isn't an artist, but my how he's suffered! After all these years of putting out destructive propaganda based on lies to ruin the lives of those targeted as political enemies, and Lord knows what else. My heart bleeds for him.

            The only question that needs to be asked..."WHY AT A PIZZA PLACE FOR CHILDREN"? It's not edgy. I don't have to accept it. Kids don't understand shit like that yet. We better not forget a single one of these pieces of shit when all this goes down. Someone make a list of names.

            "This may not be part of this specific story, but I lost some people in the Ghost Ship fire, people who were very vital to our community here in Olympia, Washington, people who had grown up here who were living in Oakland. So there was this horrible, horrible tragedy, something that is affecting everyone I know. Within a day of that news coming out, I found YouTube videos by two different people that were not only using images of my artwork, but also using images taken from my social media sites of me, of friends, using images from a MySpace account from 2006, so really going back. And these videos were just picking out the most open-to-interpretation images and giving them very specific perspectives, analyzing me for connections to Satanism, which is completely false. "

             So what? According to the left these days, virtually everything is hate speech anyway. To be concerned about such ideas is to risk engaging in self-censorship which can often be as bad as censorship imposed from outside. Let people say and think what they want, right or wrong!

            The Picasso of decapitation bawwwws.  He should thank his lucky stars pizzagate happened as many more thousands of people will pay attention to him which is what he stated he craves.
