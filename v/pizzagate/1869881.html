            This has been posted here before but like so many good threads, is worth the re-post since it's long since buried. I think this is illustrative of pizzagate and probably everything in life. We want to draw lines in the sand and say "this is where evil starts" but reality is more complicated than that. Social morals and norms change over time, place and not just in one direction, they go back and forth. The author points out that at the time of writing, age of consent even within "western" countries varies from 13 to 18. The levels of harm done to kids range from little to none to earth shattering. There is no clear line but a murky slope when it comes to this stuff. My takeaways:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) Russian hackers have (or had) the market cornered where it comes to child porn for profit.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) We likely can't stop them from a tech point of view because they are talented, funded and several steps ahead. Anyone who proposes different is either ignorant or just trying to take rights away. The Playpen bust is a good counterpoint to this reasoning but there will always be some people who make exploitable mistakes.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) Not really from the article but on pedophile forgiveness in society. If a pedo or brownstoned individual want's to come forward or seek help, they simply can not because of the attitudes towards pedophiles. Luis C.K. had a bit on this

             Yes Russia has cornered the market re distribution  but it's my understanding that Americans are manufacturing the product. If I'm wrong let me know,  in fact  I hope I'm wrong, may be the Netherlands holds that distinction.

            This lengthy article definitely worth the read. There is good and bad you can take from it. The author doesn't elaborate on his background that makes him an authority on CP but two facts caught my attention:  the persons victimizing kids featured in CP are almost always the parents, not the sleazy strangers who thereafter engage in CP distribution. If true that demonstrates what we are up against in fighting CP. Another fact is no matter how sexualized a child or teen, they are grossed out by adult sex. They want intimacy with peers, not oldsters. This counters the argument of the pro-pedophelia  advocates that children want and benefit from sexual contact with adults. The tech discussion was over my head, but please read, everyone will gain some knowledge here. Thanks Tadorno.

            The writer is unclear in a difference between unacceptable pedophilia (direct sexual acts or indirect, e.g. supportive acts for harming children or their development) and other forms of pedophilia (e.g. imagination).
           </p>
           <p>
            In its current form, this article is very understanding towards pedophiles in general, looking for answer how they can find a happy life in a society criminalizing them. It could be written by a person having certain level of pedophilia himself, and could be even seen by some readers as such supportive act.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sure, there's a lot to do in the judicial front in several countries. Sure, at some age young people should be allowed to decide on how their body is used, and to what level. Defining this age

            , as it's not a matter of how many years one has lived, but more of when and how one has developed her/his moral ethics. Parenthood plays a remarkable role on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            In overall, worth reading for what thoughts it arises, but I'd say this article is not even indirectly related to pizzagate. It does mention pedophiles in high level positions in the society, so there's a link all right, but the writer doesn't manage to address the issue into any direction. It's more a personal opinion of the writer, a possible pedophile too.

             Yeah I know it's not directly linked to any pizzagate investigation, but it definitely helps in understanding both the mindset of these people and the logistics of their material acquisition and distribution.

            Disturbing views on pedophilia under the section

             Effective prevention measures

            .  Argues for it being a preference and that society should alter its views on pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            In all cases that I know of, pedophiles have been created either by a dysfunctional upbringing or by early abuse.  Acceptance of pedophilia is not an option.  Stopping the culture that creates and even rewards pedophiles is what we we need to do.
