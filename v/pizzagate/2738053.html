Agent for 25 years, specializing in child actors. Judith’s mood started to change around the time Jaws the Revenge was finished. The audition where Judith’s breakdown occurred was in May 1988. Conflicting accounts regarding how the social worker case turned out. Sandra Palmer was the detective investigating the case. Hansen is the central commonality of each claim in the official narrative. I suspect that she is the root cause of the murder suicide narrative, likely lying to Detective Palmer.</p>

<p>Updated Working Theory:</p>
<p>-1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith\'s mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao</p>
<p>-2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Michael Caine, Joseph Sargent, Judith\'s mother (accomplice). Witness: Lorraine Gary. Person of Interest: Adria Later</p>
<p>-The Murder (my theory has changed here): Suspects: Steven Spielberg (orders), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. &quot;The most effective lies are based off a truth.&quot; The perfect patsy is someone that is already suspect and who\'s character one would expect to pull off the crime. I suspect between 3 and 4 assailants.
Motive: I suspect it was because whatever programing Pedowood does via sexual abuse didn\'t take (her heart was too strong). Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public\'s emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was beloved by the country as a whole). She also would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of lose ends to cover pedowood\'s tracks had a part in the motive.</p>
<p>Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen.</p>
<p>Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a hysterical breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (25 year talent agent) likely warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The well known abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down:</p>
<p>The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match &quot;Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the &quot;murder suicide&quot; angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith\'s was on top (which would make the &quot;murder suicide angle&quot; IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative.</p>
<p>Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a &quot;Ryuguu Gas Bomb&quot;. What this basically is is that it\'s an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up.
Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi.

           Updated Working Theory:
          </p>
          <p>
           -1st incident: Twilight Zone (TV Series) Suspects: Steven Spielberg. Judith's mother (accomplice). Witness: Clare Torao
          </p>
          <p>
           -2nd Incident: Jaws the Revenge. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Michael Caine, Joseph Sargent, Judith's mother (accomplice). Witness: Lorraine Gary. Person of Interest: Adria Later
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Murder (my theory has changed here): Suspects: Steven Spielberg (orders), Jewish Mafia (carrier, most likely a sect with ties to Bronfmans). Jozseph Barsi was an abusive scumbag who deserves to burn in hell, but he was not the killer. He was however, the perfect patsy for the crime. "The most effective lies are based off a truth."

Also I suspect the sickos wanted to harvest the public's emotional energy by triggering a mass grief/despair event (by murdering a child who was beloved by the country as a whole). She also would have been the type to talk when she got older, so I suspect getting rid of lose ends to cover pedowood's tracks had a part in the motive.

           Accomplices: LA PD, the media, Ruth Hansen.

           Timeline of the murder: May 1988. Judith Barsi has a hysterical breakdown during a singing audition for All Dogs Go to Heaven. Ruth Hansen (25 year talent agent) likely warns Hollywood that Judith might potentially tell about Pedowood. Judith’s fate was basically sealed by that breakdown, for that was the origins of the ensuing murder plan. The well known abuse and threats at the hands of Josepz Barsi would become tools to carry out the “murder suicide” by enacting the murder plan to match those very words, including burning the house down:
          </p>
          <p>
           The most likely time of the murder was sometime between 12 AM-4 AM, 7/27/1988 (which would match "Grand Climax). The killers broke into the house in 7/25. Since a sacrifice is likely, I believe the family was drugged/sedated for much of 7/26. Possibly for preparations. The culprits killed them via gun shot on 7/27 as per a hollywood hit, ie head shot as part of the "murder suicide" angle that would be sold to the public. The bodies were stacked like a pyre, and according to Metal Den, Judith's was on top (which would make the "murder suicide angle" IMPOSSIBLE). The culprits doused gasoline onto the bodies, lighting them on fire, also part of the murder suicide narrative.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since we know the fire happend on 8:30 AM, this means that its likely that a set up was done. Possibly something like a "Ryuguu Gas Bomb". What this basically is is that it's an incendiary bomb involving gasoline and the fumes. The ignition source can be programed to go off at a specific time. Something as simple as an egg timer can be wired to be such. Of course in such a scenario, one is relying on the fire to destroy the evidence, which includes the set up.
Note that an autopsy report was never given for Jozesph Barsi. Given the progress rate of decomposistion assuming a hot summer (ie July), the detective’s claim of a possible murder of 7/25-7/26 (based on the lie told by Ruth Hansen) is wrong, for the smell would have been obvious at this point. *Murder Weapons: Pistol/Revolver (likely with a silencer), gasoline based incendiary bomb set up.

            So by this point, it's the list of who's NOT an evil pedophile in Hollywood that would be shocking, given the list of d-bags seems to include almost anyone who's ever had more than ten minutes of screen time.

            UpVoat!  Thank you for your research and digging further and further and deeper and deeper.   I have never liked Michael Cain.  Now I know why. SS is a vile perverted rapist and the sooner they are brought down the better for all children.  I sometimes wonder who is next.  Frightening.

             So far the Heather and Judith are the worst child star stories I have read about.  I often wonder how the world can allow these horrendous happenings.  I know that everyone on here does not like reading the horrible details, but how can we stamp out these satanic ritual crimes if we turn and walk away.  I have one of the weakest stomachs if you talk to people that know me, but I can't give up on these two girls.  Judith's mother AND father never deserved her.  She was too good for them.  RIP Judith  RIP Heather
