<li>Clay Rockefeller, grandson of the late David Rockefeller, is Principal of Anchor Brain, a Record Label that releases bands with close ties to Providence, Rhode Island, his place of residence   (linkedin domain is banned on voat, please search for clay rockefeller, # 9602191) </li>
<li>Anchor Brain\'s Tumblr page features a video titled &quot;Stupid and Weird Video&quot;, music belonging to an album released by Anchor Brain.  The video has images of [a cat feeding on] a slice of pizza, babies, teens and and a little girl behaving in a very sexually explicit way, and riddled with suspected code words such as &quot;chili&quot; (in reference to cannibalism), &quot;thunder sticks&quot;, and &quot;burger&quot; (eaten by a young teen in a sexually explicit way) throughout the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEC4M4z-hYc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEC4M4z-hYc</a>  
</li>
<li>Images throughout the video are fast-moving and can only be made out (with text) by repeatedly hitting the play and pause buttons.  Please watch my youtube #pizzagate video in which images have been frozen, saved as screen shots, and analyses are given. <a href="https://youtube/1kE-vSriBcc">https://youtube/1kE-vSriBcc</a></li>
<li>Youtube video above mentioned in Item 3 also discusses oddities in Clay Rockefeller\'s facebook, such as a comment &quot;cute sauce&quot; (&quot;orgy&quot; is the translation for pedophile code word &quot;sauce&quot;) referring to a photo of Clay with his naked children (click on &quot;view 11 more comments&quot; in the comments section.

the 1. </li>
<li>My Youtube video in item 3 above also discusses the official video of &quot;Listen to your Left Brain&quot; to which &quot;hotdogs&quot; are a central theme.  The entirety of the video depicts images of hotdogs, people eating hotdogs in a sexually explicit way, and other food items such as mustard, potato chips, etc. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhfUZJXYtQQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhfUZJXYtQQ</a>.</li>
<li>The band for &quot;Listen to your Left Brain&quot; is The Chinese Stars.  Although the particular album to which &quot;Listen to your Left Brain&quot; belongs was not released by Anchor Brain, Anchor Brain has released other album/s by the Chinese Stars.  There appears to be a link between Threeoneg, the record label for &quot;Listen to Your Left Brain&quot;, and Rockefeller\'s Anchor Brain through a shared Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Three-One-G-Anchor-Brain-Skin-Graft/514395641980001">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Three-One-G-Anchor-Brain-Skin-Graft/514395641980001</a>. </li>
<li>Further, music by the band Doomsday Student for which Threeoneg is the record label is featured on Anchor Brain\'s tumblr page (3rd photo from the top). <a href="http://anchorbrain.tumblr.com/">http://anchorbrain.tumblr.com/</a></li>
<li>when I inquired on Threeoneg\'s facebook about how the record label is affiliated with Anchor Brain (for which Clay Rockefeller is the Principal) the response given to me was &quot;Anchor Brain was started by Eric Paul, who is in a few bands on our label&quot;

<li>A comment by Susan Loewenkamp (please search her name to view comment) in mid-April confirms that David Rockefeller death and that Clay Rockefeller is his grandson <a href="https://www.facebook.com/clayrock">https://www.facebook.com/clayrock</a> and Clay Rockefeller is pictured with David Rockefeller on his instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BTp2DsyDsjM/?taken-by=clay_rocka">https://www.instagram.com/p/BTp2DsyDsjM/?taken-by=clay_rocka</a></li>
<li>I\'ve counted 24 photos on Clay Rockefeller\'s instagram posts in which his children (mostly his daughter) are photographed fully or partially naked, not including a handful on his facebook.  This particular post of his naked daughter comes with a comment &quot;Isn\'t that twerking?&quot; by annacmcdermott post can be found on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BRjyqXYBeZH/?taken-by=clay_rocka">https://www.instagram.com/p/BRjyqXYBeZH/?taken-by=clay_rocka)</a>).

            this stuff sounds so far-fetched to new people catching on. But you work out the webs of things and it scares you seeing the tentacle reach. We should all be scared shitless at how far they will go. These are powerful assholes.
but people like me do and have lived a fucked up childhood thanks to people like my own molesters, and we know what they do. the weird way they push pairing between sick adults and victims is part of their fun. They are evil and relish in defiling a thing of innocence. They kill that potential being and return a changeling.
They support each other. Protect each other.
It is their thrill, extra kink and perverted pride.
Its their survival.
           </p>
           <p>
            Support each other. Protect each other.
Its good against bad. very simple.
Regular folks get to be heros now and find the links.
I am in awe of you all, inspired, and proud to help in any way i can.
Happy Fathers day.
