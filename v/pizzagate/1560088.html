            Wow.  Buzzfeed article led me to a slew of British Royalty articles of late.  I am still convinced that Queen Elizabeth II tried to atone for the sins of the Royals and they have squelched all of it.  There was an article about how she gave Raymond Wheaton the insignia of Lieutenant of the Royal Order which is put in place for him to resume her duties in case of death. Now keep in mind she did this while she was recovering and too sick to go out.  This was all she did at the end of her recovery. It took place at Sandringham.  This was in an article:  Australian Monarchy Group Urges To Prepare For Queen's Death.  It goes on to say that Prince Charles will be next in line due to age, but also that the law was changed so that it does not have to be a male.  I know that Fiona Barnett had said that Prince Charles is definitely involved in perpetrating some of the nefarious acts in her account of the hunting of children along with other Royals on Palace Grounds. With him in charge they will be able to cover up their horrible hobby. They say that they are worried about her since her cold.  Hmmmmm.  How timely and convenient.  Stuff is getting really hot and she supposedly sent out that tweet. Well.  On to digging.  This email sure is kooky.

            Not too good at this, but I clicked on Source and the date came up as April 6, 2015.  That correlates with an article in Buzzfeed by Sam Stryker about Prince Harry dating Emma!  That was dated February 20, 2015.  The grey stuff is delicious I am working on but that is pretty kooky.

            Seems fairly obviously someone's notes to self, preserved in email form.
Who hasn't ever written themselves an email of notes, outllines, directions, events, ideas etc. to have it as a reminder or first draft later?
           </p>
           <p>
            And yet the suspicious missing address headers... perhaps redaacted because the writer borrowed an "innocent" friend's device to make notes on and then mailed it to himself.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or a "guilty" friend.???
           </p>
           <p>
            good luck finding secret code  there  though, it doesn't smell very secret to me.

             Well, seems like it is decoded. Solid work. But I wonder... is there anything else tying these business together?

             Please read my comments.  I think they lead to something that I found because of this post.  Sometimes there is nothing suspicious about a post (not convinced yet that there is not) but it leads to something else.
