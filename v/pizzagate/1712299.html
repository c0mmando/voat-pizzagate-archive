<p>Conclusion: Tim Burton hires actors who are pedophiles, and made a movie about &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; which is a story written by a known Pedophile. Alice in Wonderland is also connected to Pedophile symbols. It\'s almost as if Tim Burton made the Alice in Wonderland movie as a tribute to Pedophilia.

            i think u are reaching with this one. you can't make leaps of thinking like that and call it logic. you're just seeing connections that aren't there.

            It did not win me over as satire.  People were laughing.  If that really was there intent, they really went about it the wrong way.  First of all that show is wrong vehicle for something so heinous and serious.  I also think if Kimmel was against all of that stuff he would not be hosting the Oscars one of the most sick places where many pedos gather.

            Yeah, no more Jimmy Kimmel for me.  It made me sick to watch the Oscar highlights on my local news. I boycott Oscars.  Kimmel was the emcee.  I could not watch.  They all disgust me now.  But Ron Howard, OPIE?  I remember Opie was a child on a set of adults and I found out Don Knotts who played Barney Pfyfe on Andy Griffith was his second cousin.  I wonder what his background was and if he may have abused him.  Hollywood is a Cesspool.

            Help!  My posts keep getting immediately removed???????
Repeating ....

           <p>
            Not a fan of either Tom Hanks or Ron Howard.  Howard took the Da Vinci Code which was telling us that Mary was the wife of Jesus and that Jesus was fighting the cementing of patriarchy with the Old Testament ... and Ron turned it into a car chase for 11 year olds.
And Apollo???  Does anyone still believe we went to the moon?

            It used to be that the right wing created our reality and we lived with it.  Now it's more like they create our reality but we stand back questioning it and puking.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just want to add that sadly it's too late for Corey Haim.  Corey Feldman seem to know just how dangerous it would be to name names.  But it may also be dangerous to walk around with these secrets.  I think we should all be encouraged at what has happened with the Bill Cosby rapes.  Victims are coming out more often.  And the public is listening.  And I don't think the public is about to let another Bill Cosby get away with this stuff.  We are more often listening to the children and on the side of the children and the deck is certainly stacked against them as we continue to see.  We need to be listening to children all over the world and letting them know that we are on their side.

            Not a fan of either Tom Hanks or Ron Howard.  Howard turned the Da Vinci Code into a car chase for 11 year olds.
Apollo??  Who believes in the moon landing any more?  It used to be that the right wing created our reality and we
lived it.  Now it's more like they create our reality, but we stand back questioning it and puking.

            Too late for Corey Haim -- and I'm sure that Corey Feldman knows what he has room to do and not to do.  It's pretty serious to feel so threatened as they both were.  But, I'm also thinking that the Bill Cosby situation should be encouraging because I don't think the public is going to let that happen again.  They will listen to the kids now.  And we should be listening to children all over the world.

            Yes.  Actually I was up and started watching and had to leave the room before I realized what I was seeing.  By the time I came back It was almost over.  Had not realized what I missed.  Someone on here had a video and bingo it rang a bell and I watched the video.  It was disgusting.  If you know about Jon Benet it was so very similar.  It was really very much like he was really into it.  It is so blatantly in your face.  When you see it, it disgusts you.  I am not good at links but I bet you could find it on YT.

            I watched two or three episodes of "Family Guy" just because I'd heard about how evil it was, and it repeatedly put the children in graphic sex acts. It's too shameful even to type out what the child characters were involved in doing. If it was live action with actual child actors, they couldn't do any of it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The whole "Stewie" character seems like a pedophile's fantasy justification - there's an adult inside the child's body.

            It is impossible to know if Carroll was a paedophile. There was a fad in his era of photographing nude pre-pubescent females that was quite popular and had no cultural connotations of paedophilia.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Tim Burton also made the movie "Beetlejuice." One of the actors, Jeffrey Jones, was arrested in 2002 for child pornography and accused of making a 14 year old boy pose for nude photographs.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            It's important to note that "Beetlejuice" came out 15 years before Jones was arrested. Hardly a connection, especially considering none of the other actors have had any suspicion of the same conduct.

              LE never decided to arrest Burton, so where it the connection? It is important because charges are being leveled at someone who has never been under suspicion. What is it about probable cause that you don't understand?

              Reubens wasn't found in possession of child pornography, though. They found vintage photographs that were so debatable as being child pornography that they dropped the charges of child pornography against him. It was very similar to the Michael Jackson case where the only child-related stuff they found fell under the "artistic" category. Doesn't mean they weren't pervs, but the evidence that they were pedophiles was meager. Jones' case was clear-cut.

               While I see you're just shilling, I'll respond for anyone else reading. Pedophiles are often caught with "artistic" photos of nude children. Michael Jackson was caught with loads of photo books like these. Members of NAMBLA even produce them to skirt child porn laws.

                Pointing out verifiable facts isn't shilling, you prick. If you can't handle facts and want to wallow in your speculation, that's your problem. Michael Jackson was caught with tons of pornography, and only a few pictures were considered possibly child porn, and were ultimately determined not to be child porn. Same with Reubens. If you actually gave a shit about the facts, people typically caught with collections of child porn have tons of the stuff. It's the same thing as accusing someone found with an eighth of weed of being a drug dealer.

             So being caught in 2002 means that the actor wasn't involved in Child Porn before the production of Beetlejuice? Obviously we can't know for sure, but odds are that the actor was involved in this stuff even in the 90s. The point is that Tim Burton is associated with Pedophiles and hires them for his movies - hence Johnny Depp, Paul Reubens, David Geffen, and possibly more (still doing research)

              There's no evidence that he was, nor any evidence that any of the rest of the cast or production crew was. If anything, Alec Baldwin is better known for being a homophobic jackass who loses his shit in public and screams at people, including his daughter when she was a child - rather pedophobic, one might say.

            Was Johnny Depp not in Tim Burton's version of The Chocolate Factory?  Rauol Dahl's father was a dentist and I thought I remembered Johnny sitting in a dentist's chair in the movie.  Pedophiles love dentist chairs.  There must be something sick and perverted about what they can do to a child in that chair.  My mind is not as sick as theirs. There have been quite a few dentists arrested for pedophilia.  If I am wrong someone let me know.  But somehow this is my memory.

            Yes, well there was a video going around about Hanks on the Jimmy Kimmel Show.  It was disgusting.  It also featured Ron Howard and his daughter.  Tom Hanks was on with a girl he said was his daughter, but she really was not.  He proceeded to whip up a fancy tutu outfit and had her made up like Jon Benet and made her say Sexy Baby about three times in a row many times.  Then he taught her how to walk sexy and say Sexy Walk Sexy Walk over and over made up like a harlot.  There was then a contest between that girl and the other two daughters.  I was so appalled and disgusted I forgot who won.  So Kimmel, Hanks and Opie are all pedophiles.  Red Pilled Again.

              It makes you wonder what their wives think?  They must know?  Do they just not admit to themselves that their husbands are pedophiles, or they just tell themselves they are a bit strange? It kind of boggles the mind.

               Me too! No amount of money or high status would be worth it if your husband and his friends are sick pedophiles (maybe worse)! I couldn't ignore that. It seems to me like, even if they aren't children, business trips become parties full of prostitutes. If a spouse can't sense that something is wrong, they have to be blind. So, I think that most of the time they know. If they aren't doing the same thing, then they stay because they like the money and status. That's sick to choose over children. I don't know how child traffickers can live with themselves.

                It is much more than just an addiction, because some do not become pedophiles even though they have been abused for years.  But some do.  That is what we have to research, what happens that makes some commit those same heinous acts and others not.  There should be testing and research done.  I believe of course, that in cases like that of Hanks, Howard and Kimmel, that there may have been MK Ultra used.

            Vanessa Tait is a twit.  She thinks we dwell a little too much on pedophilia nowadays?  Maybe because there are so many of them.  She is just hoping to rake in a bunch of money this year during the 150th Anniv. of Alice.  At the price of the virginity of our children.  Go ahead and push the book and the story You Cow.
