            No, they won't. Not if indictments come and there's solid evidence. They have to salvage what they can by doing 180. It's already started. Gates just came out with a flattering statement about Trump. Right now, it's a wait and see game. Everybody is sitting at the poker table. HRC &amp; Co. knows what possible evidence they have, but do they have it? And now Assange has joined in threatening to release 9/11 data if the FBI doesn't release certain HRC emails. HRC, Podesta, JA are all toast.

            I rewatched some debates recently, including the Red Dinner, and was surprised at how much better they played now that I have a better understanding of what was going on. Sometimes when it seemed like Trump was drifting off topic, he was actually making reference to things that scared the shit out of Clinton. You could see it in her eyes. I'm sure she knew way before anyone else that she was losing.

            There was chatter on 4chan that a cia anon said gears were turning expect something big next week. Ben Swann goes dark. Not much to go off and quite possibly nothing but there's always optimism.

            I have been treated really badly by people who are meant to love me, just for bringing this up and trying to tell them about it. Shouted at, called names etc, and they wouldn't even look at the evidence. It's so weird and frightening, especially because they're intelligent, kind people normally. When this all comes out I am going to make them feel ohsofoolish.

            Don't watch sports. But why did I just see a Pizza Hut commercial w/ a split second of a ping pong game, inside a crowded house? Honestly, it's probably the creative guys at the ad agency that did it having a ball (no pun intended) w/ all this pizzagate stuff going on.

            I wrote a brief rant about it because I was concerned about Mitt Romney and Bob Corker getting into his cabinet and posted it in a comment on his official page last November ormaybe before, and I did not see Mitt Romney or Bob Corker become Sec.of State, so that gives me hope that maybe he gets word of people associated with potential scandals.  I was not suggestions that either of them were Pedosta, but Romney has made statements through anonymous sources saying Harry Reid is a pedophile after he didn't like Reid asking him about his taxes, so either way, that shows that he is either a liar who stoops go the lowest levels to sling mud OR he allows innocent kids to go on getting abused while he saves up information on pedophiles to use as a political dagger.  Both show bad character.  And Bob Corker is part of the Tennessee group that only cares about politcs to make himself rich and he would probably protect some pedophiles if it helped him stay off the radar.  He just bothers me because he made an anti human trafficking bill and its written in a way that would let him know who might be investigated next.  I do not think we need  senate /Congress involved.  Not with any investigation where they could be implicated themselves

            And to answer the question, yes, he has to know about pizzagate.  Everybody does, but they won't mention it.  I like to bring it up casually in groups that have nothing to do with it.

            He is quoted in the Super Bowl (Bill O'Reilly interview when Bill mentioned that "Putin is a killer" ) President Trump said  "There are many killers, do you think the United States is so innocent". IMHO this is a direct response to HOMO Obama, Killary, CIA etc. again IMHO he is dropping hints of what is to come this next week. (I have been praying 24/7 that the FBI anon is real and stated facts on reddit).

             I'm from the UK and when this comes out it should herald the death of the bbc, they can't get away with it again they've already been exposed for covering up a pedophile ring IN THEIR OWN ORGANIZATION!  They've called pizzagate fake news and took their information from the New York Times who are run by the very same man who not only stopped a bbc newsnight documentary about the saville scandal, but also allowed a saville tribute show to be aired after the fact.
            </p>
            <p>
             They were completely biased during the Scottish independence referendum, did everything they could to stop brexit, and have failed to cover Wikileaks and the HRC emails in any depth at all.  Hiding in shame won't save them, they are finished after this.
            </p>
            <p>
             To everyone reading this who pays a tv license in the UK, cancel it tomorrow and never pay it again no matter how much they threaten you.  They can't legally enter your home without your permission, if the inspectors come to your door tell them you don't fund paedophilia and slam it in their face.

            I would be more incredulous if Trump didn't know. He keeps his pulse on things and this is one of those topics that is hotly contested on social media. Now what he's going to do about it is a mystery. I know what I'm wishing, but until Santa brings me that present, I wait ... like the rest of you.

             There's something strategic about it, I think. I think that his approval rating could go up 20 percentage points, but the timing has to be just right. It can't be a news story that can just be buried with the next Anti-Trump calumny, as is wont to be a strategy from the MSM.

              Oh, they're not going to bury this story! Too many big names involved. I mean, would they actually be able to NOT say HRC is going to jail? And if this all goes down, and they do have the goods on the big names (like HRC, Podesta, Schumer, Biden, even Obama), the media will IMMEDIATELY reverse themselves and backpedal ... making some sorry ass excuse up for being deceived and not knowing. Actually, this is like that prediction that guy made. Hmmmm ....

            Thanks for posting this..something else struck me as significant......the Trump Insider had high praise for Erik Prince, which lends further support to the contents of the Weiner laptop....

            I think it would be insanely naive of anyone to think trump doesn't know about pizzagate as a billionaire president with above top secret clearance and access to intelligence agencies (and YouTube) but all of us normal people know what jimmycomet eats for breakfast on a Tuesday. So it's not does he know, it's does he plan on doing anything about it. It would be tough and even war but I have faith he is.
