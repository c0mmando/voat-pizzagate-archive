            Strange how all the "anti-Jew" faggots, like Hagen19, are deleting all their comments.  I think they secretly suck Jewish cock, and this is why they are so hostile towards them.

            I will ask everybody here since Hagen19 is to much of a pussy to respond.

            , I don't know what rule this actually abides by, to be quite honest.  It violates 1 at multiple levels, 2 consistently, 3 because it only describes his 47 minute video that nobody will watch because who gives a fuck and it's not PG anway.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suppose one could argue that it abides by 4, 5, and 6, but who gives a shit at this point.

            There was an interesting Oprah segment in the 80's by a woman Rachel (aka Vicki Polin &amp; Shauna Green) who claimed she had been abused all her life by her upper middle class Jewish family. It's often alleged that her family was in some sort of Sabbatean/Frankist cult, hence the title posted for this video:

           <p>
            I found a transcript I'll post as a comment to this, so you don't have to watch Oprah.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a good discussion about her by a Luke Ford (heard the name; don't know who he is). After the show Oprah was forced to apologize for her anti-semiticism in airing such a segment.

            She started a website The Awareness Project, The International Jewish Coalition Against Sexual Assault. That's an interesting coincidence, as I just found their pages on Zvi and Frank, they are very good, well-written, researched and informative for those interested in these cults. They don't however contain any specific child abuse allegations.

             I looked all day for that video...but like the hook tube one only a snippet of the interview exists. The entire show was available, but no longer. They remove them and now this incomplete version remains. Such a shame because I believe she names the Frankist and goes into the difference between regular Jewish observers and Frankist who pretend to be Jewish and then do horrific thing on special days. Angels by day...Devils by night. Thank you for posting that.

              On the Luke Ford site there's a link to a transcript that appears to be a Xeroxed paper transcript, very official-looking, so possibly from the show itself. That might include more information.
             </p>
             <p>
              I recall she said something about her family going back to the 1700's, often taken to be an allusion to the time of Jacob Frank. Yet the Ford site claimes she later revised this to 1800's. Also as I mentioned her Awareness site pages on Zvi and Frank don't mention the kind of ritual abuse she claimed.
             </p>
             <p>
              So it's definite historically Zvi was a fake Muslim and Frank was a fake Christian, researchers infer and claim these cult followers later on posed as non-cult Jews.

               I did look at that Xeroxed transcript, seems official with copyright by Harpo productions at the end. There's no specific mention of Frankists. I did find this interesting, on page six Polin says she read a book lately that ties in with her experience. It looks like the transcript has been xeroxed so many times, particularly that page, that the title is illegible.

             Oprah transcript:
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: As a child, my next guest was used also in worshipping the devil, participated in human sacrifice rituals and cannibalism. She says her family has been involved in rituals for generations. She is currently in extensive therapy, suffers from multiple personality disorder, meaning she's blocked out many of the terrifying and painful memories of her childhood. Meet "Rachel," who is also in disguise to protect her identity. You come from generations of ritualistic abuse?
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL", Was Used In Satan Worship Rituals: Yes, my family has an extensive family tree, and they keep track of who's been involved and who hasn't been involved, and it’s gone back to like 1700.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: And so you were ritually abused.
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": Right. I was born into a family that believes in this.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Does everyone else think it's a nice Jewish family? From the outside, you appear to be a nice Jewish girl?
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": Definitely.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: And you all are worshipping the devil inside the home?
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": Right. There's other Jewish families across the country. It's not just my own family.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Really? And so who knows about it? Lots of people now.
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": Well, I talked to a police detective in the Chicago area, and several of my friends know, and I've spoke publicly before, and…
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: So when you were brought up in this kind of evilness, did you just think it was normal?
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL': I blocked out a lot of the memories I had because of my multiple personality disorder, but, yes. I mean, it's like if you grow up with something, you think it’s normal. I always thought something…
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: So what kinds of things? You don't have to give us the gory details, but what kinds of things went on in the family?
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": Well, there would be rituals in which babies would be sacrificed, and you would have to, you know…
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Whose babies?
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": There were people who bred babies in our family. No one would know about it. A lot of people were overweight, so you couldn't tell if they were pregnant or not, or they would supposedly go away for awhile and then come back…
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": The other thing I want to point out not all Jewish people sacrifice babies. I mean, it's not a very typical thing.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: I think we kind of know that.
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": I just want to point that out.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: This is the first time I heard of any Jewish people sacrificing babies, but anyway--so you witnessed the sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": Right. When I was very young, I was forced to participate in that-- in which I had to sacrifice an infant.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: And the purpose of sacrifice is to what? Is to bring you what? What are you sacrificing for?
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": For power...
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Power. And so were you ever used? Were you ever used yourself?
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": I was molested. I was raped several times.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: What's your mother doing in all of this? What's her role in all of this?
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": What is-- I'm not exactly- -what her role is-- I haven't, you know, recovered all of my memories, but her family was extremely involved. You know, she brought me to it. Both of my parents brought me to it.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: And where is she now?
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": She lives in the Chicago metropolitan area. She's on the human relations commission of the town that she lives in, and she's an upstanding citizen. Nobody would suspect her. Nobody would suspect anybody involved in it. There's police officers involved in it. There's, you know, doctors, lawyers, Indiana chiefs involved in it.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Are you kidding?
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": I mean, it's not the person, you know, who looks scummy that's involved in it. It's someone who looks normal.…
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Were you raised with a sense of right and wrong, “Rachel?”
            </p>
            <p>
             “RACHEL: Yes. I mean, it’s like we, I had both. I mean, to the outside world, everything we did was proper and right, and then there were the nights that things changed, that things just got turned around. What was wrong was right, and what was right was wrong. That’s what helps to create some of theto develop MPD.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Multiple personality disorder.
            </p>
            <p>
             “RACHEL”: Right, right.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: I know a lot of people are shaking their heads here, and I'm sure that when you go back home, I mean, everyone's going to try to make you look like you're crazy.
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": Oh, definitely.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Absolutely.
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": They do that all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: It's very difficult to believe, so how is it that you come to believe these people, Tina?
            </p>
            <p>
             Ms. GROSSMAN: Well, I've treated over 40 survivors of ritual abuse. Adult patients with multiple personality disorder, and from many states in this country as well as Canada. What we've seen and heard and gone through in the abreactions which is the remembered experiences of that- we are hearing the identical same things from these adults. Okay. These are not children that are three years old, and you can, as an adult, perhaps rationalize that this is fantasy material. These adults are saying things. They have never met each other before. They are describing identical rituals, just the same as, since I'm Jewish, you could go to New York or California and describe a seder in one state or another and, as a Jew, you would recognize it. This is the belief system in evil and the power that evil gives you, and so it has these certain rituals, so they are very similar with all of the survivors.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: See, but I am very surprised because the Jewish faith is the Jewish faith. and worshipping the devil is not a part of the Jewish faith. I mean, Jewish people do not worship the devil.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ms. GROSSMAN: But before there was Christ and before there was a system of one God, there was Paganism- and it still exists in the world, and in many cultures, you still find the belief that there is strength and power in the actual consumption of human flesh or animals' flesh.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Now in your family. did you all call it worshipping the devil, "Rachel?”
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": No.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Or did you…
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": I don't know.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: It was just evil. these things you did.
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": It was-- right.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Right.
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": Well, I said it was evil, and they said it was good. There's a book that I had just come across called [Lilith's Cave: Jewish Tales of the Supernatural by Howard Schwartz, New York, Oxford University Press, 1988] which is a book of Jewish mysticism and supernatural, and there's a lot in that book that relates to what I endured when I was a child.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: I want to stop right here, though. because you know how people build prejudices. I want to make it very clear this is one Jewish person, so don't go around now saying to people, you know, "Those Jewish people, they're worshipping--'. This is just one person. Okay.
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": Most Jewish people do not do what my family did.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: Okay. Thank you very much.
            </p>
            <p>
             "RACHEL": I mean, I don't know very many other Jewish people who would do what I did.
            </p>
            <p>
             OPRAH: But you know how people hear one thing, and then go off and they say, "I heard on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' today that…”

            Followers of Sabbatai Zvi and Jacob Frank would be good candidates for a force behind organized pedophilia. Some equate them with the modern 'Illuminati'.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Zvi had a saying 'Blessed is he who permits the forbidden'. In Jewish tradition the world is supposed to end when all people are good or bad. Frank's reasoning 'If we can't all be good, let's all be evil'.
           </p>
           <p>
            So these groups are inherently deceptive and secretive, posing as other religions and hiding their beliefs. They also believe in an inversion of morality. Usually and historically this is thought to mean loose sex, e.g. some people peeped through the windows at a Frankist mass and saw men and women dancing together naked. I think Frank pimped out his daughter Eva fairly young too.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anyway, just thought I'd chime in for support.

             Exactly. They are to Jews as satanist to Christians. An inversion of symbols just like satanist. The star is David is not a Jewish symbol. It is kabbalistic...as above so below. It is the seal of Solomon. He, King Solomon, created the temple by use of magic and demons helped him build it. See why Epstein island had a temple. 
Jesuits are the Christian arm of this cult. Wahhabist are Islams arm of cult. Destroy from within,

              I looked up
              <em>
               Lilith's Child
              </em>
              . I guess my tingly 'spider sense' paranoia failed me, not really a big deal. Just some Jewish myths.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's interesting though, Goldman (?) Polin's therapist talked about pagan Jewish cults on Oprah. I suppose that might be Moloch, don't know too much about this (apologies, I'm not being anti-semitic). But my observation is for every case in the Old Testament where one party is the good guy and one is the bad guy there's a cult that thinks the bad guy was actually right. God/Serpent, Eve/Lilith, Abel/Cain, Jacob/Esau.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think there's a religious aspect to all of this that makes it a good thing to rape kids, in some people's minds.

             The interview was about a book rabbi Marvin Antelman wrote, it was extremely well researched, To Eliminate The Opiate vol1&amp;2, since the author is being interviewed, and he's an authority in the topic, I thought that would be proof enough. I have included the Wikipedia, version,MThat corroborates my assertions.

              No, you need to succinctly support your claims - all of them.  Any videos or bodies of text need to have the exact times/lines available so others don't have to slog through a bunch of bullshit just to find the support for your claims.
             </p>
             <p>
              Direct quotes would go a long way towards making verification of your claims easier.

              You're a 10 month old account with less than 150 contribution points, showing up and making at least 2 rule-breaking posts to PizzaGate in the past 3 days, at a time when we're getting shilled and brigaded heavily.  YOU look like one of them.

            It's a Satanist agenda.  Part of their agenda was to infect EVERY religion - Christianity, Catholicism, Judaism, Islam, etc.  Every fucking religion has been infected by the "missionaries" who went forth to spread the word of Lucifer. All religions have been corrupted.  The Catholic church, up to the Vatican is the worst IMO.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then again, a compelling argument could be made foe the endemic pedophilia found within Islam.  The innate misogyny, male homosexuality, pedophilia is horrendous within Islam.
           </p>
           <p>
            But this isn't a "what's the worst religion" conversation.
           </p>
           <p>
            (Paraphrase) "They hung the finest gold crosses on the young altar boys to indicate that they were of "stature" and that they had been "properly groomed"."  It was a fucking system.  Not one-offs.  They groomed, they marked, and they prayed.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Jesuits were behind it.  All the D/CIA who are Jesuits.  G. Gordon Liddy and his pedophile CA DAG son.  Georgetown University; Loyola; Notre Dame: Penn State - Sandusky; Ohio State - Urban Meyer (this isn't about wife beating); etc...

             I agree with you....but I believe, and I think you made a point....it has infected every religion. This has been planned, systematic and effective. Once there were Christian and Jews....now there are hundreds of Christian sects and reformed, conservative and Orthodox Jews. In Islam too, many sects. They divide and conquer by infiltration and a slow poisoning of the well. Ethical beings are not easily swayed. That is why they are attacking religion. Ethical behaviour is their enemy. We are bombarded at every direction with filth. It's to encourage us to do likewise.

            From what i have read Freemasons take blood curdling oaths too pervert justice in favor of their fellow masons.  How could they possibly administer fair and honest decisions in any public office?  The Courts, Police, and all other areas of political responsibility are chocked full of them.  Not one should be allowed to practice their craft of public corruption in any office of government, particularly the Judiciary.  The same actually applies to Jesuit affiliated persons.  Jesuits are members of a foreign military service sworn to the destruction of free and open self government by any means available.  And it looks like Trump's new Supreme Court Nominee will be another Jesuit affiliated lawyer.  I honestly have lost the count.  But i think this is either 6 or 7 of the 9 Jesuit educated/affiliated.  And our founding fathers called them the greatest danger to our country's future. They should be rejected by default as affiliates to sworn enemies of free and open government.

             Yeah all one sick, very extensive cult. Jesuits are the Christian faction, but like the Templars they are cabalists too. Ahhh that days of innocent, ignorant bliss....,gone forever.

            DISINFORMATION. Typical kike disinformation. It is not a kike agenda? Luciferian element hiding within "Judaism"? READ THE TALMUD, THE FOUNDATION OF "JUDAISM", AND TELL ME WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS NOT A "JEWISH" AGENDA. So much junk in this video. Hitler funded by the Wallstreet? Scapegoating the Masons when Freemasonry is nothing but a carbon copy of "Jewish" kabbalism? Excuse me for the caps lock, but people need to take not and not fall for typical pharisaic fake "Jew" disinformation.

             Not all Jews follow the tulmud or the Zohar....they strictly follow the Torah. All Jews are not Zionist. This is a rabbi outing people who say are Jews.....but are not. If you don't believe, hey that okay, but the donmehs of turkey are all sabbatean/frankists....do you call satanist, Christian? No, well Jews have their own special luciferian edition of their own. Strange but true.

              Agent999, or should I say, Agent666, yes, almost every single "Jew" is either raised on the Talmud or in a talmudic environment, even if secular on the surface. That or the Zohar and its many descendants. You don't know what you're talking about. Is it possible that one percent of so-called "Jews" strictly follow the Torah? Don't know, can't say, although the idea of only reading the Torah is a bizarre one. Notice that the Torah consists of the five books of Moses. Why wouldn't they follow the rest of the Old Testament? The idea of only "valuing" the first five books is a talmudic idea. And of course the talmudists don't even really value the Torah, but rather spit on it with their perverted misinterpretations. Another thing. The fake "Jews" will often call the Talmud the Torah, actually meaning the oral "Torah". So often when they profess to adhere to the Torah, really they are still talking about the Talmud. They use tricky language like that, though I'm quite sure you're well aware of all this, aren't you, Agent666? But I'm writing this for the consideration of other readers.

               You are entitled to your opinion. IMO Hitlers, was a Frankist....so we're many in his inner circle. He didn't kill all the Jews, just the religious ones. Jews like George soros were saved by turning in other Jews. How do you figure? Their are good people in every religion, colour and creed my brother. Divide and conquer that is the game.
