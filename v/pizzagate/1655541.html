            I believe it will all come out.  Whether the Real Perpetrators of this horrible business will ever be punished remains to be seen.  We must push for it.  Without it, they will go underground, and even more secretive and it will only be worse.  They are evil to the core.

             China’s Human Rights Situation Is Getting Worse

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The new Trump administration also sees China’s human rights abuse as a serious problem. President Trump appointed Peter Navarro, an economist who is known for taking a hard line against China, to serve as director of the National Trade Council. In his documentary film, “Death by China,” Navarro harshly criticized the Chinese government’s crackdown on human rights activists, organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners and making profits from selling the organs.
The reports released by Canadian human rights activists in June of 2016 revealed that there had been between 60,000 and 100,000 organ transplants from political prisoners each year in China. The forced organ harvesting is being performed mainly on those whom the Chinese Communist Party considers political offenders, that is, Uighurs and Tibetans who join the independence movement, Falun Gong practitioners, and human rights activists who are struggling for freedom and democracy.

              The reality of human organ harvesting in China

              The government will say that you simply disappeared or that you were never there to begin with. But it’ll most likely say nothing at all.
Meanwhile, wealthy people will file into purpose-built hospitals for lifesaving organ transplants. The selection of human kidneys, livers and other organs is vast. That’s because thousands of people have been slaughtered to put them there. Organ harvesting is a lucrative business for the Chinese government.
That is the reality for thousands of Chinese citizens who have reportedly been subjected to forced medical testing for the purposes of organ harvesting for the best part of the past two decades.
