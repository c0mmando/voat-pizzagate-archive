            Vindicator told us just how despised we are here, and I put this reply of mine here so that it isn't buried.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             VieBleu:   Just confirms that Voat is not a good fit for this forum for many reasons including many more serious ones not listed above. For one thing, it is much too harsh a culture for SRA, MK Ultra or any other survivors to feel comfortable for long here, and outspoken victims is one of the most important things that may be able to provide EVIDENCE of pizzagate activities.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I have said since the begining, the total free speech aims of Voat does not work well with this controversial topic that attracts shill trolls like no other current forum topic anywhere. It is what it is, and the fact that the very platform this investigation is housed in is quite hostile to us creates an atmosphere not unlike a disfunctional family, with an ongoing undertone of abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              LIke a beaten up child, until the crowd here has the willpower to move themselves somewhere else, it is not going to get any better. Of course many have long left, and the forum has nowhere near the verve and dynamism it had a half-life ago.

             Your history speaks for itself.
             <br/>
             The amount of shill trolls this place attracts on a regular basis exposes the lie of your obnoxious toxic propaganda. You won't know it of course being so new here, and because troll mods deleted the two submissions, but I brought more honest truth warriors, honest subscribers, here in 48 hours when this place flung it's fake doors open, than you people have ever managed to attract in the same amount of time. 500 or more when "smart people" as you like to put it, believed in this particular piece of layered propaganda magic carpet bad trip. We thought you wanted people to subscribe here, but actual numbers of citizens drove your shills into a frenzy of downvoting and control TO SHUT US DOWN.  It has never let up.  We know this history, all who were here at the begining of December 2016.

             Now, your vile ooze only seduces people to stay here just a little longer for the wrong reasons - they believe you have any good will, and this place will do this movement any good. It doesn't last long, and neither will your obnoxious jezebel ride on the pricks that make this place run. Enjoy it while you can cause the downside isn't going to continue to make you look so pretty.
            </p>
            <p>
             Don't ever forget, that by participating in the bamboozzaling of those that believe in this place, which is dwindling, you have hexxxxed yourself. No doubt about it. Just don't forget to look over your shoulder. Your soul will right itself, and based on what you have done as a deceiver, you are not going to be comfortable with it.

            This is the orginal comment permalinked above (in case it gets edited)  which I thought was refreshingly honest - Voat hates us, and that is one reason it is so uncomfortable here.  It ends delivering the take it or leave it bad news of YOU ARE LUCKY TO BE ABUSED HERE of the controller's messaging and the faker's smiley -  (fuck you) cheers!

Hey there people,
This will probably be buried in comments, but wtf. I thought I would interject a few observations about the relationship between
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             and Voat at large, and give some insight about why this stuff keeps happening. We are largely an anomaly. Most subs don't have a serious focus. Most subs don't have serious or complex submission guidelines. Most subs don't have an organized outside group expending large sums of money on teams of shills and lawyers to silence them. Most subs are here for fun -- free of PC censors.
            </p>
            <p>
             A lot of "old goats" as the first generation of Voat users are known, resent the crap out of us. They see us as a threat to Voat and its culture ("Reddit Cancer" is what it's called, shorthand for using moderation to create safespaces that limit unfettered speech). Some of the trolls we get are actually other Voaters who make alts and come in here to shitpost. And, thanks to whom we are investigating and what, and their power to shut down companies and platforms that allow discussion of Pizzagate, we are an actual threat to Voat. Unfortunately, there is very little communication between key Voat stakeholders and
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             mods -- mostly it happens when we piss off the natives by deleting comments or committing other Voat no-nos.
            </p>
            <p>
             We don't get prior notice of pranks like this UI change or function changes like the Search bar removal. I highly doubt they have a clue how this affects people in this sub. In fact, we were razzed for this sticky.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, there's your insight of the day into the larger relationship between
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
              v/pizzagate
             </a>
             and the rest of Voat. :-) To keep this all in perspective, if it weren't for their anti-censorship pissedness, we would not have this forum at all, and that's no April Fool. Cheers!

            so the 'modern layout' is a joke right?  cuz it's hard to figure with the front page saying you can click on the "soon to be deleted legacy view" (which is eons better than the 'modern' layout)

            I sense a little Trauma Based Mind Control hypno-programming for this "joke"...Voats traffic is mostly for the subverse pizzagate...
           </p>
           <p>
            This would be jarring to the investigators and would leave them susceptible to subconscious programming.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just like when you remember Traumatic Events...eg like 911 you knew where you were and what you were doing when you heard about it and it leaves the person open for all kinds of hypnotic suggestion.
           </p>
           <p>
            This might have been funny if it werent for the fact we know the elites were running roughshod all over the world raping and killing children and the TV/Magic Box with its comedians and entertainers are ONLY there to distract you from them raping, torturing, killing and the eating of children.

            Hey there people,
           </p>
           <p>
            This will probably be buried in comments, but wtf. I thought I would interject a few observations about the relationship between
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            and Voat at large, and give some insight about why this stuff keeps happening. We are largely an anomaly. Most subs don't have a serious focus. Most subs don't have serious or complex submission guidelines. Most subs don't have an organized outside group expending large sums of money on teams of shills and lawyers to silence them. Most subs are here for fun -- free of PC censors.
           </p>
           <p>
            A lot of "old goats" as the first generation of Voat users are known, resent the crap out of us. They see us as a threat to Voat and its culture ("
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/introductions/1350015">

            </a>
            " is what it's called, shorthand for using moderation to create safespaces that limit unfettered speech). Some of the trolls we get are actually other Voaters who make alts and come in here to shitpost. And, thanks to whom we are investigating and what, and their power to shut down companies and platforms that allow discussion of Pizzagate, we
            <em>
             are
            </em>
            an actual threat to Voat. Unfortunately, there is very little communication between key Voat stakeholders and
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            mods -- mostly it happens when we piss off the natives by deleting comments or committing other Voat no-nos.
           </p>
           <p>
            We don't get prior notice of pranks like this UI change or function changes like the Search bar removal. I highly doubt they have a clue how this affects people in this sub. In fact, we were
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/whatever/1761438/8626493">
             razzed
            </a>
            for this sticky.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, there's your insight of the day into the larger relationship between
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             v/pizzagate
            </a>
            and the rest of Voat. :-)  To keep this all in perspective, if it weren't for their anti-censorship pissedness, we would not have this forum at all, and that's no April Fool. Cheers!

             Just confirms that Voat is not a good fit for this forum for many reasons including many more serious ones not listed above.  For one thing, it is much too harsh a culture for SRA, MK Ultra or any other survivors to feel comfortable for long here, and outspoken victims is one of the most important things that may be able to provide EVIDENCE of pizzagate activities.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I have said since the begining, the total free speech aims of Voat does not work well with this controversial topic that attracts shill trolls like no other current forum topic anywhere.  It is what it is, and the fact that the very platform this investigation is housed in is quite hostile to us creates an atmosphere not unlike a disfunctional family, with an ongoing undertone of abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             LIke a beaten up child, until the crowd here has the willpower to move themselves somewhere else, it is not going to get any better. Of course many have long left, and the forum has nowhere near the verve and dynamism it had a half-life ago.

              It's interesting but unsurprising, VieBleu, that you interpreted my observations as characterizing Voat goats as "hostile" and "abusive". I never said any such thing. I said they resent the pro-censorship expectation that mods create safespaces. And based on your comment, they are absolutely right to do so.
             </p>
             <p>
              Honestly, who serves survivors of sexual predators better: those who give them an uncensored forum and recognize they are among the toughest and most resilient of folk? Or those who pander and whine about them being beaten up, characterize them as weak, helpless children, trapped in a dying subverse?
             </p>
             <p>
              We've added 3,000 subscribers in the last couple of weeks, VieBleu. Your comment isn't just poisonous, it's wrong. It does nothing to build up this community.

               Your history speaks for itself.
              </p>
              <p>
               The amount of trolls this place attracts on a regular basis serves to justify your obnoxious toxic propaganda.   You won't know it of course, because troll mods deleted it, but I brought more honest truth warriors, honest subscribers, here in 48 hours when this place flung it's fake doors open,  than you people have ever managed to attract in the same amount of time.   500 or more when "smart" people believed in this magic carpet bad trip.  Your vile ooze only seduces people to stay here just a little longer for the wrong reasons - they believe this place will do them any good.  It doesn't last long, and neither will your obnoxious jezebel ride on the pricks that make this place run.  Enjoy it while you can cause the downside isn't going to continue to make you look so pretty.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't every forget, that by participating in the bambooazaling of the people that believe in this place, which is dwindling, you have hexxxxed yourself.  No doubt about it.  Just don't forget to look over your shoulder.   Your soul will right itself, and based on what you have done as a deceiver, you are not going to be comfortable with it.

                EDIT:
               </strong>
               I am not interested in another go-go round with the traitor Vindicator, who is only one symptom of the problem here.  In fact I was in agreement with her comment as I felt it was refreshingly honest (even though a rationalization) about at least one portion of hostility users of this forum face continuously.  Thus I'm replying here to her comment below
              </p>
              <blockquote>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 "and yet, you are still here.  Spewing vitriol."
                </li>
               </ul>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
               My simple answer to that is that I leave my criticisms here for other readers and researchers who may read through, so that they know more about what goes on here amoungst the mods, and to keep a record of it.  I have never had another name here and never deleted a comment.  If you read my comment history back all the way to soon after I joined, you can find a lot out about why this site is only half-functional to downright disfunctional (see the period of the week of protests March 18-25) with no good justification.  It is a fact that in many ways, top down decisions are made about how this site operates that work decidedly agaist the interests of a positive forward moving collaboration of interested citizens.
              </p>
              <p>
               In conversations with other dedicated activists, it is decided that part of the research of this entire subject includes a record of the history here at Voat, especially in light of how Reddit completely failed its users and betrayed them.
              </p>
              <p>
               I will continue to comment and criticize on this forum when appropriate as a part of my contribution to this effort; to keep putting the voice of the users of this site out there; to correct or add to the record as necessary.

             Thanks for explaining what I've been seeing but not fully comprehending. As far as free speech goes, just because you can, doesn't mean you should. That being said, I'm glad I can express myself as I want and unfortunately that extends to losers here too.

            You missed my point, and in a disrespectful way. To expect law enforcement dealing with CP or a few researchers here to remain stoic at every moment lest they show they're human, is unrealistic. Of course they laugh on occasion, certainly not about anything related to CP, but other things altogether. Doubling down by describing a community that has done incredible things to unravel the PG story as f****** psychopaths because of one lighthearted joke
            <strong>
             strictly about VOAT format
            </strong>
            which had
            <strong>
             absolutely nothing to do with PG
            </strong>
            is very disrespectful. If you want to add weight to your opinion, simply start contributing to VOAT/pizzagate with interesting content that may lead to quicker arrests and make your complaint again next April 1.

            Give consideration to all those well intentioned law enforcement officers who combat CP on a daily basis and actually see the worst things imaginable, far worse than any of us here have seen. If they didn't have an occasional laugh like the rest of the humans once the day ended, they'd go mad. A little levity for a brief moment will not disturb the unrelenting march of the PG research community, but your commitment is duly noted and appreciated.

              AB -- can you add the link to the Executive Summary in at the top of this post? Make it all big format headline with neon lights and everything? We probably should leave the sticky all day, given the reactions I'm seeing here.

            I like it. It really confuses me when I'm looking for useful topics, which is rather nice. I also like how the search bar expands across the entire page, and how the side bar is actually at the bottom. Maybe another idea would be to turn the page upside down and reverse the text, just to make life all the more easier.

                Okay, then this will kill pizzagate for me. The new look is so disorganized as to be unreadable. Sad. This was a great forum and nice home. Great meeting you, ThePuppetShow ... may our paths cross again.

             When one logs on they have most of the relevant info in front of them (the old layout)...now (or soon) instead of logging on and having the topic header, up/down vote, number of comments and a couple of other things to help you decide which threads to read or follow, there is nothing but a headline??? It seems to me that whoever made this decision has also made it more difficult for me (us)....to do what we do. Just saying...sometimes change is for the worst

             Yeah.  Had not had all my coffee and I went nuts sending a crazed PM to a couple people.  Thank God I found my way here.  I sure hope this is a Temp Trick!  Still will not believe until it returns.

               Well, I get the impression the Administrators were guilty of it.  I have calmed down, but it took me a while.  I reacted pretty wildly myself.

            I'm scared, it looks like too much work was spend on this to be just a joke. Notice, when you click on a headline it expands to display the post without loading new site... This requires quite some coding to be done that way... I'm usually always open for changes, even if the changes look bad at first, I'm always like "Hey, let's wait and have a look, maybe we need some time to understand the new concept and what could benefit from it." But in this case.... I'll riot! Please let it be joke...
