             I'm working on my other reply to you.  But yes, there is definitely an element on this board that is downvoating anything which is negative towards the jewish population, isreal, or anything that makes investigation not look like a ton of nut jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not actually anti-semitic, but I'm trying to shine a light on the fact that isreal has issues that it needs to stop hiding and deal with.  So, I get this a lot.  Unfortunately, much of what I link to is written by people that do have vitriol to the jewish population on a whole (not just the assholes in that group) and most people don't understand the difference between the jewish groups (like zionists, chabad cult, non-orthodox, etc.), so it all gets muddy.

              Yes, I am not prejudiced either, really against anyone (only the horrible criminals).  I also understand there are those that are perceived as Jewish and are really not.I have  a friend that was a nurse and she does not want to believe any of this.  I can understand for she is one of the kindest people on this planet.  She does not want to know that all of this was happening while she was doing good.  I am going to keep at it but don't know if I will ever succeed.

               Don't try to make her believe, you always have to flank people's knowledge.  I'd advise asking her questions about how somebody would go about doing this.  It will get her mind rolling over the question, point out how easy it is, while you may pull out some vital intel on the logistics of a system like this.

                Yes, I know it needs to be done incrementally not just dumping a bunch of info on her.  Also, I am German and abhor Jew hate.  So reading the article really did not have an outcome to change my mind, for I know that there can be horribly evil people of every stripe.  Sometimes the worst people are those that take advantage of their own kind.  It is all about the rich over poor no matter where they are from.  This is a global problem.

                 That comes to be the case, while I thought you were from isreal (because of a quote that you dropped in (and spacing)) I was trying to move sideways.  I do that.  Propaganda may not be my greatest weapon, but a sympathetic shoulder in the write place can be a nuke on the battle field.  I lied.  They're scum.

                 Always the worst people are those that hurt their own.  When you see your own blood as a useful pawn then you see humanity as nothing more than your own tool.

              I read almost the whole article.  I could not stomach any more of it.  The worst of it was the poor.  It gives me hope though that they prosecuted the guy in NJ.  But there has to be more done to discover that this is going on.  I believe as in Israel that they are taking the organs of soldiers since most of their families will not suspect our country to be robbing our veterans of organs.  Also, even if they suspect they cannot afford an autopsy.  Here is what they did in Israel.  I am hoping someone reads this  Little was done, however, and complaints continued – often by the parents of dead Israeli soldiers horrified to discover that body parts had been taken from their sons. Finally, in 2004 Israel’s health minister transferred directorship of the morgue itself away from Hiss. Hiss, however, retained his position as Israel’s chief pathologist, a post it appears he holds to this day.27, 28   OH the horribleness of this.  GOD help us.I believe if we can convince the people of this horror, then they will believe the rest.

               That's the gut response most people have.  It's part of the reason why it's not talked about very much, and thereby not believed.  You can't really bring up this type of subject in work, a dinner party, or any polite social event.

               That's the world we live in.  People sell their children so that the rest of the family can eat.  People are driven into desperation, and it has almost nothing to do with the population of the world.  Selling people has been going on for as long as man has existed.

               Probably, that's been a common method.  Large number of vets are homeless and I don't know about Isreal, but in the US they get free (although shitty) health care.  This puts them in a vulnerable position.  But, that's true for anybody that goes under the knife.  I would very much advise that you have somebody take you to the doctors any time you go into surgery.

               The best way to start talking to people about this is to point out Folan Gong's Chinese imprisonment issue.  That makes them believe that it can happen in the world.  You then just have to point the light at cases in whatever country.

             It is tied to the same model of rigged development deals in Racine, Wisconsin where the buildings are used by the elite for nefarious activities including trafficking and abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             They use rigged deals as another mechanism to control and blackmail others into corruption and complicity, or control them through debt.
            </p>
            <p>
             The RICO cases in Racine, Wisconsin that were obstructed by Loretta Lynch were one key that would have unlocked the bigger network linked with the Clinton Foundation, McCain Foundation and many others, and exposed how racketeering and rigged development deals are directly tied to secret societies, trafficking, abuse and harvesting.

              I just myself noticed this was an IRS case, thus RICO.  This is in a way gives me some hope.  How can this be forced now?  If this transpired during the BO years, can we achieve this now under Trump?  This also included the FBI so we would need them to work together on this again.  What hope is this for happening?

               There will never be justice in a broken and corrupt system. We learned the hard way. They are well above the laws, they control the courts, and they have many layers of insulation, contingency plans, and fall guys in place. They simply change strategies and roles as needed to shift the game. Do not fall for the hope of Trump. He is involved in the same networks.
