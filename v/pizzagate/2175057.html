            Before colobama just an interesting piece of info. I think I discovered the origin of the infamous "domino mask" that I wrote the thread about. The thread about the word "domino" in podesta's wikileaks email dump. I think it was Phoenician armor. It served as both a disguise and a symbol of terror because it was battle armor.

            I have a couple of different theories about genetic deformities the ruling class had centuries or thousands of years ago. Among them are dolicephalic skulls (elongated skull), cranial deformity, perhaps high incidence of cleft palet, and eye problems.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            I'm beginning to think the colobama might possibly be both genetic and a result of torture. Electroshock and torture will cause a condition known as Traumatic Iritis and it can look like Colobama. Ritual abuse victims are shocked at the base of the brain, top of the neck, on regular basis to wipe out their short term memory.

           <p>
            Pictures of traumatic iritis. Interesting enough some of the colobama effects look like STARS. Ritual abuse victims are often told that they are special, and that THEY ARE RISING STARS in the cult.

            There is something done to victims that causes problems in one eye, usually the left eye, but I don't know exactly what they do to people to cause it, I only know that it has been reported by victims, and I looked at pictures of powerful families and many of them have a lazy eye. One of the symptoms of this abuse is a "lazy eye" although I know people with a lazy eye that have never been abused. This could become confusing with the introduction of electroshock in the industrial age. Determing between the two is something I don't know how to do.

            Interestingly also is that there is evidence that the Phoenicians symbols and artifacts, who most likely descended from the Canaanites, and at the very least consorted with them, (talmud, cabalism) were found in Europe and they date a few centuries before Christ.

             Coloboma is discovered at birth it does not develop. It is part of screening in newborns. It is also linked to RH-bloodlines. In fact I do not believe a case has been found of coloboma in Rhesus positive people.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is part of the C.A.R.I.S.  System. Congenital Anomaly ?? I will have to find the thread. Because the blood of these children is so rare and adults with this bloodline can only accept the same type in transfusion for instance. Babies are placed on an International Registry and their whereabouts are tracked. They will even fly directly to get blood donations in rare instances. But this type highly valued.
            </p>
            <p>
             I wondered if Madeline McCann was registered in this system at birth so kidnapping her would be easy through tracking. Also the other children in JA Instagram.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think that might be possible but also believe these children are test tube babies created in a Petri dish from chosen genetic lines and then carried through surrogacy.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are historical accounts that Dr. Mengele who was a master of genetics either saved or obtained Hitler's sperm and created many children that were moved into certain places in US and other countries political positions to eventually bring about the forth Reich....it might seem ou there but Dr. Mengele had an entire village of identical twins he created in Argentina. Many believe as do I Hitler and Eva Braun were brought to Argentina with the other NAZI leaders through Operation Paperclip.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is evidence they had at least one daughter but most likely two. Additionally there is a documentary called Hitler's boys that is fascinating.

              I think they might be cloning them. There is a law against cloning for a reason. The reason is because people ARE CLONING other people. Dolly the sheep was successfully cloned in the late 90's and technology has come a long way. Mengele was fascinated with twins.

              You talking about 0 negative? I think 0 neg might play a part in this. The founder of The Society Of Jesus (Jesuits) was from the Basque Country. It is an autonimous country with its own language spoken no other place. The Basque Country has possibly the highest rates of 0 neg and B neg in the world.

              You referring to the blonde headed twins? I think Hitler died in Argentina of old age. I forgot the name of the town. There is a guy that does a tour group named "Shark Hunters" that goes over there to the Eagles Nest and other places and investigates all that. I'm thinking HIlter died in that area of old age.

               Here is an article on the Hitler's Boys of Brazille this was made into a movie that one three academy awards in 1978....you realize and I hope others now see that Hollywood scripts are supplied and funded by intelligence agencies. Several actors were actually CIA agents much like Anderson Cooper of CNN.....operation Mockingbird. I will link a clip.

            This pic of a kid who looks like he has Coloboma.  What is interesting is the advertising is from Mellow Mushroom pizza. Very suspect place with lots of Satanical imagery.  Corp took down all their incriminating pics after I posted. This whole place goes down the rabbit hole for sure.
