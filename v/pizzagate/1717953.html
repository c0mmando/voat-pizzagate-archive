What I have found by studying these claims at nauseam is that the Michael Jackson allegations have a great deal in common with other elite child abuse claims. MJ used his wealth, power, influence and fame to avoid jail time. He also used in my opinion both paid and unpaid trolls to bully, harass and intimidate anyone who dared to present the side of the victims. Michael Jackson also used his employees and staff to facilitate and enable a great deal of his behavior. The greatest similarity in these cases with the MJ allegations is the theory of Cognitive Dissonance. What this theory states is that people have a difficult time equating to polarizing views to one individual. Example because MJ gave a great deal to charities involving children and spent a great deal of time helping disadvantaged and disenfranchised youth, he couldn\'t possibly be a child predator.

            Hear, hear!  CD is a huge problem.  It never ceases to amaze how adults can cast people as "white hat" or "black hat."  That oversimplification is what children do.
           </p>
           <p>
            Another example is JFK.  "Since he was assassinated, he must have been a good guy (white hat)."  He has been martyred.

             Never really followed the controversy around Michael Jackson, so can't really comment on one way or another whether i think he really did it, or he was framed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yesterday heard this song from MJ though:
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqWXAK-pAdA">
              Michael Jackson - They Don't Care About Us Lyrics
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             There was some controversy surrounding the lyrics, especially the "jew me, kike me"-part. This was released after the first allegations of child-abuse though. (First was in '93-'94?, the song was released in '96). So there might be something to the theory of him being framed, as rape-allegations/child-abuse etc seem to be something that are used to try to take some people down. (Trump and Assange lately).

            Michael Jackson never abused anyone. That was a very poorly done made-to-look-like MJ. Another damn imposter look-alike wannabe who stole his identity &amp; his wealth. They are everywhere. Look closer.

              Right...it's perfectly normal for altruistic beings to turn themselves in to homely zombies &amp; abuse children. #MSM has fooled everyone.

               I Think you need to read my comments on cognitive dissonance, Yes it is extremely common for altruistic beings to harm others. Many priests who have done great deeds of charity have also raped children. Pedophilia is a sexual disorder that happens among all social strata and yes even people who may in many different ways be charitable, giving, altruistic may also abuse children, It also depends on the mindset of the perpetrator. Many pedophiles believe what they are doing is not harming the child but just another expression of their love.

                Michael Jackson was love. He wouldn't hurt anyone. That was a sick imposter. Everyone will know someday. Mark these words.
