            Has anyone been able to actually identify this house as being on Turkey Run Road?  I'm guessing it is a newer build, and may not be on sat imagery.
           </p>
           <p>
            Weird inconsistencies - The house is owned by UAE, but reported as Saudi; 2 dogs were rescued - last time I checked, Muslims aren't into dogs; the address of 800 Turkey Run Road comes up with different owners - check Fairfax County Real Estate Assessors office -

            Not a contributor, just a voyeur. Yet, if you really consider trafficking from a business aspect, they have to sell organs harvested fro freshly offed victims.
It is how they kept the silence. 
How rich fucks get organs for their failing, decrepit bodies. 
How maximum profit is reached. 
Think of hot dogs and baloney from end cuts of meat. Pig lips and chicken wing gristle.
 Think of Oil companies and plastic usage, the plastic leeches out poisons over time but hey..long term profits achieved!. Think of the studies about EICs and our children's neurotransmitters and receptors being fucked up from things we ingest.Think of dairies using product for formula, to feed to babies that doctors suggest formula for.
All they care about is profits. Ruthless greed.
Once you accept that people are pimping and profiting off of humans, then the rest isn't that big of a leap.
This isn't just CP or Pedocracy crap. This is a literal meat market.
 How else do so many kids and people just disappear every year?
To serve 'man'. &lt;play Twilight Zone Theme&gt;

            I come from a large, wealthy family who used to own their main home in this neighborhood. In the 50s or 60s the Kennedys also lived somewhere around there. I don't know if this is Internet verifiable- this is just what I was always told. My family has a long, hidden history of sexual abuse. Two of them who aren't biologically related married each other legally. The others laughed.
           </p>
           <p>
            My mom went to work in my dad's family's house as a nanny in the 1970s and was passed around. She was mentally ill and had already had shock treatment for drugs and mental illness. Some of the sons and grandsons (the abusing ones) in my family went on to work for the government. One person in my family is a celebrity. We have a heavy "do not talk" tone in our family, even among ourselves. It's long been a family joke that even at reunions there are always people there that no one knows or bothers to introduce.
           </p>
           <p>
            My older cousins told me that at the McLean "country" house, there were always non-family people hanging around, cars lined up in the driveway, and it was a "party" atmosphere. They said my grandfather didn't seem to care what was going on there. He was in a high position in a utilities company. It always seemed kind of odd to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of my cousins still lived up there. He was a really nice guy, but his parents are creepy, his dad is a sexual abuser. My cousin disappeared and years later his skeleton was found in the woods. Story was that he was involved in drug trafficking and that he got in over his head, killed himself to save his family. Kind of weird. His brother moved in with his wife as soon as he went missing. Started showing up with her to family functions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Maybe what gives me the creeps the most about that area is that it is supposedly elite and expensive, but it just looks like a bunch of regular houses in the woods to me. Which makes me wonder what kind of people are living there. If you're wealthy and you want to live in a nice neighborhood, wouldn't you look for a fancy house in a plush neighborhood? Not something kind cheap and scummy? It kind of looks to me like the people who live there are looking for people like themselves to surround them, with woods as coverage. The house condition is a secondary consideration. That bothers me.

            Were these women being held against their will? Were there others?

            As is typical with these stories, we never hear the ending. Probably because nothing serious ever happened.

            We kick out Russian diplomats over unsubstantiated rumors, lies, and innuendo....yet the Saudis traffick slaves in and nothing done to them.

            This is way too close to CIA HQ for no one to have noticed what was going on. This is sus af. I think the DOJ should get solid leads and surreptitiously set up hunting cams in and around the area so they have documented movements before a raid. A little misinformation on their part could go a long way considering how many pedos are imbedded in the gov. A lot of the wmn from here move to the ME (SA, Qatar, UAE) for work as maids and they almost always get sexually abused by everyone in the household.
