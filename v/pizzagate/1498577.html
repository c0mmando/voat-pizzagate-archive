            It was low because families were stronger. In a strong family the father was actually caring for the daughter and she wasn't out slutting around at ten years old. And if someone had sex with someone's daughter without the father's consent there would be big problems. Of course, this still allowed marriages to be arranged at a young age for the benefits of the family at the expense of the daughter.
            <br/>
            In short age of consent was low because women were property and subject to the protection of whatever man they belonged to.

            MANY horrific things were legal hundreds of years ago.  Our ancestors were generally European outcasts and were batshit crazy. People married (and died) at much younger ages back then. 7 is very young but typically, they were marrying other young boys (the girl's age is generally what is being referenced by these minimum ages) often for economic reasons, particularly if you were poor, which nearly everyone was back then. That meant fewer kids for the parents to feed. They also almost all had jobs. ETA: another post below mentioned ownership - yes, females were property and had few rights - certainly no rights to their own property.
           </p>
           <p>
            There were certainly older men taking advantage of this - no doubt about that. I've come across a few stories like that. One really difficult read is an account of a pedo abuse ring in France from the 1800s - a group of 3 men married each other's young daughters and used them for their ring and acquired 30 or so other very young kids: 120 Days of Sodom

            There's a sociologist that lived with a native tribe and took a 12 year old wife, had kids and the whole bit.  When his grown half native sone went to visit the tribe, the son was offered two 14 year olds as wives.  The tribe was very disappointed when he adinamty refused. The two girls did their best to have him marry and impregnate them.  Every culture especially native has different ideology on sex.
           </p>
           <p>
            Women who are young and fertile are offers to the strongest male to produce as many offspring as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            The issue with pedos is the rape, seduction infliction of pain for pure selfish reasons. It's about power. even the term pedophilia is too mild for what these freaks do
           </p>
           <p>
            Abe Lincoln left school in sixth grade and went to work. Kids worked in factories and had different responsibilities.
So ideology was different.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is predatory rape, physical and mental abuse covers under man boy love bullshit.
If these pedos did his shit with adult women it's called rape and abuse. A child can't give consent to this shit. Abuse of power and trust.

            If you listen to Jay Parker, who grew up in Arden, Delaware, you will discover some things about the area that are sinister.  You only have to watch the first minute to find out what he grew up in.

            Pre-marital Sex in general was taboo back then, so age off consent laws were less relevant than they are today, because if you were fucking somebody then they were your spouse anyway.

             Is that actually true though? That's what I more or less thought too, but when I ask myself for proof of that, I don't have much. I have movies made in the 50s that seem to want me to think that, but not much else.

              I'm mostly going off of historical books and movies I've seen that paint this kind of picture (i.e. sex with slave women was admissible because they were seen as property rather than people, sailors were seen as taboo for their promiscuity, high class women were abstinent, etc.). The 1880's would have been around the Victorian era and the general consensus is that it was a relatively sexually reserved time. I couldn't point to any real historical evidence to confirm or deny my point, but maybe someone will come along who can.

               Jeffrey Masson is a scholar who wrote an important book about Freud and "Hysteria" - a "disease" which supposedly afflicted women in the 19th c. and which does not exist anymore. Freud's patients all had this "disease" (It was because it was thought that woman did not experience orgasm. - so their inhibited sexuality made them high -strung.) and these women sufferers were his original patients.
              </p>
              <p>
               ( This also connects to the development of the vibrator - which was used as a remedy for "hysteria" - but no one connected it consciously to sex [the doctors must have known/ right?] until the 1920' when the vibrator was used in early pornography - then they took it out of the Sears Catalog. The vibrator was one of the first electric items offered in the that mail - order store. But it was for hygiene, not sex.- )
              </p>
              <p>
               Women also had to wear very tight and small corsets, which also was not good for their health. Even in my lifetime, in the South, if a woman didn't wear a girdle, and then was raped, it was considered her fault for "asking for it" or being provocative. When I was a girl, females could not wear pants to school. Skirts were the rule.
              </p>
              <p>
               Masson worked on the Freud letters and discovered that originally Freud admitted that these woman sufferers / patients had been molested by older relatives. Freud changed his theory to "Wish Fulfillment" i.e. the woman desired sex with their fathers so they imagined it was taking place.
              </p>
              <p>
               Masson was shunned by society and had to sue the New Yorker magazine for defamation and libel. -

               The Freud family is connected to #Pizzagate as you likely know. I'd give you more citations but my site was vandalized. -

                  Perhaps, but some people might want to wait a few years after marriage to have children. This might be a relic of people marrying two families together also.

            I read that in Japan the age of consent is 13. I think in France it might still be 14 or 15 also I think spain might be 14 but I'm not sure.
           </p>
           <p>
            Someone get a Wikipedia article on it. If I'm correct those are still very young to be having sex. Far too young. It's 16 here in the UK.

            In 1896 my great-grand parents got married at 15. So I guess it would depend on how old the other person was. If the male was 13 (which was basically considered an adult back then) then 10 would not be as out of line as it seems now.

             In a case by case basis only, but the larger point is the legality of it. So what I'm trying to point out, legally, it was ok for a 50 year old person to have sex with a 10 year old person.  As in, if it went to court, it wasn't illegal.

              While technically legal, that much of an age difference would be viewed with much the same disgust as it is today.

            Up until 2001 Hawaii's age of consent was only 14. Than it got raised to 16. In fact, there's alot of states in the U.S. who have their ages set to 16 instead of 18 like most people think

            I didn't know this. Helps me understand my ancestry a little better although the family story is still a bit sick and twisted.
           </p>
           <p>
            My Great Great Grandmother, Julia Howerton, was traded at 10 yrs old for 40 acres to an older man named Elijah (Lige) David Robinson. Julia married at 10 and had her first child at 12.  There were 3 children in total, one named Sarah, died young.
           </p>
           <p>
            When Julia was 17/18 she tied my Great Grandmother (Ethel Robinson) and Great Uncle (Lonny Robinson) to a tree and told them to take care of each other and ran off. I can't imagine living back then and being treated as property. Julia had no rights to her children and her only escape was to leave them behind.
           </p>
           <p>
            My Great Grandmother Ethel and Great Uncle Lonny were taken care of by the Robinson family. Elijah Lige Robinson remarried. I have found my Great Uncle living with Elijah Robinson's brother working on a farm at 16, but nothing else in the census.
           </p>
           <p>
            Flash forward to many years later and my Great Grandmother Ethel decides to hunt her real mother down.  (Lonny never saw his mother again) She ends up visiting in South Dakota where Julia now lives and had remarried to a George Anderson. She says that Julia is very cold toward her (she stayed a week-her and her husband) and that she was dark complexion (possibly 1/2 Native American?) and how she found out she was traded to an older man for 40 acres.
           </p>
           <p>
            So far, I have had no luck finding Julia's real parents or lineage yet or figuring out what 40 acres she was traded for. They say Elijah worked on the railroad but that's all the info I have. Sad family history...

             Yeah, realities were different back then, so we can't judge people by the same standards we use today (I'm not a moral relativist btw). But my big thing, in relation to pizzagate, is that, if a 50 year old man had sex with a 10 year old girl, and it went to court, legally, just the fact that he did it, it couldn't be used to lock him up.  Like, it sucks to think about, but today, if a poor family coerced their 10 year old daughter to marry a rich man to forgive a debt, you'd understand (technically), and even then, it would still be illegal. It wouldn't be back then.

             Fascinating history - a tough research, no doubt. Speaking of trading people as property - have you read The American Slave Coast? Parts of it are being challenged as factual but overall, it's the most stunning piece on the slave trade I've ever read. It covers in astonishing detail the specific economics of the slave trade (which was what the Civil War was really about - not the inhumanity of slave ownership) and how family lineages were completely destroyed - namely for females at incredibly young ages, just as with your GG Grandmother. Once they were traded/owned, they lost their father's names and the lineage was severed forever and were often separated from their children. What was also remarkable to me was that there were just a few differences between the slaves and many white women back then.

              I haven't read it, but I will look into it. My ancestors were share croppers in Arkansas and Oklahoma, some moving west to California during the dust bowl like in Grapes of Wrath for a better life. I would love to know more about the history of my GG Grandmother's time to know what possibly would have caused her family to trade her for land. What was happening at that time in 1880s that was so bad to trade one of your own children for land. Perhaps her parents were gone and someone else was caring for her? I hope to find out one day.  Thank you!

            Right? It kind of freaked me out, because what was going on in society so that they would set the age that low?  I'm starting to think things were a lot different than what we've been told. The other day I was watching an interview of Shelby Foote, a noted Lincoln scholar/writer. He was asked about the well known fact that Lincoln shared a bed in Springfield with his business partner, of course, another man.
           </p>
           <p>
            He answered this question with a strange story. He talked about a young homosexual man who asked him about the same thing who stated to him "The idea that Lincoln might have been gay is very important for many people in my community." Foote just told him, "If you want to think he was gay, then you should." The young man pressed him for a definite answer and all foote would give him was "back then it wouldn't* seem strange to anyone that 2 men slept together".
           </p>
           <p>
            I used to have this notion that the 1800s were, morally, like the 50s but on steroids or something like that. I'm not so sure anymore.
