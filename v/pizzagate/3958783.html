            Well I was going to start a thread but I see suspicions around Christian B are already around. So I'l post my thoughts here.
           </h2>
           <p>
            Is this Christian B guy a scapegoat in the Maddie McCann case?
           </p>
           <p>
            First off it's like some cheesy heist movie script. His former burglary accomplice says he was:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             nicknamed “The Climber’’ as he was so good at breaking into holiday apartments
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            :rolleyes: wow, how convenient for your story.
           </p>
           <p>
            He's apparently been twice convicted of sex crimes against young girls, though they don't say how old the girls were. They've referred to him as a paedo, but we all know that word gets used for guys involved with teens. For example his former accomplice says that the usual age of Christian B's girlfriends was 15. That is not paedophilia. Then there's this conviction for raping a 72 year old woman. Apparently there is video evidence of this crime but Christian B has been allowed to appeal the charge. How does that work if they have video evidence? Why would a paedo rape an old woman?
           </p>
           <p>
            The only thing they've currently got him on is drug offences, for which he's spending 21 months in prison for. In one article The Sun reels off a list of missing children and simply say he's "been linked to them" by the police. Which means nothing really. In one paragraph it says he has a
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             total of 17 convictions, including burglary.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            The drug offences must make up some of the other 17. Yet no mention is made of abduction, murder, sexual assault of minors. All more serious charges which you'd think the story would prefer to highlight over mundane burglaries.
           </p>
           <p>
            The guy is being linked to a string missing children over the past 25 years. Starting from when he would've been 18/19. Yet all they've got is him on drug offences and a conviction for raping an old woman hanging over him. It all begs the question of whether this guy is just being used as a scapegoat in this very suspicious story.

            Canada seems to be a hotbed for military MK ultra style brainwashing. When reading the part above that stated they went to Phuket on a Christmas trip I wanted to vomit. You know these people are NOT celebrating Christmas, they are anti Christian and who in their right mind would want to go to Phuket on Christmas besides satanists, Luciferians, Kabbalah and the like, etc... so you know they were up to some serious crimes against children during their high satanic ritual date, my guess would be murder, torture, rape of innocent children and Phuket Thailand is where there are plenty of street kids sadly.

             <p>
              David Russell Williams[1] (born March 7, 1963) is a British-born Canadian convicted murderer and former colonel in the Canadian Forces. From July 2009 until his arrest in February 2010, Williams commanded CFB Trenton, Canada's largest military airbase and a hub for the country's foreign and domestic air transport operations. He was also a decorated military pilot who had flown Canadian Forces VIP aircraft for dignitaries such as Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, and the Governor General and the Prime Minister of Canada...
             </p>
             <p>
              David Russell Williams was born in Bromsgrove, England, to Christine Nonie (née Chivers) and Cedric David Williams. His family emigrated to Canada, where they moved to Chalk River, Ontario. His father was hired as a metallurgist at Chalk River Laboratories, Canada's premiere nuclear research laboratory.[10][11][12] After this relocation, the Williams family met another family, the Sovkas, and they became good friends. Williams' parents divorced when he was six years old, and soon after, Nonie Williams married Dr. Jerry Sovka. During this time, Williams took the name Sovka from his stepfather, and moved again to Scarborough, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto.
             </p>
             <p>
              While in the Scarborough Bluffs area, Williams began high school at Birchmount Collegiate, but finished at Upper Canada College. He delivered The Globe and Mail newspaper and learned to play the piano. By 1979, his family moved to South Korea, where Sovka was overseeing another reactor project. Williams completed his final two years of high school as a boarding student at Upper Canada College while his parents were in South Korea. In his final year in 1982, he was selected as a prefect for his boarding house.
             </p>

               While a young, fresh-faced Russell Williams was a student attending Toronto's elite Upper Canada College in the early '80s, a housemaster of the boarding school was quietly sexually assaulting some of the boys. The housemaster, Douglas Brown, would eventually be convicted in 2004 of indecent assaults dating between 1975 and 1980. The teenaged Williams, who spent his last two years of high school, 1980 to 1982, at UCC while his parents were living overseas, would graduate and move on, eventually joining Canada's armed forces to become one of the military's top commanders.... The coincidence – Williams, a boarder at the school at the same time Brown was molesting students – is hard to ignore although there is currently no evidence indicating they, in fact, crossed paths. Brown, who remained at UCC until 1993, was reached by the Star. He said he never had any contact with Williams.

              ..From December 2005 to May 2006, Williams also served as the commanding officer of Camp Mirage, a secretive logistics facility believed to be located at Al Minhad Air Base in Dubai, United Arab Emirates that provides support to Canadian Forces operations in Afghanistan.... On July 15, 2009, Williams was sworn in as the Wing Commander at CFB Trenton.. Located in Trenton, Ontario, the base also functions as the point of arrival for the bodies of all Canadian Forces personnel killed in Afghanistan, and the starting point for funeral processions along the "Highway of Heroes" whence their bodies are brought to Toronto for autopsy.

              </p>
              <p>
               The charges against Lorne Cook stemmed in large part from simulated kidney-transplant exercises he devised for his adolescent students -- experiments that in 1993 helped him secure the Prime Minister's Award for Excellence, rewarding achievements in education.
              </p>
              <p>
               ....Other incidents were part of an accelerated learning method called "super learning" -- also developed by Mr. Cook -- which entailed breathing exercises and relaxation techniques in loosened clothing.
              </p>
              <p>
               Mr. Cook's verdict is the latest in a string of old child-sex criminal cases at UCC. Last year, former teacher Douglas Brown, now 56, was sentenced to three years imprisonment for sexually assaulting six students during the mid-1970s.
              </p>
              <p>
               In 2004, onetime teaching assistant Ashley Chivers, now 30, was convicted of possessing child pornography. Arrested a year earlier while still on staff, he initially escaped incarceration, in lieu of a conditional 18-month sentence, but was subsequently jailed for violating his terms of house arrest.
              </p>
              <p>
               And there were other scandals.
              </p>
              <p>
               Teacher Clark Noble left UCC in 1971 after a 17-year-old boy accused him of sodomizing him after getting him drunk at a private club. Rather than being prosecuted, Mr. Noble was allowed to leave quietly. He taught elsewhere and in 1997, was convicted of an assault on a boy at Appleby College in Oakville.
              </p>
              <p>
               Most recently, in December, a 70-year-old former UCC house master was acquitted on six charges of assaulting a student under his care during the 1980s. The judge made plain he did not believe the former student's testimony.
              </p>
              <p>
               ....Much of Mr. Cook's testimony wasn't believable, the judge found.....He was nonetheless acquitted of a charge of sexual interference, which arose from
               <strong>
                one of the mock kidney transplant sessions
               </strong>
               , because of insufficient evidence Mr. Cook's motives were sexual -- a key component of the charge...Mr. Cook was hired by UCC in 1979 as a science master. He later took over the department and held the position until he retired in 1994.
              </p>
              <p>
               <strong>
                After retiring, he taught undergraduate courses at the University of Toronto until his arrest in 2004.
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               ..Other prosecutions: Other Upper Canada College teachers faced prosecution on sex-crime charges in the past two years.
              </p>
              <p>
               Herbert Sommerfeld, a former teacher and dorm supervisor, was acquitted in December, 2005, of allegations he sexually abused a student decades earlier. The music and math instructor retired in 1996. Now in his 70s, he faces a civil lawsuit brought by an alleged victim.
              </p>
              <p>
               Douglas Brown, a former teacher and dormitory housemaster, was convicted in 2004 of nine counts of indecent assault involving six students from 1975 to 1980.
              </p>
              <p>
               He was sentenced to three years in prison; the conviction is under appeal.
              </p>
              <p>
               Ashley Chivers was convicted in 2004 of possessing child pornography and given an 18-month conditional sentence. He was a teaching assistant from 1995, until his arrest in 2003.

              <p>
               Upper Canada College was founded in 1829 by then-Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, Major-General Sir John Colborne (later Lord Seaton), to serve as a feeder school to the newly established King's College (
               <strong>
                later the University of Toronto
               </strong>
               ).
               <strong>
                It was modelled on the great public schools of Britain, most notably Eton.
               </strong>
              </p>
              <p>
               ..UCC welcomed the first woman to its Board of Governors in 1971 with the appointment of Pauline Mills McGibbon,[17] although she resigned in 1974 upon her appointment to the post of Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario. Five years following her departure, UCC celebrated its 150th anniversary in the presence of the
               <strong>
                College's Official Visitor, Prince Philip
               </strong>
               , at the College's first Association Day..
              </p>
              <p>
               ..In 1991, UCC was visited by the Hungarian President Árpád Göncz, who would soon after enrol his grandson at the school,[20] and
               <strong>
                in 1993, Prince Philip again visited
               </strong>
               to officially open the Foster Hewitt Athletic Centre, the Eaton Building, as well as the rebuilt College gates, the Mara Gates, at the foot of the main avenue...
              </p>
              <p>
               ..The publication of the book had an effect on the College, both in its internal structure, as well as its relationship with the broader community.
               <strong>
                Peter Dalglish, the founder of Street Kids International, criticised the school heavily
               </strong>
               in his interview for Old Boys, where he said "A prime failing of UCC is that they have no sense of being a part of a community within the city or country. The school has to change; it is still very upper middle class."
               <strong>
                Subsequently, he was hired by the College to change school culture.
               </strong>
               Under his direction, along with Nanci Goldman, the former Toronto Board co-ordinator of inner city services, UCC students have since been partnered with inner city Toronto kids in the College's Horizon program..
              </p>
              <p>
               By around 1919, the UCC Cadets became compulsory, and principal Grant asked the army district headquarters if the Corps could be presented with Colours, both the King's Colour and College Colour. The College Colour was given by Elanor Gooderham in 1921.[...For thirty following years, the Cadets remained a part of College life, and by the middle of the Second World War boys were practising not only drills, but also spent time on lectures, map reading, military law, and signalling...In 1977, the voluntary Royal Canadian Army Cadets helped organize a course in military science at UCC, which also included battle drill, field craft, weapons training, and some parade-square drill. But, by the mid-1980s, interest in this programme had fallen to a bare minimum, and today UCC provides no formal military training.

            <p>
             Sherborne Preparatory School in Dorset was one of the country’s top private schools of its kind, where the elite paid thousands for their children to be readied to take their place at schools like Sherborne, Eton and Harrow. What their parents didn't know was that they were paying a paedophile who for 30 years preyed on the children he was supposed to be looking after...
            </p>
            <p>
             Joanna Brittan's father, Major Peter Brittan, first went out to Qatar in 1971 and helped establish the Qatar Emiri Air Force.
            </p>
            <p>
             The former Britannia Royal Naval College naval officer cadet and Fleet Air Arm pilot was forced to medically retire from the Armed Forces and went on to become chief test pilot for the Qataris, seeing action during the Gulf War...
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr Brittan sent his three sons to Sherborne Prep and two of them on to Sherborne School, when he and their mother were living in Qatar.
            </p>
            <p>
             He was a regular visitor to Lindsay’s prep school, as well as to Sherborne Boys and Sherborne Girls, where his four children were educated at various times. Some visits coincided with a period when he led delegations from Qatar to negotiate buying helicopters from Westland, based at Yeovil, just a few miles from Sherborne, whilst staying at the Post House Hotel in the Dorset town.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ms Brittan believes that her father’s links to Qatar, and his recommendations of the Sherborne school system to the state’s rulers, was one of the influences that prepared the ground for the eventual establishment in 2009 of Sherborne Qatar - an independent school based on the Sherborne model with junior and senior departments, in the Qatar capital Doha.
            </p>
            <p>
             Members of the Qatari ruling family, including current emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, were sent to Sherborne International, a satellite of the senior school, which offers an intensive education for overseas students whose first language is not English. The promotion of British education as a potentially lucrative export was championed by Prince Andrew the year before Sherborne Qatar opened.
            </p>
            <p>
             Qatar has the highest per capita income in the world, its wealth deriving from gas exports. The nation, which hosts a giant U.S. military base, has been politically isolated by other Middle East states including Saudi Arabia, who accuse it of being too close to Iran and Islamist groups including ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood.

             A couple of years ago, I was briefly involved with Pitch@Palace – Prince Andrew's initiative to link up fledgeling businesses with investors. On Friday, the Duke of York quit the project following a wave of criticism surrounding his connection to Jeffrey Epstein. But from what I saw of the scheme, the Prince has more questions to answer than just those arising from their friendship. Pitch@Palace appears to have been a vehicle for Prince Andrew to enrich himself at the cost of the hardworking entrepreneurs he claimed to be helping.
