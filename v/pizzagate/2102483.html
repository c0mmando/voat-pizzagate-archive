           Why is a supposedly scientific facility holding "mock" ritual human sacrifices? Because  ritual killing is so far outside the comprehension of most sane individuals that even after pizzagate, people do not believe that this is a regular practice of the elite. This aspect of pizzagate which is by far one of the most legitimate and verifiable falls by the wayside because it is not part of a more understandable but no less horrific scenario involving run-of-the-mill pedophile rings.

           This is extremely troubling because CERN has previously been known for its blatantly satanic rituals including the Gotthard Tunnel opening "ceremony."
