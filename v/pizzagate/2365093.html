            Yes, 'allowed.'  My role here is to enforce rules decided on by the community.  What word would you prefer?  Are you really going to police my choice of words?  Has everyone here lost their minds?

            <p>
             Your job is not to determine what "gets to stay" but rather weed out posts that A) don't cite sources and B) don't explain relevance.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            My job is to decide what "gets to stay" based on whether it meets the rules, so what are you even saying?  It seems you're stubbornly trying to avoid acknowledging that allowing users to repost removed submissions allows them to flout the rules.  Maybe all this focus on my perfectly appropriate choice of words is actually a bit of projection, because you seem to have abandoned logic in order to posture for dominance.

            <p>
             I agree that it was a dick move of the user to throw you under the bus like that, but that isn't justification to pull the post.

           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Throw me under the bus?  Again, I pulled the post because he re-linked the removed submission.  Stop trying to make it something that it's not.  If the
            <em>
             community
            </em>
            wants to
            <em>
             allow
            </em>
            users to link deleted submissions, it's fine with me, but it would need to be discussed in a sticky.   I think even raising the question would be ridiculous, though, because if users can re-link deleted submissions on the main sub, the rules are nearly pointless.  I would probably in fact resign as a mod if that were to be
            <em>
             allowed
            </em>
            .  The shills and trolls would have a field day.

              It seems you're stubbornly trying to avoid acknowledging that allowing users to repost removed submissions allows them to flout the rules.

             That is what posters have been instructed to do. Modify and repost. This was clearly a good faith effort on OPs part. He didn't post crazy NASA space alien shit so you can just stop using that as an excuse. If you can't tell the difference then you do not need to mod.

            I understand that, but that doesn't mean they should be allowed to essentially repost them.   What's the point of the rules if users can sidestep them by posting a link to their removed submission?  I think what I was asking of the submitter was also easy and straight-forward.  If users want to vent and raise moderation concerns, they should do it in the appropriate place (i.e. /pizzagatemods), as I always direct them, or in the comments.  Linking to the removed post just flouts the rules.

            !) to this post and the previous one and tried to make sense of what went down and still am not quite clear where we ended up. The original thread looked legit to me, and it appeared that efforts were made to meet the submission rules (to me, whether it's disinfo or true, Hampstead is clearly pizzagate-related). It didn't jump out at me as being swiss cheese intentionally full of holes with a bunch of unsourced claims, especially when the second version went up with the additional links.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's my understanding we don't remove such posts, even if we think they might be disinfo. We flair them as such and point out the problems. Removal really does nothing to fight shills. It just gives them ammo to claim censorship. (

            , I am not implying you are shill...I'm speaking in general terms).
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally would like someone to make a Hampstead megathread rounding up all the research that's been done and weighing it disinfo vs. real. The kids seemed coached to me and not traumatized when I watched their video. And there have definitely been suspicious accounts flogging this topic in the past (again, not you OP). I once thought it had been debunked. But I honestly couldn't say, now, because new research keeps turning up like this that make me wonder.

              The original post had clear rule violations.  The second one linked to the deleted post, which, as I explained to kevdude and Vindicator, is something that can't be allowed, because it would be a major gaping loophole in the rules.

             The original post clearly broke rules 2 and 3. I'm not going to repeat myself on that as my comment is in the original thread.  The new post linked to the original deleted post, which is a bad precedent to allow as it sidesteps the rules, not to mention that he said he "highly recommend[s] the comments," which consisted almost wholly of complaints about the removal (dishonest complaints at that).  He is fine to repost it as long as he doesn't link to the original removed post.  He has no legitimate reason to do that. Ask yourself why he did it in the first place.  Ask yourself why he hasn't already simply reposted without the link to the original thread.  Shills (and that persistent shill/troll who loves the subjects of Hampstead, NASA, and aliens) would LOVE us to set the precedent that they can link to removed submissions.

            . He has set an unusually high bar that he does not think OP can meet. Technically OP did not violate rule 4 because he did not complain, all he did was point to the reason he reposted. But just to let Falcon have that victory that is easily fixed by not doing it again.

            Now he is demanding that a victim be identified by positive ID when he knows it would take a birth certificate to meet his demands. We post about people all the time in name only even when we have multiple people with the same name. Then the narrowing process starts and people start ruling out individuals that don't fit the criteria. That is why this is known as a RESEARCH SUB. We want to know if this guy was really a victim or if somebody made it up. It will take several talented people to come up with the answer.

            I don't see anything wrong with that because we know Christ Church's history already. We research a lot of Hillary's victims with only a name, and we do it regularly. Why can't we do the same on Christ Church?

            is saying he does not know if Aaron is a victim or not. He needs to prove that Aaron is not a victim or back up out of the way and let us prove it.

              Your associations and curiosity are perfectly reasonable. As far as I am concerned the burden of proof should be flipped to Falcon and force him to prove his case. Just because the perps are trying to slander a potential victim is not proof of Falcon's theory. Falcon is supposed to back up and let us investigate but on Christ Church he will fight you. Hillary is an approved safe target because she is heavily protected in D.C. and its open season on her. The people at Christ Church have less protection and are more vulnerable.

            is doing is obvious. He is setting a bar he does not think you can cross. He is demanding that you practically have Aaron's birth certificate or something to get it posted.
           </p>
           <p>
            The theory is that Aaron's mother was a tavistock spook and she helped with his abuse when he was a kid.. After he started to testify and remember they drove him crazy and killed him.If this is real it needs to be known. The only way to know is to let the community investigate it and Falcon does not want that to happen. He nukes Christ Church in the past too. Of course the shills that set up the "hoaxtead" site have pummeled Aaron's reputation as hard as possible which is indication that it needs research. Falcon is jumping on the bandwagon with these shills from Hoaxtead.
           </p>
           <p>
            Falcon its up to you to prove that Aaron is not real. We investigate tons of people on much more flimsy associations than what we have here. In other investigations you don't demand proof like this because quite frankly it most often cannot be provided. People sit on this site and hash through similar names all the time in a process to narrow down and make sure the right person is selected. You are denying the community their RIGHT TO DO SO.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just because the perps probably slandered Aaron does not mean he was not abused. You know full well that slandering victims is a full time job for the perps. Your adamant demands on Christ Church are "interesting" to say the least.

             ?  That's an account on voat.  I have not seen any of those posts previously and frankly I'm not interested.  The Aaron Dover I'm referring to was written about in national newspapers and had facebook and youtube accounts, some of which I've linked to.. that digital footprint is clear. And so is the Tavistock connection of the mother.  Is it the noted Tavistock connection that is causing the censorship, do you think?

              You are correct that Aaron Dover has been written about and you linked to the article about his death. It seems that Falcon is almost basically forcing you to produce a birth certificate before you can talk about it. And his mother's too. This is a standard of proof that he does not demand in other cases. He has a history with Christ Church though. He can whack a Christ Church thread in a little minute. As far as I am concerned the news story about Aaron Dover flying out of a window to his death is link enough for us to investigate if we think its involved because that same name has been associated with abuse at Christ Church.
             </p>
             <p>
              Get ready because he will start the personal insults to distract and keep from discussing this probably. He will call us alts. Say that we just want to cause trouble, anything he can think of.

             I'm not sure what you mean by that as I haven't been following the whole Aaron Dover thing.  I just saw 'flat earth' and switched off a long time ago.  Could you clarify?  As far as I see it, there was an Aaron Dover and his mother is the Tavistock psychotherapist.

              The whole first part of your post was about Aaron Dover.  If you want to say "someone claiming to be Aaron Dover" that's fine, but if you want to claim factually that it was really him, you need to give some evidence.

                For bullshit posts about politics the threshold of proof is very low and sometimes does not exist. For child abuse posts you have to thread a fucking needle.

                 We allow significant swamp-related posts, because swamp = pizzagate.  Factual claims require sources.  Opinions don't.  Practical issues of time constraint do however mean that certain posts draw more attention than others.   This one drew my attention because a lot of comments in the original post suspected it was disinfo, and because there is a persistent troll who posts almost constantly, and Hampstead, NASA, aliens, and Jack Parsons are some of his favorite subjects.
