             One of the worst, most terrifying offenders was
             <strong>
              CARITAS
             </strong>
             (or, "charity" in Latin). This group operates internationally to this very day in the same field of child welfare. This was a way for the government to profit tremendously from the aid flowing in internationally and from Romanians who deposited in the accounts. It was like a lottery in that select depositors could see an 8-fold return in their investment within 6 months if they won, all while "helping impoverished Romanians during the transition to capitalism." Between 1992-1994, the scheme attracted a staggering 1.5-5 billion USD. The National Romanian Bank estimates it held a whopping 33% of the country's deposits. The scheme ultimately fell apart because the money was siphoned off to select winners overtly in the "winnings" publication, and also covertly in the form of handing off mad fat stacks of cash. Winners--many who were politicians themselves--were friends to the organizer, Ion Stoica. The New York Times interviewed one citizen who said, "It's a scheme for Mr. Stoica and the people in the government to get rich."

            PC may not be used as a smokescreen, but the UN is involved in this one. I wasn't expecting to find something so substantial so quickly. Here's the link:

            This stuff is so unbelievable. It's not difficult to understand why people who don't know me personally think I'm insane for "buying into" this stuff. My only request would be that you share your study once you're done with it! I'd love to give it a read through :) I'll be sure to post again whenever I find more. The best of luck to you, Hunter. Let me know if this isn't exactly what you're looking for.

             "You know how in the 1990s and 2000s a whole bunch of naive conservative Christians were hoodwinked out of $millions by Charlatan Evangelists?
