<p>On Reddit a Lithuanian person, &quot;Penki-&quot;, gives a totally different angle to the story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay so some backstory, and I will go as unbiased as I can, but as a Lithuanian I would like to point out I am biased and I do support her detainment</p>
<p>So its starts with her brother committing a crime, he killed 2 guys. He was in hiding after that, naturally a child should be with her mother (legally) in such circumstances. If I recall correctly they were getting a divorce. After the murder the child was with his grandparents, and they refused to give the child to the mother. Latter they started claiming that the mother was involved in some sort pedophile ring, anything to avoid giving the child. They guy who was hiding eventually found dead. No clue how that investigation went on. The women that is detained right now was a judge herself. Mother sued her family and the court ordered to give the child to the rightful mother. They refused. They started rallying people behind them (that\'s why there were a lot of cops during the police take down, just a lot of other people potentially interfering). Police finally came with force to uphold the court\'s decision. They took the child, but because grandparents (and others) interfered it got a bit physical.</p>
<p>So going a bit further, the child is with her mother, somehow the child is fine being with mother even though while being with grandparents there were constant talks about abuse. Even more further away, she is trying to get into Lithuanian parliament (the story was a bit on point with elections, although probably not related at all). Going on high populism wave she manages to get elected. While she is elected there is ongoing investigation about the former case. Crimes she did: abuse of power while she was a judge, not upholding courts decision (WORTH NOTING THAT SHE MIGHT GET AWAY WITH JUST A FINE). To continue the investigation the court has to ask the parliament to take away her immunity, the parliament votes yes (usually case in any investigation on parliament members) When she lost her immunity she went to US and went into hiding. US didn\'t really bother doing anything (her location was somewhat know to everyone). So now they will probably give her to Lithuanian authorities and the story will end.</p>
<p>Correct the place I was wrong, cause this story is old.</p>
<p>Now for more biased stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her brother is a murderer and she tried to protect him. All claims about pedophilia came after the double murder!</li>
<li>She did commit a crime anyways, how ever you twist a story she did commit a crime.</li>
<li>I understand that the story is something that really hits hard it did in Lithuania too (hence the large crowds of people by their homes, and large police force), but it just doesn\'t seem right. Their claims seem to be odd.</li>
<li>Worth noting the story snowballed by the election cycle, where odd stuff might get traction, but we also live near Russia, even the guy in the video show RT video. It sure did a lot of turmoil in Lithuania. SURE, say its odd, say that we blame Russia for nothing, but once a politician that got investigated for corruption, fled nowhere else but to Russia. A truly friendly state.</li>
</ul>
<p>News articles about this from major news sites in Lithuania. Most of the articles will be about her arrest (as it is easier to find cause its recent), but they do talk about backstory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The child was in fucking agony while being taken away, that\'s something you can not deny, and blame on the aunt. Something was up in that house. Even considering that they made her lie, it\'s still not very likely for her to react in such a manner. She\'s going to her mother, yet she\'s screaming like she\'s being taken to hell. You do see that right? This girl is no A-list actress. She clearly is scared to go where she\'s been taken.</p>

<p>Penki- replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons a child was screaming could be that she was taken away by a group of strangers from people that she knows with everyone yelling around. This would create a stressful situation for a kid.</p>

            240 cops to take one little girl... hmm, seems very strange to me. The priority and resources... Never seen that many cops even for riots or whatever... Clearly this is a HIGH priority case for the government... and a normal "murder case" hardly get that kind of man power...

            According to Wikipedia:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Frustrated with the apparent lack of progress in official investigations and convinced that the case was being deliberately stonewalled, Kedys sent out some 200 DVDs to Lithuanian politicians, media outlets, and law-enforcement agencies, featuring homemade video footage of his daughter's explicit testimony against three "uncles". He promised to send out the subtitled version to Members of the European Parliament. Many sources criticized Kedys, who acted as the cameraman, for asking his daughter leading questions and heavily editing the film (it contains some 50 segments filmed over nine separate occasions).
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            You can see a short clip of footage at the very start of the video posted.
           </p>
           <p>
            How does that mesh with:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             After the murder the child was with his grandparents, and they refused to give the child to the mother. Latter they started claiming that the mother was involved in some sort pedophile ring, anything to avoid giving the child.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            If he had fled the country and she had stayed in Lithuania with her grandparents, he couldn't have acted as the cameraman, no?

             What the hell? I signed the petition just for the way they treated the child in this anyway.  They have used the ABUSE OF POWER to traumatise that child who CLEARLY wanted to stay with her aunt ON BOTH OCCASIONS. Plus I believe that the Government world wide have had the power to do what they want when they want and DO NOT WANT the commoners of the world to have any sense of control or voice.  Thank God for people like Donald Trump and Brexit and Italy decision to take back their rights from these blood sucking sickos whos whole aim is to rule you and me! This is my opinion anyway.

            While it's good to view a story from as many angles as possible (I too, wondered about other takes on this story), what made me thinking yesterday's video could maybe have presented the true story was that several psychiatrists have said that the girl was raped indeed.

            You are right about the fact that we outsiders just know one side of the story.
But how can anyone justify the behavior of the police? when I look at how comfortable the girl was being at that home and how authorities forcefully entered the house by breaking the glass, and destroying the door, trying to snatch a minor girl from a family member by force while she screams like hell, over a fucking court decision. Oh no no, its the law right. When the well-being of a child is so important why the fuck do you torment it?

             IMO this is often a problem. But who is to blame for the behavior of the police?
Is it the police and the legal system, or are it the persons who refuse to cooperate? Every thesis has its antithesis.
            </p>
            <p>
             So if it would be not done to break the glass, while a young girl is screaming, etc, even not for upholding the law, then effectively the law cannot be uphold. Criminals can then use children to get their way.
            </p>
            <p>
             This sentence is for me most telling:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              So its starts with her brother committing a crime, he killed 2 guys.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Assuming this is true, I think the sad situation for the girl is to be blamed on her aunt+family.

             Alright, so as a Lithuanian who has been following this for years let me clear up some things. The problem about if it's real or not is a reallllly big issue here. During the time this was happening the entire country was pretty much divided on their stance. Some people support the Neringa side, while other people declined their allegations.
            </p>
            <p>
             The girl in question went through multiple psychiatrists, and their decision was very split, some of them believed she was raped, while some decided that Neringa told the girl what to say.
            </p>
            <p>
             The case quickly picked up pace as multiple very high-end people was involved in it. Some very highly respected Lithuanians joined Neringa's side (most importantly, few of the March 11th declaration of independence signators) The problem is not about if the girl is telling the truth or not, but rather the very very strange deaths of all the suspects. First of all the death of Drasius Kedys, the person who was alleged of killing two of the suspects of pedophilia, he apparently drowned in his stomach juice even though there were visible fighting signs on his body. Then came the deaths of a few very high-end judges, most importantly Andrius Usas, who was found drowned in a small pond after falling down from a 4-wheels motorcycle 3 hours later after denying the protection from the government because he was also a suspect in this case. The story is still unclear and the moment we got the news about Neringa getting arrested all the country got divided again in a matter of second and a lot of news sites are covering the story here. (For reference, the biggest Lithuanian news portal Delfi. lt got over 1000 comments in just two hours on the article about Neringa getting arrested)

             Well that's kind-of the biggest issue with this topic, we do not know either. This discussion has been going for almost 8 years and the people are still as divided now as they were when it originally happened.

            IMO it is a trap for persons at far distance (i.c. non-Lithuanians) to take sides in such cases.
There is no real way to know who is speaking the truth; therefore I'd recommend not to sign the petition mentioned in the video.

             Can you clarify for me how doctors could be unclear as to whether a young girl has been violated or not? It's a simple question of biology.
