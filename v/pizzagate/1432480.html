             It just helps solidify any newcomers doubt.  I made this post hoping some of you can think of other instances where this is expressed in songs.  I think it could assist in finding more people involved.  It's a small thing, but it hasn't been discussed.  Maybe there's a band/artist releasing very damning evidence if we read between the lines and research.  I didn't mean this to come off as a shitpost.  Just thinking outside the box a bit.

              I think we should focus on ACTUAL evidence not some pop song. Yes you can analyze strange.music or radio broadcast to find hidden clues but that would be things CONNECTED.to pizza gate some random pop song will accomplish nothing. I mean this is the same category of "UNDENIABLE PROOF KATY PERRY IS ILLUMINATI" and "KURT COBAIN REVERSE SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES ILLUMINATI" . This is why no one is taking us seriously.
