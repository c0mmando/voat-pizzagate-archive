<p>Hey ESPG... as a long time customer I have a crazy suggestion.</p>
<p>Perhaps ESP could <strong>come out in support of &quot;Peaceful citizen investigation of publicly available information that indicates unfortunate connections between the term Pizza and a widely known but still operating child sex and trafficking situation in many walks of life that is currently broadly labeled #pizzagate&quot;</strong></p>
<p>I can\'t guarantee the result, but I\'m pretty sure your bosses can imagine the effect of being the first Pizza shop to openly express such a message. It would be huge.</p>
<p>However, it would also put you at risk of being targeted by the same people who setup the false flag that happened this weekend. However if you were suddenly targeted it would be IMPOSSIBLE for them to claim it was done by pizzagaters or because of people concerned you might be involved... so it might in fact create an immunity.</p>
<p>Like I said... crazy idea, but also imagine being the first pizza place to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is something meaningful here. Are there <em>any</em> pizza company owners that would be willing to take an open stance like this? Next time I go somewhere I might consider asking if I could talk to a manager... or perhaps we could start emailing some. If some companies start coming out in support of the Peaceful Research it has the potential to create a genuine rift between companies and organizations that are actually complicit and those that aren\'t.</p>
<p>A business that isn\'t clean would be at large risk of pretending to support it because the last thing they need is legitimacy being applied to what is happening here. However, if they did opt to pretend to be in support hoping to avoid personal scrutiny, the more they increase being outed by someone in the know trying to throw them under the bus.</p>
<p>It\'s definitely a risky thing to do... and it wouldn\'t even have to be a pizza business... but a pizza business would be a powerful powerful meme and potentially a massive business boost from pizzagate supporters who would then be more inclined to show we stand WITH them and provide economic and community protection. Similar to Gamergaters donating to female game developer programs, etc.</p>',
