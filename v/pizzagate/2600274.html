<p>Excerpts from the <strong>Romper</strong>\'s 2018 \'Claim to Fame\' article:</p>
<p><em>&quot;From featuring a book that was made out of human flesh to the constant \'virgin\' talk, Hocus Pocus wasn\'t your typical Disney movie&quot;...</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;After taking on the role of <a href="http://33.media.tumblr.com/d8c428fdcf142990aa7bdb1586a42074/tumblr_nch3x2Fjzm1rn5a30o1_r1_250.gif">Dani Dennison in the 1993 cult classic</a> Hocus Pocus, Thora Birch, who had mostly done strictly TV work up until that point, <em>became almost as recognizable as that of her A-list co-stars.</em> By association, it turned Birch into an unforgettable child star. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;She admits that even today she can\'t fully understand exactly what it is that made this movie such a phenomenon -- <strong>especially considering the essential premise centers around witches sucking the souls out of children.</strong> \'When you think about it, <em>it’s kind of a dark story,\'</em> she muses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Before Buffy Summers started slaying vampires and Sabrina Spellman began casting spells, <strong>Dani Dennison</strong> proved that you don\'t have to be of a certain age to be a badass. [Note that the character\'s initials were \'DD\'. As mentioned above, Birch\'s next major Hollywood movie was <strong>American Beauty</strong> with Kevin Spacey, where she filmed a <a href="http://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/thora-birch-american-beauty-gif-3.gif">topless scene</a> at the age of 16.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;It was important for Birch, looking back on it, to have a team of women pushing the movie forward. \'That feeling on set of it being a female-led movie for young girls was a great thing to be apart of,\' she explains. <em>\'We were working alongside <a href="https://c8.alamy.com/comp/E7R246/now-and-then-year-1995-usa-director-lesli-linka-glatter-gaby-hoffmann-E7R246.jpg">very powerful figures in the industry</a> at the time\'.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;<strong>Wading through the murky waters of childhood stardom</strong> is no easy feat, many have been pulled in and come out barely clutching to their <a href="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UntriedLimpingGuineafowl-small.gif">good-kid image</a>, but in the case of actress Thora Birch, <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zXr_79WQOvA/WM8MGdiJRmI/AAAAAAAAALE/WrG6DJ914VkLu96Yk3GK5zITnrkECW2QgCLcB/s1600/01_thora_birch.jpg">growing up in Hollywood proved to be a fairly positive experience.</a>&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Note they use the phrase <em>\'fairly positive\'...</em> This begs the question, what parts of it <em>were not</em> positive? Don\'t think we\'ll get those answers here]</p>

             Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that show targeted at young adults / adults?

             Whereas this movie was targeted directly at kids, with the full marketing power of Disney behind it... which makes it no coincidence

              You are absolutely correct! Even though I was comparing apples to oranges, kids will find a way to seek out what is new and exciting, even if they aren't perhaps the target demographic.
