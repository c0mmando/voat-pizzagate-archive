<p>Tel Aviv — It\'s a tense stakeout, waiting for Jimmy Julius Karow to appear. He is a wanted man and is considered dangerous. <strong>Accused of sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl in Oregon in 2000, he fled to Israel before authorities in the U.S. could apprehend him or figure out where he went.</strong> Karow has been running from U.S. law enforcement ever since. Currently INTERPOL, an inter-governmental policing organization that works with 194 countries, has a Red Notice to alert police worldwide that he\'s a fugitive.</p>
<p>Karow has successfully evaded authorities by moving between communities in Israel for almost two decades, and he is not alone.</p>
<p><strong>A CBS News investigation has found that many accused American pedophiles flee to Israel, and bringing them to justice can be difficult.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jewishcommunitywatch.org/">Jewish Community Watch</a> (JCW), an American organization that tracks accused pedophiles, has been trying for years to find Karow and help bring him to justice.</p>
<p>JCW says Karow and other wanted men and women have been able to exploit a right known as the Law of Return, whereby any Jewish person can move to Israel and automatically gain citizenship.</p>
<p><strong>Since the small organization started tracking accused pedophiles in 2014, it says more than 60 have fled from the U.S. to Israel.</strong> Given its limited resources to identify these individuals, JCW says <strong>the actual number is likely much larger.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The same thing that is going on in the Catholic Church right now around the world, the exact same thing is happening in our community,&quot; JCW\'s founder Meyer Seewald told CBS News. &quot;The cover-ups are the same, the stigma, the shame.&quot;</p>
<p>Seewald says tightly-knit Jewish communities across the U.S. will sometimes meet accusations against a member with incredulity, and that can have a chilling effect.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone goes and surrounds this individual and supports him because they can\'t believe a person can do such a crime. They take the abuser\'s side and the abuse continues,&quot; Seewald says. &quot;They put him in another community. A few years later, he\'s done the same thing and we hear more allegations that the person is abusing children. Victims don\'t want to come forward when they see that.&quot;</p>
<p>Mendy Hauck decided to come forward after receiving support from JCW. The father of two says <strong>he was just 8-years-old when he was molested by a teacher at his Orthodox Jewish School in Los Angeles.</strong> Hauck says the abuse started one day when a friend brought in cookies for his birthday.</p>
<p>His alleged abuser is Mordechai Yomtov, a then-35-year-old Hebrew teacher.</p>
<p>When the year finished, Hauck moved on to the next grade. That\'s when Yomtov\'s crimes caught up to him. In 2001, police arrested and charged him with committing lewd acts with three of his other students, ranging in age from 8 to 10. But Hauck never told anyone about his ordeal until years later.</p>
<p>Yomtov eventually pled guilty, served time in jail and was released on probation. But once free, <strong>he violated his probation by fleeing to Israel via Mexico.</strong></p>
<p>JCW tracked him down and confronted him in Jerusalem with a hidden camera. Yomtov admitted that he violated his probation and illegally fled the United States, with help. He also said that in Mexico he obtained a fake passport in order to travel to Israel, where he lives illegally.</p>
<p>&quot;I want the (LA County District Attorney) to step up their game — you know, actually fight to get him back here and give him what he deserves,&quot; he says. &quot;And also, I want the communities to make sure this doesn\'t happen again.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The district attorney\'s office told CBS News there has been no request to extradite Yomtov back to the United States,</strong> and declined any further comment.</p>
<p>Help from the community is a reoccurring theme. Rabbi Yehuda Oppenheimer knows first-hand how a pedophile is able to flee to Israel. In 2000, he unwittingly helped Karow escape.</p>
<p>The two met when Karow expressed interest in converting to Judaism. <strong>One day, Karow suddenly said he wanted to move to Israel.</strong></p>
<p>When asked whether there was nothing at all that raised red flags up to the point when Karow said he wanted to move to Israel, Rabbi Oppenheimer responded: &quot;I wish I could say that [it didn\'t raise any red flags], but unfortunately, I can\'t… He [Karow] said, \'I plan to go to Israel, I need to go much more quickly than I thought I needed to go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He said that there was something in the past that happened when he was young but nothing had ever happened since. I felt that I could trust him. So I wrote him a letter, he bought a ticket and he left.&quot;</p>
<p>Oppenheimer gave Karow the contact information of family and friends in Israel to help him settle. Then one day a close friend called the rabbi.</p>
<p>&quot;I\'ll never know exactly what happened but something severely sexual… something happened with their daughter, and [Karow] was arrested.&quot; Oppenheimer says it felt like &quot;a punch to the gut. It was very painful.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the girls Karow allegedly abused in Israel is &quot;Amoona.&quot; She asked us not to use her real name, to protect her family.</p>
<p>&quot;I was 5, 4 or 5 years old. My mother was on bedrest. My father is a rabbi so he wasn\'t home. (Karow) used to come to our house. We used to play games and then it became sexual.&quot;</p>
<p>The alleged abuse took place over the course of more than two years. A July 2019, Israeli indictment against him details allegations of severe sexual abuse, including rape and sodomy. She says he would threaten and manipulate her to keep her quiet.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;\'I\'m going to give you a cookie because you do it so nicely.\' It\'s all about the cookie it\'s all about lying and it\'s all about being so evil to a little child,&quot;</strong> Amoona recalls him telling her. &quot;He also threatened to kill my parents. He would choke me. He would hold me.&quot;</p>
<p>Amoona is angry that Karow was allowed to enter Israel in the first place, but JCW\'s chief operating officer Shana Aaronson says the failure begins in the United States. She says <strong>there are elements of the Jewish community in the U.S. that are willing to help pedophiles escape.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;Oftentimes there\'s some sort of community incentive, either somebody owes them a favor or someone in the community, let\'s say an institution, has covered up for them in the past and they know that if this goes to court there\'s a lot of civil liability coming down the line,&quot;</strong> she says.</p>
<p>While Aaronson puts blame on Jewish communities in the U.S. and the U.S. government for not aggressively pursuing extraditions, she says Israeli authorities have also failed to prioritize the hunt for suspects.</p>
<p>She tells CBS News it would be easier for the police to locate and arrest Karow, for instance, but it has fallen instead on the JCW to track him down.</p>
<p>Israel is known as a nation on the cutting edge of technology, but Shana says that doesn\'t trickle down to local law enforcement. Shana says <strong>police don\'t request background checks of perpetrators arrested in Israel who have recently moved there from other countries. They don\'t even do a Google search,</strong> she says.</p>
<p>JCW says <strong>the problem reaches into the upper echelons of Israeli politics</strong> as well. They note that Yaakov Litzman, leader of an ultra-orthodox alliance in Israel\'s legislature and the current minister of health, has been accused of <strong>preventing the deportation of a Malka Leifer, a former head teacher at a Jewish school in Australia, where she is wanted on multiple charges of child sexual abuse.</strong></p>
<p>CBS News obtained an Israeli police recommendation that says there is enough evidence against Litzman to recommend he be charged himself with fraud and breach of trust for protecting Leifer. Litzman\'s office told CBS News there was not any wrongdoing. It\'s now up to Israel\'s attorney general to decide whether to indict the lawmaker.</p>
<p>&quot;It\'s a good example of the lengths the community will go,&quot; JCW\'s Aaronson says. &quot;It\'s really disappointing and disgusting.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The U.S. Department of Justice</strong> declined to comment on specific cases too but <strong>praised their relationship with Israel\'s law enforcement,</strong> adding sex offenders have been successfully extradited in the past.</p>

             "Oftentimes there's some sort of community incentive, either somebody owes them a favor or someone in the community, let's say an institution, has covered up for them in the past and they know that if this goes to court there's a lot of civil liability coming down the line,"
            </strong>
            she says.
           </p>
           <p>
            While Aaronson puts blame on Jewish communities in the U.S. and the U.S. government for not aggressively pursuing extraditions, she says Israeli authorities have also failed to prioritize the hunt for suspects.
           </p>
           <p>
            She tells CBS News it would be easier for the police to locate and arrest Karow, for instance, but it has fallen instead on the JCW to track him down.

            Israel is known as a nation on the cutting edge of technology, but Shana says that doesn't trickle down to local law enforcement. Shana says
            <strong>
             police don't request background checks of perpetrators arrested in Israel who have recently moved there from other countries. They don't even do a Google search,
            </strong>
            she says.
           </p>
           <p>
            JCW says
            <strong>
             the problem reaches into the upper echelons of Israeli politics
            </strong>
            as well. They note that Yaakov Litzman, leader of an ultra-orthodox alliance in Israel's legislature and the current minister of health, has been accused of
            <strong>
             preventing the deportation of a Malka Leifer, a former head teacher at a Jewish school in Australia, where she is wanted on multiple charges of child sexual abuse.
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            CBS News obtained an Israeli police recommendation that says there is enough evidence against Litzman to recommend he be charged himself with fraud and breach of trust for protecting Leifer. Litzman's office told CBS News there was not any wrongdoing. It's now up to Israel's attorney general to decide whether to indict the lawmaker.
           </p>
           <p>
            "It's a good example of the lengths the community will go," JCW's Aaronson says. "It's really disappointing and disgusting."

            Does the US have an extradition treaty with Israel?

           <p>
            Reasoning: If the answer is no, then the pedos are actively exploiting that fact. If yes, then there’s an issue of corruption. Then against the Israeli government is corrupt as fuck anyway.

            Thanks for repposting my post. I want everyone to know there is an 11 minute video on the CBS link as well. It was aired on the CBS morning news show at 7:30am today, Feb 19th. I hope because of that it reached an audience that was unaware of how depraved these people are

             Yes. It is always good when stories like this hit the mainstream news and introduce normies/boomers/etc. to information which they may not otherwise get exposed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pure speculation on my part, but the negative portrayal of the orthodox community in the story may have given it some extra leeway with the ADL censorship crowd. The zionists, who have a much stronger influence within the media, hate the orthodox community and their opposition to the state of Israel, so anything that makes them look bad may be given wider circulation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Only time will tell if this story will disappear from the CBS Web site and the video of it will be removed from ThemTube.

                I find it very odd.  CBS surely is behind Dems. But maybe not Bloomberg. Maybe they see the handwriting on the wall He was pummeled last night with racist and women’s issues. We do not need  this guy. Yikes. Connects to Epstein as well.

            America should assemble a special unit to go into israel and collect these demonic pedos and bring them to justice. Many jews in America are also going to fight for the IDF each year doing terrorist operations against Palestine. They should not be allowed to re-enter America because they are fighting for a foreign nation.
