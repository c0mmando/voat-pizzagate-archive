             I see, I can post the link in a follow-up post but not in the thread...I just followed the procedure, there was a bar to enter the URL so I did. I'm not really having an investigation, just some strange circumstancial evidence about voodoo donuts in Portland that were literally promoted by a classic hardcore punk band from Portland since the early 80's and obviously I was rather mad and didn't look if the rules I knew of back in late 2016 had changed, for them to put out that 7 inch single where their name is barely showing on the cover making it look like it's a Voodoo Donuts record...and then all the distasteful humour and disturbing art and pictures inside the lyrics sheet insert, I thought this fit this place, as voodoo donuts is part of the overarching pedogate which pizzagate really is. So, I can make the same thread, not including an URL to make the title a link and that would be fine? just want to confirm, thankfully I saved the text of my post...so like I said I haven't been here in a while, I've concentrated my efforts to actual help by going to a middle-eastern country, as a pharmacologist/chemist to make medication for free in the now pretty much war free country, you can guess which one it is, WMD's and 9/11 blame was deflected on the former secular ruler. I've done this is by giving my services to one NGO I have strongly vetted of being free from any sort of government control/funding, these days NGO's are mostly GO's...with all the kids and adults ridden with disease due to the huge amount of "depleted" uranium that's been laid by the tonnes in that country since Desert Storm in 1991. I consider my privileged position in this world as a Canadian who's a Pharmacologist for a generics company here in Canada, I jumped at the chance to spend 6 months over there to produce anti-cancer and painkiller drugs, I find that relieving some people of their own very real hell, a great way to reduce my own personal mental hell because as a person from such a country as Canada, where we mostly observe from the outside since we have the luxury of nothing at all happening here other than typical biker/mafia crime which has never been lower than it has in 45 years+. Call it a way to unlearn helplessness.

            Here's the liner notes and the stupid "jokes" on what was before that other guy took over after the singer died, who were always pretty crazy guys, but tough guys who stopped the big neo-nazi skinhead scene by themselves and their crew, along with singing about all the ills that make awakened people really angry. The amount of times bands like this were so-ahead of their time by their social and political commentary, a lot of their predictions becoming true also, not necessarily all Poison Idea's but the whole Hardcore Punk scene of the '80s,'90s was solid and even in the 2000's they remained true until their morbidly obese singer died of a heart attack (last LP with him is called Last Will And Testament...knowing he didn't have long left to live). But that puts into question the guy who took his place from 2006-2017 and the other members, who likely aren't the original line-up that was around until sometimes in the 90's at least.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found this by randomly browsing Discogs and marking releases I didn't have by iconic bands that lasted longer than almost all of the original bands in the genre, now only Agnostic Front and Slapshot pretty much remain from the early 80's...and they have never done anything like this.
           </p>
           <p>
            This proves something really is strange about voodoo donuts, maybe it's just a dump bakery joint (which has multiple items for sale btw, not what we were told by the guy at that illegalnewz blog or the now befallen traitor RandomRantsofRyan (at least he brought down Roger Stone, which likely brought down Alex Jones, Roger Stone doesn't fuck around and he's the dirtiest meanest bastard from the Nixon days still alive who actually thinks Nixon was a great President (lol).
           </p>
           <p>
            You can look at the pictures inside the insert and the cover of the vinyl single yourselves, I'm not posting it here. It's not CP, obviously. I'm kinda mad the legendary producer Don Fury recorded this too...wtf, I used to be heavily involved into nuclear waste sites awareness and their leakages all over the US but this overarching pedo thing...although the 3 girls in the insert are definitely late teens, but they are likely hypnotised "Mk-ultra"-ish girls, consider the title of the B-side....
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm fucking mad and since the band broke up and this is nowhere one of their popular releases (1983-1993 is pretty much where its at with that band), so I can raise awareness about it, but ultimately it's not about the band, who did have some twisted humour in the past, but nothing like that for sure before. I'm in my 30's and despite being a Pharmacologist, I have that schizo personality that doesn't let go of what I was after I discovered punk music...to me it's more like...when people grow up, their heart dies, mine hasn't, anybody caring about pedosadism, luciferianism etc. is disgusting to us, because it goes in lockstep with the fake politics, fake conservatives like the Council for National Policy who are Christian Identity a-holes, fascism (on both right and left, authoritarianism...) and the devolution of society, mainstream society, not poor people who do things poor people do when things get beyond the pale for a human being to endure. Basically, it's all about countering khakistocracy, "Rule of the Worst". So if this can add weight in the circumstancial evidence again the guy owning voodoo donuts and the neighbouring businesses, which is pretty much a rundown area of Portland. A geologist has to get an underground scanner in that area of Portland to decide whether this is just a ridiculous donut shop or something much more insane.
