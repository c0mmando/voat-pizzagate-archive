            This is already
            <a href="http://pizzagate.wiki/Hillary_Clinton#.22owl.2Fminerva_rule.22">
             on the wiki
            </a>
            . This is the last paragraph of the email that might violate the rule:
           </p>
           <p>
            "We have always said that the Qaddafi government's future is a matter for the Libyan people to  decide, and they have made them selves clear. When a leader's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people, he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving, and the sooner the better. Moammar Qaddafi has lost the confidence of his people and he should go without further bloodshed and violence. The Libyan people deserve a government that is responsive to their aspirations and that protects their universally recognized human rights."
           </p>
           <p>
            Tiberghien is absolutely right to say Minerva's rule is about like-minded states creating global institutions. But I believe the owl is a
            <a href="http://www.askphilosophers.org/question/1579">
             reference to Hegel
            </a>
            when he said "The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk." That means that societies generally only understand their times once they've passed. The Owl-Minerva Rule as I understand it is that like-minded people in these states (Hillary et al) will create global institutions but ordinary people will only realize much too late what they were up to. So I believe this email means:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             They're going to overthrow Qaddafi for their own sick purposes, perhaps creating or strengthening ISIS or providing a nice supply of children displaced by the conflict.
            </li>
            <li>
             They cannot reveal or hint in public statements that's why they're encouraging regime change.
            </li>
            <li>
             This public statement might have shone light in that direction. Jacob Sullivan is worried that it does, Hillary says no, it doesn't violate the rule.
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Does that make sense?
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't believe this has anything to do with the Bohemian Grove.

             It's certainly possible the Owl-Minerva reference
             <em>
              doesn't
             </em>
             precisely allude to the Bohemian Grove, but it was an initial theory. You've certainly developed on it quite a bit though and your line of reasoning is solid. I'm still keen to believe that Hillary isn't exactly the top of the food chain in such an endeavor, however.

              Thank you. Yes, I think Hillary reports to Lynn de Rothschild - witness her email request to 'do penance' because she couldn't get Tony Blair into a meeting. FBIAnon
              <a href="https://churchmousec.wordpress.com/2016/11/03/fbi-anon-speaks-part-2/">

              </a>
              their relationship was mentor/protege.
             </p>
             <p>
              Upon further reflection though, I think the connection to the Bohemian Grove is quite a bit stronger than I first thought. Grove members recite the following prayer as part of the ritual: "O thou, great symbol of all mortal wisdom, Owl of Bohemia, we do beseech thee, grant us thy counsel" and owl symbolism is rampant throughout the organisation from the logo on down. The Grove is composed of
              <a href="https://isgp-studies.com/Bohemian_Grove">
               very powerful people
              </a>
              and it's not hard to connect their machinations behind the scenes with the idea of an active force bringing about the change the elites want via secret global societies. So it's perfectly possible the Grove is one of the Owls in the Owl-Minerva rule.

            Minerva is very common on old Roman coins (and Greek too, though she was called Athena then).
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is an article on Minerva for those interested in more.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.forumancientcoins.com/dougsmith/feac67min.html">
             http://www.forumancientcoins.com/dougsmith/feac67min.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Note:  Minerva is holding an owl in this link on the coin.
           </p>
           <p>
            Owls interestingly enough are the first one world currency.  Greek owls, specifically large silver tetradrachms from Athens with an owl on them, were basically so common they were used everywhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any relation to the Minerva / Owl rule, I doubt it, but it wouldn't surprise me either as I tend to think those at the top of the PizzaGate pyramid are old school banking families / central banks.  The type of people that print money out of thin air, use that unlimited currency to buy up all the politicians on both sides of every aisle, then buy up all the media and schools to influence the young.  Again, connected, I doubt it, but now you learned something that isn't totally pedophile related for a change. . . .
           </p>
           <p>
            Here is an old Athens Owl coin (not mine).
           </p>
           <p>
            Note the obverse has Athena (Minerva) on it and an Owl on the reverse.

            Boy I remember when I first read those words.  Amazing.  I also have read all about The Bohemian Club.  You must read the whole Wikipedia report. They have an owl on a pedestal with the recorded voice of Arthur Cronkite.  Can you imagine?  Him being connected to that place.  I remember when he had to announce that President Kennedy was shot and then he had to announce that he Died.  What a jerk.  He knew all along who killed him and was behind it. How could you hang with those people and not know the story?  Skull and Cross Bones Too. What a Sorry Bunch.
