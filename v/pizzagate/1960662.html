            I put the timeline in a series of 3 jpgs, just open them all and see the entire timeline published by the NY Times in April, 2015.  Clearly the NYT is well aware of Hillary's Russian connections.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Uranium One was intent on becoming “a powerhouse in the United States uranium sector with the potential to become the domestic supplier of choice for U.S. utilities,” the company declared.
...
When ARMZ, an arm of Rosatom, took its first 17 percent stake in Uranium One in 2009, the two parties signed an agreement, found in securities filings, to seek the foreign investment committee’s review.
            </p>
            <p>
             But it was the 2010 deal, giving the Russians a controlling 51 percent stake, that set off alarm bells. Four members of the House of Representatives signed a letter expressing concern. Two more began pushing legislation to kill the deal.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, where Uranium One’s largest American operation was, wrote to President Obama, saying the deal “would give the Russian government control over a sizable portion of America’s uranium production capacity.”
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            Seems that Russia made out well under Obama's administration's "Reset" experience, and so did Hillary and Bill Clinton.

             As a side note, this is interesting as well, remember the Mueller taking an enriched Uranium sample to show to the Russians on the tarmac? In August of 2009?

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             Strange summer that was...
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              By June 2009, a little over a year after the star-studded evening in Toronto, Uranium One’s stock was in free-fall, down 40 percent. Mr. Dzhakishev, the head of Kazatomprom, had just been arrested on charges that he illegally sold uranium deposits to foreign companies, including at least some of those won by Mr. Giustra’s UrAsia and now owned by Uranium One.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...Uranium One officials were worried they could lose their joint mining ventures. American diplomatic cables made public by WikiLeaks also reflect concerns that Mr. Dzhakishev’s arrest was part of a Russian power play for control of Kazakh uranium assets.
             </p>
             <p>
              At the time, Russia was already eying a stake in Uranium One, Rosatom company documents show. Rosatom officials say they were seeking to acquire mines around the world because Russia lacks sufficient domestic reserves to meet its own industry needs.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was against this backdrop that the Vancouver-based Uranium One pressed the American Embassy in Kazakhstan, as well as Canadian diplomats, to take up its cause with Kazakh officials, according to the American cables.
             </p>
             <p>
              We want more than a statement to the press,” Paul Clarke, a Uranium One executive vice president, told the embassy’s energy officer on June 10, the officer reported in a cable. “That is simply chitchat.” What the company needed, Mr. Clarke said, was official written confirmation that the licenses were valid.
             </p>
             <p>
              The American Embassy ultimately reported to the secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton.
             </p>
             <p>
              What is clear is that the embassy acted, with the cables showing that the energy officer met with Kazakh officials to discuss the issue on June 10 and 11.
             </p>
             <p>
              Three days later, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rosatom completed a deal for 17 percent of Uranium One. And within a year, the Russian government substantially upped the ante, with a generous offer to shareholders that would give it a 51 percent controlling stake. But first, Uranium One had to get the American government to sign off on the deal.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             And then 2 months later according to the ZeroHedge article:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              The secret “action request,” dated Aug. 17, 2009, was sent out by Secretary of State Clinton and was addressed to the United States Ambassador to Georgia Embassy Tbilisi, the Russian Embassy, and Ambassador John Beyrle.
             </p>
             <p>
              It proposed that FBI Director Robert Mueller be the one that personally conduct the transfer a 10-gram sample of HEU to Russian law enforcement sources during a secret “plane-side” meeting on a “tarmac” in the early fall of 2009.
             </p>
             <p>
              (
              <em>
               "Over two years ago Russia requested a ten-gram sample of highly enriched uranium (HEU) seized in early 2006 in Georgia during a nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices.  The seized HEU was transferred to U.S. custody and is being held at a secure DOE facility."
              </em>
              )
             </p>
             <p>
              "We require that the transfer of this material be conducted at the airport, on the tarmac near by the plane, upon arrival of the Director's aircraft."
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             What is up in the Summer and early Fall of 2009 with Hillary, Russia, and Uranium rights, plus delivering a "sample" on the tarmac by then FBI Director Mueller, like showing a cocaine sample...

            Many thanks for this link, I had been trying to remember the name of the company involved with the selling of sub-standard AIDS drugs to treat poor people in Africa, a deal facilitated by the Clinton Foundation, and now I found the article I had been thinking of.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Thakur knew the drugs weren’t good. They had high impurities, degraded easily, and would be useless at best in hot, humid conditions. They would be taken by the world’s poorest patients in sub-Saharan Africa, who had almost no medical infrastructure and no recourse for complaints. The injustice made him livid.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ranbaxy executives didn’t care, says Kathy Spreen, and made little effort to conceal it. In a conference call with a dozen company executives, one brushed aside her fears about the quality of the AIDS medicine Ranbaxy was supplying for Africa. “Who cares?” he said, according to Spreen. “It’s just blacks dying.”

            Just a note on colomba.  For the sake of accuracy, and therefore credibility, it would be good to discriminate between colomba and sectoral or segmental heterochromia iridum.  Colomba is distortion of the actual pupil:
            <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=coloboma&amp;t=ffab&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images">
             https://duckduckgo.com/?q=coloboma&amp;t=ffab&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images
            </a>
            Segmental heterochromia iridum is a difference of color in one segment of the iris (scroll down)
            <a href="https://www.crutchfielddermatology.com/caseofthemonth/studies/2013/l_2013_008.asp">
             https://www.crutchfielddermatology.com/caseofthemonth/studies/2013/l_2013_008.asp
            </a>
            According to mainstream medicine, this is attributable to either congenital or other causes such as injury or illness.  I believe both Hunter Biden and Madelaine McCann are cases of segmental heterochromia rather than colomba (see their photos in next paragraph).
           </p>
           <p>
            The potential interest to our investigation lies in the alternative medical field of iridology, which locates areas of iris discoloration on a chart corresponding to different body parts.  Right eye chart:
            <a href="http://www.healthyyounaturally.com/iridology/right-iridology-eye-chart.htm">
             http://www.healthyyounaturally.com/iridology/right-iridology-eye-chart.htm
            </a>
            Interestingly, Hunter suffered a serious head injury in the car accident that killed his mother and sister, and his discoloration is located in the face/head region of the chart:
            <a href="http://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hunter_Biden.jpg">
             http://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Hunter_Biden.jpg
            </a>
            Madelaine's discoloration is in the abdominal/pelvic/groin area:

             Thanks, very informative.  So really the coloboma isn't part of PG if Madelaine McCann doesn't have it.  I had never heard of the "Iridology Chart of the Right Eye Iris"...interesting!

             The pic  sure looks like it, and ado you think that Joe had to give up his wife and daughter that accident, and then Beau to cancer and  has a son with coloboma.  Is there something about Beau's wife that would be an advantage to marry Hunter with the coloboma eye?

             The American public may never know. The likelihood is WJC LLC, as well as WJC International Investments LLC and WJC Investments LLC were created and maintained as limited liability corporations – with WJC LLC being nothing more than a shell corporation – precisely so that questions could never be answered.

            <p>
             A search of the ICIJ database of the Panama Papers for WJC Investments LLC produced a list of hits that included 19,372 offshore entities, 3,396 officers, 215 intermediaries and 316 addresses. The database also produced 38,934 offshore entities associated with WJC Investments Group LLC, plus 50,407 offshore entities identified with WJC International Investments LLC, as well as 68,188 offshore entities identified with WJC International Investments Group LLC.
            </p>
            <p>
             WND also searched the ICIJ database of the Panama Papers for William J. Clinton and found the name was associated with 433 offshore entities, 1,380 officers, 250 intermediaries and 363 addresses.

            </p>
            <p>
