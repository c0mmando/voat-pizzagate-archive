            It doesn't matter what it was invented for. What's it's used for and crawling with is detestable. How could you not know about that? What's also public knowledge is that it is a honeypot for law enforcement. There is no reason to be using it.

            So this crew of evil sick deranged fucktards took over from Peter Scully in the Philippines after he was busted. How the hell can we stop this shit from happening? It’s BEYOND EVIL. read the story on Crazy Days for all the info. Obviously law enforcement won’t touch them. Who are they? And what elites are logging on to instruct the torturers killers? How can we help get rid of this vile filth of people raping torturing and murdering children on the dark web for all to pay and view? We can talk about it all day long but what can we actually do? I need to go for a walk I’m pissed off and angry at the world for letting this be, for people into this shit for their religion and just for shits m giggles. There’s no hope left for humanity if we can’t do something, anything... apparent their IP addresses are never traceable when they are online either so no use and they move constantly. Fucking Dutch torture chambers, gonna be sick.....

            Never use TOR unless you want to implicate yourself. It's dangerous and immoral, and it's damaging to even look at these things. Don't involve yourself in the unfruitful works of darkness. TOR is only used for evil and should not be dabbled into, and it's not brave to do so. We're exposing evils hiding in the public domain, and trying to make the common man aware of his plight. The Dark Web has already been exposed as a haven for every evil act possible and needs no further exposure, only policing. You're a fool if you peruse it.

             Fucking lol, stop going to CP websites, then. The fuck are you doing still running Windows XP? Of course an operating system that downloads anything without your consent is going to fuck itself up. Of course turning on automatic downloads is going to fuck you up. A sane person doesn’t allow any access to any content that he doesn’t expressly affirm.

                 Stay safe. Make sure to go to the settings immediately and turn off the ability for the browser to send you ANY requests (microphone, camera, notifications, location, etc.). Then click the shield (somewhere in the main bar, or you can do it in the settings) and ensure that you have it set to at least “safer” (where it only loads JavaScript on secure sites) or “safest” (where it doesn’t load it at all). Then for finding tor websites, you’ll want to know an onion search engine that doesn’t index CP. Ahmia fits that bill.

                   That’s a bit of a tall order… There’s a lot of specialized ground to cover there. For a regular user, you only need to be aware of a few things.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                   <li>
                    <strong>
                     Always have an adblocker.
                    </strong>
                    Malicious ads masquerade as regular website elements, so the best thing to do is just block them from showing up in the first place. You want uBlock Origin on all your browsers.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <strong>
                     Ensure that any site on which you input information is secure.
                    </strong>
                    You can install the HTTPS Everywhere extension to automatically force all websites with secure versions to load them. Otherwise, if it’s not HTTPS, don’t give ‘em any information (shopping, personal, or otherwise). You can go there, sure, just don’t input anything.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <strong>
                     Never download anything from a website you don’t trust.
                    </strong>
                    Might be easiest to have your browser alert you every time a new site tries to download anything. If your actions didn’t explicitly cause a download notification to pop up, deny it.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <strong>
                     Never run any application you don’t trust.
                    </strong>
                    Goes hand in hand with the downloads; if there’s an EXE or BAT in your downloads folder and you don’t remember downloading it, delete it without running it.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    <strong>
                     Never put any of your personal information on the Inter
                    </strong>
                    ...oh, wait, it’s not any of the years between 1985 and 2003, and so everyone ignores that. No one gives a flying fuck about the most common sense things anymore…

             In the comments to the above CDAN item: "... shipping containers that were discovered by Dutch police a week or two ago? There was a barber chair bolted to the floor with leather straps and handcuffs to restrain whoever..." and "...Dutch police said they discovered a twisted, underworld prison with soundproof torture chambers to stifle prisoners’ screams."
            </p>
            <p>
             We know about the soundproofed bathroom in Wexner's / Epstein's NYC mansion and the dental chair in Epstein's Palm Beach mansion and speculation the temple on Pedo Island was a recording studio, because Epstein was a musician.

             In another forum, someone who claimed to be on death row said that to aficionados of this "art" the soundtrack was hugely important.
