            Wikileaks &amp; Snowden already talked about this. Playpen was being run by FBI for quite some time. They shut it down when they were exposed as running it. Hoe does Comey &amp; McCabe honestly bust anybody when they and CIA operatives are either involved/blackmailed accepting bribes or turning a blind eye to politicians innvolved. Disgusted.

             This absolutely not true.  The case has been going on since 2015 and Playpen has been shutdown since 2015.  The got a court order to operate it for two weeks to trace and track down the other criminals involved.  The "exposure" came when the revealed to the lawyers of the people arrested why and how they were arrested in the filings before the court.

             Here's the court documents filed back in 2015 in one of the first cases that went to trial

             One person arrested challenged his arrest in court and lost, this is from January 2016 and clearly says the FBI ran the website for two weeks under a warrant.

               That's because I don't listen to Snowden or Assange.
              </p>
              <p>
               I get paid enough to read the original link and learn that this investigation has been going on for two years and that many cases already went to court.  And I have a basic sense of civics that when the government tries to put you in jail they have to tell you what evidence they have.  This means that Snowden and Assange's claims of the government being exposed make no sense because they came a year or two after the government would have to show their cards.
              </p>
              <p>
               My salary is enough to know how to google a criminal's name to find previous news stories about the case.

                That is your problem then. You "Google" someone's name to find information. You also are relying on civics for interpretending the law and it seems you are also relying on the constitution. These elitist do not play by these rules ang "Google" is part of them.
               </p>
               <p>
                That is exactly why Snowden &amp; Wikileaks came about
                <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/Are_we_sure">

                . This is why you are in denial or as you state you are being paid by them, which indicates you are brainwashed to some extent. You have no critical thinking skills.
               </p>
               <p>
                Snowden &amp; Assange happened because actual whistleblowers went to their superiors through the proper channels are were turned away time and again. Some lost their jobs. Some were put into disrupt campaigns by the FBI/CIA to use slow kill tactics of intimidation. Some went to journalists finally and the journalists were placed under surveilance by the Obama Admin &amp; called enemy of state (James Rosen of Fox News) listening to his phone calls, his wife's, their emails, their parents emails, etc.  Some of those journalists died like Andrew Brietbart of strange "heart attack" after stating openly that John Podesta was a pedo &amp; he was going to expose Obama's real identity, The day after Brietbart Autopsey was performed the coroner who performed it and "allegedly"signed off that it was a "heart attack" died of arsenic poisoning. No investigation done. Are you f***ng kidding me. Did he accidently ingest a lethal dose of arsenic?
               </p>
               <p>
                Next we have Michael Hastings journalist for Rolling Stone. He was writing an expose on John Brennan (CIA director)
               </p>
               <p>
                Just prior to it being published he seemingly became afraid for his life telling his girlfriend and others he believed he was surveiled and the CIA was going to kill him. The night he died he went to his neighbor and asked her if he could borrow her car because he was afraid to drive his due to the fact he believed someone had tampered with it.He was described as being scared, nervous. And said he could not give her more details. She was unable to loan him the car.
               </p>
               <p>
                A short time later his car was seen speeding at a high rate of speed out of control and exploded right before it hit a tree and the fire burned his body beyond recognition.
               </p>
               <p>
                Wikileaks released Vault 7 two weeks ago with authentication CIA documents confirming they have been able to remotely take control over cars for many years and are used in assasination.
               </p>
               <p>
                So excuse me for going on and lecturing you but knowing the law does not make you a genius it should actually make you pissed off like the rest of us. The fact is these Elitists are not enforcing the law,they break it when ever it is convenient ,then cover it up. That should cause you to fight with us because if you are not an elitist and one day get on the wrong side of one, you too will feel their wrath....The law be damned.
               </p>
               <p>
                We all need justice to be restored!

                </p>
                <p>
                 The camera shows the view from near the entrance of Pizzeria Mozza.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Four seconds into the start of the tape, a minivan or SUV goes by the front of restaurant. Three seconds later, another vehicle goes by, traveling from the restaurant front door to the crash site in about seven seconds. At 35 seconds into the tape, a car is seen driving northbound and appears to slow, probably for the light at Melrose.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Then at 79 seconds, the camera catches a very brief flash of light in the reflection of the glass of the pizzeria. Traveling at least twice as fast as the other cars on the tape, Hastings’s Mercedes C250 coupe suddenly whizzes by. (This is probably the “whoosh” that Gary, the Mozza employee, heard.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 The car swerves and then explodes in a brilliant flash as it hits a palm tree in the median. Viewed at normal speed, it is a shocking scene—reminiscent of fireballs from “Shock and Awe” images from Baghdad in 2003.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have heard and read a wide range of guessed speeds, up to as much as 130 mph. I think it’s safe to say the car was doing at least 80.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Driving 80 on Highland is flying. Over 100 is absolute recklessness.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Highland has a very slight rise and fall at its intersection with Melrose. It’s difficult to tell by the film, but based on tire marks—which were not brake skid marks, by the way—chalked by the traffic investigators, it seems that the Mercedes may have been airborne briefly as it crossed the intersection, then landed hard. Tire marks were left about 10 feet east of the restaurant’s valet stand.
                </p>
                <p>
                 (Later, I drove the intersection at just 45 mph, and my car rose up significantly.)
                </p>
                <p>
                 About 100 feet after the car zooms by on the tape, it starts to swerve. At about 195 feet from the camera, the car jumps the curb of the center median, heading toward a palm tree 56 feet away.
                </p>
                <p>
                 About halfway between the curb and the tree, the car hits a metal protrusion—perhaps 30 inches tall and 2 feet wide—that gives access to city water mains below. This is where the first small flash occurs. This pipe may have damaged the undercarriage of the car, perhaps rupturing a fuel line.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I looked at the tape frame by frame. A second flash immediately follows the first. It might be the brake lights, but it’s hard to tell. The next frame is dark. Then comes the first explosion, followed immediately by a large fireball.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I showed the video to a number of people. Everyone had the same reaction: essentially, “Wow!”
                </p>
                <p>
                 “This Was Not a Bomb”
                </p>
                <p>
                 I showed the video to Scott E. Anderson, an Academy Award-winning visual effects supervisor with Digital Sandbox who has engineered explosions for many films.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He viewed the footage more than 20 times at various speeds, including frame by frame. Anderson concluded, “This was not a bomb.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 He said a bomb would have propelled the car upward, not forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                 “It’s very hard to blow up stuff well,” Anderson said. “I think too many things would have to go right. Luck would be involved. Good and bad. Does someone doing this to Hastings want to rely on luck? Too many things have to go right. It would have to be perfect. And that’s almost impossible.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 He continued, “It comes down to physics. A bomb would have lifted the car and the engine up. Based on this video, the car doesn’t go up, and the engine goes forward, which makes sense since the car apparently did not hit the tree head on.”

                 When I did a few minutes of simple research your claim fell apart and you accused me of working for the government. And you really shouldn't accuse anyone of lacking critical thinking skills when 
You swallowed and repeated two false claims without checking the facts.
You believe my response to you is confirmation I work for the government and not mocking your accusation.
You then repeat a bunch of conspiracy nonsense.

                 Hastings car did not "explode" before he hit the tree.  The witness who saw the whole thing said the car was going as top speed and then hit a deep pothole and bottomed out causing sparks and causing the car to fishtail as he lost control and hit the tree.

                 His family doesn't suspect foul play.  They suspected his metal health.  He was bipolar and had issues with drugs in the past.   The circumstances of his death seemed familiar to them.  He was thrown out of college after his first year.  He was talking adderall and cocaine and would become manic.  In fact, his family was about to stage an intervention for him because they felt his erratic behavior before he died indicated he was back on drugs.  He was also known to speed in his car.   He, his friend and his wife were in a car when he got a review of his book, a bad review, by the time his wife finished reading it to him, he was doing 90mph and didn't realize it until his friend told him.

            Wikileaks has published the FBI report on this case. I truly believe they were acting in good faith here. During investigation or operation they identified the location of and seized the Playpen server. Instead of ending it there. They ran it for 2 weeks and served malware on it to track users. Then shut it down and busted users. They might have been operating illegally but those illegal actions have led to many more arrests than if they had just ended it with the server seizure.

             I'll believe that when seeing high profile persons arrested too. There must be quite a few among almost 900 in total.

             But each of those children in the images were victmized for two more week. That is not ok.  This is a serious heinous crime.  Can you imagine murdering just a few more people to catch one more murderer?! No. No .No.

              If you see a couple ants eating the honey in your pantry, you don't kill them and wrap up the honey. You set a poison trap next to the honey. They eat it, carry the poisoned food back to the colony and kill the colony which you could not otherwise get to. From an operational standpoint devoid of emotion, this is just how it's done properly.

              So FBI got onto the case from a tip from a foreign law enforcement agency. Since the server was in the US the ball was in our court so to speak. I think they did the right thing and I think they may have acted illegally as well. If they truly botched the legal aspect of it, then they know all their case prosecutions are at risk of being thrown out due to illegal evidence gathering. I doubt that will happen.

             This has been going on since 2015, it's a whole bunch of different court cases because it's an internet case and the users lived all over the place.  You can look up "website A" cases which is what they called it in the early cases or "playpen cases."

             The first guy arrested lived pretty close to an old address of mine.
            </p>
            <p>
             Vice's Motherboard, the ACLU and the Electronic Freedom Foundation or other legal/civil rights sites have been writing about this for a long time.

             What happened this week is they just sentenced the owner of the website.  They might have wrapped up all the cases.  EDIT:  They have not Looking it up, it seems to be over 200 separate court cases and many are still active.

             Which means there is going to be a lot of different legal decisions and a lot of different appeals.  And as was discussed a lot on this board, a judge in one case in WA said, if the government was not going to reveal exactly how the software that revealed the users IP worked, he would exclude the evidence.  The government withdrew that case because the software is classified.

               AreWeSure has a personality disorder. Must always be right, no one else can have a different opinion. I know some of these in real life. You could tell them that their hair is on fire and they will say "no its not" until their shoes are a pile of ash.
