<p>A man was arrested on Saturday, July 14, after allegedly breaking into a Liberty County home under the false pretense that he worked for Child Protective Services and trying to take three children who lived there.</p>
<p>According to ABC 13, Jimmy Dwayne Lackey, 37, is accused of entering the home and charging after an adult male who was also living there. Lackey allegedly planned on killing the man before kidnapping the children.</p>
<p>The four victims hid inside a bedroom and the male victim grabbed a gun and fired four shots into the ground. According to the Montgomery County Police Reporter, they were then able to get to a neighbor\'s home to call 911.</p>
<p>When deputies arrived on the scene, Lackey allegedly made several attempts to resist and evade arrest before he was finally apprehended and arrested by deputies.</p>
<p>According to the police report, Lackey faces several felony charges including burglary of a habitation with intent to commit another felony, impersonating a public servant, possession of a controlled substance, and resisting arrest.</p>
<p>Lackey is being held at the Liberty County Jail on $75,000 bond.</p>

<p>MOM SAYS FAKE CPS WORKER TRIED TO TAKE AWAY HER BABY</p>
<p>When Ashley Bradley put her son down for a nap on Wednesday, she wasn\'t expecting any visitors, so the New York mom was surprised to find a woman knocking at her door.</p>
<p>The stranger said she was with Delaware County Child Protective Services and was there to remove her 9-month-old, Ja\'vonni, from Bradley\'s care. Yes, the stranger knew her baby\'s name!</p>
<p>But then after she had a second to process, Bradley felt that something was off. The person from &quot;CPS&quot; didn\'t have a state-issued badge, Ja\'vonni\'s name was spelled wrong on the folder she was holding, and Delaware County CPS was the wrong county. Plus, the mom didn\'t have any CPS cases and she hasn\'t done anything that would require a visit from government agency staff.</p>
<p>So, Bradley trusted her mom gut and asked the woman for proof.</p>
<p>The fake CPS worker immediately &quot;got an attitude and stated, \'I just told you who I am,\'&quot; Bradley wrote. &quot;I then told her I was going to call the police and went to get my phone. She was standing on my porch, as I would not let her into my home. When I walked back out into my living room from getting my phone, she was walking very fast around the corner of my house.&quot;</p>
<p>The mom immediately went to go check on her son and contacted the police.</p>
<p>The officer who arrived &quot;said people come from different countries and states, kidnap kids and traffic them; it does not matter what the age,&quot; she wrote. On Love What Matters, Bradley added that police are still investigating and she\'s waiting on them to check video surveillance to see if the unknown woman was caught on video.</p>
<p>Parents Have Enough To Worry About With The Real CPS Workers.  Thank God THAT COP IS SO WOKE.  Please Read Rest of Story.

            This was occurring in the U.K. In the 80's and was termed "phantom social workers". There seems to have been a push to discredit it and tie it in with the "satanic panic" , however the reason I learned about it was because  a few years ago  it starting happening again! I just tried to search for some recent articles regarding attempted kidnappings that followed the same pattern and I can find nothing! Very weird.

               I am sure those that remember this, or horribly suffered at their hands will remember this for a lifetime.  I can't believe it took place.  There we go again, with horrid things so terrible it won't be believed after others are gone.  So frustrating.  Any from the UK, must pass this on and to their children and relatives.  Spread the word.

            Still stealing money from secure bank accounts, still stealing children. This is going to get worse before it gets better. Liberty county still alcohol free? That might be a good thing. I doubt he would get better treatment on the Conroe side. In the old days, he would not make it to the next jail meal. What am I talking about is he would be buried by the menfolk before he got that far.

              I am not so sure those days are entirely gone there. I grew up in CutnShoot, Texas when I was young. That is right on the border of those two counties. The reason for the name was because Liberty was dry. It was nothing but rednecks, nice junkyards, and a few bars. We were in the dirt roads out back. If a strange relative came in to visit, there was a landline system that would telegraph who came up the road, and someone would tell you before they got there. Other than that, everybody pretty much minded their own business.

               Sounds pretty good to me.  Easy to keep track and watch for strangers.  Now with both parents working nobody around to mind the kids in the hoods.  Sad.

                The kids were armed too. That helps. I got my first 410 when I was 8. Already had several knives and completed my second homemade bow and arrow before that. I did not realize the Bronfmans was old news. Just got back and cooking. Sorry.

                 No not old news.  Just arrested.  I am waiting for more news to hit.  There is a new thread on it.   The problem is that children are given guns or they are in the home without teaching them respect for the firearm.  Just like with driving.  They are both weapons.

                  Yeah, city kids and trailer trash. We had them back then. Ain't nothing changed. It was 1977 when I said Mama, why cant I hang out with such and such, she said their parents do the cocaine. That is just the facts in life that young people need to know.

                   Parents are so busy now that they don't have time or just don't care.  Must take an interest and in their friends.  Very important to make the kids feel you care.

             Both are Monsters.  Just pointing out that people need to be aware, they are getting more desperate.  By having Fake Ones, this puts even more on the Street, so to speak.  We have enough of the others.  Now we have to fight the Fakes as well.

                Am not. You should KNOW this. I rarely post. I hate people in general. You are part (delusional and stupid) of the reason WHY I have my general attitude. Imagine an INTELLIGENT person SURROUNDED by STUPID (false assumptions) people like you. THEN, you can begin to understand my personal hell.

                      I am trying to be a GOOD person, though I've DISCOVERED, I'm a STUPID person. I have an idea along that regard. EXPERIMENT. Are you TRUELY (no lies) a black/negroid/africanamerican/gangsta whatever person? Are you INTERESTED in discussing this issue? KNOW that I have won scholarships and have patents (including lawsuits) and I WORKED my "ass" off to get those things achieving MIXED success....WHO are you?

                        THAT is the problex I think. You're contaminated. SEX is NOT what you want. WHY do YOU go with "Shizy"? Do you not realize THAT alone is a disctraction. WE have our OWN problems. We do NOT need nigger problems. How do you respond (respect please) to this position we ALL are in?

                         You say I'm contaminated and then ask that I respond in a positive way? I'm gonna guess English isn't your primary language? I'm just having a hard time understanding what you're  trying to say.

                         Shizy isn't a sex reference. It's slang for shit. I didn't put much thought into it (obviously) and only used it after I dumped my original name after being relentlessly hassled by a number of creepy assholes and shit is what they reminded me of!

                              Never saw him either.  I can't stand people that think they are above others because of their education.  Each person is different.  I have met some of the smartest people that did not go to college and some of the dumbest ones that did.  Actually most of the people that I have tried to red pill are college grads.  Go figure.  Narcissists most of them.

                               Exactly right!! No one cares about that when you're acting like a rude and arrogant person. Education doesn't entitle them to some special privelage to act like a jerk!

                                It's their ploy.  Putting us down and what we just told them, absolves them from looking into anything.  They are either brain dead, or brain washed.  I am giving up on them.  Except for two of them.  They are really worth it and I believe just too busy to know about any of it.  But I don't know how I am going to reach them.  They are in my hood and great people.  I just think they don't believe people are that evil and cruel.  So frustrating.

                                 It's easier to live in a happy reality that you have created than to realize how sick and awful things are going on around you. I have people in my family like that. Then there are the other types who want the truth no matter how awful it is. Those people are the ones who stumble here!

                                  Those that come here, they live by The Truth Shall Set You Free.  There are many that have learned the truth here on voat and many from blogs and other sites.  More and More Everyday.  Our Counter has stopped adding up again.  I was watching it and keeping track and we were adding every week.  Now we have not added anyone for 2 weeks.  Hmm.

                            Oh my God.  So into himself and so interested in downing others.  Racism is obvious. So smart that he is above all others except his own kind.  White and educated or you are useless.  It is sad all the people you don't get to know when you close yourself off to others.

               It cannot lead to good, for sure.  We will have to get even more vigilant, if that is possible.  It's almost impossible to be one step ahead of them.  They are resourceful and sick.  A bad combination.

                You said it resources!  But we have a strong army of people that are growing by leaps and bounds who are waking up to it all ! We have “ word of mouth “ and that is powerful I think .

                 I had to call a fix it man this afternoon.  You never know who you will meet.  One thing led to another and he told me he was a 2nd Amendment Guy and we got onto all kind of things.  Well I told him about voat/pizzagate and he is going to check us out.  So yes, we are growing by leaps and bounds and this guy is on to pedos in our govt. already.  Gives me hope.

                   Exactly!  And the James Gunn/Disney firing will open their eyes.  Unfortunately it takes names like that to attract attention.  But either way, it's good.

             The suspect knew a lot about the mother.  How did she know what she did?  I am going to guess FB and Pintrest and other similar sites.  People have to stop revealing personal info.  Criminals are constantly on the lookout for opportunities.  This is another Horrid Case, and one that ended in the death of this New Mom.  She should have been enjoying her Baby Girl.

              Yes it does seem satanic and ritualistic.  I was also thinking about the 3 year old boy in England who was targeted with an acid attack.  It's almost like a new wave of intentional targeting of children.

               Pedophiles Hate Children.  So they could be doing a lot of this and also Satanism is spreading.  Remember we have posted about them setting up schools within Schools.  Lots of bad things going on in the world.  We do have to remember though, we never used to hear about as much before the internet.  I think there was much more going on then too.

                Let’s not forget the approaching 27th which this year coincides with a lunar eclipse.  I can’t let my mind go there, but t this will be a very important event this year.  The fucking frustration kills me sometimes.

                 Please explain.  What are you expecting to happen then?  When the two coincide?  Something to do with the occult I imagine.  And the Satanist calendar.

                  27th is the massive climax event in the Stanic Calendar marked by anal/vaginal rape and human/animal sacrifice.  This approaching full moon is a Blood Moon and coincides with a lunar eclipse.  They will be celebrating in their usual terrible ways no doubt but with added energy and evil.  My heart breaks for those in their path.

                   We should inform all with children and animals must be kept inside.  Make sure children go in pairs or walk or drive to school if you can.  Take them to a movie or  do something fun outside with them.  If you work make sure they are with other kids and keep in constant contact on phones.  If you can at all do it, this is the day to take off or ask to leave early.  There is no way if  had kids that I would let them roam free this day.  I would not help them Make Their Day.
