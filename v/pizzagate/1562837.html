<p><strong>Soliciting Prospective Buyers</strong></p>
<p>Potential Solicitation 1:
In this inexplicable  (WikiLeak 49098)[<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/49098">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/49098</a>] written in Chinese characters only, there is a PowerPoint presentation attached, from painter Andrew Atroshenko.<br />
From the PowerPoint presentation:</p>
<p>Of 42 portraits, 4 were of men and the remainder were young beautiful women.  The PowerPoint says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 2000, Andrew has worked with dealers from Western Europe and the US, exhibiting and selling his paintings in such US cities as Carmel , Scottsdale, Palm Desert, Las Vegas &amp; Hawaii. Two of Andrew’s pieces were also auctioned off by Sotheby’s in 2002 and 2003</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/dNRrw">Typical images of young women painted by Andrew</a></p>
<p>Thinking that the images might possibly conceal images of trafficking victims offered for sale, I attempted to decrypt an image with online steganography tool using the title of a portrait as a password without results.</p>
<p>Potential Solicitation 2:
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/26192">WikiLeak 26192</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be an art auction in ny that we are doing and I just confirmed that cap will be one of the beneficiaries and get a minimum of $100K in c4 $$. It is on sept 9 and you should try to come if you can but it is not a prerequisite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Potential Solicitation 3:
<a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39777">WikiLeaks 39777</a></p>
<p>In this email, Tony Podesta and Olofsson agree on a specific date for Podesta to arrive at the Andréhn-Schiptjenko gallery in Stockholm, Sweeden ostensibly to view the art of Julie Roberts.  The Roberts show depicts WWII era children who are isolated, sometimes mechanized, sometimes decaying, and infirm, often Jewish.</p>
<p><strong>Methods for hiding transaction</strong></p>
<p>Two Ways Transaction Funds might be hidden:</p>
<ol>
<li>As suggested in Potential Solicitation 2, art/children can be purchased with 501(c)(4) nonprofit Charitable donations, for example, at a gala or fund raiser, where large amounts would not be suspect  
</li>
<li>1031 Exchange Loophole
<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/1031-exchanges-help-art-investors-avoid-taxes-1422849602">This WallStreetJournal article</a> entitled 
<em>With 1031 Exchanges, Art Investors Avoid Taxes: Tactic Used in Real-Estate Investing Makes Inroads in Art World</em> states that IRS regulators state that as long as you sell and buy investment art within 180 days you can differ capital gains.</li>
</ol>
<p>This InvestmentWatchBlog.com article entitled <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/1031-exchange-how-art-can-be-used-to-pay-for-human-trafficking">How Art Can Be Used for Human Trafficking</a> applies the 1031 Exchange Rule specifically to art and child trafficking, proposing a possible scenario:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tying it all together, here’s how to use art to pay for a spirit cooking party:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recruit your handlers from the art world by nurturing artists and becoming their patron. Buy their dog shit at inflated values, then have that art assessed. You now have a tin of dog shit valued at $1 Million.</li>
<li>Donate said tin of dog shit to a gallery. This helps cultivate your sponsored artist and increases the value of their work.</li>
<li>Contact one of the artists you have been cultivating and commission a painting series of the victims you have recruited through modeling agencies, adoption networks or human trafficking rings.</li>
<li>After the victims have become a subject of your art work, you do whatever it is you do to them. Pay the artist for the painting and keep it as a memento so you can re-live the experience.</li>
<li>If you are supplying the victims to a buyer, put the painting up at an auction and invite the buyer to attend. If the buyer is successful in buying the artwork, they get their delivery (Translation: art auctions, in some cases are actually child auctions to those in the know).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What does this mean to PizzaGate?</strong>
Could the solicitation scenario or the commissioned art scenario apply to PizzaGate?  Was Pegasus Museum or Transformers Art Gallery created for the purpose of using art purchases as a cover for sex trafficking?</p>',

            Thanks SturdyGal and here is what I originally posted:
           </p>
           <p>
            Alefantis and his friends are all into the modern art scene and the area where Pegasus and Comet are located is supposed to be home to many CIA officers and for sure many foreign diplomats. So the art galleries would be a perfect front for trafficking the kids. I imagine it works like this:
           </p>
           <p>
            The sale of art is cover for the sale of kids. You pay for the painting you bid on the painting in an auction but what you take home at the end of the night is the kid you paid for. You get the painting as part of the deal. That's what the modern art galleries are doing it's all out in the open but it's under cover.
           </p>
           <p>
            Some art lovers don't realize kids are for sale they are only bidding on the "fantastic modernistic painting" and they are happy to go home with "such a magnificent work of art" but other "buyers" are there for the kids. ;-)

            I thought it might be a spam, too because of those very markings.  But why is he on a Chinese spam list, and why attache then a big PowerPoint.  Could be the artist just got an Asian service to spam everybody but then I wonder how he got the pedestal name.  Anyway of course not proof, just trying to illustrate how it might work.

            I wholeheartedly agree to your post... I connected the dots a few days ago when I wrote my VOAT on Richard Dubeshter and him being an ANC with Pegasus lurking in the background... I just didn't type it out yet, but everything you just typed is everything I've been thinking for almost a week now.
           </p>
           <p>
            Imo, Pegasus and likely other places were being set up to be the ultimate art gallery where they could also hold "Live art shows" that coincided with the Trolley Park's annual holidays and patrons would stand on top of Pegasus or in 1 of the many properties owned by Richard Dubeshter's homes while victims would parade around the Trolley Park with their handlers among unsuspecting citizens of the community.
           </p>
           <p>
            The interesting thing is that I believe the org that is the parent of the Trolley Park is a 501c3 (GreenSpacesDC)... someone can fact check me on that... and the really creepy thing is that Richard Dubeshter is ALWAYS asking for donations on his facebook page for a city run park?!?!

             Interesting.  Another purpose of the art might be simply to screen patsys.  I invite people over to my house, they have drinks, and if they show any interest in a particular piece it's a conversation starter.  We talk a little, I make them feel like their particular deviance is not weird and in, fact, I know a guy who can make it happen.  Then we set it up and film it.  I think this is George Webb's CIA brownstone idea.  But the art is a significant player here, just trying to figure what.  Maybe multi-purpose.

            Don't forget Maria Abramovich's Celebrity Cannibalism event aka Kreëmart at the MoCA Annual Gala 11-12-11. Alefantis and other suspect Bohemian style pizza places are loaded up with "art". Alefantis was supporting the DuPont art tunnels, the Old Vic tunnels were also art tunnels. The "art world" does seem to be wrapped up in the high level pedophile rings. This may be a niche segment of the overall systematic child abuse flowchart - that includes: Adoption agencies, Child Protective Services, Refugee NGO's, hidden pregnancies, kidnapping, illegal aliens. It looks like most of the transfers of children are done with their parents consent and go by way of adoption agencies. But there are also ALOT of missing children, and that is ostensibly without consent - how do all those children get moved around thereafter? Perhaps art auctions are a part of it, but at 1262 missing children per day I can't imagine that it is the bulk majority.
           </p>
           <p>
            According to the FBI, in 2015 there were 460,699 NCIC entries for missing children. 
(460699/365) = 1262 per day

             adam you are absolutely right.  This idea would be only for the very rich as they have to knock themselves out to avoid capital gains or to explain a really big purchase.  My guess is that the rich pay more for discrete services.

            Random reference, but if anyone has seen the recent Affleck movie 'The Accountant', there are two separate elements that relate to #PG... Affleck's character, an assassin, takes expensive artwork as payment for murder... and he owns several adjoining businesses as fronts to cover his money laundering. The details are slightly different but the methods are there.

            Exactly. Who can say what art is really worth. It's in the eye of the beholder. Maybe this is why Jackson Pollocks "work" is valued in the millions.

            I think the same goes for the movies and music. I can imagine that it is handy when caught with children not yours and/or out of place you can tell you are on the way to a movie set and they are actors.

            Tony Podesta is renowned for his status as an art collector.

            The field of art has become so deviant in its messages that people don't question the character of creators of the most perverse "artwork".

             No. Art has not become 'deviant'. People who assess, trade and collect art have. Art has merely followed - in fact the lesser talented 'artists' have.
            </p>
            <p>
             A similar revolutionary thing happened late 18th century. Look at the Rococo style and all its forgotten adopters. Sycophants to power.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then look at Goya's portraits of nobility, before he went rogue and exposed them all as the decadent perverted sadists they were. And are.

              attachment

            </p>
            <p>
             The attachment file is much smaller than the url version. That the url version is sharper is For me, as a layman no surprice. But the attachment file looks to have lines in it that are not in the url version.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have made this short movie about a stenograph program linked to Comet Pizza some while ago and understand that this basic kind of pictures are not the ideal ones to use, and maybe by me see the lines is the reason why? The movie. 2 minutes!

            You are one Spunky Gal!  Either you have hit the nail on the head, or you are pretty close and have given us something to really grab on to.  One thing aside from the selling of the children, it infuriates me that these sick pedos can attend those disgusting spirit cooking parties for free through charity.  It seems to me the Charity stuff is hiding in many corners.  Thanks for all your hard work.
