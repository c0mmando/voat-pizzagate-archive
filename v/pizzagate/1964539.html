<p>The Lyon Sisters (aged 10 &amp; 12) were abducted and murdered by a carnival worker called <a href="http://i.imgur.com/vTRn9I2.jpg">Lloyd Lee Welch</a>     in March 1975 after they disappeared from a local shopping mall were they\'d gone to have pizza. The murders remained unsolved for 40 years until convicted pedophile Welch was charged with the double murder in July 2015. It\'s the longest cold case in US history in a body-less murder. Welch\'s uncle <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0wF5Y3x.jpg">Richard Allen Welch</a> worked as a security guard at the mall and is also a suspect in the case after his nephew accused him of helping him abduct the girls then witnessed him raping one of them. Another cousin Henry Parker admitted that he\'d helped Lloyd Lee Welch burn the bodies of the victims on land owned by Richard Allen Welch\'s sister Elizabeth Parker on Taylor’s Mountain, Thaxton, Virginia. Several of Richard Allen Welch\'s relatives were charged with obstruction of justice in the murder case.</p>
<p>Here\'s the street view of <a href="http://i.imgur.com/P9EvR7I.jpg">3124 Jennings Rd &amp; 3121 Plyers Mill Road</a></p>
<p>The fact that the Lyon Sisters\' house is right next to a property owned by James Alefantis could be a complete coincidence, but when you throw the surname &quot;Welch&quot; into the mix and the connections it has to both Alefantis <a href="http://i.imgur.com/cPm3qOk.jpg">(Edgar Maddison Welch)</a> and the Lyon Sisters (Lloyd Lee Welch) then I suspect there\'s something more to this than meets the eye. Are the Welch families related? If they are, then it could suggest that the same multi-generational families and properties have been used for child trafficking going back decades. Lloyd Lee Welch had 4 children with his long term girlfriend <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wUqvrXy.jpg">Helen Craver</a> all of whom were taken into foster care. Who, and where are Welch\'s 4 kids? Edgar\'s father Harry L. Welch Jr on the other hand has 3 adopted children, though it\'s not clear if Edgar is one of them. Maybe there is a link to Richard Allen Welch who is a suspect in the Lyon sisters case? Or his cousin Henry Parker? I\'m just guessing really, but both Welch families do appear to be from the same generation and of a similar age group. Edgar also lived in Haiti for an unspecified time and his <a href="http://i.imgur.com/2nF09EQ.png">father\'s biography</a> raises a few red flags such as his work with Adopt A Child. Both are also involved with film making which suggests that Edgar could be a crisis actor.</p>
<p>So are these families related in some way? Is there a connection between both Welch families and James Alefantis? and is there something we don\'t know about 3124 Jennings Road?</p>

           <p>
            Adoption, church deacon, filmmaker with Peter Pan esque titled production company, dentistry, boy scouts, child abuse charities and son worked in Haiti. That is an incredible list of KNOWN areas where child abuse is rife for someone to be coincidentally involved with.

            An aside, my theory: Alefantis might very well be the "Here Comes Your Man" go-to engineer behind underground construction of other boutique pizza joints in the nation--plenty of those--Goat Hill Pizza in San Francisco comes to mind. Who better than he to create the undectectible infrastructure and connect the Ratlines necessary for discreetly handling / moving the kids?  I thought about this when I first read about his wealth and level of influence in DC, read that other American pizza shops bear similar nefarious public identities. Then I read about his connection to the Pegasus Theatre construction...sayin.

            James Alefantis is so gross--naming his company "here comes your man" really?! I am sick of him and this potential lead is extremely interesting and very coincidental.

            Nice post that deserves some attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            The problem is that Welch is a common name. In one of the threads I posted, there was a serial killer with the same last name as the person I was writing about, but I couldn't find a connection so didn't mention it. I see you're also be responsible by not leaping to conclusions. Hope someone can dig into this a little further. The fact JA was living so close is uber troubling.

             Heres the deal though. Running back family lines and checking associations using only google, geni, genealogy sites, etc. only provide very little information, and relying on facebook and social media to determine associations is even getting close.  Far more often than not, YES THEY ARE RELATED and/or associated.  I like peoplelooker.com and intelius. Together... a good idea of what you need to know. EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW.

            Consider you are an evil choad and running the world...you control the world thru blackmail and providing things that match peoples various piccadillos.  You have to ACT good and normal..so certainly laws have to exist and laws against things like pedophilia have to exist.  But if pedophilia is your primary tool in your blackmail...well, hell, wouldn't you be on the lookout for pedophiles?  And when you find them use them?  Like a big insider party where only those in the club can share the secrets?  So what happens when one gets arrested?  Well...you offer them choices like:  we will take your kids away to be used and they will no longer be your kids, or; we give you a job that involves trafficking or other illegal activities because we know you are our man.
           </p>
           <p>
            So..now you have this big criminal network..and these kids you are abusing and passing around eventually grow up.  So now you have a second generation of criminals who have been abused and are abusers.  A problem is NAMES..so you take kids away, abuse them for years, then put them with affluent families to be further used...these kids (probably) take the names of the families they are placed with.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think Alefantis is one of these kids...he certainly has been "placed" with affluence..he is tied to this big ring...
           </p>
           <p>
            Also interesting...I was reading a comment by a psychiatrist on what happens sexually to these abused kids when they grow up.  Opinion was they become far WORSE abusers and seem to gravitate toward very young children as their victims.

            I wonder if welch was given a sort of deal. weeks before he went to comit, he was involved in a traffic incident of some sort, i think i remember reading that a young boy was in the hospital in critical condition because of it. Anyways what if the prosecutors were aware of his acting career and offered him a plea deal where he would get a reduced sentence in return for helping stage a shooting. I plan on comparing similar cases to see if 4 years is the typical sentence as well as what a possible sentence for his traffic incident would have been.

             Good point. I have a theory that he deliberately ran over the kid in order for his handlers in US Intelligence to portray him as "reckless and unhinged" in the news, ie: someone who could shoot up a restaurant (from which they could create their "fake news" narrative). The car accident was on 25th Oct 2016 so they would have known about the pizza stuff in Podesta's Emails. So the car accident and the Comet shooting incident were part of the same psyops. Just a theory mind.
