<p>This is another quickie post that I had to get out there because it concerns another star that I used to enjoy watching falling into the pit of hell. Ellen DeGeneres, the friendly, cool Satanist that I used to think was funny, made me open my eyes as another shoe dropped. Seems she produces a new show called First Dates that I had the misfortune of watching. Disclaimer: Sometimes you don\'t always have control of the remote, but I\'m sort of glad I didn\'t.</p>
<p>I figured it wouldn\'t be too bad, but the show is godawful and insidious towards a certain class of people (mostly young, attractive white women, but then they\'re the enemy). Anyway, one half of the blind date is a loser that\'s plucked from the episode of X-Files HOME (X-File junkies, you know the episode I\'m talkin\' \'bout!) Yes, Woody (that\'s the name he\'s going by) is that bad. The huge, hulking other half of the date shows up and he\'s immediately attracted to the alleged woman with a hairline like werewolf Eddie Munster. How? Why? They\'re talking when out the blue this woman asks (paraphrasing): &quot;So if you were given the chance to eat human meat, would you?&quot; Woody immediately gets an erection and jumps all over the remark. &quot;YEAH! I\'ve always wanted to try human meat! I mean, I wouldn\'t kill anyone or anything, but if it was there ... even if they killed someone out in the alley, yeah, I\'d love to try it!&quot; She follows up with: &quot;And how would you like it?&quot; They both scream &quot;RAW!&quot; as they cackle in unison!!! No joke. Yes, I\'m paraphrasing. but there it is. The broaching and normalization of cannibalism by two people that clearly deserve a stint in a federal penitentiary. And the kicker? That woman is from MARYLAND/VRGINIA! Yes, victims of The Finders Cult are still out there! For those interested in viewing the offending material, it\'s Episode 2: No Idea What Her First Name Is. </p>
<p>How did Ellen stay under the radar all this time? I don\'t watch that Satanist\'s show so didn\'t know she actually had The Cannibal Queen on asking who\'d she rather have sex with by showing two choices. The choices started off tame, but then got into Beyonce, Michelle Obama ... and then  KILLARY\'S OWN DAUGHTER CHELSEA and Michael Obama?!!!! WTF? Here\'s the clip: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEE655KDgN8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEE655KDgN8</a></p>
<p>I mean, come one! This is inappropriate no matter what the circumstance, but you have a mother being asked if she\'d prefer to sleep with her child over the current first lady of the United States at 4 in the afternoon on national TV and there\'s no outcry? But it\'s just another non-threatening alcoholic illuminati asking the woman alleged to have abused Cathy O\'Brien so nobody really cares. It\'s how these things work. Just bring up a taboo subject under the guise of normalcy, and the seed is planted that this is okay. If Ellen and The Cannibal Queen aren\'t upset and think it\'s a joke, then it must be all right and you override your own good judgement in lieu of what &quot;authority&quot; tells you to think. It\'s called &quot;conditioning&quot;. </p>
<p>DeGeneres was also the show that had Michael Obama swinging her nuts to the groove: </p>

<p>And Michael had two daughters, huh?</p>',

            To be this messed up her family likely did horrible things to that cabbage head who farts when asked a question (hence the 2016 election Depends robes that did not compliment her in any way. She's got parkinson's, and just for the sake of my sanity, I'm going to say that is a natural development likely not helped by her apparent ease of drinking everyone under the table, except Bill of course but she never hung out with him past 2001, not from Kuru which gives parkinsonian symptoms...

            I believe there was a new show on Netflix that also glorifies cannabalism as well.  The elites aren't even bothering to hide their agenda to normalize pedophilia and Satanism anymore it seems...

             Soros bought a controling interest in Netflix in Dec.  He is the reason for this obvious degenerate propaganda.

             Could be they're forced to normalize because the schedule is moved up .... or it could be that they think we've been conditioned enough and ready (probably the latter).

             Someone should quickly put together a series that demonstrates exactly what goes into cannibalism. The selecting of a victim, the cold-blooded murder, the preparation and how only someone without a soul would be able to do that ... and then the demons that eat a person's flesh. You know, now that I'm thinking about it, remember Jeffrey Dahmer? The entire country was HORRIFIED by what he did. Now consider how much the country has changed thanks to this malevolent influence of the Cannibal Elite. Scary ... very scary.

            I'm going to further emphasize a comment here, by Zen0.
            <strong>
             I want to make this CLEAR, and save people some trouble, trying to verify.
            </strong>
            THIS version of this idiotic "Who Would You Rather" game was NOT about "who would you rather have sex with (sleep with, do), but "who would you rather have as Vice President." The guy barely mentions that, then continues throughout the rest of the video to heavily imply that the show was based on a question about having sex. To the point, I actually thought it WAS, until I easily found the original clip on the Ellen Show YouTube channel.
           </p>
           <p>
            It took me a minute to get his point - that the game is usually about some fucked up "who'd you rather ________" question, implying there's some hidden meaning in all this. Considering MY low opinion of those two degenerate witches, the stretch to acknowledging this as a sick joke, on their part, isn't far. But, if you're like me, and have no clue as to how this segment of the Ellen Show usually goes, the guy who made this video gets a C- for clarity.

             Thanks. That's what I'm trying to do ... it's what we all should be doing. If we hear something inappropriate, like an agenda being pushed, speak up! Don't wait until it's too late to do anything about.

            " If Ellen and The Cannibal Queen aren't upset and think it's a joke, then it must be all right and you override your own good judgement in lieu of what "authority" tells you to think. It's called "conditioning".
           </p>
           <p>
            It's much worse than that.  Watching TV induces low alpha waves and suspends THINKING.  You're in a highly suggestive, passive state so your brain is "taking it all in."

             Anything reality TV is horseshit. Other than the sports of choice you enjoy watching. As for TV series which are not tainted (or barely tainted) with actors with normal backgrounds, not this kind of white trash pop "music" (that's why I listen to hardcore punk and thrash metal, it's truth music, it's in your fucking face, it's not pleasant to the ears of double digit IQ's and some bands have lyrics that touch on topics like this and all kinds of injustices.....even Metallica surprised by how "One" became so big, they had to say in 1989 that One isn't an anti-war song....which it is, but they couldn't say that in Bush Sr. (Reagan part 3)'s America. Plus it takes actual talent to play most metal genres, thrash being one of the most difficult when it came out.).

             It's your problem though, here in Canada I fight the Natives' fight with them, the horrors of the Residential Schools and the mass graves everywhere in Canada full of native children kidnapped from their parents to de-indianize them were brutal and the United Church/Catholic Church and the Anglican church were all those who sponsored this effort that lasted 80 years (ended in 1996!). Injunctions have been placed by the previous Conservatard government in 2014 not to permit digging around the now abandoned Residential Schools (which were in the middle of nowhere in northern Canada, so escaping was not an option), the Liberals will likely let the injunction end without renewing it and may all the lawyers and the natives who are now in their 60's who saw Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip leave a Residential School after they came "just for them" to have a picnic with the students, they picked 10 out of the 70 or so kids and brought them into their jet plane and they disappeared forever. A common law warrant is on her head right now (the Queen), too bad Phillip had to die..nah, i'm fine with him dying, enough eye witnesses confirmed the common law tribunal in Europe. This is our fight. Anybody admitting to be a pedophilia here....which I only know of once....some kids got high on PCP and LSD and the provider of the stuff was really fucked in the head, he actually found a large bag of powder PCP at a bus stop, he was a normal kid, just smoking weed sometimes, but he thought it was coke....it should have been, wouldn't have warped his mind like that, he started showing to his friends when we were 18-19, with his desktop plugged to a large TV pictures of 13 year old boys having sex and they almost killed him after the beating he's got, he had a blood clot in his head and the doctor refused to remove it, not even giving him anti-clotting meds, they give him nothing for pain, told him he had a blood clot near his cerebellum and if it was to move any further he would die.
            </p>
            <p>
             That's not really foillowing the Hippocratic oath, but they knew what led to this. He's not dead, he says he can feel the blood clot apparently, never saw him again, a girl told me that when they just went to buy weed from him. His IQ dropped by 30-40 points and it was already damaged from all that PCP snorting. Feels good to see justice accomplished sometimes.

             Upvoat for you. You're absolutely right. I didn't even think of that. It might be why I almost fell off the couch when the cannibalism came up in conversation. I was in this passive state and JOLTED awake .... that's exactly what it felt like, too.

              Rosie has shilled about 9/11 since day one. The tower 7 collapse was a distraction. What is really going to blow 9/11 open is the proof that the fake bin Laden videos were made in the US - something which many suspected for years - and the PTB have that proof. Things are a-happening behind closed doors.

                I've known about this for almost ten years. Follow the money trail backwards from those who have made a fortune off the backs of missing people. One place I suggest is pseudo-celebrity Beth Holloway's gutted facebook page. Likewise Joyce Kesse, mother of allegedly still missing Jennifer. Do they really look like people who are really looking for their allegedly still missing children? A lot of parents sold their own children. Others like Nancy Grace are complicit in the disappearance of the allegedly still missing Trenton Duckett. Trust me, the entire celebrity media is going to collapse real, real soon.

            This is just bad. I hate that they are trying to normalize something as sick as cannibalism. its disgusting. not to mention the rest, and about deez nutz... i have yet to find any photo where Michelle Obama is pregnant full term... but maybe i am missing it... but they show her in dresses with empire waists as if she was 3 months or 4 months but there are none that i have found where she is full term with either child. just weird... thats all.

            Hi everyone I have a confession to make. I think pizzagate is a ridiculous fictitious conspiracy theory because I am in fact a pedophile. I like young boy cock and I really don't want you to interrupt my stream of African and Haitian children so I come here and hate on pizzagate. I fuck young boys there I said it. I'm going to go kill myself now.

            We have to start using the meme power. You guys do realise that they're just regular people right? All of them, those that call themselves "elites", "celebs", "VIPs" they're all made of flesh &amp; bones. Nothing powerful about them. They think they can scare us with their bling and their fat wallets, but they lack something very important. Moral fucking values. They're scum. No better than cockroaches.

            You know,  I do believe that most likely every celebrity to some degree is trapped in this matrix and Ellen is no exception.  Simply because she is gay and a celebrity she would be goaded along the way to support some awkward cause that has nefarious connections, but I think as far as pizzagate is concerned this thread is a bit over-reaching.  I will reiterate,  while I do believe Ellen is on it to a certain capacity,  this thread just does not bring it. I think if we are to make a statement about this particular celebrity we better shelve the small stuff until we have a nice,  interesting cache.  Glad to hear you have pointed this sick event out to us,  but it just doesn't convince me of much.  I see a diabolical element in 99% of all tv as it is so...

             It should mean something to you. The same way it should mean something to you that Bob Saget joked about his infant son being anally fingered, and Bill Maher joked about a twelve-year-old being molested. These things should matter to you because it crosses a line ... and if you don't have boundaries, you have no society and the Cannibal Elites will have won. That's just my opinion, but I'm tired of giving a pass to these pervs. If I hear about cannibalism ... on a show about first dates? Come on! Something else is going on ...

              It most definitely means something, and I don't mean to disparage your initiative and effort, I'm just saying when you go, go big on these celebrities. Ellen is one we don't have much on and seems intent on trying to keep below radar and frequently isolates when she's not on the show. I get the feeling that maybe you, others and myself included, that since we know so much about some other 'stars' we wonder how she could be any different, and may be a sort of a projection. However, simply because she is enveloped by the life and lifestyle of a celebrity and what naturally comes with the business, ie, towing the sponsors line, giving away material possessions, artificial happiness manufacturer that who knows, you might be on to something big eventually, it's a start in understanding the motivations of this woman.

               I understand, but I caught this show and didn't know how many others saw it. I wanted to make them aware. I'm glad I posted this as Anne Heche came up. What she went through was horrible, and I always believed she'd been abused. The fact that Ellen was handling her seems right.

                You are right, Heche does prefer bizarre and controversial roles and also displays some kind of severe mental disability, meaning she could very well be a multiple and a handler as well.

            No doubt. It stands to reason if they normalize cannibalism ... an ultimate taboo ... the rest would be easy to accept. And think how this has already been done with human flesh being found in burgers and meat suppliers' food. Restaurants/fast food places are receiving a mixture of human flesh and serving it without being aware of what it is.

            Early in DeGeneres career, she made fun of how her name sounds like 'degenerate'.
There is no mistaking the fact that she has been given an assignment to promote the sick agenda of the elite and now it has come to the point of  sheer depravity. People actually watch this crap and think it is normal. It's not called programming for nothing.

             It's also notable that the people scaring were in COSTUMES.  Considering that MK-Ultra is "themed," and that many (if not most) celebrities have been MKed, it is a double whammy for them (probably more so than for the average person).

             Jews are masters of deception.  That's why so many of them work in Hollyweird -- acting comes naturally to them.

              Yes, that is a great point--thanks for sharing it. Didn't we see some weird costumes connected with Comet Ping Pong?
             </p>
             <p>
              Costumes--as featured in Purim, the holiday that allegedly celebrates a king killing his own people at the behest of a whore. At Purim, cookies are made in the shape of ears and other body parts of the "villain"--the guy who tried to red pill the king--shades of cannibalism. Also, why is this costume a perennial favorite and even "costume of the year"? :

             This video was bang on thank u. Yes the scaring people on her show was always horrible and it would always scare me as well. It's not funny and I never thought it was and most of the people were trying to keep their composure as they were on national tv. They would be in the midst of answering a serious question that Ellen didn't care about obviously. Certain celebs were not scared though. This show should be boycotted. It's sad so many people love her but can't see the truth.

             Thanks for the link. Yeah, she is a degenerate. I always forget that sociopaths can be charming. Especially when they're jacked up drugs or alcohol. She's given things to say and he says them ... that's not a talent ...

            Anne Heche used to be Ellen's domestic partner and then when they broke up she was labeled insane. Same thing happened when Portia tried to leave the relationship before being pulled back in and getting crazy facelifts. Ellen remained unscathed and increasingly successful.

             Upvoat for you! Anne Heche disappeared down my memory hole. And didn't she admit to being abused? But nobody believed she'd been raped?

             I know she was found wandering ... with her hair cut? Wonder if it was a ritual gone wrong. I mean, if the ritual abuses tattoo without permission, wouldn't they also cut hair? It might account for all those whacko do's I see. Like Miley ... WTH was that? But thanks for reminding. Yeah, Anne Heche. I hope she's okay.

              Hair cutting is an MK ULTRA thing. I'm not sure if it's a marker or a signal or what, but there's a list of celebrities who have lost it and had their hair cut or strangely colored.

               When the Pizzagate truth goes live, it will be made known that the heads of most of their male rape/torture victims were shaved/scalped to minimize lice transmission.

                This brings to mind the "Caesar cut" trend of the 1990s! A hairstyle that blossomed in the gay community and spread throughout the population. Makes sense and is incredibly depressing to think abou

               Really? Maybe it has to do with identity? They really screw with people's heads. I read about some of those rituals done to children, and it would be hard to get a handle on who they were and what they were supposed to look like. Perhaps it's also control over the hair of a young child. I remember reading something about Jonbenet Ramsey's photographer cutting her hair. I remember thinking that it was odd that she did that. She didn't get permission an she seemed sort of proud of doing it. I doubt I can find the article. Up to that time, I'd thought it was the mother that had done it, but she swore up and down that she had. I feel so sorry for these kids. They don't know love and they're only property and sexual tools. No wonder they have such problems.
              </p>
              <p>
               Edit: Just remembered that Rhianna does the same thing. I believe she cuts her hair when she has problems.

               With her there were hints that she took out her problems on her hair. Can't remember who said it, but they made reference to her doing things to her hair like cutting or pulling it and then having to get extensions of wear wigs. So it definitely had to do with the effects suffered ... and could it have been put in her head? Why not? She clearly was suffering from something so why not being threatened?

               I know. When they found her scared, bleeding, and alone they blamed it on her being crazy and on drugs. Why wouldn't someone that's been raped as a child be on drugs? WTH do they expect? That they'll end up normal?

            ... the question was "who'd you rather have as your vice president", but i understand that the game is usually who would you rather have sex with. Not as degenerate as initially painted, but given how the game is usually played, it's not far off for audience members' minds to subconsciously go there.

             Of course! If you're asking who you'd rather have sex with and put up two more pics ... ???? In fact, it's worse in a way because it's mixing job and having sex with someone you'd appoint for a job. Isn't that not PC correct?

             Love it! Degenerate. Definitely fits. And Twitter protected her. That should be reason enough to know that she's part of this conspiracy. Palin had tweeted a pic of her kid standing on the family dog. Degenerate did the same thing, but no outcry AND the pic was scrubbed. Not so with Palin. It's all over the place.

            They realized that in order to get from A to Z you must go in alphabetical order - slow but steady. First you plant the seeds where once a taboo subject and a bio/psychological abnormality (ir homosexuality) enters public consciousness as an 'alternative' sexual orientation. Use the media to paint a jolly fun picture of gay life style (Fraser??!), at the same time demonise family and concoct a rape culture (biggest social hoax ever) Then you give them more rights, right to addopt, use propaganda to normalize the abberation! Now imagine if in the 1950's some politician had propsed same sex marriage or transgender bathrooms - I would not be that person. Imagine if public (1950's) came across photos of chidren taped to a table and babies with #hotard ??!!!! That would be going from A to say ...... V, or W, a huge leap! This has been playing out for the last few decades!

             We really have to get together some coalition to complain about the normalization on the media. Like this. Call the stations and boycott advertisers for this show. We do have numbers. If nothing else, the Christian right would definitely be counted on. I'd hope we could get more centric, but WTH cares? At least they're not laughing about cannibalism and parents being asked if they'd sleep with their own children!

             Because it would be taken down. The pics constitute fair use, but if they showed the clip, there would be a copyright infringement. it's how the Cannibal Elites play this game.

            LGBT is the trap we have fallen for.  They​ are controlling our direction of social development because of their position.  Hang on it gets worse.

             Yeah, this is REALLY bad. I know in Russia, they tried to strip men and women of their sexual identities. This might be a way of doing it. Does anyone have definitive studies on what the stripping of sexual identity does to someone? Of course, the studies would have to be pre- the surge to convert us all to this new religion. I'm just wondering what was written when Russia/communism tried this and the Cannibal Elite are spreading Communism. McCarthy was a genius and a prophet. He got in trouble when he targeted PedoWood. Is this all beginning to make sense now?

             It's a trap alright, they get everyone on board with the LGBT crowd then thrown in a P (for pedo) at the end! I seen a video the other day. Normalizing pedos &amp; cannibals...   humanity is headded down the shitter.

              I call her Elen Degenerate - she looks like she belongs with Alifantis in his seedy pizza parlor, with Jacke Tapper &amp; wife to keep her (or is it him) company.

               So do I!!!!! Degenerate hahaha Yeah I've called her that for a long time and her whole show is programming the NWO agenda with tons of kids, pizza, LGBTQ, Kartrashians, politicians and everything else in between. She knows exactly what she's doing while coming across as your best pal. People are blinded.

                They have no soul! Bet you any money Caitlyn Jenner was paid off handsomley for that stunt - just to push the LGBTPQRSTЯЙЬЖШХ agenda. So was Fake Jones when he apologized to James-American-Psycho-Alifantis. Degenerate, Colbert, Megyn Smelly, Bill Maher, John Oliver, Trevor Noah - they are all part of the cabal, and may even partake in rituals. They all seem to be well aquainted with Marina Abramovic! Watch that extraordinary interview with Bernard - it's the truth. I have a friend who works in high finance and he told me that child porn DVD's exchange hands like after meal mints! It's a depraved world. Question is, what are we gonna do about it?!

                 Agreed. Your last part really gets me. Has your friend ever confronted any of these people? Are they all pedos? It would be so satisfying to leave a DVD on their desks advising them that "we know" what your into and have the dirt blah blah blah and blackmail them back to get more dirt on all of them and then send it all in to the child trafficking and crimes unit. Fucking pieces of shit.

                  He was shocked to find out that most of them were not even pedos, they wanted a new high, a novelty!!! Absolutely sick. They did not even bothered if my friend went to the cops! Look how Titus Frost's friend hacked into CPP to find CP, sent it to the Police, FBI, DHS - and nothing! Robert David Steele gave an interview with Victurus Libertas saying thay all top police chiefs were compromsed - he added 'without exception.' Public has to hire private detectives - that is what Trey Gowdy is doing. They need to be taken down. Trump may not be the best thing ever but he is the best chance we've got! Let's not waste time.

             I suspect you're right. If the MO established by the Cannibal/Pedo Elite is right, then nobody/nothings like DeGeneres are rewarded a carrot to play with. I suspect Portia de Rossi was that carrot. Think Tom Cruise awarded prizes ... and Angelina Jolie ... "But I want BRAD!!!! WAHHHHH!!!!" She skanks herself with rituals, gets tatted up, is given blackmail evidence on people she wants to control (this in her own words in the video is made ... yes, the one they tried to scrub from the internet). The marriage is a farce. They're both alcoholic and out of control, but then it's an alliance made in hell.
