            Off topic a bit, but Charles Lindbergh was into Eugenics! Many believe he had his son kidnapped/killed because his son had rickets &amp; his bones weak would cause noticeable deformities. Embarrassing to have a defective child, Lindbergh pd 2 have him kidnapped.
           </p>
           <p>
            Eugenics is solo Evil!

            I haven't heard anything, but, it looks like a lot of the links that were being tossed around weren't archived. If someone has a few extra minutes, might not be a bad idea to keep this stuff locked down. We've lost a good bit of intel since the beginning... because, you know, if you are totally innocent the first step is to immediately scrub everything you can, delete images, shut down social networks, pull videos, release shills, death threat people, shut down entire forums, launch a massive media coordinated PR effort, remove questionable artwork, install new security locks/mirrored windows at key places of interest, and change some incriminating logos.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because that's what innocent people do... right?

            So here's an interesting tidbit: the founder of moose international and the kids' town was a proponent of eugenics.

            Looked up founder of the moose lodge, james davis. Looked up town he's from in wales. Says he is the founder of moose INTERNATIONAL, the grand lodge of the moose in Great Britain. But the link for moose international automatically REDIRECTS to loyal order of the moose. No mention of international anything. Highly suspect.

             We can confirm the Moose Lodge plays a major role in the system of brazen corruption and abuse in Racine, Wisconsin and is part of a bigger network of many interwoven groups involved.

            The history of Mooseheart Child City &amp; School is inextricably intertwined with that of the Loyal Order of Moose and the Women of the Moose, two organizations whose stupendous growth during the first quarter of the 20th century was inspired by the idea of creating this beautiful home and community for children in need.
           </p>
           <p>
            James J. Davis – who later would serve as Secretary of Labor to three Presidents, then 14 years in the U.S. Senate – agreed late in 1906 to take on the job of recruiting members into the then-faltering Moose organization, on the basis of eventually using members’ pooled resources to create a home and school where dependent widows of Moose members could take their children.
Pieces of History
           </p>
           <p>
            It is James J. Davis (right) who is duly honored as Mooseheart’s founder, for he conceived the Child City concept—and tirelessly sold hundreds of thousands of men on the idea. But it was Rodney Brandon (left) who built the place, guiding the campus’ planning, construction, staffing and program for its first three years.
           </p>
           <p>
            U.S. Vice President Thomas Marshall was recruited to speak at Mooseheart’s dedication ceremony on July 27, 1913. Five years later, speaking to the 1918 International Convention in the new Roosevelt Auditorium, the Vice President returned and confessed that he’d been very skeptical as he spoke beneath a circus tent on that hot day in 1913. “I felt that . . . it was only a circus performance and when the tent went down, the show would be over. Thank God that today...all that I hoped for on that interesting occasion has come to pass at Mooseheart.”
           </p>
           <p>
            In late 1912, the Moose Supreme Council approved the purchase of what was known as Brookline Farm, nearly 1,000 acres west of the Fox River along the dirt-surfaced Lincoln Highway.
           </p>
           <p>
            What is now Minnesota Home on the Mooseheart campus was originally dubbed Purity Hall; the high-school age girls who lived there upon its completion in 1915 began their mornings with calisthenics.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the time this aerial photo was taken in 1933, many of today’s established Mooseheart landmarks were in place, notably the Campanile. With the Depression setting in, only the football stadium would be built between this point and the end of World War II.
           </p>
           <p>
            The center court of the five-building Baby Village complex was originally built in 1922 with a formal concrete fountain (left); by 1940 (right) the fountain had been replaced by a much more practical (and fun!) wading pool.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fraternity’s Nine O’Clock Ceremony was first depicted in oil for distribution to Lodges in the early 1930s, with a Mooseheart child saying a bedtime prayer with the Campanile tower shown outside the window; the painting was updated in the early 1960s, now the House of God is depicted at dusk outside the window.
           </p>
           <p>
            By the 1940s Mooseheart’s front entrance, off Illinois Route 31 (formerly Lincoln Highway), had been paved for many years and was graced with mature trees. The concrete column at the entrance had been a gift from the Class of 1929.

              </a>
              Apparently, the Pizza is ordered at PP and the kids passed off at VIP Canine?  Also, for a Pizza place to have been around for 20 years, why don't they have their own website?  Look at their menu, that's all i could find...something weird as hell going on in that neighborhood...not sure why this is getting deleted on VOAT&gt;
