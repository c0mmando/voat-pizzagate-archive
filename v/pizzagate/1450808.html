            I am happy to say and thank you to those who replied on this topic the tinychat.com/100chats and gamesgames123 have both been removed and shutdown by tinychat. Weebly got back to me and told me those sites will be removed as well.  I know this doesnt stop all pedophiles and i know people are going to say theyll just create another room and eventually it will be the SSDD...but if i saved at least one child from exposure of what was going on in that chat? Im ok with that.  Thank you for all who were concerned and help. We did good work today :)

            Thank you already contacted Tinychat. Now have contacted weebly as well. If the room is removed by the webmasters at weebly then that should take care of it.  I didn't rip the IP's they were posted by someone else who has been collecting the info in the chat. And in this instance I think an exception could be made because we are trying to track down scum.

            People need to stop calling CPS, they are deeply involved, not sure how bad the DHS is. FBI is probably the best first call to make! As well as local and state police!
