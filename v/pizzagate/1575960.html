<p>The following is a post that excited my curiosity:
<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085</a></p>
<p>It discusses the Alefantis connection in purchasing the Pegasus Museum property at 3518 11th St Rear, Washington DC. It was purchased by Alefantis from the ‘Estate of Joseph T. Scheve’ and ‘Nellie Hubbard’.</p>
<p>I decided to investigate this connection more. Wanted to know if Alefantis just bought from an estate sale or if there was truly a deeper connection between Scheve/Hubbard and James Alefantis. To do my due diligence, I started digging for the document that drove the above VOAT post.</p>
<p>VOILA! Below is the link to that document:

<p>“Superior Court of the District of Columbia PROBATE DIVISION Foreign No. 2011-0104 JOSEPH THEODORE SCHEVE, Deceased NOV 5, 2008, Date of Death Notice of Appointment of Foreign Personal Representatives And Notice to Creditors NELLIE T.

Pub Dates: SEP 29, OCT 6, 13, 2011. “</p>
<p>Fact from this document that jumped out at me are:
James Alefantis was an AGENT OF THE ESTATE of Joseph T. Scheve 
Since he is not an attorney or fiduciary (that I know of), this means he would have to be a close friend/associate of Scheve/Hubbard (much more than just a casual acquaintance).</p>
<p>SO WHY IS VALIDATION OF ALEFANTIS’ CONNECTION TO SCHEVE/HUBBARD IMPORTANT?</p>
<p>As a note from the earlier VOAT post I referenced (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085)</a>), Joseph T. Scheve was the business manager for the New Hope Academy, a school connected to the Unification Church (AKA Moonies) at 7009 Varnum Street, MD Hyattsville. Hyattsville is a close urban suburb of Washington DC. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St</a>. The Unification Church has curious connections to the CIA (and other intelligence agencies), Washington (friends with the Bush and Biden families and convicted pedophile, former Speaker of the House, Hastert), and Haiti (New Hope Academy has a branch there).The Unification Church also has had quite the reputation for odd sex rituals and brainwashing.

<p>Also, according to that post (<a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1564085)</a>), there is a strong theory on where the children are housed.
(here is a direct quote from that post)
&quot;So where are the children James Alefantis deals with likely kept/housed?
It\'s highly likely they are kept in neighbouring homes around New Hope Academy along Varnum Street, Hyattsville. Open this link and scroll down to see the number of residents listed in each of the single residential family homes that make up Varnum Street. Some of the homes are listed as having one bathroom ie. 7111 Varnum Street and happen to service 25 residents. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Hyattsville/7009-Varnum-St</a>
Children are also most likely kept in homes neighbouring 7292 Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706 which is listed as the residential address of one Joseph T Scheve, Business Manager of the New Hope Educational Institute Inc and Nellie Hubbard (wife/divorced).
Note how 40 residents are listed at neighbouring property, 7308 Finns Lane. Next door, 28 residents and so on…Again, these are single family residences. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln7292">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln7292</a> Finns Lane, Lanham, MD 20706 <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln#expanded_map">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7292-Finns-Ln#expanded_map</a>
Behind Scheve/Hubbard’s address and at 7309 Riverdale Rd Lanham MD 20706, is a complex listed on Google as a Baptist Church which has a large carpark area and plenty of bush secluding it – interesting in that it’s very similar in environ to the academy location/setup in Hyattsville. <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7309-Riverdale-Rd#expanded_map">http://www.spokeo.com/MD/Lanham/7309-Riverdale-Rd#expanded_map</a></p>',

             to me, this strikes me as a typo. Wonder if someone was transcribing a handwritten document and mistook an "le" for a "k". That's my theory anyhow.

            I kept asking for something really linking JA to moonies and here it seems to be. If someone would be kind enough to detail the positions of each person with regard to succession and real estate procedures it would help.

            Just realized Alefantis (or any permanent resident of DC) would have been required (by law) to act as 'resident agent' for Scheve's estate, in case there were any claims against the estate. A DC resident agent was required because Scheve's heirs resided in Maryland. But of course Alefantis wouldn't have been just any 'agent' if he later ended up owning that Pegasus building!

            Great digging! The proof is there. Keep fucking their worlds up.
They took that video off because the heat is too hot on their asses. You all are doing amazing work.
 Believe in God or not, you do good to the world and it comes back ten-fold. Bless you all.
For the kids who were abused, for the kids to still be abused, for the ones being abused now-- please do not stop.

              I'm not suggesting that because someone calls themselves a Baptist that they are okay.  Only that this particular Baptist Church has all the hallmarks of a legitimate Christian Church.  Check out their web page but please avoid disturbing them.  Seriously their crime is having a parking lot???, and being located rurally????  We can do better than this!

            This information is helpful because it deepens the connection between Alefantis and Scheve/Hubbard, and maybe also the Unification Church (Moonies). With Alefantis being an agent to a PROBATE estate, though, I wonder if he was appointed by the court?  If that was the case, it would be odd that he would then became the new owner of Scheve's property in DC (which later became the Pegasus museum building). Big puzzle. Figuring out these relationships is important!
