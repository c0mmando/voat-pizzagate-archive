             On a whim, Eve, a Swedish traveler, accepts an invitation from Peter to vacation on his family's private island off the coast of New England. As a series of unexpected delays prevent other guests from arriving, Eve discovers that she has little in common with the increasingly erratic Peter. Gradually the idyllic natural beauty of the island gives way and Eve finds herself trapped in a state of surreality punctuated by bizarre visions, dimensional shifting and secret soda.

            my biggest fear is that all of the evidence collected gets memory holed, and people like alefantis are not held accountable for their crimes. the rule of law is broken.
