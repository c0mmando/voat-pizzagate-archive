<p>So they had food coolers for their ingredients. How many coolers would they need to make 21 pizzas? From Dailymail </p>

<p>It will feature his signature dishes - ten deep dish and ten thin crust creations. He is also planning a pizza especially for the president.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So 21 pizzas confirmed. 3 coolers? 5? 7? Lets say 7 coolers. One cooler for enough ingredients to make 3 pizzas. Seems excessive but lets allow it. American Airlines states its fees for oversized baggage is $100 for up to 32kgs and $200 for upto 42kgs. I\'ll play it safe and say the 7 food coolers were under 32kg each. So thats $700.</p>
<p>$1200 + $700 = $1900 which we\'ll round up to $2000.</p>
<p>Ingredients for 21 pizzas. How much? On Pi\'s website menu their most expensive deep dish pizza costs $23.45 x 10 = $234.50, make it an even $250. Their most expensive thin crusts are $22.95 x 10 = $229.50 again make it an even $250.</p>
<p>So I\'m allowing a very generous $500 total for the ingredients budget for the 20 pizzas. Then there\'s Obama\'s special pizza. What the hell lets say they spent $100 on ingredients. Ridiculous.</p>

<p>$2600 + $3880 = $6480 which is basically $6,500.</p>
<p>So if you believe these two chefs used a ridiculous amount of heavy luggage to transport an obscenely expensive amount of ingredients for 21 pizzas, while travelling first class and staying in the finest hotel AND that Fred Burton in his email got their location wrong, got wrong what food they were making, misplaced the comma between 6 and 5 to 5 and 0, then added an extra 0 to make $65,000, and finally alluded to knowing about &quot;the same channels&quot; as used by Obama...well then yes, Hot Dog Friday has been debunked.</p>',

            Why couldn't they just buy the ingredients locally when they got there or have someone buy them ahead of time so they were ready when they got there? I still think their hotdog party was code for prostituting children to the attendees though.

           <p>
            So you're thinking that pizza party actually means child sex party?
           </p>
           <p>
            If you were going to throw a child sex party, why would you need pizza chefs? That we're flown in from out of state? Would you delegate the party planning to other White House planners, put it on the official agenda?
           </p>
           <p>
            Why would you want the event publicly announced and discussed in interviews to the media? If a congressman goes to a hooker, do they call the media, release a statement that they're going out to get a pizza with extra sausage? Or would you instead just view keep your mouth shut about it and do it?
           </p>
           <p>
            Did the pizza chefs know and do anything about the supposed child sex, or were they just pizza chefs? If they are just innocent pizza chefs, than the number of coolers and any inconsistencies there is totally irrelevant.
           </p>
           <p>
            It makes little sense that these two would be helping with child sex. If they were involved in heinous crimes, they would refuse media interviews. And why fly child sex "chefs" in? Do you think they brought child s c paraphernalia on the plane? What are they going to do to help get sex slaves for the party? Would you fly the Hollywood Madame into D.C. to provide hookers? Her connections and hookers are back in LA. It makes zero sense. Will the chefs go down to the child sex slave store and use their expertise to squeeze and pick out the freshest ones?
           </p>
           <p>
            You haven't debunked anything here. What you have here are questions you don't know the answer to. Questions based on ridiculous assumptions. They said they had a cooler with them. Does that mean they brought enough cheese, sauce and white flour to make all the pizzas? Or would they more likely bring just a few items they thought were irreplaceable?
           </p>
           <p>
            Just  because you can't figure out every detail of how this was done, doesn't mean you've found inconsistencies or lies.

            Channels is a known "criminal underworld" vernacular for smuggling/trafficking routes.

            2 coolers one for the deep dish dough, one for the ingredients. You don't need a cooler for thin crust dough.. but if so it would probably fit in the same 2 coolers.

            There's also this story about a year after of Obama flying in Byron's Hot Dogs owner Mike Payne from Chicago to ASSIST WH cooks in making Chicago-style hotdogs. He didn't even bring his own ingredients, he just gave them a shopping list.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/President-Needs-a-Hot-Dog-Helping-Hand-96078774.html">
             https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/President-Needs-a-Hot-Dog-Helping-Hand-96078774.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            Isn't it peculiar that Fred Burton would mention flying in hot dogs from Chicago over a year before this story came out? He couldn't be referring to another hot dog event because the story points out the reason for Mike Payne being invited to cook is because none of the chefs in the WH knew how to make hotdogs. And in the email Aaric Eisenstein knows what private party Burton is talking about because he is the one who brings up "waitresses".
           </p>
           <p>
            Begs the question, were these two publicized events cover? Remember Obama was the most secretive President in history. If he was having a "private party" it would not be splashed all over the news.

            There's a world of difference between St Louis pizza and Chicago pizza. If someone from Chicago wanted Chicago style pizza, it's highly unlikely they would buy it from a St Louis pizza place.

             That's also irrelevant speculation as he had this pizza before and wanted this pizza.   The Chicago thing was other people complaining about his choice.   They even called it pizza-gate back then.

            It's probably my debunk.  You are missing something essential.   Fred Burton's version is completely third hand right wing gossip.  The chef donated his time and his food, the White House paid zero dollars.
           </p>
           <p>
            Your debunk is chasing a ghost that isn't there.

            Right wing blogs started arguing that taxpayer money was spent to fly the pizzas in, that Obama was wasting taxpayer money...
            <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/planet-gore/whats-carbon-footprint-pizza-greg-pollowitz/">
             .in fact, some of the criticism started as an environmental criticism,
            </a>
            that Obama had a government plan fly this guy in because he wanted pizza and that would be environmentally wasteful.  This whole controversy just starts as an attempt to criticize Obama for something.  The amount of taxpayer money kept changing in terms of who was telling the story.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fred Burton picked this completely incorrect story from right wing radios or blogs and put a number on it.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             Lets imagine they were treated to First class and their flights cost $1200 combined. Google flights has a return trip at just over $500.
            </p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>
            They were not treated at all.   It was timed for when the pizza guy was going to be DC on business.   He paid his own way and he donated his time and his ingredients.

             You you're implying that Obama has outside food into the white House and eats it? Seems pretty risky for a president to ignore security policy and eat pizza sauce that wasn't sourced and prepared by his own chefs.... Or at minimal sourced by them and prepared onsite. What did he do? Have someone else eat the pizza and see if they got sick? Are we sure Obama lacked that much common sense?

              I'm not implying anything.  I'm staying as fact a well known pizza guy came to the White house with his dough and sauce and he and his manager made pizza in the two white house kitchens.  One made thin crust and one made deep dish.   And that this was well covered in the media including Good Morning America and Fox and Friends.

             In a 20 week period Twitter only shows these six people, in 6 tweets, referring to Obama flying in pizza from Chicago. Everyone knew what the story was. Everyone knew Chicago's relevance in the story was being annoyed after Obama chose St Louis except for those ignorants.
            </p>
            <p>
             You're suggesting Fred Burton and Aaric Eisenstein were another two people who hadn't read the news properly and assumed the pizza came from Chicago? Yet somehow they knew enough about it to know about the "waitresses" and "channels" involved. And where did they get hot dogs from?

             In your post in the other thread you link to search results for Obama pizza along with the TCOT hastag. In those results only one person refers to Obama flying in pizza from Chicago. Once again everyone was aware the pizza came from St Louis.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also looked at some of the links to articles which mentioned Obama flying pizza to the White House.

             <li>
              <p>
               RightPundits.com - their article points out the pizza was from St Louis. Not Chicago. In the comments someone explains this wasn't some huge extravagance because the cooks restaurant paid for it. No cost figure given.

               Bipartreport.com - a left of center blog. I cannot find the article but would assume they would have it down as St Louis since they're pro Obama and would follow RightPundits commenter and clarify this wasn't a huge taxpayer bill.

             Thats just a few but nobody is mentioning any figures. Not even taking a guess at the cost. So where are these forever changing money amounts you refer to that led Fred Burton to pluck $65k out of the air? Who does that anyway? That makes no sense. He would've said like everyone else who may have been ignorant of the facts "Obama spent a lot of taxpayer money on pizza".
            </p>
            <p>
             Hardly anyone was saying these pizzas were from Chicago or how much the whole thing cost, not even on Twitter. So it makes the claim that Fred Burton was referring to this event catered by a St Louis cook while throwing in the unmentioned hotdogs and the ridiculous sum of $65k very difficult to believe.

              the trick with this is, though - even if we say 100% that $65k is a suspicious amount
             </p>
             <p>
              ok, im on board with that
             </p>
             <p>
              that doesnt give a smoking gun for paedophilia. It could provide a semi smoking gun for financial corruption, it may be the emailer talking out his arse to sound impressive, it may be a budget that included a massive cocktail party with a $8k payment to an 'event manager' + insurance and some top-of their industry burlesque / circus performers soaking up another $20k (how long does it take you to rip through a $1000 bar-tab at cheap-arse pub prices?). We dont know. BUT
             </p>
             <p>
              the very fact that a bona fide pizza guy came in to the WH around that time gives a massively innocuous explanation for the $65k email.
             </p>
             <p>
              I dont say it rules it out of all contention, i dont CONCLUDE that Obama isnt part of pizzagate, but if he is - this $65k email is no smoking gun without substantial independent evidence to show that the actual St Louis pizza guy was a smokescreen of sorts

Subject: RE: Get ready for "Chicago Hot Dog Friday"
I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in
pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long
ago, assume we are using the same channels?
            </p>
            <p>
             "waitresses" aka little girls to fuck and btw the "hot dogs and pizza" came from Chicago, Illinois not St Louis aka a child sex ring run out of there.... Check your Geography and timeline dumbass. Different cities, way out of line price, and oh yea different time period. "Same Channels" means not a food joint it means a trafficking joint for raping children.

              The Chicago Outfit aka the Chicago Mafia. The very mafia Pizzaface's (my South Park inspired insult against HRC mocking her appearance) father was a high level of. No wonder she wanted to help the Gambino family "deal with" RICO. For the record I like to call Pizzaface's equally ugly daughter "Donkey Witch".

            I didn't think that food was allowed to be brought into the white house from an outside source. ( I can't think of the right way to explain it.) Risk of POTUS being deliberately poisoned.

              I think this a general rule, but don't think if Trump.wanted McDonald's or KFC he wouldn't get it.

              If you think every meal a President makes is made by the White House chef you're wrong.  Presidents go to restaurants.  And Trump often eats at his clubs

              You can't bring in outside food
             </p>
             <p>
              With a strictness rivaled only by movie theaters, you're not allowed to take outside food into the White House. When visiting chefs cook there, they can't bring pre-prepared sauces, as all ingredients must be obtained by the kitchen staff through secret and secure sources.

              But in his exclusive-to-subscribers report of November 14, 2011, investigate reporter Wayne Madsen wrote:
             </p>
             <p>
              “The fallout from Penn State has universities and colleges across the nation checking their records for indications of child abuse and other sex scandals. The Citadel is now embroiled in a scandal involving child sexual abuse by a summer camp counselor. Past gay-oriented sex parties at Duke and the University of North Carolina involving then Duke basketball and football player Reggie Love reportedly cost him his job as President Obama’s ‘body man.’ De facto White House chief of staff Pete Rouse, upon hearing of potential problems regarding Love at Duke and UNC and on the heels of the scandal at Penn State, forced Love to leave the White House staff immediately, even over the objections of Obama.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Yesterday evening when I began a draft of this post, I had seen on Wikipedia’s entry on Reggie Love a reference to him “overcoming” an un-named “scandal” when he was at Duke University to secure a job in Obama’s Senate office. This morning, however, that reference has disappeared from Wikipedia.

              Booker Rising, a website that describes itself as a “news site for black moderates and black conservatives,” has the dirt on Reggie Love.

              I will let everyone that wants to read the rest.  It has to do with Tea-Bags.  It's not pretty.  There are pictures and a Warning before the Fateful Photo.

                Here is the email talking about the party and it says That was not long ago.  Email sent on May 14 2009.   Reggie Love was in the WH  from   January 20, 2009 – November 10, 2011  So I think that means he was there, but we need the date of that party if we can get it.

               So unless there's some totally next level pre-emptive coverup rabbit-hole-beneath-the-rabbit-hole going on here, which would totally fail the Occam's Razor test, it seems to me this likely puts Obama in the clear on this charge. And I also think that without this being pizzagate related, the 'hotdog stand in Hawaii' seems pretty innocuous, too

              Yeah, this actually refers to regular old pizza.   And the guy talking about $65,000 doesn't know what he is talking about and is repeating gossip from right wing blogs.

               The $65,000 hot dog party guy? Not a White House insider. A guy who worked in Texas with no first hand knowledge of the White House and certainly not an Obama insider, he hated Obama. AND he just repeating a fake story that was going around on the right wing blogs and talk shows. After Obama had the pizza chef of a St Louis Pizzeria come to the White House to make pizza, right wing blogs started saying he wasted a bunch of taxpayer money just to eat pizza. (Actually the pizza chef bought the ingredients himself.)

               as to your other claims downthread.  You are starting by assuming a lot of facts in evidence, such that the stratfort people have any inside knowledge of the white house, that the pizzagate intepretation of code words is correct.  You're basically saying this is not debunked because I believe the story we tell about it.
              </p>
              <p>
               It becomes a lot simpler story if you start from the beginning and start with what we know and assume and Occam's razor approach to this.
              </p>
              <h5>
               Claim 1:
              </h5>
              <p>
               There's no reason to believe that Fred Burton has any inside knowledge of the Obama White House.
              </p>

               Evidence:
              </h5>
              <p>
               The email makes clear that Burton doesn't know this information first hand.  "I think Obama spent....."   He is recalled information he heard about.
              </p>

               Statfor is a private company in Austin, TX.  They have a lot of government contracts but are not part of the US government

               Fred Burton was solidly right wing and hated Obama.  And would read and push right wing news sources.

               Anybody every here of a site called socyberty.com?  Seems like it steemit type site where people who don't have blog can put up a post.  Burton pushes a story from there, a story from a conspiracy theorist called Ulsterman.  A conspiracy theoorist who is getting the straight dope quoting* an anonymous White House insider.*  Does this sound familiar?
              </p>
              <p>
               Yeah, Burton would promote anonymous right wing conspiracies if they made Obama look bad.  Did you hear OBAMA DIDN'T WANT TO KILL BIN LADEN BUT WAS OVERRULED BY MILITARY INTELLIGENCE!

                our longtime Washington D.C.Insider first outlined shocking details of an Obama administration having been "overruled" by senior military and intelligence officials leading up to the successful attack against terrorist Osama Bin Laden

               The more you look into him, the more the idea of Fred Burton having the inside story on the Obama White House become ludicrous.  The idea that Fred Burton would never screw up his facts in casual conversation is silly.
              </p>
              <p>
               I showed in the links above that this story was making the rounds of the right wing web.
              </p>
              <p>
               The timing fits with Burton's email.   The idea that Burton would know secrets about the Obama's White House does not.
