<p>I\'ve been suspicious of Ark of Hope for a long time.  Notice the heart-shaped logo.   I\'m not accusing anyone of anything, but some things here don\'t seem right.   Ark of Hope\'s founder is Blair Corbett. He also founded the Good Men Project: <a href="https://goodmenproject.com/author/blair-corbett/">https://goodmenproject.com/author/blair-corbett/</a>  You will see that he has posted an article on a Dutch court legalising a \'child love\' group.   What does the legalisation of a pedophile group have to do with Good Men Project?    Blair uses his passion \'to draw more men into the front lines of the international battle for the hearts of imprisoned and oppressed children\'.  Nothing is said about saving children and preventing child abuse, only the \'battle for the hearts of oppressed children\'. Weird.</p>

My suspicion is that he publishes articles on pedophile activity as a way of alerting pedophiles on what to watch out for or how to avoid being found out by authorities.      He talks about \'Our Circle\' and his website features an owl.   <a href="https://notinmyworld.org/about_our_world/our-circle/">https://notinmyworld.org/about_our_world/our-circle/</a>  Please read the comments: <a href="https://notinmyworld.org/">https://notinmyworld.org/</a>   \'how did you like how I told the story, how we had to sacrifice somebody????\'</p>

<p>Anybody who knows anything about children from broken and dysfunctional homes know they don\'t \'share their pain, their fears and doubts\'.

            Some things here look quite shady. Why do they all use owls?
Why would Robert Strongbow call himself Blackhorn33, as another user here already pointed out? That's not what you expect from someone who claims he cares for children.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "MakeItUltra" psychologist has this picture with a monarch butterfly on his webpage:

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            When you know anything about MKUltra and Monarch Mind Control symbols that's pretty straight in your face. There could be more to find in this circle of people.

            Wow, that's quite the rabbit hole you discovered!  Robert Strongbow calls himself "Blackhorn33."  Kait King claims to be a former criminologist who is "writing about what she knows."  I am sure that pathology and criminology attracts those types.
