            Has anyone looked for connections between him and Ed Buck? I have a gay conservative friend from LA and he’s been telling me for a while how the gay mafia runs Hollywood. And how he believes Ed buck is one of the leaders.

            This makes me wonder whether the video Spacey made was a warning to anyone who dared to accuse him of anything.
           </p>
           <p>
            This guy who was assaulted by Spacey was said to be a nice man trying to live a quiet life.

            Further to the item I posted below, If anyone's interested, the original story linking Ingvaldson &amp; Justin Trudea is from 2012. Ingvaldson also had connections to extraordinarily scummy paedophiles in (surprise) England.
           </p>
           <p>
            Back in 2012 there was also the sensational case of the Canadian Psycho, cannibal and LA Porn Star Luka Magnotta, who dismembered a Chinese student, Jun Lin, in Montreal. He posted a video of the dismemberment, but not the murder, and then fled to France and eventually Berlin, where he was captured. What's interesting, with what we know now, is this statement from a friend of Luka's in Moscow:
           </p>
           <p>
            "Viktorin Khlynin 8 Jun 2012
           </p>
           <p>
            "Im from Russia. About Luka We all must help and support him! Yes Luka became insane through a time. Very very very insane and more more and more insane in time. He made awful things with Lin. So sorry for Lin((( Lin was good Luka was in child pedophiles pornography ring (his parent or parents also have some connection with one) with 5 or less years old. It why he hate own parents and they dont want to see him at all even now!!! Now he (with Homolka) posted bags with bodys parts to political elites and in some schools. Why? Because this schools have connection to child pedophiles pornography ring and son of ex-Prime minister of Canade have link to it too!!!! Homolka with Luka made it in world NEWS and PRESS. Sorry but may be only this manner they may took attention to this things and show US that elite are satanic!!!" The link is still good, but the domain is banned by voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            Other interesting bits: Luka worked as a model-for-hire (rent-boy) in London and Moscow and was friends (there's a pic of them, not photo shopped, not sexual, looks like a family photo, with a (at the time) multi-billionaire oligarch friend of Putin. Putin and the moneyed friend had a falling-out and the poor friend was reduced to a uni-billionaire.
           </p>
           <p>
            Abel Danger (a crazy and hard-to-read conspiracy web page) claimed that Magnotta's Chinese victim (who according to citizens of China had no good reason to be in Montreal — only the wealthy or party members were permitted to go overseas for education, and Lin was neither, plus he already had an undergraduate degree in China. Why start over as an undergrad? — was at the time a student at Concordia University, allegedly a center for man-in-the-middle kiddie porn used to entrap people by the Deep State.

            Not to get too far off topic, but this does relate to elites and paedophilia (quotes from various sources):
           </p>
           <p>
            "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized Wednesday night soon after a 2001 photo emerged in a Time magazine report showing him wearing brownface makeup to an “Arabian Nights” party at the private school where he was teaching. "I should have known better," Trudeau told reporters."
           </p>
           <p>
            "The photo showed Trudeau, then the 29-year-old son of the late former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, donning a white turban and robes... Trudeau’s face, neck and hands have been darkened significantly. The photograph is from the 2000-01 yearbook of the private day school where Trudeau was teaching,
            <strong>
             West Point Grey Academy.
            </strong>
            "
           </p>
           <p>
            "The human hand found Tuesday by staff at False Creek Elementary and the foot at St. George’s School belong to [Luka] Magnotta’s alleged victim.  St. George’s School, on Vancouver’s west side, is billed as one of Canada’s premiere boarding schools for boys, with students from 18 countries enrolled. In March, Christopher Charles Ingvaldson – a 42-year-old former teacher at St. George’s School – pleaded guilty to child-pornography-related charges in connection to an international Facebook child-porn ring."
           </p>
           <p>
            "It was widely reported in 2010 that Ingvaldson was a close friend of Justin Trudeau, the Quebec MP and son of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau. Justin Trudeau had taught with Ingvaldson at West Point Grey Academy more than 10 years ago."
           </p>
           <p>
            There also a quote from a Russian friend of Magnotta's in Moscow where he says that Magnotta, admittedly insane, committed the murder to draw attention to the problem of high level paedophiles in Canada and the US. Magnotta did travel with a rolled up movie poster for
            <em>
             Casa Blanca
            </em>
            (the White House) which featured prominently in several on-line pics that he allegedly used to promote his upcoming dismemberment / minor-cannibalism video.

             CDAN Blind: Epstein, Prince Charlie, Camilla's brother, Mark Shand murdered?

            This is an conspiracy blind involving Epstein, the Royal Family — this time Prince Charlie, Camilla and her late, possibly murdered brother. Murdered in New York City by

            Tom Hardy and Mr. Bean are guesses on CDAN, and we might as well throw in Spacey. Interesting that the original poster of this thread is
            <strong>
             elephantdoesntforget
            </strong>
            and Mark Shand was head of an elephant charity and died at an after-party for the charity's fundraiser. More clues at:

             I chose my screen name because it has to do with a victim not forgetting what his perpetrators did to them, much like the saying that an elephant doesn't forget. Nothing to do with an elephant charity.

             Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is definitely one of them.

               Yeah, they have all kinds of ways of getting rid of people while making it look like it's natural causes.
              </p>
              <p>
               What I've seen personally is using a taser to cause heart failure making it look like a heart attack, and injecting a person with a hypodermic needle full of air to cause a pulmonary embolism. Both things are easy for them to do, and the authorities never look into it any further.

             Spacey was good in Unusual Suspects.  Just like some older Woody Allen films are good.  It creates cognitive Dissonance and anxiety to contemplate.  For some unusual reason they have done this on purpose I am guessing.  When good people do something wrong.  On second thought it makes me search for God to deal with it all. So maybe a benefit for all the exposure. To clearly make one choose between good and evil and reconsider all of our actions.
