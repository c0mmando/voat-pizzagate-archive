            subscribers voted a while back not to accept Share A Link submissions. You'll need to repost this as a Discuss submission, with a summary of content as well as a link in the body of the submission. Please be sure to explain how this likely connects to the abuse of kids by the global elite. If there is no evidence of that, it needs to be posted in

             That seems weird. People voted for that? Why not just discuss it to debunk it?

            <p>
             Colorado Springs has had weird happenings lately. The Diocese refused to release priest abuser names so a law firm for victims did it. The same day this happened. Then, the weird illness broke out.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't know if any of it is connected but don't you think people should be allowed to discuss it and downvote it accordingly? I thought this place wasn't supposed to be like reddit.

              Yes. Child porn was direct linked. We have a lot of survivors in this subverse and they did not appreciate that. Also, we delete many fewer submissions by allowing Discuss submissions only, because posters can edit them when they don't quite meet the other submission rules.

              How does submitting a Discuss submission with a brief description of how it relates to child abuse by the global elite prevent people from discussing and downvoting?

              The Los Angeles Times reported a similar home day care story with a Carla Faith back in 1998
             </strong>
             , saying she secretly housed children in unlicensed facilities. KOAA is working to confirm with CSPD whether or not that is the same Faith in Colorado Springs.

             Three adult workers were arrested for misdemeanor child abuse charges that were later canceled after further investigation, according to police.

            <p>
             CSPD did not arrest Faith as investigators decide what charges to file against her.

              According to Colorado courts, she has a clean record.

            Clearly a well-connected trafficker we're dealing with here. Reddit is trying to drown this story out as
            <em>
             less sinister
            </em>
            than the headline may seem (nevermind the begging question, "why does a daycare have a trap door?"
