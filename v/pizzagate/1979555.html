&quot;Hmm?&quot; Hillary opened her eyes and sleepily roused herself &quot;Show me.&quot; 
Hall\'s wife ordered me to take my clothes off while Hillary watched. &quot;Is

&quot;Of course, she\'s Byrd\'s,&quot; she responded, continuing the conversation as 
though I were not there, &quot;Plus, I heard Houston say something about her being 
a Presidential Model, whatever the hell that\'s supposed to mean.&quot;
&quot;It means she\'s clean,&quot; Hillary said matter-of-factly as she stood up. 
I was not capable of giving thought to such things back then, but I am aware in retrospect that all Presidential Model slaves I knew seemed to have an immunity to social diseases. It was a well known fact in the circles I was 
sexually passed around in that government level mind-controlled sex slaves were 
&quot;clean&quot; to the degree that none of my abusers took precautions such as wearing condoms.
Hall\'s wife patted the bed and instructed me to display the mutilation. 
Hillary exclaimed, &quot;God!&quot; and immediately began performing oral sex on me. 
Apparently aroused by the carving in my vagina, Hillary stood up and quickly 
peeled out of her matronly nylon panties and pantyhose. Uninhibited despite a 
long day in the hot sun, she gasped, &quot;Eat me, oh, god, eat me now&quot;. I had no 
choice but to comply with her orders, and Bill Hall\'s wife made no move to join 
me in my distasteful task. Hillary had resumed examining my hideous mutilation and performing oral sex on me when Bill Clinton walked in. Hillary 
lifted her head to ask, &quot;How\'d it go?&quot;
 Clinton appeared totally unaffected by what he walked into, tossed his jacket 
on a chair and said, &quot;It\'s official. I\'m exhausted. I\'m going to bed.&quot;</p>

            Been reading it -- and it seems to me that like Abu Ghraib and Torture which they seemed to have
been practicing there for future use .....
           </p>
           <p>
            Taylor seems to be making clear that MKULTRA was practice for future enslavement of us all,
physically and mentally -- and REMOTELY -- !!
           </p>
           <p>
            Amazing, however, how the brain continues to sort it all out ...
In other reports they suggest at about age 30 (at least in women I read about)
the brain begins to pull all of these parts together and the victim begins to see 
what is going on.  At that point they are very much in danger of being killed off.
           </p>
           <p>
            Humankind has never found a way to deal with the violence of the few among us ...
whether this desire to control others actually not only physically but to enslave
them mentally is wholly part of human flaw or whether it has another source -- perhaps alien? -- 
I think is something we have to consider.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also, the fact that many ordinary citizens seem to have been tortured and
set loose as time bombs within our society.... may also make some of these 
"events" a bit clearer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mae Brussel was a brilliant researcher and she seems to have touched on this idea,
and she was certainly into examining the various Nazi projects and the idea (as Jack Ruby
told us) of Nazis/fascists behind JFK assassination --- and obviously much more.
           </p>
           <p>
            Recently, an investigative reporter relayed a story of (I think it was) a journalist who
had a kind of farewell conversation with E. Howard Hunt about the WHY of the JFK coup ...
and Hunt replied that it was because JFK was about to reveal to the Russians ... "the alien
presence."   One of the quite believable reasons often mentioned at the time.
Though, I would trust that JFK would have been informing the public -- and the Russians would
have also gotten the message.  :)

            No -- but I think I know what you're talking about -- ???
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it also suggests that Hope was a handler for MKULTRA -- 
and a pedophile?
           </p>
           <p>
            Try to figure out however what Allen Dulles -- who ran a "CIA Farm" where pedophiles were
taught how to seduce children -- would have said to encourage someone to do such things?
           </p>
           <p>
            Based in patriotism?  What could the story have been?
           </p>
           <p>
            Or were all of these guys pedophile volunteers?
           </p>
           <p>
            Was there some insight into that question in the book?

            What I find interesting about the Cathy O'Brien testimony is that it overlaps/parallels things in DeCamp's book, The Franklin Cover-Up. Whereas that text focuses on the torture aspect, O'Brien elaborates on the why's of the torture (MKUltra).

            Last year, pre-election, I made a
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anx-FXle-2g">
             vid
            </a>
            covering O'Brien's allegations when PussyGate broke-- why were they focusing on a hot mic when there's video testimony of O'Brien talking about HRC raping her? Where's the so-called equality when it comes to coverage of sex crimes? Isn't it sexist to focus on men groping vag, while ignoring a woman's rape of another being?

             Regarding "Tin Foil Hat Brigade": whenever something uncomfortable gets mentioned, it isn't long before someone chimes in with a dig at tin foil hats and conspiracy theories. So, in honor of those enterprising souls that know/have seen things that others cannot wrap their minds around, I'm covering some little known scandals... one of which was revealed in 1995, well before HRC ever ran for office.

             , someone asked if anyone read "The Franklin Cover-Up: Child Abuse, Satanism, and Murder In Nebraska" ... and so I looked it up and started reading it. After all, I'm a child of the 80's and remember the Satanism hysteria that was
             <em>
              everywhere
             </em>
             and ultimately discounted as the wild imaginings of kids... Kids that recalled in detail ritual abuse, torture, perversion, money, drugs, and the names of the elite.
            </p>
            <p>
             Long story short: Iran-Contra funding via coke sales, money laundered by a bank ran by a pedo who recruited kids from Boys Town (among other places) to be prostitutes and drug couriers.
            </p>
            <p>
             And before you roll your eyes, please consider that A) human experimentation has happened in the US; and B) Bill Clinton issued an apology in 1995 (

              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRTOB
             </a>
             ... ) to the victims of those experiments. He references one type of experimentation, but that is a far cry from all the manipulations used on an unknowing/unwilling people, including CHILDREN. Oh, and C) America's Most Wanted covered it, but dropped the topic after the FBI failed to co-operate (aka stonewalled them), being the first time that agency declined helping investigate a story from that program.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, tied to this is Cathy O'Brian (
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugx64">
              https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugx64
             </a>
             ... ) who alleges she was part of the CIA program, MK-Ultra, and was used as a messenger and prostitute after being tortured and abused from an early age. In her book, "Trance Formation America," published in 1995-- way before HRC ran for president, O'Brian states that Hillary saw her particular genital mutilation and began raping the teenager.
            </p>
            <p>
             If our government was kidnapping children and doing atrocious things to them in order to fulfill an agenda, then our country has bigger problems than this election. Just sayin'.

            Call me a tin foil nutter, but when one discusses what they read and posts it, then gets a bunch of hits from the DC area, and then their youtube channel is throttled, methinks one is onto something (or wholeheartedly embracing confirmation bias, but whatevs)...

             <p>
              The CIA's Intervention in Afghanistan
Interview with Zbigniew Brzezinski,
President Jimmy Carter's National Security Adviser
             </p>
             <p>
              Le Nouvel Observateur, Paris, 15-21 January 1998
             </p>
             <p>
              Question: The former director of the CIA, Robert Gates, stated in his memoirs &lt;"From the Shadows"&gt;, that American intelligence services began to aid the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan 6 months before the Soviet intervention. In this period you were the national security adviser to President Carter. You therefore played a role in this affair. Is that correct?
             </p>
             <p>
              Brzezinski: Yes. According to the official version of history, CIA aid to the Mujahadeen began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan, 24 Dec 1979. But the reality, secretly guarded until now, is completely otherwise Indeed, it was July 3, 1979 that President Carter signed the first directive for secret aid to the opponents of the pro-Soviet regime in Kabul. And that very day, I wrote a note to the president in which I explained to him that in my opinion this aid was going to induce a Soviet military intervention.
             </p>
             <p>
              Q: Despite this risk, you were an advocate of this covert action. But perhaps you yourself desired this Soviet entry into war and looked to provoke it?
             </p>
             <p>
              B: It isn't quite that. We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would.
             </p>
             <p>
              Q: When the Soviets justified their intervention by asserting that they intended to fight against a secret involvement of the United States in Afghanistan, people didn't believe them. However, there was a basis of truth. You don't regret anything today?
             </p>
             <p>
              Q: Regret what? That secret operation was an excellent idea. It had the effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap and you want me to regret it? The day that the Soviets officially crossed the border, I wrote to President Carter. We now have the opportunity of giving to the USSR its Vietnam war. Indeed, for almost 10 years, Moscow had to carry on a war unsupportable by the government, a conflict that brought about the demoralization and finally the breakup of the Soviet empire.
             </p>
             <p>
              Q: And neither do you regret having supported the Islamic fundamentalism, having given arms and advice to future terrorists?
             </p>
             <p>
              Q: What is most important to the history of the world? The Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire? Some stirred-up Moslems or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the cold war?

             <p>
              The US spent $100's of millions shooting down Soviet helicopters yet didn't spend a penny helping Afghanis rebuild their infrastructure and institutions.
             </p>
             <p>
              They also spent millions producing jihad preaching, fundamentalist textbooks and shipping them off to Afghanistan. These were the same text books the Western media discussed in shocked tones and told their audiences were used by fundamentalist teachers to brainwash their charges and to inculcate in young Afghanis a jihad mindset, hatred of foreigners and non-Muslims etc.
             </p>
             <p>
              Have you heard about the Afghan Jihad schoolbook scandal?
             </p>
             <p>
              Or perhaps I should say, "Have you heard about the Afghan Jihad schoolbook scandal that's waiting to happen?"
             </p>
             <p>
              Because it has been almost unreported in the Western media that the US government shipped, and continues to ship, millions of Islamist textbooks into Afghanistan.
             </p>
             <p>
              Only one English-speaking newspaper we could find has investigated this issue: the Washington Post. The story appeared March 23rd.
             </p>
             <p>
              Washington Post investigators report that during the past twenty years the US has spent millions of dollars producing fanatical schoolbooks, which were then distributed in Afghanistan.
             </p>
             <p>
              "The primers, which were filled with talk of jihad and featured drawings of guns, bullets, soldiers and mines, have served since then as the Afghan school system's core curriculum. Even the Taliban used the American-produced books..." -- Washington Post, 23 March 2002 (1)
             </p>
             <p>
              According to the Post the U.S. is now "...wrestling with the unintended consequences of its successful strategy of stirring Islamic fervor to fight communism."
             </p>
             <p>
              So the books made up the core curriculum in Afghan schools. And what were the unintended consequences? The Post reports that according to unnamed officials the schoolbooks "steeped a generation in violence."
             </p>
             <p>
              How could this result have been unintended? Did they expect that giving fundamentalist schoolbooks to schoolchildren would make them moderate Muslims?
             </p>
             <p>
              Nobody with normal intelligence could expect to distribute millions of violent Islamist schoolbooks without influencing school children towards violent Islamism. Therefore one would assume that the unnamed US officials who, we are told, are distressed at these "unintended consequences" must previously have been unaware of the Islamist content of the schoolbooks.
             </p>
             <p>
              But surely someone was aware. The US government can't write, edit, print and ship millions of violent, Muslim fundamentalist primers into Afghanistan without high officials in the US government approving those primers.

              Jimmy Carter seemed at times to be trying to get some info out -- though he pretty much never did .
Carter is part of the Establishment which means protecting it.
Carter actually took the US out of the Russian Olympics at that time because of the Russian "invasion" of 
Afghanistan, though there was much criticism of that move as many thought that we should allow our 
athletes to go at any rate and perhaps wear black armbands.
We haven't had a liberal president come to power since the coup on JFK and our "people's government" on 11/22/63.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             Also remember that Carter evidently slept through the setting up of the October Surprise/Reagan "Win" and, as well,
the failure of the Desert Rescue Mission where at least one or two helicopters went down.
Difficult to know at times whether Carter was dumb or playing dumb.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those missions were headed up by Oliver North in Command, and Secord second in command.
At some point it was discovered that the helicopters were missing the sand shield which would 
have kept sand out of the motors of the helicopters.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was also a confirming story by John Tunnheim who headed up the Panel on the 1993 JFK Classified Records Act where Tunnheim and the Panel revealed that they had unanimously found that "Oswald was employed by the CIA working on high level assignments and probably also for the FBI."  At the end of the History Chanel/Discovery Channel program (at the time they were calling themselves "The Network for the New Millennia") Tunnheim repeated that announcement TWICE while the TEXT appeared below on the screen as he spoke.
            </p>
            <p>
             After a few weeks the program disappeared and later I have read that Carter had alerted Bill Moyers and Lady Bird Johnson about the program and that authorities had visited the network and confiscated all copies of the program.
            </p>
            <p>
             Additionally, from day one of the assassination, our journalists were asking for the employment and work records of Oswald which were always denied them.  Of course, those records would have been included in the records which the Tunnheim Panel were able to review.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks for the leads to the Cathy O'Brien book -- I'm aware of her story but have never 
actually read the book -- nor the quoted part of it.

             By going to "Cathy O'Brien Gynecology Appointment", a YouTube video is viewable where one can see the carving. The 9:00 minute mark is where she is in the doctor's office, but the entire video is enlightening.
In addition, the D C Hammond Greenbaum speech describes in  detail how much of this came about.

              isn't there a youtube video in which she goes to an obgyn who examines the the face and it is shown in the video? I recall seeing the face somewhere bc the nose was sort of pointy.

            This is so disgusting. I have the book.  It's a riveting read.

            Thanks for posting, OP.  Upvoat for the "supposed" qualifier.

             It's so stomach churning that I was sceptical when I first read this passage 20 years ago. Now that we imagine Hillary to be complicit in far more nefarious crimes than this - on the balance of probability it's more likely that she's telling the truth than not. How could you make this stuff up? My first upvoat for you, sir.
