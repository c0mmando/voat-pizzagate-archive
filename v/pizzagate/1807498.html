Here is the transcript: <a href="http://whale.to/b/mcgowan34.html">http://whale.to/b/mcgowan34.html</a></p>
<p>Here is Dave\'s introduction: &quot;On August 29, 2001, this journalist received an e-mail correspondence from a certain Lt. Col. Michael Aquino, informing me that he was none too pleased with the Pedophocracy series of articles. Go figure. The following is the complete text of the message that I received, interspersed with my responses (in red) to the points that Aquino attempts to make. This posting will serve as an open response, so to speak, to Aquino\'s correspondence. None of Aquino\'s comments have been edited and are presented here exactly as received, including the typos and misspellings.&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently it was Part 3 that got to Aquino (the subject heading of the email, as his name is mentioned within that part), who gets blasted with truth by Dave.</p>',

             The FBI has, of course, turned a blind eye; for the last quarter-century, “federal prosecutions of major pimp operations have been virtually nonexistent.” As Dr. Lois Lee has noted: “It’s not a high priority with the FBI to go after kids that are being transported across state lines. It’s really a disgrace.”

            Dave's dialogue  is a  must  read, I have seen enough  evidence  to disregard  any  further comments  from  this Aquino  monster, if ever there  was a  devil in a  man's skin  it is  this SUB-HUMAN, there  is no  point  in having  a  dialogue with a  sinister psychopath-I  don't care what  medals  he is  wearing, the  sickest  part is is  that he  is just one  face  of  the  military  establishment that  has  been taken  over  by  this Evil Force running the  world  right  now, and people  just  can't  believe it-its  like Invasion  of  the  Body  Snatchers; if  you read  the  Presidio reports  it  becomes  very  obvious  that all  high  level police  agencies were IN ON  THE  COVERUP especially the  MILITARY

            I am nearly at a loss for words because I am so sorry for what happened to you. I am doing this because of a friend who is a survivor, and others as well (and for those who are truly awake).
           </p>

            Thank you for your kind words and for your courage.

            May I recommend a book? It has helped many, though it is just one person's story. It is written by a survivor and is so uplifting: "Waking Up In Heaven" by Crystal McVea

            Dave was truly a great.  (The REAL ones are taken out one way or another -- TAKE NOTE, Alex Jones Kool-Aid drinkers.)
           </p>
           <p>
            Excerpt from a tribute --
           </p>
           <p>
            "Earlier this year, alternative media fans were stunned to learn that Dave McGowan, a highly-respected researcher from southern California, had been stricken with a rare form of deadly and fast-spreading lung cancer. Right from the beginning the prognosis was grim, and Dave’s family has now confirmed the worst: his cancer has reached the terminal stage and he may only have a few days left to live.
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              In a field dominated by fakes, frauds, narcissists, sociopaths, shills, bigots and straight-out dumbbells, Dave McGowan has always stood out from the crowd
             </strong>
            </strong>
            . Dave’s research into alternative history, deep politics and conspiracy has been honest, thoughtful, thorough, imaginative, eclectic, tough-minded and shaped by a genuine concern for the health and welfare of his fellow human beings.
           </p>
           <p>
            Dave’s approach to alternative analysis is populist, left-leaning and forged in cynicism about the true intentions of economic, government and media elites. His work is known for its humor and the depth of its research, and unlike many conspiracy theorists Dave’s speculations are always backed by established facts and hard-headed analysis of all the existing evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Never afraid to go where others feared to tread, Dave’s work has touched on a variety of fascinating but forbidden subjects, including
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             <strong>
              September 11, 2001 (Dave rejects the official conspiracy theory) /  The Moon landings (he concludes they never happened) / 
The Boston Marathon bombings (another hoax, he asserts) / The Lincoln assassination (he believes it was the result of a wide-ranging conspiracy) /     Serial killers (he suspects many were involved in mind-control experiments) / Peak Oil (an oil-company inspired fraud, Dave says) /  The Kennedy Assassination (a coup d'état carried out by government insiders, according to Dave along with just about everyone else) /
             </strong>
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            Recently, Dave’s focus has been on the surprising connection between the military-industrial- intelligence complex and the California rock and roll scene of the late 60s and early 70s. He discussed his theories on this subject in his book Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon: Laurel Canyon, Covert Ops &amp; the Dark Heart of the Hippie Dream, which was published in April 2014."

             I had a question once and wrote Dave/not really thinking he would reply/being so busy and all.  He sent a very kind reply even tho he was not familiar with the subject matter.

             You are correct. they were doing this back in the 60s.  On example is Jack Ruby ( real name: Jacob Rubinstein--the guy who shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald. They didn't want him to talk in prison, so he "suddenly" developed a fast acting "cancer".

              Yes, I remember Ruby with the fast acting cancer/just like Dave.  I actually saw Ruby shoot Oswald on TV...I was in my teens and didn't know about spiracy things but even at that young age said well, there ya go, that was certainly planned.  Back in those days alternative news grapevines traveled via things like beauty shops (which were the norm for women) and stories circulated about the strange things associated with the assassination (I lived in Houston), witnesses dying or disappearing.  No one with half a brain bought the official story and Johnson's corruption and murderous ways were legendary even before Jack was off'ed.

               I saw "Ruby" shoot Oswald on TV too. (Everyone was gathered around the TV after JFK was shot.)

              <p>
               I recall thinking when I saw it, even as kid, it was so weird how the law enforcement personnel actually stepped away to give Ruby a clear shot!

              <p>
               And how did Ruby get into the jail corridor anyway?

               No doubt it is difficult for people who were not alive at that time to grasp how huge and devastating it all was. And yes, you are correct, no one with half a brain believed the "official story", which had about as much credibility as the 9/11 commission report, which omits anything about WTC 3, 4, 5, 6, and (famously) 7 all destroyed, it seems, by themselves.

                I just read this about Dave, his home being repo'ed...

                 David passed away at the age of 55 years. on November 22, 2015 at 12:42 PM PDT. He had recently moved to Eagle Rock, CA but the never considered that to be home. It was only a transitions residence after losing his home in Sunland, CA to bank repossession.

                I remember when he passed his daughter took his site down to try and sell his books at his request bc he wanted to leave something for his family.  Few months ago I see she has put up a new site with all his articles.
The Lincoln series was so revealing/like I knew there was fishy stuff but never knew all I did after reading.
The wag the moon doggie series also excellent.  I recall when the so called live from the moon thing was going on/I thought this looks so fake...and it was, imagine.  Still lived in Houston at the time close to NASA.  Took a class of kids there and looking at the capsule said no way.  Learning to trust first impressions/the red flags in our heads is an important thing to cultivate.

               <p>
                On the vein of first impressions my first awareness of politics I was 5 and Eisenhower was prez.  I said to mom what is he the president of?  All he does is play golf, I don't see him doing anything for the country.  That pattern has perpetuated, the deep state calls the shots and the puppet du jour is sent to play golf.  Trump said while campaigning he would never have time to play golf like bama bc he would be too busy working.  Well, maybe eating the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake is work/dunno.

                 I wonder about that "chocolate cake" comment. It really creeped me out; maybe I've been on VOAT too much. Nothing looks innocent anymore.

                 I was taking college astronomy the year of the Moon hoax. Back then, when a calculator was the size of a toaster oven, and there was a delay ( a lag)  talking on the phone to anyone  overseas, they wanted us to believe that there was instant communication to the moon and that a polyester "suit" 1 mm thick is going to protect you when your body is half in sunlight @ 253 degrees F (123 C) and half in shadow @ minus 243 degrees F (-153 C). It would not even be suitable for a fall day. I was wise to this, and more back then.

                  Yeah, I was in college too finally finding a place of sanity- the hippie no war, love the earth revolution.  I had no idea it was all a CIA/Brit creation till I read Dave but it all made sense.  Murder of Hendrix and Joplin and the movement seemed to die overnight basically.  'They' gave us mind expanding drugs thinking it would make us fizzle but it had the opposite effect.  Next on the block Yuppies and sadly I watched a number of friends morph into some strange creatures but could never figure out why until Dave.

                   I thank God I never fell for the hippie/drug movement or any other brainwashing. I was taught from a young age how to think for myself and how to research and think critically and analytically. In the thick of the ivy league, SDS, Gay Pride and the rest of the insanity, I saw, even at that young age the sheer hypocrisy of it all, not to mention the depravity. Some of the kids who spent their four years of undergraduate stoned out of their minds, are, today, investment bankers with Goldman Sacks, or corporate tax lawyers (I saw them at reunions). The ones who started the "antiwar" protests and shut down the school (just before midterms of course) were the very ones whose parents were profiteering off weapons, drugs, trafficking etc. It was a total psyop.

                    Well, I think you have a perspective of the hippie movement that is a bit one sided.  Not everyone spent their times stoned out of their minds and it was a time of expanded red pilling for many of us.  Pacifica radio was an excellent alternative news source.  One night I listened to an ex cia for hours who explained how assinations worked not only JFK but Johnson which I had not considered/just for starters.  For many of us it was a time of deep discussions and questioning the purpose of life.  And not all of us morphed into yuppies/bc I have so many friends now that were part of that movement and what we learned is with us today.  We have taken those ideals and translated them into how we individually feel we can make a contribution to earth.  Many of us naturally morphed into various meditations, yoga, non violent eating after the movement.  We became aware of the plight of small organic farmers and factory farming.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So don't toss us all out as brainwashed.  Yes, I was surprised with the Laurel Canyon series but had to chuckle bc for many of us it empowered and has held fast decades later.  Alot of ppl think all hippies were unwashed and humping like dogs/which was not the case in my circle.  Staying up all night discussing the magic of life that we knew as children that had been programmed out of us...so many things explored.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is not to convince you~doesn't matter.  But to discount the many of us that had our lives transformed from years of programming is seeing things as one sided/which is no different than seeing the various thought groups of today as all or nothing and not seeing the threads of truth that bind us.  Those of us that came with the intention to awaken can never be stopped no matter the current mkultra/we turn it to our advantage.

                      You know I remember when Johnson announced on TV that he was not running.  It was so eerie bc he would have been re-elected/he had the political machine behind him.  He was pale, sweating, looked terrified (to me).  I thought at the time wonder what got to him.  He retires to his ranch and then hits the dust/doa.  The Pacifica program I mentioned where the ex cia explained in detail how something like that works blew my mind/a whole other piece of the matrix crumbled.  Then there was the time I was seated next to a retired military officer on a plane who was quite chatty and explained how wars have to happen under a 20 year mark bc that is when weapons need to be tested for viability.

                      And there was the fello I dated in college whose grandfather was one of the founders of gulf oil.  He said those pulling the strings we never hear their names, Rockefeller, Rothschild, Howard Huges etc (which would include Soros if you think about it) merely pawns/the ones at the top play this like a monopoly game.  When he turned 21 he went to England for the summer and when he came back I didn't even recognize him.  It was scary and I got out of the relationship.  Now I read the children of the elite are given free reign till they turn 21 to sow wild oats/dots always connect.

                      Mine was not an ivy league school/it was a state university and relatively calm compared to what was going on in other places.  We never stopped midterms (unfortunately lol) but we did protest.  I remember when Agnew came to town and we turned out in droves.  We saw the insanity of killing.  We mourned for all the dead and maimed on both sides.  I had friends that never came home and ones who came home so damaged emotionally they never recovered.  What shocked me was some who morphed to materialism and are still at that point today.  Some think Liz Warren is da bomb.  I moved to the backwoods and never looked back.  We dot the landscape.  Individually we do what we can to contribute to awakening and making a difference locally.

                      The positive I see with the campaign brew ha ha is it's effectively splintered various thought collectives and neither has a 'savior' to lead them.  This is the start of entrenched systems falling and it takes time.  I really think this might be the straw that broke the camel's back about putting faith in others and reclaiming personal empowerment and integrity.  Time will tell.  The only 2 times the US has had this astrological config is Ame Revolution and Civil War.  It doesn't have to be bloody (but it can sure) but maybe a revolution of consciousness.  To that end I have ways I contribute to that and I'm not alone, we are legions.  And I'm not talking about the airy fairy new age woo'ers.  Just as an example forums like this are effecting a change bc ppl are finally communicating/still some arguing but that is part of the evolution and learning how to communicate mind to mind and heart to heart is a learning in process.

                        I'll give it a through read/but can't at the moment.  We have an animal sanctuary and I'm busy puttering around

                        .  On scan I did catch the Nature Conservatory chapter/yep/all ruses to satisfy un-inquiring minds.  Most of these kinds of orgs serve that purpose.  As of yet I've not found any damning info on The Sea Shepard but I haven't looked in a long time so who knows?  Greenpeace is a farce.  Same with peta, National Wildlife Federation, list goes on and on and on.

                        I do remember digging around about Mathis quite some time ago and found few things that gave me pause as to his credibility but don't recall specifics.  Controlled opposition's benefits/mostly truth (so that has benefit)/digging for the interjections of propaganda is for me entertaining.  I lump Geo Webb in that category, trump election, Robert Steele, Roger Stone (bleh, hard to even look at him much less listen) and host of others.

                        This latest to hit the web Ronald Brenard has a real 'feel' of truth.  I was very moved by the interview.  What do you think?

                         While I do not agree with all of Miles' conclusions in all his articles, I sent you this one because it is quite detailed, makes easily verified claims and really connects some dots. No one person has cornered the market on truth. I do not follow those "gurus" you mentioned. Like Mathis, though I look at different sources, I like to do my own research though I have no desire to publish it.
As someone with a heavy background in both (but I don't want to dox myself) I can say that Miles is spot on with what he writes about  science and art.
ps-I got downvoted just now for alleging that Podesta is a cannibal. This site is chock full of kids and trolls.

Right on Miles/I found some of his articles to ring true.  I will get to the one you sent.

This addon apparently stopped working few days ago and the developer made a patch.
