            So, TLDR: Alex Jones is lying because he didn't tell the 9/11 story you believe is the correct one.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don't trust him as far as I could throw him, but this is hardly evidence of intentional deceit.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the Stratfor connection you dropped with no supporting evidence, it would be nice to see your evidence (though I think you're referring to their emails).

            You are spreading half truths. Alex is a stratfor cointel disinfo agent, but your story of 9/11 is BS. So you are BS or uninformed. The buildings were taken down with controlled demolition, but they were hit by planes as part of their storyline to give an excuse on how they came down and that Muslim terrorist did it. You are trying to say the planes were not real. No reason for you to add that angle in unless you are trying to decieve people. Not a link in this thread proving once again that mods get personal and pick and chose how they translate the rules and who they enforce them on. Down vote.

           <p>
            And you're wrong about Alex, he is listed on e who promotes the "no planes" idea.
