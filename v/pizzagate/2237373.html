<p>WASHINGTON — One is a rail-thin liberal idealist who spent his career in government, on campaigns and at think tanks. The other is an overweight pragmatist who made a fortune lobbying for all manner of liberal boogeymen.</p>
<p>And now, in a twist with Shakespearean undertones, the two influential Washington brothers have found themselves on opposite sides of the scandals over Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
<p>John D. Podesta, perhaps more than anyone except Hillary Clinton, was a victim of the Russian cyberassault on allies of her presidential campaign, of which he was the chairman. Emails stolen from his personal Gmail account were dribbled out by WikiLeaks last fall, revealing the embarrassing rifts roiling the campaign and Washington’s Democratic establishment. He has pushed hard for an aggressive investigation of Russia’s role in the election.</p>

<p>Last week’s indictment did not name the <strong>Podesta Group</strong> or another firm with which it worked on the Ukraine account, <strong>Mercury Public Affairs</strong>. Instead, the indictment referred to them as <em>“two Washington, D.C., firms” that were recruited by Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates.</em></p>

            While this isn't necessarily a retraction, it is more of a CORRECTION. You are right, my limited understanding of the entirety of the Podesta Groups lobbying contracts are responsible for the confusion and these subpoenas were served on the Podesta Group for work that would "boost Ukraine’s reputation in the United States and increase its chances of joining the European Union" and NOT for their involvement in the Uranium1 issue as stated in the title. Further research into this issue today has helped clear up my misunderstanding.
           </p>
           <p>
            While "both firms claim that they were unaware of any connection to the Ukrainian government", the Clinton political mechanization's in the Balkan/Kosovo conflicts during their tenure make that lie utterly contemptuous.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do apologize for any misleading information.

           </p>
           <p>
            "Podesta and the other firm, Mercury Public Affairs, say that they were hired by the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, a nonprofit group based in Brussels, to boost Ukraine’s reputation in the United States and increase its chances of joining the European Union. Both firms claim that they were unaware of any connection to the Ukrainian government. The Podesta Group received $1.1 million between 2012 and 2014 from the organization.
           </p>
           <p>
            Its representation was originally listed under the Lobbyist Disclosure Act but not the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), as required. A Podesta Group spokeswoman says that following media reports that the ECMU may have been connected to Ukraine’s government, the firm submitted new disclosure forms, after which “the FARA office at DOJ informed the Podesta Group that it was not the subject nor a target of an investigation.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Legalities aside, the question among lobbyists in Washington is why someone at the top of his game like Tony would have anything to do with Manafort, whom one Republican lobbyist described as a “shady businessman advocating for murderers, thugs and thieves — even if those criminals were heads of states.” Sources close to the Podesta Group claim that Manafort was not involved with the ECMU at the time the firm worked on its behalf.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tony declined to comment on anything involving the investigation. His company has “fully cooperated” with Mueller’s office and “taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law,” according to the spokeswoman.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the news was enough to end Tony’s tenure at his own firm. He resigned just hours after Manfort’s indictment went public."
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             The real fact of the matter is that the world is catching up very quickly as to how the Podesta's and the Clinton Cartel , Sandler's, Soros ', Rockefeller's, Carnegie's etc etc operate and how they have been working tirelessly to dismantle every vestige of ethical democracy.

            The odd thing is I remember this being revealed back in the 90's on AM radio by George Putnam. Is the time frame correct? I have known about the Clintons Russian Uranium deal for decades.

            Falcon deleted my first post for rule 2 and 3. Reposted and deleted for rule 4. That makes sense right? They've already divided and conquered here, splitting this forum into pizza whatever and whatever else. Now we are left with a forum without much activity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Millenial falcon reminds me of Peter newsham. The DC police chief who charged an 11 year old girl of lying about getting raped when there was medical evidence of multiple seen samples in her underwear.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will continue to make posts like this, with other accounts if necessary, until he is removed. Feel free to join in. The same way we should demand Peter newsham be removed.

            Nothing of any substance will ever come from here with this pedophile protecting Nazi around.

              While this isn't necessarily a retraction, it is more of a CORRECTION. You are right, my limited understanding of the entirety of the Podesta Groups lobbying contracts are responsible for the confusion and these subpoenas were served on the Podesta Group for work that would "boost Ukraine’s reputation in the United States and increase its chances of joining the European Union" and NOT for their involvement in the Uranium1 issue as stated in the title. Further research into this issue today has helped clear up my misunderstanding.

              "Podesta and the other firm, Mercury Public Affairs, say that they were hired by the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, a nonprofit group based in Brussels, to boost Ukraine’s reputation in the United States and increase its chances of joining the European Union. Both firms claim that they were unaware of any connection to the Ukrainian government. The Podesta Group received $1.1 million between 2012 and 2014 from the organization.
             </p>
             <p>
              Its representation was originally listed under the Lobbyist Disclosure Act but not the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), as required. A Podesta Group spokeswoman says that following media reports that the ECMU may have been connected to Ukraine’s government, the firm submitted new disclosure forms, after which “the FARA office at DOJ informed the Podesta Group that it was not the subject nor a target of an investigation.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Legalities aside, the question among lobbyists in Washington is why someone at the top of his game like Tony would have anything to do with Manafort, whom one Republican lobbyist described as a “shady businessman advocating for murderers, thugs and thieves — even if those criminals were heads of states.” Sources close to the Podesta Group claim that Manafort was not involved with the ECMU at the time the firm worked on its behalf.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tony declined to comment on anything involving the investigation. His company has “fully cooperated” with Mueller’s office and “taken every possible step to provide documentation that confirms compliance with the law,” according to the spokeswoman.
             </p>
             <p>
              But the news was enough to end Tony’s tenure at his own firm. He resigned just hours after Manfort’s indictment went public."

               This makes absolutely zero sense.  You have the wrong decade and the wrong geology.  Ukraine is not part of the Balkans and this NGO was formed in 2012.
              </p>
              <p>
               It also makes no sense logically.  The NGO was advocated for better EU-Ukraine relations, but it was pretending it was the EU part of that equation.  It was a deception and there's no reason, it couldn't have been a successful deception.

               If they are no longer the subject of an investigation, this could just mean they were a cooperating witness against Manafort.  Their lawyers have said that "The ECFMU provided formal certification that it was neither funded by nor directed by a government or political party.”    So the ECFMU sent out a deceptive certification.  It seems to me the crux of the case is, does Mueller believe that the Podesta group or Tony Podesta knew this was deceptive?  If Podesta participated in the deception or didn't ask enough question to find out the truth, he would be in jeopardy.  But if their lawyers explained this to the special counsel's office and the special counsel declared that.......

              <p>
               Wait.  I'm reading that wrong.   I almost just said that Tony Podesta was off the hook, but the document refers to the company

               This could mean that the FARA office doesn't have an investigation, but the special counsel does.
              </p>
              <p>
               Or it could mean
              </p>
              <p>
               The Podesta group is not the subject of an investigation, but Tony Podesta himself is.      This would make sense with him stepping down and the company renaming itself.  He might be personally guilty.  Maybe the firm didn't know Manafort was involved, but Tony Podesta did.

               Good on your for your retraction. Kudos.  If you genuinely misunderstood the issue, I withdraw lie and will subsitute, "This is false and you are misinformed."
              </p>
              <p>
               It does show the power of the dishonest UraniumOne narrative though.
              </p>
              <p>
               Here's a non-dishonest summary.  Mueller is not investigating Uranium dealings in any shape or form.  Not UraniumOne, nor the Tenex the company involved in the bribery crime.  Mueller is investigating Russian interference in our presidential election.  This led him to look at Trump's campaign manager Paul Manafort.  Looking at Paul Manafort led to several shady transactions that looked like money laundering.  A local NYC blogger got a tip and found out that Paul Manafort owned a brownstone in Brooklyn.  Real Estate records showed.  The building was bought for $3 million dollars in an ALL CASH no mortgage deal by a shell company and later ownership was transferred to Paul Manafort for $0.  Manafort then got $6.8 million in mortgages on the house.  (5.3 million of these was for a one year mortgage.  Due in Jan 2018.)
               <a href="https://pardonmeforasking.blogspot.com/2017/10/paul-manafort-carroll-gardens_30.html">

               </a>
              </p>
              <p>
               This basically classic money laundering.   Further examination of Manafort found other NYC properties with the same MO.   Mueller has found tens of millions of dollars that Manafort has been paid to him by Pro-Russian Urkanian political party and he has never declared this money.   Among things he was paid for was lobbying for Ukraine in the US and setting up a non-profit organization in Belgium who's purpose was to do PR for the corrupt Ukrainian president.
              </p>
              <p>
               This was illegal because Manafort did not disclose this under the Foreign Agent Registration Act.  This is where Tony Podesta comes in.  The Belgian non-profit was intended to look like an International Organization and it hired a couple of firms in the US to do PR work, a Democratic firm,  The Podesta Group and another Republican affiliated firm.  The Podesta group didn't disclose under FARA.   They are claiming they the work they did never counted as lobbying work and they disclosed the work in a different way to Congress.   In effect they are arguing they used a loophole.  Whatever the legal status of doing it that way, that argument probably falls apart if they knew the money was really coming from Ukraine and Paul Manafort.  The Podesta group denied this was the case in a cease and desist letter to Tucker Carson's show.

               B.  NBC News described The Podesta Groups and Tony Podesta as "subjects" of Mueller's investigation.    In this case a subject has a specific meaning, meaning the subject might be indicted.   Manafort was a "target" of the Mueller investigation meaning, he was almost certain to be indicted.  It's possible to subpoenaed to the grand jury and not have any legal jeopardy.   If they were just looking at Manafort, they still could have requested documents and testimony from Podesta to find out things about Manafort's potential crimes, but it seems that Mueller is going to see Podesta violated FARA too.
              </p>
              <p>
               C.  None of this involves pizzagate or uranium.   Folks are deliberately trying to confuse people about that.
              </p>
              <p>
               D.  Neither Tony Podesta nor John Podesta are in custody.  That was always goofy nonsense.
              </p>
              <p>
               E.  Tony Podesta has stepped down from the Podesta group and this news has definitely affected his firm.
              </p>
              <p>
               What we don't know.
              </p>
              <ol>
               <li>
                <p>
                 If John Podesta is involved at all.   He doesn't work at The Podesta Group and hasn't had a financial interest there since the 1990's, I believe.
                </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                <p>
                 That Tony Podesta is indicted.   It's possible that the loophole that Manafort is claiming stands up or Mueller can't find enough evidence to prove a FARA violation.  It's possible that the sealed indictments include Podesta and given E. above, I think this is likely

             Looks like SGT Report was right - that Trump and Muller teamed up and the DNC got played! I knew something was up when Donna Brazile threw Killary under the bus. She was greenlighted, assuring her that she won't be Seth Riched.

            I really hope this all leads to more coming out. If it does, I wonder how long MSM will try to keep up the lies.

            The Democrats really fucked up. They could have burned Hillary alive and capitalized on the post election anger by "rebranding" their party after an embarrassing failure. Without changing anything of course, but with the spectacle of dropping Hillary and her team like a hot potato. Can't worry about no actual changes being made if everyone is watching the execution. Then they would be seen as
            <em>
             doing
            </em>
            something instead of whatever limp dicked strategy they've adopted that is so impotent it's not even readily apparent.

             Hillary's and Podesta's campaign strategy was the dumbest I have ever seen. She almost quit the campaign totally because she could not even get 200 pissed off females and SJW's to show up.

             It looks like they’re attempting to do something like this, but it’s too little, too late.  The Clintons have been running that party for decades and with the influence they have, they could probably take everyone else down with them.  This is what happens when you make deals with evil; it all comes crashing down at the end.

              Exactly. There was a rumor that on the election night when she was smashing glasses she is alleged to have shouted at Podesta 'I will reveal all the horrors you've have done' - She has the goods on everyone, she will not be touched, but I really hope that's the last we see Hillary and Bill in the political arena. And no Michelle or Chelsey or I will start climbing walls!

              John Podesta is a Malignant Narcissist he's loving all the attention and notoriety. Reminds me of the last Ted Bundy trial when, acting as his own counsel, he cross questions a sheriff about the murder scene he (Bundy) has committed himself. The jury were  rightly horrified and we all know the outcome...

                  Be careful with sleeplessness, it can kill ya. Look up "glymphatic system". Gotta get Stage 4 sleep. Glycine, Taurine and L-Theanine help, as does 5htp.

                  Get off the Valium and get enough sleep and cut down on your liquor.  If you are taking Valium you should not be drinking.  I know from experience. They made me High as a Kite.  I was on them years ago and almost got killed crossing the street.  It clouds your judgement.  I finally cut them in half and slowly took myself off.  Bad News all around. Just Sayin'.

                   Hey Carmencita, I'm tapering off Klonopin. How was your "detox"? Did you have any bad w/drawals or did it go fairly smoothly? Benzos are extremely nasty. Wicked stuff that will wreck your life. Doctors haven't a clue. Never made me "high," just drowsy.

                    This will speed along helping your body thoroughly flush the drugs from your system. Its also like an organic body fixer upper medicine cabinet in a jar. Perhaps the most important natural medicine on the planet. I take two teaspoons a day. Every two or three weeks I skip a week, just because I think I should. Known to be good for more than over 600 health ailments. Nothing like it and one of the most studied substances on the planet. Do not take the curcumin extract because when you extract something it removes and isolates it from the rest of the elements in the turmeric and it is no longer a compound. Its the synergistic effects of the whole compound, the whole root, that does the trick.

                    Capsules are a waste of money. Get a whole pound cheap. Lock it up in a mason jar and put it in a dark cabinet. It will last for years in a mason jar.

                    Same instructions as above. Also very good for you. After a few days you will have less anxiety and depression. Its like ginseng in its properties. Its an adaptogen. After a couple of weeks you will notice a lot more chill...

                     Thanks much for this, and good to hear from a survivor. My natural doc has me on some of this, it's capsule, I'll ask him about powder form. It's for adrenal fatigue brought on by benzos. We used amino acid therapy to detox from an SSRI and Suboxone. I never drank or smoked dope. Body can't handle it. Amino acids were to balance neurotransmitters and reach "homeostasis" again in the brain, urine tests which reflect brain chemistry were used to achieve balance. Thanks again.

                      Powder form is simply a much more economical way to do it basically. You also have a better chain of custody about exactly where the product came from and what it really is. Bu the time the product hits the capsule machine there are more steps involved to dilute it with fillers. You can call mountain rose and ask them questions. Nice people. Like any business you might not get through to the actual buyer of the product on the first call but it can be done. You also probably get fresher stuff.

                       Nice place, I just bookmarked it. Thanks. Yes, my doc is big on purity and chain of custody. Has a hard time finding good stuff, getting some stuff from France even. The macuna we use, only one manufacturer is up to snuff, macuna is L-Dopa natural form. I will talk to him about these things. He's the best, glad I found him.

                        That is interesting as hell. Wasn't the movie "rain man" about using L dopa and in the end, after miracles, all patients reverted to their catatonic states? I always wondered if that test was done using synthetics and that is why it failed. That was based on a true story right?

                         "Awakenings" w/ Robert de Niro. Great movie. True story, based on work of Oliver Saks (sp?) w/ these catatonic people. I think it failed because the other "co-factors" needed such as 5-HTP and a few others weren't used nor their importance understood. W/out these the neurotransmitters become unbalanced leading to destructive deficits. This is the problem w/ modern antidepressants and other psych drugs, including L-Dopa, used for Parkinson's. We use only pure, natural macuna, comes from a legume.

                    Well, must admit this was a long time ago.  The doctor warned me to not go cold turkey, so I did it very slowly.   The first week I remember only cutting in half two pills and did that for a couple weeks then 3 pills.  Remember I was on 30 mg.  a day.  Shocking.  In those days all women's problems were solved by giving them valiums or something similar. The doctor was clearly trying to keep me on them.  So I had to slowly do this on my own.  I recommend you might find info on the internet or from a natural doctor for advice as well if possible.  At the time there was not internet for backup help.  I was going through a divorce and this was the recommended remedy.  WTH?

                     Wow Carmencita, that's a drag. Yeah back then there was no help at all. You were taking "Mothers' Little Helpers" I assume you know that song. 30 mg a day is indeed shocking, but I've heard of worse. At least your doc knew not to go cold turkey, kudos to him, and to you for tapering off. Good job. Yes, I have plenty info and help, I'll be off them soon. Took them for years for insomnia, just made matters worse, much worse. Thank-you.

                      For alcoholics the ashwagandha is also a godsend. It can eliminate the anxiety that causes the urge to drink. I don't know if it would work for an active drinker though because the body will be so screwed up it might not be able to process the ashwagandha properly. If an alcoholic can stop drinking and stabilize his system, and take this, its like a gift from the god. Was for me.

                     Read my reply, shit... That wasn't even a mood swing lol. Here is the ultimate problem with text - it's devoid of audible connotation - if it were possible to hear how I would have said what I typed, it would come across a little less hostile and more just literally a tired misunderstanding.

                       Poor choice of words given that it wasn't audible. I was quick to apologise, though, was I not?

                       I'm from Australia, we swear(or curse, as others call it) casually and more often than not, without malice. I responded the way I did, due to percieved disrespect aimed at me; it was a misunderstanding on at least my part, if not the both of us. Downvoating me for expressing to others that I'm having trouble sleeping, though... do we call that disrespectful too? Or am I just a cunt?

                      TY.  That is exactly how I meant it.  Having had a horrible experience myself. I realized the gravity of the drug when I could not cross a street by myself.  The only way to cross was to watch when others crossed.  That was my cue.  Then I just realized how dangerous that was as well.  This was decades ago when I trusted doctors, not anymore.

                       Well I don't know why he would ping people if he doesn't want a reaction. That makes no sense. His constant mood swings are showing he's not handling it well. I told him what I thought so he'll probably be all mad but oh well. I don't think he should disrespect you and cuss at you the way he did. Not to the ones he's supposed to be "friends" with. His mood swings are annoying.

                        Yes, and I spent countless hours and days researching his many connections to Wisconsin and Rigby.  I did it because I believed in it but did not expect this reaction.  Oh well, time to move on.
