<p>First things first. Disney admits here it organizes many political events involving government officials along with fulfilling requests for them for exchange of favors.</p>
<p>Disney\'s government relations manager page:</p>

<p>Walt Disney\'s link to the FBI</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/movies/disney-link-to-the-fbi-and-hoover-is-disclosed.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/06/movies/disney-link-to-the-fbi-and-hoover-is-disclosed.html</a></p>
<p>&quot;From 1940 until his death in 1966, Walt Disney served as a secret informer for the Los Angeles office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to documents that have come to light under the Freedom of Information Act.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Eliot, who has written several books on popular culture, provided a copy of the Disney file to The New York Times so that information and direct quotations in the book could be verified against the Government documents.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In return for Disney\'s information, J. Edgar Hoover, the Director of the bureau, allowed Disney to film in F.B.I. headquarters in Washington. For his part, Disney allowed Hoover access to some Disney scripts, and made slight changes in a few lesser-known movies and an episode of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; television show to mollify the director. There is no evidence that revisions were requested in any of Disney\'s classic animated features.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As a bureau contact, Disney reported on the activities of Hollywood actors, writers, producers, directors, technicians and union activists suspected of political subversion. The earliest communication between Disney and Hoover appears in a July 1936 memorandum in which Hoover writes, &quot;I am indeed pleased that we can be of service to you in affording you a means of absolute identity throughout your lifetime.&quot; The meaning of &quot;absolute identity&quot; is unclear, but the document signifies the beginning of a long-term relationship between the two men.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The F.B.I. and Disney found an opportunity for mutual benefit in Disneyland, which opened in 1955. A document in his file reads: &quot;Mr. Disney has recently established a business association with the American Broadcasting Company-Paramount Theaters Inc. for the production of a series of television shows, which for the most part are scheduled to be filmed at Disneyland, a multmillion-dollar amusement park being established under Mr. Disney\'s direction in the vicinity of Anaheim, Calif. Mr. Disney has volunteered representatives of this office complete access to the facilities of Disneyland for use in connection with official matters and for recreational purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>Disney along with Universal Studios and Sea World had a pedophile ring back in 2014.</p>

<p>Jon Heely, A Disney executive, got arrested for sexually abusing children back in December 2017.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/12/12/disney-exec-suspended-after-child-sex-abuse-charges-filed/944507001/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2017/12/12/disney-exec-suspended-after-child-sex-abuse-charges-filed/944507001/</a></p>
<p>Victor Salva, A Disney director got arrested for raping Nathan Forrest Winters in the 1980\'s</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gv855/victor-salva-loves-terrorised-semi-naked-youths-jeepers-creepers-powder-clownhouse">https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8gv855/victor-salva-loves-terrorised-semi-naked-youths-jeepers-creepers-powder-clownhouse</a></p>
<p>He only served 18 months of his three year sentence.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/245090/clownhouse-molestation-survivor-nathan-forrest-winters-speaks-new-documentary/">http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/245090/clownhouse-molestation-survivor-nathan-forrest-winters-speaks-new-documentary/</a></p>
<p>Then got hired by Disney again in 1995 even after his conviction in 1988.</p>
<p><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-25/local/me-60848_1_child-molester">http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-25/local/me-60848_1_child-molester</a></p>
<p>So out of three years only serves half of it then gets hired again. Disney pulling alot of strings out in the court system.</p>
<p>CDAN entries on the rape of Fergie and Jennifer Love Hewitt on Kids Incorporated I spoke about here to. It was a Disney Channel show.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/todays-blind-items-child-porn-and-drugs.html">http://www.crazydaysandnights.net/2017/11/todays-blind-items-child-porn-and-drugs.html</a></p>

<p>Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and on Disney\'s board of directors had this tweet aimed at him from CNN journalist Jake Tapper.</p>
<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTRB_gOU8AUsCt-.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DTRB_gOU8AUsCt-.jpg</a></p>
<p>So 35 Disney employees have been arrested in pedophile rings since 2006. A Disney executive from 2017 (Jon Heely) gets arrested for child sexual abuse and one Disney movie director as well you can add to that list from 1988 (Victor Salva). This along with CDAN talking about the Kids Incorporated rapes happening at the same studio Heather O\'Rourke died in after being raped on the set of Jeopardy.</p>
<p>Disney having so much influence over the government as I stated earlier is beyond startling. They have immense control.</p>',

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             [Walt Disney] was made a "full Special Agent in Charge Contact" in 1954. An "S.A.C. Contact" was usually a trusted informer who could provide transportation and equipment as well as public relations services to the bureau.
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1956, a Disney aide requested the right to use the bureau's offices in Washington for the Mickey Mouse Club television program. Disney officials promised that the Mouseketeers would be seen enthusing about agents on their shooting range as "great marksmen" and the F.B.I. "would be something which children would look up to."

            Somewhat tangental but Disney produced the SPIRIT OF 43 where Donald Duck is convinced to be patriotic and voluntarily self-assess himself for "income" tax in order to fight the Nazis.

             It's actually not a satanic book at all. It's a novel by Salman Rushdie:
            </p>
            <p>
             It was an international bestseller, and many people with all kinds of backgrounds have read it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Only some Islamic Mullahs didn't like it;  Ayatollah Khomeini, the former leader of Iran, imposed a
             <em>
              fatwa
             </em>
             on Rushdie, and he had to live underground for many years, protected by police.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              In mid-February 1989, following a violent riot against the book in Pakistan, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, then Supreme Leader of Iran and a Shi'a Muslim scholar, issued a fatwa calling for the death of Rushdie and his publishers, and called for Muslims to point him out to those who can kill him if they cannot themselves.
             </p>
             <p>
              Although the British Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher gave Rushdie round-the-clock police protection, many politicians on both sides were hostile to the author.
             </p>
             <p>
              British Labour MP Keith Vaz led a march through Leicester shortly after he was elected in 1989 calling for the book to be banned.

              Wow.  I knew about Rushdi, and the call for his death but did not connect to that book.   Geez, people read tweets.  KnoTwing what we know about Tapper and his wife taking their kids to CPP,  it may just be part of their Bedtime Reading.  Thanks for the link.  Will Read.

             What Heartwarming Cartoons the were churning out.   We have long suspected that DC and PedoWood were connected.  Malia went to work for Weinsten.  What does that tell us.  Nothing has changed, except that it has gotten even worse.

              Oh, I forgot about Malia working for him. You know the "system" had known about Weinstein for a lot longner than the public has. How could Obama send his daughter to work for such a perv? Kinda makes you think ALL of these people behave the same way

               or they are not their daughters.  Can't wait for the proof about the Os to finally be proven 100%. ie: birth/children/M a man/his half bro Malik etc, (imo the 'half bro' is not related at all hence the indifference he feels about seeing him impoverished, especially when he is so wealthy -  if his dad is supposed to be a different man than he claims and his mom is definitly not Maliks - no connection) so frustrating all the conspiracy swirling around the internet.

                I 100% believe his dad is Frank Marshall Davis making Malik not actually related. As far as the kids, I don't know. It all seems very sketchy with that "family"

               Don't let it consume you. I know how that feels. Almost a year ago when I first came to Voat I lurked Pizzagate a long time and felt the same way. When I made an account and started researching and I felt so horrible. I felt sad, angry, upset. Life dident really feel real anymore. Watching my favourite show The Walking Dead became distant fiction and no bit of horror I ever watched or read about could compare to this. When I was young I loved reading about different things about the world I wanted to educate myself. Like the Vietnam My Lai massacre or 9/11 or FBI operations. This though? Pizzagate? This was the most horrific thing I had ever heard about. My love for games began blurring and I couldent really pay attention to fictional plotlines anymore. My worries about work or college began to feel trivial. I started going down the rabbit hole. I researched everything. The pedophiles, the snuff films. the corruption and how it intertwines in the worlds governments and how it is in everything from the entertainment industry to the schools and colleges, and in businesses around the world. People like Jeffery Epstein had elites from all walks of life. In our feelings as Americans or wherever country we come from and our world it all seemed upside down. I felt sick but I wanted to stop this. To stop this unspoken rape and genocide of children. Just don't let it consume you. Millions are awoke, and millions more will be soon. We're going to stop this.

                Yes, exactly how I feel. Thank you for the moral support and the links...I'll check them out now. I just wish I could go save all these kids right now. I too feel like certain things are so pointless and unreal compared to what is happening "underground" so to speak. But ya, slowly but surely things will change for the better. :)
