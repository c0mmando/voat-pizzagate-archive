             "In a press briefing in Geneva on June 27th, Thomas introduced WHO’s Ebola expert Pierre Formenty, who categorically denied that Ebola was “out of control” , as reporters and Doctors without Borders suggested.

            You've said nothing. Are you drunk? I remember when I had first realized the world wasn't as it seems, a true paradox of paradoxes, an altruistic assumption of titanic proportions. I didn't know rather if I should turn away from the horror, and delve within, create a false dichotomy in my own mind, or face the truth, and bathe in it's light. This is a spiritual journey my friend. By choosing to disguise the truth from others, you are diminishing your own soul. You are also reserving a special place in my heart. A place where murderers and jackboots arrive. This is but one lifetime of many pal. I will remember you.

            Think it was Serena Shim who reported the UN/WHO using their trucks (meant to deliver food), for the transport of weapons to terrorists to take down Assad.  She and two other journalists were murdered after reporting on the shipments.  The weapons shipments are connected to Hillary Clinton and the foundation.  50 earlier videos have been removed.  A couple were explicit about Hillary shipping sarin gas to the terrorists (all of it blamed on Assad and Obama on the verge of going in with bombers until testing at Porton Down in the UK proved the gas was US-made (it came from Gaddaffi stores taken over by the US, along with stinger missiles, after Clinton had him killed).

            You can see arms trafficking is being used to fund these huge oil deals.  CF is the hub and is taking bribes all along the way.  The guy says clearly she needs 3 billion for the campaign and $500,000 speeches won't cut it.  She'd need 6,000 of them, but this deals mean real money.   And if they need real money and human trafficking is a trillion dollar industry - it is also part of this?  Does child trafficking in Haiti figure in here, as well as child trafficking elsewhere?

              a Julian Assange interview on Hillary Clinton and the emails
             </a>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              JA: There’s an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation.  Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well it’s just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves.
             </p>
             <p>
              But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             JP: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the Saudis and the Qataris, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              JA: Under Hillary Clinton, the world’s largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia, [worth] more than $80 billion.  In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State, total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value, doubled.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             JP: Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIl or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              JA: Yes.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             JP:That's extraordinary.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              JA: I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions,  tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of [the reaction] to their ambitions. She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states.  The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network?  She's a centralising cog. You’ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street, and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis.

            You might want to look into what is said to be UN/WHO coding inserted into Obamacare.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is another posting here about a Hillary Clinton visit to an African village and kids becoming deranged a few days afterwards.  This comment was posted but it raises questions about  the UN and who runs it (allegedly the Jesuits) which brings us to the pope who just tried to shut down news of Pizzagate internationally by treating the normal function of the press as a religious sin.

           <p>
            The end of the article relates to the African town because it shows that a French town was driven insane through actions of the CIA.

           </p>
           <p>
            And it brings us back to kids because at the end of that article it asks (in the context of what appear to be plans for the dispersal of various forms of  bioweapons against people in the US), whether the WHO and UN (both are controlled by the Vatican) inserted a section inside Obamacare that pre-legalizes both poisoning and gassing? And that coding (it needs to be verified it's there) may refer to rape and satanic ritual abuse and even to cannabilism.  In which case, you hit the mother lode with what Hillary's visit to Africa may expose.

            To Attorney Generals of All States Opposing Obamacare - It Includes Illegal Foreign Coding for Beheadings and Multiple Forms of Mass Murder

            Is this section really there?
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.centralx.com/diseases/icd889.htm">
             ICD 9 E 978 “Legal Execution”
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            All executions performed at the behest of the judiciary or ruling authority [whether permanent or temporary] as:
           </p>
           <pre><code>**asphyxiation by gas**

[As was done in the Nazi death camps?  What government legally asphyxiates people?  How many people?  Where?  From the sky?  In the new bricked up train buildings in Indiana, California, Oregon, Texas and in many other states, with tracks running into them?  In subways?  Is this an attempt to pre-legalize gassing people in gas chambers or in subways with Sarin or other gases and killing them, as "legal execution?]

**beheading, decapitation** (by guillotine)

[This doesn't need a comment.  It's illegality and horror speak for themselves.]
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Actually, it does very much deserve a comment since it is a basic in satanic rituals using babies and young children.  It turns out that beheading is an occult ritual tied to beginning the NWO.  The Pope is Jesuit as is Podesta.  B. Clinton may be because he went to Jesuit Georgetown University.

           </p>
           <p>
            Now back to the list of Obamacare "legal executions."
           </p>
           <pre><code>**capital punishment **

[Capital punishment" is not a form of execution.  Was this just thrown in so someone scanning the list quickly would see something familiar and not look further?]

**electrocution**

**hanging** 

[Do US states hang people anymore for capital crimes?  Is hanging not considered cruel and unusual punishment now? ]

**poisoning** 

[The US does not execute using poisoning.  In what country anywhere is poisoning a legal execution?  Might this be an attempt to pre-legalize deaths by poisoning of water supplies as "legal execuations"?  Or of food supplies?  Or by assassination?]
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Think water systems, subways, and vaccines.
           </p>
           <pre><code>**shooting** 

[Is this by firing squad as in a military execution?  Does this cover mass shootings in front of pits as was done by the Nazis?  Would it include shooting of protestors?]

**other specified means **
</code></pre>
           <p>
            THIS IS THE MOST BIZARRE OF THE SECTIONS BECAUSE IT HIDES WHAT IS INCLUDED.  DOES IT GIVE THEM A CODING FOR SATANIC RITUAL KILLINGS AND CANNABILISM?  WHAT ELSE IS SO HORRIFIC IT CAN'T BE LISTED WHEN BEHEADINGS AND THE REST CAN?
           </p>
           <pre><code>[Where are those listed?  This UN and WHO coding leaves this section referring to secret information. 

[What kind of legal coding is that?

[What kind of medical coding is that? 

[Are drones such means?  Or mandated lethal vaccines such as with weaponized ebola patented by the CDC?  Is harvesting of organs included on the secret list of means?]
</code></pre>
           <p>
            **    Injury undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted **
           </p>
           <pre><code>[How can it be a "legal execution" if it is accidental?  

[How can it be a "legal execution" - distinct from all the choices above - if it is an injury that was purposefully "inflicted"? 

[Is that not a description of inflicted injury by mandatory vaccines - which are included in Bush's pandemic laws - that end up killing?

[Is this vaguely worded section of Obamacare not an effort to define "accidental" or "inflicted" deaths by mandatory  vaccines, as "legal execution"?

[Is this also a description of deaths occurring as the result ofttorture?

[Would rape not fit here?   Would child rape, torture and satanic sacrifice by the criminal elite as exposed by ITCCS.org not fit here as well?]
</code></pre>
           <p>
            Who can check out Obamacare?  If this section is in it, this will blow sky high because it's insane.  Allegedly DHS inserted for the UN and WHO.  But if you check out the chart in this article, you'll see that ultimately the Jesuits run things.  (This coprophilia pope is Jesuit.  Isn't he the first Jesuit pope?)

            So what may have happened to the African village after a Clinton visit is hugely relevant to now and protecting kids AND this country.  Based on the article, the CIA certainly drove a French town insane with LSD in the water and experimented on people in NYC through spraying LSD in the subway.

            This is the same one. This site keeps censoring any information about the eastern european pedo rings, that came about after the Bosnia/Kosovo war. If you don't remember, Clinton, and bush completely destabilized the area to create a UN elitist cuck state, known as the Albanian/Kosovo golden triangle.
