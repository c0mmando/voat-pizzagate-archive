            <strong>
             from the article:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            "A Houston man and woman have been ordered to federal prison following their convictions of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors and sex trafficking of minors, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Abe Martinez. A federal jury convicted Jazsmine Arielle Joseph, 28, on Sept. 2, 2016, following a week-long trial and approximately six hours of deliberation. Co-defendant Xavier Cooper, 32, had previously pleaded guilty.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today, U.S. District Judge David Hittner handed both defendants 262-month prison sentences. They were further ordered to serve five years of supervised release following completion of the prison terms, during which time he will have to comply with numerous requirements designed to restrict his access to children. Both will also be ordered to register as a sex offender.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the trial, the jury ultimately found Joseph engaged in a conspiracy with Cooper between October 2014 through March 2015, in which they engaged in conspiracy to entice, transport and harbor a minor female to engage in commercial sex. Joseph paid for and directed the posting of prostitution ads online. Joseph also rented hotel rooms where the minor engaged in commercial sex acts.
           </p>
           <p>
            The jury heard that the minor engaged in numerous commercial sex acts over the course of the conspiracy culminating with her recovery during a highly publicized sting operation on March 31, 2015. At trial, Joseph claimed she was “just helping a friend” in regard to her renting the hotel room and assisting with the posting of the prostitution ads. The jury also heard about and viewed text messages between Joseph and Cooper discussing the minor victim. The texts discussed making sure the victim was ready to receive customers and when customers were on their way.
           </p>
           <p>
            Joseph attempted to convey her innocence by testifying she was trying to help the victim and protect her from Cooper. The jury was not convinced and found her guilty on both counts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Texas Department of Public Safety investigated with the assistance of the FBI. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kimberly A. Leo and Sherri L. Zack prosecuted the case."

             This is related to PG as it deals with organized child sex trafficking, child sexual abuse and exploitation, and use of the internet to sexually exploit kids and run a human trafficking operation.
