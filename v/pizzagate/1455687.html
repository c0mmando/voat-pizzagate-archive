            Soros is 101 years old and he's had 7 heart bypass surgeries I believe. More than anyone on earth has ever had. Isn't time for the fucker to drop dead? Oh but wait! Then his son takes over and the evil continues! I hate those bastards

            Why does this article think that Kelloggs is 'far left'? Because it wants to help make sure people from all races have similar levels of opportunity and that your race or nationality shouldn't hold you back from fulfilling your potential just on the basis of other peoples' prejudices? I don't understand why that is a) a left wing idea or b) a bad thing??
           </p>
           <p>
            I hate the way the right seem to have decided to label everything they don't like as being 'left wing,' even when it's completely the opposite. Like the idea that the Clintons or the Democrats are left wing is utterly laughable. The EU? The EU is right wing/centre right. George Soros? Right wing. In the traditional sense of what left and right mean. I think what people are getting mixed up about is that ideologies like that of Clinton, for example, are economically very right wing and neoliberal, and they are also socially liberal, so basically they don't want to interfere in how individuals choose to live their lives, let people marry who they want, do what they want with their own bodies etc - they don't care about that stuff, that's just stuff to get people on their side, what they really care about is their awful criminal economic policies and their perverted form of sociocorporatism, where economically there is socialism for corporations/the rich (i.e. the working people and the poor prop up the banks and the corporations with their taxes by bailing them out, subsidising wages etc) and capitalism for the workers and the poor (i.e. dog eat dog). They are NOT left wing.
           </p>
           <p>
            I get the feeling the right try to characterise these awful people and ideas as left wing so that people will never bother looking into what actual left wing policies are like, centre-left democratic socialist policies, which are basically for the good of the people, not dictated by governments and bankers and corporate lobbyists. Of course they don't want people getting wind of
            <em>
             that
            </em>
            . It's so frustrating to me, I see it ALL THE TIME, people getting it all wrong and mixed up. Argh.

             In reality, they are all left wing. Socialism/Communism (what the left is referred to) and Fascism (what the right is referred to) are both on the LEFT. On the far right side would be anarchy and right next to that would be our "Constitutional Republic." In fact, we are not a Constitutional Republic nor any system even closely related to such. We are more of an Oligarchy at this point.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I digress... calling one extreme right and the other left is a false left-right paradigm. They both exist on the far left.

              No, they aren't. But I think it doesn't matter anymore, everything has turned into such a mess I don't think the right left dichotomy is at all useful anymore, too many people think it means different things, which means it's lost any coherent meaning and therefore lost any usefulness. We need to start thinking in terms of us vs them. As in us, normal ordinary people all over the world, and them - psychopathic child raping warmongering money sucking slave driving monsters that have somehow engineered themselves into positions of ultimate power over OUR world. The world belongs to the nice, kind ordinary human beings, who are by far the majority - these abominations of our species have stolen it from us. So that's the real fight everyone should concentrate on, I think.

             Lmao no true scotsman fallacy. I am pretty sure no one "labeled" those fools. They are self proclaimed democrats/leftists/liberals. You're in denial

              Yeah I know they labelled themselves that, that doesn't mean that's what they are, I know the majority of people on the left in my country do no identify at all with ANYTHING Clinton is about. And they are liberals in many senses, but liberal doesn't equal leftist. Maybe it's just a relative term for each country, if the Democrats came to the UK maybe 10 years ago, they would've been seen as on the right, more on the right than our major centre right party. Now the Overton window has shifted so much towards the right the world over. I actually think we should stop using these terms because they mean such different things to different people and different countries etc, and it just means that people will hear something is 'right wing' and instantly dismiss it without checking it out, and the same with people who consider themselves on the right instantly dismissing anything that is labelled as leftist.
             </p>
             <p>
              For example I thought a couple of Trump's policies were left wing by the definition of the left I understand (an which Wikipedia seems to agree with) but perhaps we shouldn't think in those terms. Let's just think in terms of what's good for ordinary people and what's bad for them, that way we hopefully won't miss out on any good stuff just by virtue of the label that's been stuck on it.

               Your 3rd point is so idiotic that I don't really even want to address it BUT... "to get people on their side" = pandering,  to "let people do what they want with their own bodies" would make sense, except for all of the laws that Democrats pass limiting what you can do with your body, i.e. own a gun, speak your mind (online bullying laws), sending our Soldiers off to war after war after endless war, etc., etc., etc.

             Dude, just hang out here for a while and you will get what we call a Red Pill. I used to be a hard-core Democrat my whole life but after a short time on Voat I started to realize that the world is not what it seems. Right now you are a copper-top but soon you will be unplugged. Trust me.

              Trust me I am noway near a Democrat, I hate them and think they are evil. Those things I said aren't what I think, I was saying what they think they're doing re pandering to people and the stuff about doing what you want with your own body (which I agree with) but yeah they are hypocritical and have double standards about it (as do the Republicans in other ways). And yes most European governments are to the left of the Democrats, definitely, (except maybe the UK) I don't think I said that they weren't? I think you completely misunderstood my comment.

             I never understood why people spend money on name brand cereal when most types, except "strawberry" mini wheats, come in store brand as well. Less expensive and tastes the same (to me at least)
