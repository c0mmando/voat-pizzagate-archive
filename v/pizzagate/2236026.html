<p>One of the questions asked for research regarding the day before Osama Bin Laden “character” (Anon words) was killed off by MSM and government actors. I will be adding more to this post as it goes along. OBL was “allegedly” killed on May 1, 2011. This announcement actually interrupted The Aprentice show with Donald Trump. I have a clip. </p>

<p>The day before on June 30, 2011. Numerous stories broke about Libya being an unauthorized War Power violation. The mass drone strikes of extrajudicial killings was revealed as occurring in at least 7 countries. Pakistan went on record demanding the US government stop launching drones from Pakistan base. Here is a compilation of stories.</p>

<p>When something very detrimental to the Deep State is exposed a false flag or drill gone live will often occur. False Flags are not always just crisis actors, they can be mixed with real victims or entrapment schemes. </p>

            The day before May 1 would be April 30, not June 30.
           </p>
           <p>
            Democracynow.org doesn't do weekend headlines, so April 30 and May 1, 2011 are not provided (Sat. and Sun.)

             Do you even realize who you're talking to, "FactFinder"? That's Jew777.  Fought off 9 masked men for the cause.  Tracked down the Khazar Mafia in Racine, WI.  I daresay such a titan knows the order of the fucking months of the year.

              It was only three men actually and one other. I wouldn’t say fought them off since they beat me senseless but I lived and fought enough to keep them from getting in my house although they stole my car, property ID, known 9X felonies and local LE and witness protection are involved due to the signs of targeted attack and the words they threatened me with...

               We can assure you that everything we have posted about Racine, Wisconsin is the real Truth and leads to the real global agenda of eternal enslavement.

             Thanks for that rundown. Apparently you are not aware we are on the same side. I am actually working very hard to expose the attempted takedown of Trump by delivering real evidence to people and exposing the coup plotters.

             All of those alts do ping me and I know the real identity of the poster. Who has excellent info in between the disinfo. I allowed myself to be pinged and responded to learn from the other side. Once I got the info and blew the cover personally and the opposition forces behind,  they  became furious that they let me in on the plan. 
I am know no longer pinged...
