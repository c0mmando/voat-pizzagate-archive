- If we get the same &quot;waitresses,&quot; I\'m all for it!!!
- I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long ago, assume we are using the same channels?
- To celebrate all you hot dogs out there. Aaric, you can participate as well!</p>
<p>That’s what was said in the emails. I’m assuming that “waitresses” could mean either hookers/strippers/pimps/child handlers. Channels refers to a special network whereby goods/info/etc. are brought from point A to point B. There is no good reason to need the kind of complicated setup the word &quot;channel&quot; implies if you are just ordering in food. Pizza and hot dogs especially are not the kind of food which you would have brought over by airplane. If you are determined to waste a ton of money on high-class pizzas and hot dogs you would just get some high-rated chef and get him quality ingredients.</p>
<p>All very likely, very likely, however there is a point made, however doubtful it may be.</p>

<p>Item	Price
Dog	$0.20
Bun	$0.10
Condiments	$0.10
Total	$0.40
This ignores labor, which I\'m going to figure in as 200% the cost of each dog for a total cost of $1.20 to make one of these things. Let\'s be generous and add in various other costs and say $2.00 per hot dog. That\'s 32,500 hot dogs, each weighing between 3.5oz and 8.5oz resulting in a total weight of 7106.375 to 17265.625 pounds of hot dogs. Assuming this is a crazy-ass event and they are eating nothing but a half pound to full pound of hot dogs each, that feeds a decent section of a full-blown arena to the entirety of a small arena worth of people.
To wrap up: did Stratfor host an event for no less than 5,000 people in May 2009 on a Friday?
edit 2: I\'ll be generous and lower the bar, assuming this is not being spent 100% on hot dogs but on other items (alcohol, sides, &quot;waitresses&quot;, etc). Did Stratfor host an event for 1,000 people in May 2009 on a Friday?
edit 3: We may have an answer on this one: POTUS flew in a chef for the congressional picnic at around the same date a year later. This fits price-wise much more realistically, and the scale of the event makes sense.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is enough to discredit these few emails, it’s somewhat lacking in structure and also what was found was hosted a year later. Not sure what to make of this, may just be a coincidence. Or maybe the event hosted the next year was a ‘routine event’, however this time it became more public knowledge?</p>

            Fair point, although the very fact they're bringing in outside food with (i assume) no previous documentation of approval is off-putting.

            Not enough sufficient evidence for anything other than a theory as Wikileaks was compromised so we should be taking the file with a pinch of salt.

            He (BO) is literally throwing it in our face. 
Discussion of being fake, about kids loving the president. 
He said he "does really well with the zero to eight demographic." (5:12 or so) because of his ears??
           </p>
           <p>
            Somewhere else I saw a video where he said something about ketchup on hot dogs was unacceptable, unless you were under the age of 8. How many times has BO said something strange like that? Especially about hot dogs.
           </p>

            Obviously JS is in on it. Anybody want to watch these episodes? This one was labeled season 7 episode 1. Might be some right in your face clues based on their arrogance.
