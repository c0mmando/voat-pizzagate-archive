<p><strong>The US Embassy previously confirmed a large child trafficking ring in Faisalabad, Pakistan:</strong></p>
<p>Reportedly in 2008 an American woman wanted to adopt a Russian child, but the agency referred her to their partner agency who had a Pakistani baby.  The one-month-old was being trafficked by <strong>a large Faisalabad ring:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The US Embassy also confirmed for the plaintiff that Global Adoption Services was a front for a large child trafficking ring located in Faisalabad, Pakistan. Faisalabad was the city of Marina’s birth.”</p>

<p>Imran Awan’s father, Haji Ashraf Awan, fraudulently owns very large Faisalabad land areas, <strong>farmland</strong> supposedly to be turned into housing.  The father is also alleged to have “transferred a USB drive to a Pakistani senator and former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency”:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Awan brothers are reported to have connections to</strong> <strong><em>Russia and the Ukraine,</em></strong> <strong>just a coincidence?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Awan’s younger brothers Abid and Jamal were also on the House payroll, but have not been charged with any crimes.</p>
<p>“Jamal used to travel a lot,” the relative said, “and he has just been in the past few months he visited some countries and was planning to go again and in the house, Awan used to talk a lot about <strong>Russia.”</strong>  Abid’s wife, Natalia Sova, who was on the House payroll for a time, is <strong>Ukrainian.</strong></p>

            "On March 19, 2015, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and her Japanese counterpart Akie Abe announced a pledge “to strengthen bilateral cooperation in helping girls around the world receive an education, especially in developing countries.” The U.S. government will spend $250 million supporting girls’ education in the 2015-16 budget and the Japanese government will outlay $350 million or more under its Official Development Assistance (ODA) program during the next three years. According to the Japan Times, “Under the partnership, the Japan International Cooperation Agency… and the U.S. Peace Corps, both sending volunteers abroad, will formalize cooperation and ‘focus in particular on advancing girls’ education through cooperation on the ground in countries around the world.’”
           </p>
           <p>
            This effort represents a promising starting point for cross-sector cooperation among U.S. and Japanese aid agencies, companies, civil sectors, and local social entrepreneurs to create a “Collective Impact” on girls’ education in Asia. Moreover, this model could serve as a framework for additional U.S.-Japanese development collaboration utilizing cross-sectoral expertise in ways that benefits both countries."

             Thanks.  This one hit me hard; I don't know why but this logo got to me, even the "U" and the person with "a crown" on feels Satanic.  I really wanted to work hard on this post overall.  Who knows what's going on but I have a bad feeling.

             Kashmir is a muslim controlled part of India. Last year, Senator Schumer helped bring in a pedo-athlete from that region (circumventing Trump's immigrant visa ban).
            </p>
            <p>
             "Senator Chuck Schumer pulled visa strings for Indian snowshoe racer, 24, who 'sexually abused a 12-year-old girl' while in the US for a contest after initially being denied a visa
Tanveer Hussain, 24, has been arrested for allegedly touching the girl in an 'intimate area over her clothing' 
Senators Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand contacted the New Delhi embassy 
The senators' help allowed Hussain to get a visa to compete in the race
Police said the assault happened Monday in Saranac Lake, New York 
Abid Khan, a fellow snowshoer from Kashmir, said the girl followed him and Hussain around in 'an affectionate way' during their stay in the village"
            </p>
            <p>
             "Abid Khan, president of the Snowshoe Federation of India, said Hussain told him he is innocent. Khan also came to the village from Kashmir for the world championships but did not compete."

            He reportedly just met with John Kerry recently.
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             John Kerry, who served as secretary of state from 2013 to 2017 under the Obama administration, was allegedly seen meeting Iranian officials on May 12.
            </p>
            <p>
             Kerry was seen meeting with three Iranians with a five-man security detail, who were traveling in diplomatic vehicles, stated Jason Osborne on twitter. (He was former senior adviser to the Trump presidential campaign).
            </p>
            <p>
             So John Kerry just left a meeting @ L’Avenue in Paris w/3 Iranians. A friend was sitting next to their table and heard JK blasting
             <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/realDonaldTrump">
              @realDonaldTrump
             </a>
             . The Iranians had a 5 person security detail and left in diplomatic vehicles. Is he FARA registered?
            </p>
            <p>
             A follow-up tweet included images of the men who met with Kerry. One was former Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi, another appeared to be Iranian Ambassador to France Abolghassem Delfi, and the third was allegedly the director general of chairman’s office at the Tehran-based Strategic Council on Foreign Relations (SCFR), Abdolreza Faraji-Rad.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tweet from M. Hanif Jazayeri: "The one in front is certainly Kamal Kharazi (#Iran regime's FM from 1997-2005). The one behind the door looks very similar to Abolghassem Delfi (current Ambassador to France). See photos for comparison. Please bear in mind these ppl aren't diplomats. They're diplomat-terrorists." pic.twitter.com/4ZoSA9cyJ6

             I agree.  The cell phone threw me off.  I wonder what the person wearing the monkey costume is signing.  According to
             <a href="http://archive.is/m1uLE#selection-599.0-621.33">
              Wikipedia sign language varies in Pakistan,
             </a>
             but it's hard not to notice the possible "devil's horns" sign (or it's simply "I love you" in ASL.)  It's chilling to consider what might be going wrong there.

              SURYA OR RAVI MUDRA (SEAL OF SUN, LIFE)
How: Touch the tip of the ring (third) finger and the tip of thumb together. The other three fingers are straight.

              This apparently is one of 6 ancient hand gestures, and that is the description for the ring finger gesture.

            Umeed-e-Noor intends to provide the infrastructure and support necessary to meet the needs of special children, including a residential facility for them. Particular emphasis is placed on aiding children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds; early intervention services for babies and young children; programs that integrate all aspects of learning, including language, cognition, motor, self-help socialization and play skills; vocational and life skills training for special children; counseling and support services for parents; and raising awareness about special children in the community as a whole.
           </p>
           <p>
            It all sounds wonderful but all while reading it I know none of this will come about.  It will be the exact opposite.  When the Clintons say they are going to help children, they mean they are going to help themselves to the children.  This whole site sounds lovely and that's exactly what makes me sick.

             <p>
              The father of Imran Awan - a longtime IT aide from Pakistan who made "unauthorized access" to the House computer network - reportedly transferred a USB drive to the former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency, alleges the father's ex-business partner, Rashid Minhas.
             </p>
             <p>
              Minhas told the Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF) - which traveled to Pakistan to interview those involved - that Haji Ashraf Awan, Imran Awan's father, had been giving information to Rehman Malik - former head of Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and current senator. Malik was appointed to Interior Minister in early 2008, only to step down in 2013 after he lost a Supreme Court hearing over holding dual UK citizenship.

              </p>
              <p>
               Asked for how he knew this, he said that on one occasion in 2008 when a “USB [was] given to Rehman Malik by Imran’s father, my brother Abdul Razzaq was with his father.” -DCNF

            Of course, OP doesn't know what's going on here. If you've got a few minutes, I can explain it, so Western minds can get wrapped around it.
           </p>
           <p>
            First, Imran Awan, or better known in Pakistan as Asrraff Imran Awan. That's right; he bought himself a tribal chieftain's title in his warrior tribe. That's right; he's a muslim warlord. I'll bet you'll be surprised to learn it's also called the Awan Tribe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Wait what's going on here?
           </p>
           <p>
            Awan's not a family name, it's the name of an ancient tribe of killer's, smugglers &amp; white slavers. I shit you not! I'll wager, wife #2 the Ukrainian woman was purchased as a child bride.
These Awan's are another Eastern Asian ancient bloodline, which has bundled up local opium from Pakistan &amp; India for shipment by the British East India Company to China since 1718. Yup, this same tribe has been supplying the Queen of England's dope to China for hundreds of years. They created a nation of addicts cultivated by the British in China.
           </p>
           <p>
            Remember Gandhi? Yup, he was a sandles &amp; high fashion skinny, opium addict!
