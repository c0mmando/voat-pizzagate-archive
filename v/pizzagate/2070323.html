            Just because someone is Jewish and they are a bad person does mean those two things are correlated. I can think of at least one Jew that is not a bad person, therefore "all Jews are bad" = false.

            For some people, they just can't get enough violence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Plus, they somehow think that what they're doing today with hateful propaganda against
Jews is somehow different from what the Jewish Holocaust in Germany was all about -- 
or the 1,500 years of vile propaganda against the Jews by the Vatican which they spread
throughout the Papal States.
           </p>
           <p>
            Or maybe they just want to see another Jewish Holocaust ...  :(

            I obviously made this burner username to discuss this situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The biggest problem this subverse has is it's most active moderator Mil Falcon which was discussed at length in two threads that amounted to a mutiny by the posting voater community. Many of the posters actually believe that it is his intention to damage this subverse and make it ineffective.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            Considering Mil Falcon's moderation style it is understandable why do many have this opinion. The puzzling part of the equation is why Mil Falcon has the backing of the board owners for his obvious lack of mod skills at best, or intention to damage the sub-verse at worst. Regardless of which it is, it is obvious that he can and will do whatever he desires with zero regard for the posting rules unless he wants to use the posting rules in a weak and transparent attempt to justify his actions.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The best posters have mostly thrown in the towel for 1 reason and that reason is Mil Falcon, and the support he receives from the board owners. It is obvious that the posters that made this sub-verse what it once was no longer post much, if at all, because of Mil Falcon. Mil Falcon has crippled this sub-verse in such an obvious way that it cannot be denied.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            There is only one active mod that can change this destructive situation and that is
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/vindicator">
             @vindicator
            </a>
            , which is also obvious to the remaining posters.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            The posters wanted their minimum 100 point limit for down voating back and it went totally ignored as does all their other concerns.
           </p>
           <hr/>
           <p>
            If something doesn't change soon, very soon, its over for the sub-verse.

             Getting a sticky up for this is still on my to do list, I just haven't had time. Camping and boating peak season right now. :-)  We will get this rolling, but it might be a few weeks yet. Most people aren't on the board right now anyway (very low live user numbers lately). This is not a discussion we want to have when few are logged on.

            Jews should be gassed. We're going to do what Hitler didn't do, but should have done. This isn't violence, because we'll make it law. All Jews report to the showers.

            Jews are soulless and are responsible for all 100% of the suffering in the world. Including pizzagate.

            Its all part of the divide distract and conquer. Hence the predictable upswing in Gay &amp; Jew bashing. While people are busy bashing consider where Trump would be without the Jewish vote/ support, and how many Jews have been murdered fighting the Deep State.

            It's so fucking ridiculous. This kind of nonsensical/frequent posting re: anti-Semitic garbage, is EXACTLY what I've been predicting for months. I KNEW that this was shill bullshit. Specifically built up over time to discredit us retroactively.
           </p>
           <p>
            And now, look at what is happening... yet another race-baiting fury across all of the media. These fools are being put in place to erode the foundation of what we work for.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now we're seeing a flood of nonsense posts about nuke codes and all kinds of dumb stuff. Again, flooding with nonsense in an attempt to dilute the real content.
           </p>
           <p>
            If/when news breaks on Assange/Rhorbarach:
           </p>
           <p>
            "He reaffirmed his aggressive denial that the Russians had anything to do with the hacking of the DNC during the election," Rohrabacher told the Orange County Register about meeting with Assange. "He has given us a lot of information. He said there's more to come. We don't have the entire picture yet."
           </p>
           <p>
            News about Awan... who is likely being setup as the fall guy.
           </p>
           <p>
            News about HRC investigations, Comey, Lynch, unmasking, leaks, etc... ANYTHING of substance. And we will get immediately pounced on along w/ other informational/conversational sites. Citing the garbage posts to undermine legitimate info.

             Some may be shills and some may be for real. The ones who are for real are taking individual data points and the opaque nature of power and extrapolating with greater confidence than anyone should ever be certain about.

              Agreed. Some may be legit, but the trend is picking up speed at an alarming pace. Almost as if it was coordinated alongside the media barrage of hyper-racism now that RussiaGate is DOA. A sad, pathetic group of charlatans the Elite have become. Focused only on hiding from the public while leveraging the weak-minded sheep to perpetuate a non-existent divide to divert attention even further away.

            In fact israel did that at least twice, including killing american sailors.  And they make hundreds of holocaust films a year. So way to play their game, asshole

              Who said anything about white elites? Jesus, drop the tribalism. It's not white vs non-white, that's not the world. It's not jew vs gentile. It's not man vs woman, it's have vs have not - that's how it's always been and how it always will be.

               Meanwhile, as I've pointed our frequently, our Founders immediately betrayed us in creating an Elite patriarchy, endowed them with land grants and gave them immense influence and control over our "people's" government, the nation's wealth and natural resources.
               <br/>
               All while proclaiming "All are equal."

              <p>
               The Founders also saved and protected the system of Slavery for Elite/wealthy which also guaranteed the Civil War which further benefitted Elites by splitting the population into two camps of hatred which continue to echo today across the nation.

            Jews are the cancer of the West. The harm they have done to the West is beyond calculation. They are responsible for international communism which has killed countless millions, and which was the cause for the rise of the Nazis in Germany, and hence for WW2. The founding of Israel has thrown the entire Middle East into perpetual turmoil and has given rise to modern terrorism, all caused by the Jews. We won't even mention the harm they have done brainwashing white Christian children into hating their own race through their almost total control over the media in most Western countries, or their continuing promotion of violent liberal fascism, or their corruption of our universities, which have turned into cesspools of idiocy, or their control over the pornography industry which has arguably done more harm than anything else, by destroying morality, marriage, the desire to have children, and the family unit.

             If anything, capitalists invented communism in hopes that no one would notice what capitalists were actually doing in stealing land and natural resources.

             Didn't know either that all of our Presidents of the US had been Jewish -- 
Or that Jews were the invaders of this land and killed 112 million native people here for their land.
Nor did I know that our Founders were Jews who saved the system of Slavery for Elites/wealthy.
Or that it was the Jews who brought out the 200,000 ex-Nazis through Vatican rat lines and the GOLD
in order to ensure the Rise of the Fourth Reich.

             Actually, I didn't even know that any of the Popes were Jewish ... but I do recall the history of the Inquisition.

             Don't know what garbage can you're getting your news out of, but it was American Elites who worked to re-arm Germany and they worked with international Elites through front companies to fund Hitler.  Many American capitalists and corporations profited from selling arms and materials to Hitler.
And shipping GOLD to Hitler.  Allen Dulles and Prescott Bush were very involved in this treason.
Dulles was turning in the Americans dollars for GOLD in order to ship it to Hitler.
See:

**&gt;The Guardian has obtained confirmation from newly discovered files in the US National Archives that a firm of which Prescott Bush was a director was involved with the financial architects of Nazism.

              His business dealings, which continued until
              <strong>
               his company's assets were seized in 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act,
              </strong>
              has led more than 60 years later to a civil action for damages being brought in Germany against the Bush family by two former slave labourers at Auschwitz and to a hum of pre-election controversy.

             The Catholic Church has also been called to confess to its co-responsibility for the Jewish Holocaust in Germany due to its 1,100 years of holding Jews in Jewish Ghettoes, isolating them from society, barring them from education and the professions and their vile propaganda against Jews which hatred they spread throughout the Papal States.

             i realized that its because their book, the real interpretation says that once all people join their religion, and we are all doing and thinking the same thing, we'll return our homeland or something. i think it explains why everyone should be
             <em>
              cultured
             </em>
             and immigration is always the issue for any country, plus banking.
            </p>
            <p>
             they are using cultralism as a way to merge people to follow their religion, secretly.

             i think it's why communism, progress, and overall new education is always stopped. or maybe people are just really dumb and lazy, and this is all greek crowd control.

              The largest issue in the creation of refugees fleeing their own countries is the war mongering by the US and the US/CIA's illegal wars of aggression throughout the Middle East.
             </p>
             <p>
              Not to mention that the US now has Russia pretty much surrounded by NATO ... and fairly close to China, as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              US is responsible for the creation of "terrorism" and the hopes of a new Cold War in order to keep the profits from these wars high and MIC going.
             </p>
             <p>
              US has done everything they can to disrupt the Middle East and control their OIL.
             </p>
             <p>
              US/CIA also created the original situation which "baited" the Russians into Afghanistan ... "in hopes of giving them a Vietnam-type experience."  US put troops into Afghanistan six months before the Russians entered in order to "bait the Russians into Afghanistan."
             </p>
             <p>
              US/CIA has also worked to create a more VIOLENT Islamic religion and what we saw of children in Afghanistan reading VIOLENT passages from religious books -- and we saw this over and over again on our TV's -- were being read from books written, created, and shipped into the ME by the US/CIA.

             </p>
             <p>
              Washington Post investigators report that during the past twenty years the US has spent millions of dollars producing fanatical schoolbooks, which were then distributed in Afghanistan.
             </p>
             <blockquote>
              <p>
               **Have you heard about the US/CIA Afghan Jihad schoolbook scandal?
**They also spent millions producing jihad preaching, fundamentalist textbooks and shipping them off to Afghanistan. These were the same text books the Western media discussed in shocked tones and told their audiences were used by fundamentalist teachers to brainwash their charges and to inculcate in young Afghanis a jihad mindset, hatred of foreigners and non-Muslims etc.
"The primers, which were filled with talk of jihad and featured drawings of guns, bullets, soldiers and mines, have served since then as the Afghan school system's core curriculum. Even the Taliban used the American-produced books..." -- Washington Post, 23 March 2002 (1)

             <p>
              From the very beginning to the very end, a lying and corrupt US government has betrayed the citizens of the US.  Beyond that, they seem to be completely insane in their obsession for Empire and warmongering.

               why would any part of US/CIA continue, knowing it's public knowledge to some degree, orchestrating events the force people together and keep squeezing nations into closer

                proximity
               </em>

               it's built into their paradigm of life. catholics wip each other, jews guilt the shit out of each with false narratives and stories of bs.
              </p>
              <p>
               it's a clear assault on individuation at any level. false dichotomies for religious motivation.
however, yes—I understand there real evil-doers with nothing to gain but more power, as well.
but the tug between factions is obvious.

                Who does US/CIA work for .... other than Elites who the Founders actually put in power?
               </p>
               <p>
                Like UFO's and coups, if there is evidence that proves anything like Roswell or 9/11, it is usually in the hands of those who put the false flag events in play or who handle the cover ups.
               </p>
               <p>
                And, the idea that "refugees" are simply immigrants doesn't hold water.  They are fleeing war not seeking a new country.
               </p>
               <p>
                The reality of 9/11 was that the WTC towers were going to have to be brought done due to Asbestos and it would have to be done with scaffolding and taken down as they were put up, piece by piece.
                <br/>
                Very expensive deal but it has been done in Manhattan.  NO demolition was to be allowed.
               </p>
               <p>
                And -- That's how Asbestos and Empire and desire for war on Iraq and wider wars in Middle East all came together.

             Well said but dont forget the worst of all: they opposed the immigration restrictions hard until the jew Jacob Javits of NY pushed thru the 1965 law to bring in peoples known to have much higher birthrates than natives, while saying it wouldnt change the demographics of the country!

              Your library is democratic socialism -- so is your Post Office (aside from the GOP efforts to destroy it) ...
and so is public education - Medicare.

              The original NAZI socialist organization which Hitler took over was originally a LIBERAL organization supporting LABOR, labor unions, health care for the public, worker safety, women's rights, abortion.
All of that was turned upside down by Hitler when he took over the organization.

              Nor does democratic socialism have anything to do with Russia or communism (which basically has never been practiced anywhere by anyone).......

                Evidently you have no idea that the Post Office was mandated by the Constitution...
or the fact that the GOP has done everything it can to destroy it over decades ....

                 <strong>
                  The Postal Service Is Near Death and You Can Thank the Republicans
                 </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                 There’s a really dirty war going on behind the scenes between the Postal Service and the right-wing. In the land of despicable Republican political practices I don’t think I find anything more despicable than what the GOP is already doing to the nation’s postal employees. Taking full advantage of an errant legislative move nearly 7 years ago before things collapsed completely, Congress brought us the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (PAEA) by unidentifiable voice vote. That precipitated the current crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This act called for the pre-funding in the course of a mere decade of some 75 years of retiree health care benefits, decimating the USPS budget. Without that ridiculous politicized mandate the Postal Service would be running a surplus today. Some 4 out of every 5 dollars of postal debt can be tracked to PAEA.

                If the Post Office was actually allowed to compete with FedEx and UPS, those private companies wouldn't exist.

                      Trust that more Voat posters will be "reporting" these posts
and if Voat and/or the Mods don't take action against these posters
who are calling for the MURDER of Jews then I think any and all of 
these posters and their posts should be reported to the FCC.

                       Unfortunately I don't think you'll have much luck with that.  The mods here are Nazis:
