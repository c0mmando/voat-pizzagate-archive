            If we can be very specific with each post and see what attracts them. Identify them but don't ban then, start tagging them and keep them busy af, but how do we deal with the human shills. And I would imagine there are humans behind an army of bots to keep the bots corrected.
           </p>
           <p>
            How about rewarding productive posters and productive supporters with credits and identified bots and shills can be restricted as apposed to banned, that way they don't just create new accounts. Like the way twitter and facebook shadow ban us.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is a risky compromise to free speech but it isn't much different than maintaining national security. This is a real and very serious investigation and steps need to be taken to protect it.

            That's funny I thought people here were individuals who tossing out their own thoughts and just trying to see what stuck to the wall.

            R U saying the the PEDO-DOLLAR is not real?
           </p>
           <p>
            The CTR-BOTS have points they are down-voating such as yourself, the humans have no points they can't down-voat.
           </p>
           <p>
            1,000's of people during the past month have tried to rename pizzagate to pedogate, so what? Sounds like Concerned-Trolling?
           </p>
           <p>
            We have moved on BOTS, us humans are now talking about PEDO-DOLLAR's, how USGOV supply's children to saudi as sex slaves in return for the USDollar to be Saudi oil4fiat.
           </p>
           <p>
            I suggest if BOTS
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
             /v/pizzagate
            </a>
            want to be johnny-on-the-spot  they add  the keyword 'PEDO-DOLLAR' to their witch-hunt algo to find the humans still lurking on this sub.
           </p>
           <p>
            Good luck bots, you need it I understand Brock is out of Bitcoins.
