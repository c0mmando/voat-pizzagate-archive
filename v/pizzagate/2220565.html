<p>According to wikipedia A Madman\'s Diary is a short story published in 1918 by Lu Xun, a Chinese writer. It was the first and most influential modern work written in vernacular Chinese in the republican era, and would become a cornerstone piece of the New Culture Movement. It is placed first in Call to Arms, a collection of short stories by Lu Xun. The story was often referred to as &quot;China\'s first modern short story&quot;.[1] This book was selected as one of the 100 best books in history by the Bokklubben World Library.</p>
<p>The story is the diary of man who finds out his whole village is populated by cannibals and he is being stigmatized as paranoid or crazy. Take note that it is explained in the preface that the character he has recovered from his craziness and has gone elswhere to take an official post. So, strangely the paranoid man, was promoted to a job right after his psychotic episode?</p>
<p>I believe that there is a hidden message inside this story. The author is urging us to read between the lines much like main character.</p>
<p><em>I read intently half the night, until I began to see words between the lines, the whole book being filled with the two words—&quot;Eat people.</em></p>
<p>In the story, the main character little sister was killed to be eaten to aid his mother sickness.</p>
<p>Take a look at this. Exactly what they do to us everytime. They can either label us as crazy or conspiracy theorists. Remember yesterday Podesta\'s &quot;pizza gate crazies&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Then I realized part of their cunning. They would never be willing to change their stand, and their plans were all laid; they had stigmatized me as a madman. In future when I was eaten, not only would there be no trouble, but people would probably be grateful to them. When our tenant spoke of the villagers eating a bad character, it was exactly the same device. This is their old trick&quot;</em></p>
<p>Take a look at this dialogue. It speaks about secrecy as a main directive in (((them)))</p>
<p><em>What am I talking about? They are eating men now in Wolf Cub Village, and you can see it written all over the books, in fresh red ink.</em>
**His expression changed, and he grew ghastly pale. &quot;It may be so,&quot; he said, staring at me. &quot;It has always been like that. . . **</p>
<p><em>&quot;Is it right because it has always been like that?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I refuse to discuss these things with you. Anyway, you shouldn\'t talk about it. Whoever talks about it is in the wrong!</em>*</p>
<p>And then it continues to state how they are taught from a very young age to cannibalism <em>&quot;He was much younger than my elder brother, but even so he was in it. He must have been taught by his parents. And I am afraid he has already taught his son: that is why even the children look at me so fiercely.&quot;</em></p>
<p>A portent of the future.Take note that the village where they live is called Wolf Cub Village. 
&quot;<em>If you don\'t change, you may all be eaten by each other. Although so many are born, they will be wiped out by the real men, just like wolves killed by hunters. Just like reptiles!..You should change at once, change from the bottom of your hearts! You must know that in future there will be no place for man-eaters in the world . . .&quot;</em></p>
<p>The last line of the story will send shivers to each of us in this forum. This is why we must persist in our cause.
<em>Perhaps there are still children who have not eaten men? Save the children. . . .</em></p>
<p>I have found that both history and literature is full of references both to (((them))) and to their practices. I have also found that there is always an intention to keep the truth hidden &quot;between the lines&quot;. As if it was only right to expose the truth to some selected few. I have not only seen this done by (((them))) but also by writers which i deem good guys so i can only presume there is a good reason to share this knowledge to the common public.</p>
<p>I have even seen this bluntly written in the Dead Sea Scrolls. At this moment i am bit agitated by so much information but i am willing to share some of my findings if there is any interest. I feel that giving everything away might be counterproductive at the moment. I ask everyone to please share this story and relate it to Pizzagate and the cannibal pedo elite.</p>',

            Very interesting.  I was recently reading the Nag Hammadi Library manuscripts, and they warn of the Rulers and Authorities.  I think that people knew back then.,,  Can you please share links to the relevant portions of the Dead Sea Scrolls?  I am not surprised there are warnings in here, too.

              I have heard "vine tree" mentioned in other posts.  I will have to look that up again.  I recall there was a discussion here about it.

               From Wikipedia: Ambrosia is sometimes depicted in ancient art as distributed by a nymph labeled with that name.[3] In the myth of Lycurgus, an opponent to the wine god Dionysus, violence committed against Ambrosia turns her into a grapevine.

               One word of advice. Be absolutely certain that Kabbalah is Satanic and Satanism is Evil against Mankind. If you start to disgress, dont let any new knowledge disgress you from that certainty. I hope you bear this advice seriously.

                Yes!  Thank you for the warning.  I am an Atheist, so hopefully that will protect me from falling to the dark side.  It is like these people are a virus on humanity.

            You might really be on to something here.  The also have been accused of hiding in plain sight.  So why not hide  their antics and nasty habits between the lines.  Also, hiding behind writings that most people may not even be aware of.  I would not be surprised if they found one of these books in our library that they would ban it.  They are into banning books now that will expose their sins of the past and the coming future.

              What a wack job story and this time it seems we do not have to even read between the lines.  They come right out with the dirty disgusting deed.   Also I think when using ((them))  we should think of the cabal not Jews.  Stupid thinking.  They are all doing it and they are not all Jews.  Besides they are Kazarians, not real Jews.

Though they do usually hide behind the jew elite and LGBT movements.

                I know that whenever I asked what it meant people would tell me it was code for Jews.  Stupid, is how people that imply that are.  We that now the history of the Kazars/Kazarians, no that is poppycock.  We need to post that more often on here.  I did not go to college, but had an interest in World History but did not know of them.  I do remember though that at one time the King of Spain drove out a whole tribe of what the book called "Jews".  Maybe that was the Kazarians, idk.  I really should look that up.  The books of the 40s and 50s probably had more truth than our history books they are doctoring up for our kids now.
