<p>I attended a class today on preventing sexual abuse of children and one of the officers in a film we were shown was stating that child porn can include images of children while they are wearing clothes if the footage is focused on the genitals in any way, whether clothes are there or not. Examples he gave included while the children were wearing wet clothing. This would mean that Greg Chism\'s videos depicting Annabelle peeing on herself constitutes child porn because he zoomed in on the pee spot on her clothing as she crawled away from the camera while shaking her butt (like a stripper on stage would do). </p>
<p>It would also mean that his zooming in on the genitals from behind during the videos where they were going down a slide of some sort would possibly constitute child porn. (This was something I read about from another article about the videos but I didn\'t personally watch the video of him zooming in on them while they went down the slide) </p>
<p>In my opinion the video in which Annabelle peed on herself was likely depicting her in a drugged state. </p>
<p>In my opinion the &quot;spit up&quot; she was forced to make on her sister\'s shoulder at the end of the video looked like semen.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a video called pool party / pools in the house, or the video of the girls in their swimwear in the shower might also fall under the definition since they were in wet clothing and we know that the intent was obviously to get pedophiles to the channel to look. This is clear child exploitation.</p>
<p>This is not meant to be an all inclusive argument but more of an afterthought. Obviously there was plenty of other evidence against him all over his gross channel. This is just a side note on the definition of child porn including zooming in on the genitals even if clothed, or if the clothing is see through or wet while zooming in. I believe they also count the breasts as areas that they can include as sexually exploitative if someone is zooming in on the boobs of an underage girl on film in a sexually suggestive way. Especially in a wet bathing suit.  
</p>
<p>It\'s unfathomable to me how the law enforcement and CPS where Chism lives can\'t figure this out. Obviously he must be a protected individual, most likely in the CIA or something. </p>

<p>Images of child pornography are not protected under First Amendment rights, and are illegal contraband under federal law. Section 2256 of Title 18, United States Code, defines child pornography as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor (someone under 18 years of age).  Visual depictions include photographs, videos, digital or computer generated images indistinguishable from an actual minor, and images created, adapted, or modified, but appear to depict an identifiable, actual minor.  Undeveloped film, undeveloped videotape, and electronically stored data that can be converted into a visual image of child pornography are also deemed illegal visual depictions under federal law.</p>
<pre><code>       Notably, the legal definition of sexually explicit conduct does not require that an image depict a child engaging in sexual activity.  A picture of a naked child may constitute illegal child pornography if it is sufficiently sexually suggestive.

            Under these definitions then several of the pictures and comments on the Alefantis instagram could be considered child porn. The #chickenlover pic , the "Why does daddy like butt?" pic for sure.

             The emphasis was how it would be sexually suggestive because of zooming in on the child's genitals or private parts. I don't think those zoomed in on genitals, but they are definitely suggestive. A CPS worker I talked to said it gets really confusing how you define child porn in many legit cases of child porn where a child might be naked. I think that the law enforcement tends to under-enforce in this area sadly. I overheard some things at court the other day that tended to suggest police won't make an arrest if the perp isn't actively abusing children himself in addition to possessing child pornography, but then again, it's possible that I misheard that.

              Yeah, there's also the desensitizing effect LEOs go through. If you're exposed to hardcore material for very long making busts, you're not as likely to think a girl in a wet swimsuit is worth pursuing, if that's all you've got. Too many other serious cases out there.

               It's highly possible that even though there aren't criminal proceedings in this matter, that CPS still became involved with this family and has intervened in someway. CPS involvement is considered a civil matter and is completely separate and not dependent on criminal proceedings. So essentially CPS can make a substantiation of abuse or neglect against this guy and it wouldn't go through the criminal system. It also means that we as the public wouldn't be informed of the case or what is going on.
              </p>
              <p>
               Hopefully they did step in to investigate and ensure the girls are ok, but we as the public will likely never know the outcome unless the CPS case turns into a termination of parental rights case. At that time it would partially become public record.

                Good info.  I too hope they've intervened, because with Chism not being charged, it seems likely he'll try again with the videos once the dust settles unless someone stops him.  Does CPS have the legal power to prevent him from using the kids again in videos?

                 I think that might be a question for an actual licensed attorney but I would assume that he is not stupid enough to try that again on YouTube. If I were working for CPS and on his case I might tell him to stop, but I think normally they have a certain time frame in which to close a case, or offer services. So if his case is closed then they're not theoretically monitoring him any more.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The cops might be monitoring him, but if he did start making videos again, then someone could call CPS again. I called them twice.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As an aside,it was interesting that they mentioned in the MSM pieces that he was reported for possibly having a missing kid, but that the MSM chose not to name who the missing kid is. I wonder how hard it would be for Voat researchers to locate a good email address or phone number for Lisa's parents?

             and we both feel that the Wonderland Club Operation never died.  It was located in St. Charles Mo.  It was part of Operation Cathedral with the US part of the CP operation being in St. Charles.  There was a raid and some were arrested but it was a very lucrative business.  I feel they never quite shut it down.  There are also quite a few people living in the St. Charles area and surrounding area by the name of Chism.  Possibly someone in his family has the same interests, or is helping him.  That area also has a lot of LE Protection..

              I read something the other day on George Webb's twitter referencing something about St. Louis being a hotbed for the ratlines / trafficking and CIA headquarters but I don't remember which project specifically. That whole area seems to be a kidnapping Mecca. The cops there could easily be covering for him.

              My "interactions" with him (or what seems like him) online, including the recent ones where extremely threatening messages were sent included that they would "see me at the mill" and a link to the Pelter SC blog. I assume this means he is in the Finders Cult or something like it, or that he wants me to think he is, or that someone wants me to think he is.

The other video in that story turned out to be a  hoax according to the person who sent it to me (Bryon Adams), but it contained links to someone's Twitter page that had copies of handwriting that looks exactly like my ex husband's.

              The Richard Dickeson account has a graphic depiction of a dead man in a pool of blood in a hospital bathroom. I reported to Facebook and I was told it did not violate the community standards. Several of my friends on Facebook claimed he was  sending them threatening messages, then a few of them changed their names, unfriended, and blocked me which leads me to believe these so-called friends were troll accounts or cointelpro.

              Messages include "good children like to poop and die" and "I'd fuck that in the ass hell yeah" (referencing the dead body) and "sexy I'm cumming to this right now"

              He now has one friend and it appears to be an account that is exhibiting photos of underage children who appear to be in exploitative situations.

              I reported that to the FBI.
             </p>
             <p>
              The articles written by Buzzfeed and the Daily Mail and others were all released on nearly the exact same day, as though a propaganda press release had been finalized and approved. This was soon after someone retaliated at me by calling CPS on me claiming that my research was endangering my children. That is cleared up now, but I am still getting occasional threats and weird comments.
             </p>
             <p>
              No matter how many times I file a follow up report with FBI nothing ever seems to happen.

              The articles that came out had so many obvious false excuses in them for why law enforcement wasn't prosecuting, like claiming that they couldn't pin an exploitative video on him because it was filmed in a different house or apartment from the one he just moved to a few months ago. It's like they are laughing at how many people will accept that fake story. Maybe there are only a few people who were on to him and it's those of us who are weak and not in any form of power.

              Then right after he scrubbed his channel the Google CEO resigned and Rhett &amp; Link made fun of the "epidemic of unboxing toys in kids' videos on youtube" in a skit called Spa Trip where they drink urine and get hooked up to a matrix of sorts. The next episode, they eat alien poop. Long story.

              I'm super happy though that the cancer channel is gone. I just hope someone besides the obviously fake ass law enforcement community who thinks we will believe that Annabelle wasn't Lisa Irwin because reasons has saved some of those cipher codes from the comments section on Toy Freaks, so that eventually someone will figure out everything that they were doing when they communicated. And by that, I mean I hope someone saved the earlier cipher codes from the comments section, and not just the ones at the end that were all being put on there to specifically troll me. That is all.

               The LE group that worked on the Jane Doe case in St. Louis I feel did something so stupid that no LEO in his right mind would do investigating a case.  They sent a vital piece of evidence out to someone through the mail.  I have felt all along that this was done on purpose to send it to the criminal or to just get it lost.  That area is rife for CP sex trafficking and organ harvesting.  I am very sure that he has hooked up with those that have continued the CP Operation they thought they took down.  It is still going on somewhere.  I can feel it, just knowing what I researched.  There are too many as you say rat lines and people working them like the Archdiocese of St. Louis, St. John Vianney where all the priest abusers are sent and is more like a Club Med.  The priests still look at CP on their computers there.  That whole area is a Cesspool and I believe it is all protected by LE.
