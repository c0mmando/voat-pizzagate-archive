<p>I will be brief and to the point. The movie was analysed by recently murdered Tracy Twyman though she missed some hints.</p>
<p>Kinderman to his police colleague: I cannot believe you just said that. What kind of a world is this? Are you an animal? Do you know what Macbeth is about? I\'ll tell you. It\'s a play about the numbing of the moral sense. I tell Ryan that we have nothing to go on in this case. You know what he says to me? &quot;Win some, lose some.&quot; You\'re a racist, Ryan. Did you know that?</p>
<p>On the entrance exam for new policemen, they ask, &quot;What are rabies and what would you do for them?&quot; Ryan said, &quot;Rabies are Jewish priests and I would do anything I possible could for them.&quot;</p>
<p>Kinderman jokes with his priest friend &quot;do you want to fund the order of lurking fathers?&quot;</p>
<p>Kinderman warns her daughter when she goes out &quot;Beware of red shoes&quot; Remember Podesta red shoes? In a scene later a woman with a strange witch costume and red shoes hands a priest speech.</p>
<p>Father Joseph Dyer:&quot; I once spent a year hearing childrens\'s confessions and I wound up a lemon drop junkie. The little wierdos keep breathing it on you along with all that pot. And between the two of them, I\'ve got a feeling it\'s probably addictive&quot;</p>
<p>Also, when a nurse enters the wrong room on the hospital she says she was going to 409 but this is 411. 9/11 Remember Polanski 9th gate?</p>
<p>Tracy Twyman Quote: What you need to understand is that, in the OTO’s structure, they “officially” kind of skip over the 10th degree. The ninth degree is, according to several sources, dedicated to vaginal sex magick mysteries, including the consumption of menstrual blood. The eleventh degree is about “Crossing the Abyss,” as I mentioned. These are sex rituals involving sodomy, killing your own “personality” to make room for the rebirth of your “Holy Guardian Angel” (allegedly your higher self), and then landing safely on the other side of the Abyss, if you’re lucky. It is implied that not every person who goes through this ritual comes out sane or fully functioning.</p>
<p>Watch the movie. Find Tracys analysis of it. Gemini Killer is 11, twins, these are the pillars of creation which they seek to destroy through their abominations.</p>',
