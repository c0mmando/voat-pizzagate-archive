<p>Tracy Twyman Quote: What you need to understand is that, in the OTO’s structure, they “officially” kind of skip over the 10th degree. The ninth degree is, according to several sources, dedicated to vaginal sex magick mysteries, including the consumption of menstrual blood. The eleventh degree is about “Crossing the Abyss,” as I mentioned. These are sex rituals involving sodomy, killing your own “personality” to make room for the rebirth of your “Holy Guardian Angel” (allegedly your higher self), and then landing safely on the other side of the Abyss, if you’re lucky. It is implied that not every person who goes through this ritual comes out sane or fully functioning.</p>
<p>Watch the movie. Find Tracys analysis of it. Gemini Killer is 11, twins, these are the pillars of creation which they seek to destroy through their abominations.</p>',
