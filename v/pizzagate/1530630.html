            ahem - Puello is NOT an attorney. Now the REAL (actual) Puello is, but this clown wasn't that. He had borrowed someone else's identity (an attorney's), and was using an alias at the time. I think its likely that Clinton's State Dept put the ass-clown fake lawyer and Silsby together, though I can't prove that - yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            His actual name is Jorge Torres. Torres is a felon, and convicted child and human trafficker himself, and was wanted for trafficking in El Salvador at the same time he was "defending" Silsby in Haiti - that's why I believe he was "set on" to Silsby, he owed State Dept some favors, and State coudl "pay him in kids", thus keeping with no money trail leading directly back to Clinton - even though dozens of email updates on Silsby's situation from Huma to Clinton exist.

            I wonder if there are reports in Haiti's press about the Silsby situation, and it would probably be in French but who knows where you'd find it.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also wonder if there are some revelations in the court transcripts, if Haiti even has such a thing. I just can't trust any of the sources that have searchable online reports on this. Especially after reading the bio of family members. The father has the most left-connected bio I've ever read.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if some of the msm reports sound mildly critical, that would be necessary to make readers feel that they are getting a balanced report.
           </p>
           <p>
            One thing I'd want to know right away: did the Silsby group use pseudonyms and fake addresses when they gave contact information to the parents who gave them the children?

            Perhaps if there really was some shady doings, Silsby or whoever changed the story to not implicate the Friends of the Orphans.

            This was already addressed, but I'm not sure if it was deleted. Max Maccoby, who is connected with Friends of the Orphans, was also the Alefantis &amp; Brocks attorney.

            I think this kind of peer checking and questioning is very important. There is a lot of information coming out and sometimes the conclusions we reach seem a bit of a stretch given the sources. Going back over key points like this and solidifying the case will only make it stronger and more convincing for the public.
