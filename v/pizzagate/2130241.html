          <p>
           <p>
            I'm a fan of Alex Jones, despite what his detractors say.  I saw this clip today and it was one of the strongest attacks that I've ever seen Alex Jones make on the pedophilia that we hate.  He went full on anti-Satanic pedo.  Good stuff!
           </p>
           <p>
            For those who I think I'm a knucklehead for liking Alex Jones, I'm a highly educated person (doctoral degree) who's surrounded by a number of other highly educated individuals (doctoral degrees).
           </p>
           <p>
            Notwithstanding our expensive and time-consuming educations, and despite our respective workloads, we listen to Alex Jones regularly and appreciate his efforts.  I know the detractors have plenty to say about him so I won't address that here.  I happen to know that nobody is perfect and I'm sure Alex Jones makes mistakes and crosses the line from time to time.  But every little bit helps, and he does much more than a little bit!  He actually changed my life because he, alone, first opened my eyes to the world beyond television and mainstream media propaganda.
           </p>
           <p>
            To me, that's worth something. I give Alex Jones the credit. To be honest, he first won me over when he ranted against Piers Morgan on the issue of guns. My name is Second Amendment.  Go figure.  So I first sought him out to hear more of his views on the right to bear arms in this country, and then I stayed for the rest and kept learning each day.
           </p>
           <p>
            Why I like him is that he has taught me so much and inspired me to study, on my own, and to keep learning more. He has inspired me to do more research and he is the only one out there making some of the bold claims that he makes. He invites guests on his show that the MSM refuses to touch and, by doing so, he has opened my mind up to everything related to my red-pilling.  I have listened to him for only a couple of years. I feel sorry that I did not know about him sooner but, to be honest, I never owned a smartphone until about 2 years ago. I use an old desktop computer with no audio. I just didn't have any way to hear him until recently. I'm glad I found him because he's  opened my eyes to what is going on behind the scenes.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope the Alex Jones  detractors will lighten up a bit because for people who are only now discovering these horrors (like I was a couple of years ago)  Alex Jones is a great opening act.  He's passionate, entertaining, ballsy as hell, and devoted to Christ. That means something to me, especially in the thick cloud of spiritual warfare against the darkness of Satanic pedophiles.
           </p>
           <p>
            So bottom line?  This video has some good stuff on it.  Good job, Alex Jones, and thank you for posting,

             I could write something similar to this. How I came to Alex Jones was on the issue of the Democrats rigging the primary. I stayed because Alex Jones demonstrated that he has real sources -- the Secret Service warned him that Hillary has Parkinson's, and that was certainly borne out by subsequent events.
            </p>
            <p>
             He has many faults, and makes a lot of mistakes, and has some dreadful guests at times. But there is no other channel for some of the things that he talks about. Nobody else comes close.

             Upvoated, thanks for this.
