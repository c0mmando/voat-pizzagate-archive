            This is from another post:
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me add this. Look at my attached graphic. The "realtor" market tries to maximize the "value" of the house when listing them. Realtors will advertise a basement as a second story. The difference is that the DC tax assessor does not recognize finished or unfinished basements as taxable property, so the tax assessment will state 1 story. If you look at the graphic, there are some very obviously 1 story buildings next to CPP. The tax assessor lists these other locations as 1-story, yet the realtor (propertyshark.com) website "markets" it as a two story, because it has a basement. If the building had 2 stories above grade, the tax assessor would assess it as a 2-story building and the realtor would market it as a 3-story building. [sorry, not listing citations, but this is all verifiable data]

             No thats brilliant information to know why all would be listed as 2 floor on the realty sites, when they clearly dont have a 2nd floor. Bucks is the lemon though it HAS to have a 2nd floor based on the square footage.

              If you look at aerial imagery, you will see bucks is about 30-40% wider than CPP or LRF.  I think that's where the additional SF comes from:

            This needs to be looked into. There has to be traces of children if they were there (basement). DNA and such. Police should swab their walk in cooler for human blood. That big walk-in cooler is where they gut and kill the children to prep them for cooking.

              There has to be DNA evidence somewhere. They scrubbed that walk in cooler pretty clean. They're confident enough to be blunt about it.

            Sorry if my comment here is a little bit off the main search for details of a possible basement at CPP, but in looking around for related info I've had quite an education on subterranean Washingon DC.  I'm not familiar with the city and perhaps the following is already known to many but it was new to me and certainly put the whole tunnel thing into perspective for me:*
           </p>
           <p>
            I came across this interesting article
            <a href="http://untappedcities.com/2014/07/25/the-underground-city-beneath-the-u-s-capitol-and-library-of-congress/">
             The Underground City beneath the US Capital and Library of Congress
            </a>
            which includes a brief summary of the layout of the various tunnels.  Cannon Tunnel caught my eye because of the children's art on the walls and following the link to the Congressional Art Competition was instructive too.  This year's winner from District 7 can be seen here :
            <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cannon+tunnel+washington&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1229&amp;bih=589&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI4eK4ldjQAhUC0hoKHbZrB60QsAQIQg&amp;dpr=1.56#imgrc=oiqsMPjpXG-rnM%3A">
             District 7 winner
            </a>
            .*
           </p>
           <p>
            More information on the various tunnels can be found in
            <a href="http://thehill.com/capital-living/cover-stories/80433-an-a-mazing-guide">
             An A-mazing Guide
            </a>
            .  Definitely worth a read.  Including titbits like the newest tunnel addition which is the Capitol Visitor Center basement which is split into 3 floors.  The first floor is reserved for member meetings that require privacy and is also the U.S. Capitol Police’s new home base. *
           </p>
           <p>
            I never realized that Washingtonians spent so much time underground.

             Interestingly from a PM from someone who didnt want their name on this apparently "They were first dug out to be used to connect the ring of Forts that surrounded DC during the Civil war." - though I have not yet had any time to verify any details on this. So there tunnels, old tunnels, older tunnels and really old tunnels.

             Underpinning can be necessary for such projects but that's hardly the only reason!   You can add underpinning to a foundation of a building with no basement as well

             Is there any info that there is a second story to these as opposed to a basement? Looks like all three are listed as two story incl Little Red Fox

              Someone posted a thread yesterday explaining how property details were listed during the days of the prohibition.  I'll try to find it. Apparently most properties of that era did have a basement.
