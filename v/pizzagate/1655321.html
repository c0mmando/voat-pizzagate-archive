            How people can actually believe he sings "I'm John Podesta" just blows my mind. It's beyond ridiculous. Apart from the fact that it sounds
            <em>
             nothing
            </em>
            like it, why the hell would he even sing that? Also he sounds nothing like him in that particular clip, it's a completely different person. The other one sounds somewhat like him but is still sketchy at best. Skippy? Don't hear it. John? Only when I'm
            <em>
             told
            </em>
            what to hear. This whole thing reminds me of the 80s when backmasking was a thing.

            It doesn't sound
            <strong>
             exactly
            </strong>
            like Podesta to me. There is something more disturbing happening. The voice
            <strong>
             has the same unique stutter
            </strong>
            as Podesta, but is a more deranged version of him. Would make sense if this "skippy" is an autonomous personality inside him that can take over at times.
           </p>
           <p>
            To verify the unique stutter: play the audio on slow speed. Collect all the moments of "Skippy" stuttering. Especially when he pronounces the 'whaa wha' sounds for words that begin with 'w'. Then compare that stutter with John's stuttering of 'whaa wha' in interviews over the years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having said that, it is not obvious to me that the child is shouting "skippy."  But on careful listening with headphones, with confirmation bias removed, whatever the child says does seem to have an 'sk' sound, as opposed to the earlier occurrence of 'John.'
           </p>
           <p>
            And then there is the unusual upstairs area of comet, the bass, and the flickering and coloring of the strobe both matching to comet. Very weird stuff. I'm not going to say anything for sure yet. But I would not completely rule it out.

             It sounds like Podesta, similar lights to CPP, and
             <em>

             </em>
             she pronounced a "sk-"

             <p>
              It sounds like Podesta, i've listen and analyzed it personally as a sound engineer who is privy to audio software.
             </p>
             <p>
              Is it him 100%? I'd say its pretty damn close. So maybe it is SKIPPY. Just more fuel to the fire, who gives a fuck if its him or not, lets put these people and John Podesta especially, to the fire and get some answers from them. WE HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS.

               I already said it sounds like Podesta.
              </p>
              <p>
               When the whole community starts to act like the way you are suggesting, it makes the movement less fact-based, and more based on emotions. It sounds like Podesta, like I said. But its bad when ppl say shit like "OMG I HEARD SKIPPY" OMG I HEARD THEM SAY "PODESTA". when nothing suggests that in the audio.
              </p>
              <p>
               we agree to disagree then.

                I disagree. It needs more information to denote an accurate response from the public and any response from Podesta.
               </p>
               <p>
                The movement is fact based and there is too much coincidence to call it circumstantial. Either way, you won't be able to actually decide how people react to new video and something as disgusting as that one. All you are doing is crying about it, honestly, no one is going to change their opinion or how they act just because you think its the wrong direction.
               </p>
               <p>
                To me there is enough dirt on Podesta that along with the voice in the video, it is almost CERTINALLY him. So yeah, agree to disagree...I say keep digging and bringing attention to Podesta and pedogate in general and don't worry about stirring up the pot, THATS EXACTLY WHAT IS NEEDED, stir the pot to the max.
               </p>
               <p>
                If it wasen't true Podesta would have filed a suit against worldcorpo for Slander.

                 im not crying about anything. im just saying that ppl should think critically and not jump to conclusions lol. jumping to conclusions is alex jones shit and then normies will look away when everyone has that attitude. ppl need to be cautious of what they say as fact.

                  The fact is that he is tight lipped about the whole PedoGate thing in general and has more than one Pedophile friend.

            Consider the idea that the horrific nature of the video, coupled with confirmation bias, will spark an awakening to the concept of PedoGate. I also think we should start referring to it as such in an effort to rebrand what we're doing and separate from the pizza shop in DC where any and all evidence was pulled out and cleansed under cloak or moved camera and corrupt agents.

            Yeah this is important. That video is sick and twisted and I couldn't even watch the whole thing, but we really have no connection at all to Podesta. The guy who runs the website is in Canada, even. It could be Podesta, but it probably isn't. That guy still needs to be taken down though.

             It looks bad on everyone when we freak out and start jumping to conclusions. Yes, Podesta has an alter ego– but the guy doesnt say anything to suggest he said "Skippy" and the girl doesnt say "skippy" either. She says something like "jaaahn"
