            He fits a profile that is easily distorted. - He's right wing, he's gay, - most religious types bundle homosexuality and pedophilia together. - I've even heard some go as far as to call homosexuality the "gateway" sexuality, citing that it could lead to "all kinds of perversion." - I think this is why they've chosen to go after him, - perhaps they assume it be easier to misconstrue the situation because of his abrasive nature and sexuality, they feel they might be able to generate some controversy, lies, and perhaps even frame him. That'd allow them to kick their disinformation campaign
 off full gear once the high level arrests start to really shake things up. This whole thing certainly looks like a smear job, and I think they definitely want to hijack the pizzagate narrative now that things are heating up. - I don't think anyone's buying it though. Milo can be really abrasive and annoying to me sometimes, but seriously, - a pedo?  No f@#$king way man. These media pedo's are desperate as hell, and I'm so sick of seeing their slimy faces and faux indignation! - Can't wait till they all crumble. - I feel like it's gonna get uglier though.

            Exactly! I am a 3 month lurker, and i am posting very rarely, but now I see the recent shills reaching their goals i feel the need to intervene. Yesterday on facebook all of a sudden a university student (typical mid 20s lefty normy) who frequently reacts on my political posts (pro-Trump, right wing here in the Netherlands), and who back in November when i had made 1-2 posts on PG was greatly triggered, and he felt great joy in telling me how nonsensical and tinfoil BS it all was. Suddenly yesterday he showed up again in the comments of some random post, feeling the need to point me to an article on the recent MILO pedo stuff from some MSM source. Then I realised for certain this is a big psyop initiated on purpose and most likely to condition people for something which is perhaps coming.
           </p>
           <p>
            So many of us now falling into the obvious trap of debating the morality of pedophilia, and whether or not some celebrity is or is not a pedophile. May I please recall that pizzagate is about ritual sexual abuse of children by people in the highest ranks of power. This is not about the ins and outs of sexual attraction to children, but the actual abuse, torture, and killing of them by those people whom we elected and who are supposed to ensure a certain peaceful coexistence for us the people. Stop giving the shills their way, there have been many here since yesterday. It is NOT important whether or not Milo has had sex as a minor with an adult, or may or may not still defend that act. Milo is a great person, and doest NOT deserve these attacks. Stop the nonsense, and start focussing on the ACTUAL EVIL!

            Not at all surprised by shitty MSM normalizing pedos and other disgusting behaviors. Do you know any links where I could see this for myself? From what I can tell though he made articles exposing multiple pedos though, that's about all that I say on that. When he himself posted about what he has done to counter peoples suspicions.

            Milo is controlled op, no doubt and Breitbart is a Mossad front.  This is another red herring by TPTB in an effort to divert and discredit the investigation and a crafty piece of Hegelian dialectic to boot.  They will mainstream and trivilaise Pizzagate by diluting its definition and reapportioning the blame from those at the top to lackeys below.  Milo is on point about most things and this is the problem, he's a honey trap and the best way to control the oppostion is to lead them.  Monitor his actions, exploit them when beneficial to the investigation but don't stare into the light for too long!

            I think they're just probing for soft spots.  They have nothing but good news from the Trump Administration, and the whole world is getting really really sick of "the Russians did it."   There are a variety of ways they could try to spin this out, especially when (hopefully) the high profile pedos start to fall.  I think the really important thing is don't take any bait, and continue to ferret out as much real info about the sicko human trafficking networks as possible.

            It's all part of Saul alinsky's ' rules for radicals', accuse your opponents of what you are guilty off or hold your opponents up to there own standards paraphrasing but a lot of what the leftist media does can be explained by a understanding of this book.
Here's a link for more, it's long but worth it.

             Yes, that TOTALLY absolves him from saying the following:

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              You’re misunderstanding what pedophilia means. Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13-years-old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty. Pedophilia is attraction to people who don’t have functioning sex organs yet. Who have not gone through puberty. Who are too young to be able (unclear and cut off by others)…That’s not what we are talking about. You don’t understand what pedophilia is if you are saying I’m defending it because I’m certainly not.
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             to which the host responded:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              You are advocating for cross generational relationships here, can be honest about that?”

            <blockquote>
             <p>
              Yeah, I don’t mind admitting that. I think particularly in the gay world and outside the Catholic church, if that’s where some of you want to go with this, I think in the gay world, some of the most important, enriching and incredibly life affirming, important shaping relationships very often between younger boys and older men, they can be hugely positive experiences for those young boys they can even save those young boys, from desolation, from suicide (people talk over each other)… providing they’re consensual

            <p>
             So fucking them at 13 is SAVING THEM FROM SUICIDE. And that's NOT PEDOPHILIA, it's just FUCKING YOUNG BOYS and saving them from SUICIDE.

             The only reaons he apologizes is because his gravy train just came to a screeching halt. His apology is a non-apology where he never ONCE says the pederastic behavior above is unacceptable(because it is not PRE-pubescent pedophilia). That's some NAMBLA level bullshit there. He might allude to the consent ages being 'roughly the right age', but that's a whole lotta wiggle room considering the comments above. He also tries to play it off, because 'he never thought he'd be this famous' and that there were a lotta of late night streams, ha ha ha ... non - fucking - apology bullshit.
            </p>
            <p>
             You can surely accept his apology if you like, but realize there are others that just can't bend over far enough to actually stick our heads completely inside our assholes.

              Or, smart-aleck, if you thought two steps ahead, you would know that Milo has mentioned being at some Hollywood parties that disgusted him and happened to get a phone call before his Pizzagate talk that really shut him up good. Then, the guy who breaks this story (Evan McMullin) is known to be a former page of Dennis Hastert's which is where he got kids to abuse, indicating he was involved in pedophilia, and had some reason to attack Milo. Does that make you feel like maybe Milo is a different risk than you realize?
             </p>
             <p>
              He knows names that will get him killed if he even mentions it. Pedophiles coming out of the woodwork to use this as an attempt to slander him.
             </p>
             <p>
              I can just tell an obvious ploy when I see it, unlike some gullible folks like yourself.

               He said 14 on Joe Rogans show, is that OK? At what point does it become OK, 15, 16? I just want to know for a friend .... Im not talking about him being a victim, or when he was a victim. Im talking about him apologizing for pederasty.

                He knows names that will get him killed if he even mentions it. Pedophiles coming out of the woodwork to use this as an attempt to slander him.

                Maybe you'd be surprised to find that most European countries have the age of consent at 14.... saying 15 or 16 is not very radical in the larger course of things. Again he is clear he has personal feelings that the age of consent is strict while real-life is blurry, because he is trying to rationalize his own abuse internally. The guy has a few things to get over still. But pedophilia, the guy is very clear on.

                Castration or incarceration is what he recommends. If you take one statement at face value, why not the other?

                Easy for you to say, know why almost nobody else has named names so far? Gets you fucking killed, won't be much use as a witness then will he?

            I've seen suggestions that this was a hatchet way to get at Bannon. That may be the case, but they have to realize they're playing with fire given the PG issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for Milo, judging by his statements and actions, I don't think he's trying to screw us over. I think that this is how he copes with his own abuse--rationalizing it in his head as "I was the predator", suggesting that it's more acceptable once you've hit puberty, etc.
           </p>
           <p>
            I hope if he has a plan to play this well, he hangs the actual pedos out to dry at that press conference.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also possible that, as you suggested, this is a ploy. MSM suddenly realize that they made a mistake, making everyone skeptical of future instances of people as pedos.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Jake Tapper is suddenly arrested, expect some hard backpedaling and reluctant defense that Milo did nothing wrong in this case.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also interesting that Egg McMuffin (Evan McMullin) is ex-CIA and associated with the Reagan Battalion who is supposedly behind the Milo assault.
