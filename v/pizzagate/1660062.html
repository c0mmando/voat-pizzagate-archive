            Not sure if this was covered here or elsewhere..as I'm relatively new ...but I just read some of the names involved in Edgar Welch case.  It appears Judge Trafford used to work at the Mental Health division of the DC public Defender..the same office defending Welch.  Not only did judge Trafford work their she was also a subordinate and had a extra marital relationship to Charles Rust-Tierney and with Rust Tierney 's son both having been caught in criminal dusts ups.   Rust-Tierney had tapes of forced assault on kids and infants.  He was also coach to little league teams (possible connection to Sandusky ?) .  Rust Tierney was head of Virginia ACLU..but he was nice guy right ?   Then we go the Seattle judge who TRO'd Trump temporary travel ban. Well he was head of some children advocacy group in Washingont. Former President and Trustee, Seattle Children’s Home.
 Former Co-Chair, Second Century Society, Children’s Home Society of Washington.
Former Member, State Advisory Board and Former Trustee, Children’s Home Society of Washington.
During his tenure as boardmember and trustee ever since 1990's there have been allegations of rape and molestation at the Seattle Childrens home.  see
            <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/former-counselor-pleads-guilty-to-child-sex-abuse/">
             http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/former-counselor-pleads-guilty-to-child-sex-abuse/
            </a>
            <br/>
            Also it was finally closed after children's charity which was run by Dr David Scratchley who was arrested for raping a 10 yo boy! 
We know sick people are attracted to fields where the sickness takes them..but why protect them unless you are also them ?

            So that is odd since the gun laws are very strict in the District of Columbia , wonder how many of these " Crisis actors " there are. Bringing a gun into D.C. is a whole world of trouble

            WOW! I expanded the search just to double check. How the fuck is this possible, AND it went unreported? I know everything MSM is crooked, but how would so many alternative news outlets miss this? Am I wrong? Anyone pick up this story?

            I was the first person to post on The_Donald about him being an actor.  It's just a habit for me to look up someone on IMDB whenever a crisis happens.

            Great one. This is a smoking gun. Just as it should have played out! He had apparently injured a teenager via negligent driving and with this stunt he cut a plea deal.

             That's the understanding I have as well. Cutting a deal. But make sure to note my amendment, the case was transferred to the US District Court and he is still "in the system" awaiting his court date. Probably cut a deal, seal records and we won't hear anything about him again.

              It's also possible that the feds are less corrupt than the local courts (NEVER thought I'd say that, but we're talking about DC cops and DA's here). Keep the faith man, this is getting exposed.

             My understanding is 12/13 the case was dismissed from the local courts and referred to the federal court (US District Court) immediately. This was the reason for my initial confusion because they are both DC courts, so when I searched the DC court system, there was no pending case.

            I noticed that myself. Definitely not normal for a random guy to be getting a protection order. Pretty sure that means he will be separated from general population in jail while he awaits his arraignment.

            On behalf of actors, SAG, AFTRA, and AEA, I would like to say I'm sorry for this and Sandy Hook.  It's tough to make a livin in this biz, and always tough to turn down work.  Even if it's for Satan's Lizard Demons.  I told my agent not even to tell me if they call.  I don't want the temptation.

            I tried to find the police scanner audio from that date/time in DC back when this took place. Police scanners in that area are encrypted for the most-part but I did find this snippet that matched the timeframe:

            - some guy screaming in a store at customers, something about being in a cult.

            First, I would take the 'accuracy in question' bit in stride; just what happens with relevant threads here on voat. One must call it like one sees it --
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365/7121491">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1470365/7121491
            </a>
            . Second, unfortunately, most people are looking for 'smoking gun' proof or a fucking confession or whatever 'solid' proof that we're never going to get because these pieces of turd do it like the spooks; Admit nothing, deny everything. I want solid evidence, too, but, in retrospect, did this entire investigation start off with solid evidence or coincidence?

            The martial art of Judo involves using the enemies momentum against them, and the principle applies just as much to psychological combat as it does physical combat.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, there are two opposing sides of #pizzagate. The opposition asserts that:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              comet ping pong is a victim of a vicious defamation campaign being waged by right wing zealots.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Their hate campaign has inspired one of the zealots to come completely unhinged and attempt a spree killing in their establishment.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            The strategy (if you can even call it that) being advocated is to make noise and call bullshit. Which will, of course, be ignored.
           </p>
           <p>
            But what if, instead, people sought out the management of comet ping pong, and told them the news about the charges being dropped? What if people asked them for their opinions of this horrible miscarriage of justice? What if people informed the media about the "right wing judge that dropped charges against the comet ping pong shooter"? What if people took to social media and proclaimed "this right wing violence and intimidation has gone too far! we need to fight back!" What if people accused the outlets that refused to cover it of being right wing reactionary sympathizers?
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>
              the people that work at comet ping pong will have to lie and feign outrage, or lie and justify the release of the man that came into their establishment with a gun and tried to kill people.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              the media will have to cover the news of the release of the shooter, or suffer the backlash of being labeled as right wing sympathizers.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              The opposition will not be able to tell the trolls from the useful idiots swept up in the psy-op.
             </p>
            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              Useful idiots will get sucked in by the headline and get redpilled when they start doing further research. the denial by the trolls and masterminds that have been manipulating them will drive them to the other (our) side and pressure will mount even more ans the MSM and powers that be lose control of the narrative.
             </p>
            </li>
           </ol>
           <p>
            Letting this man go was the stupidest thing they could have done and a huge tactical blunder on their part. but then again, I'm just a guy on the internet. The people involved have much more experience in this area that I do and are probably several steps ahead of me in the info-war department.

             The case was moved to the US court system (In DC, that's the confusion) so we will see what comes of things. I have a feeling Welch won't be seen again upon his release.

            Here are the suspicious parts:
           </p>
           <p>
            1) MPD dropped the charges.  Firearms charges.  On non-federal property.  They never, ever do that and there are plenty of examples, even weeks before EMW's arrest to support that.
           </p>
           <p>
            2) EMW was granted access to a video teleconference system, pre-arraignment, so he ould conduct an interview with the New York Times.  Again, this never happens.
           </p>
           <p>
            3) At that time, MPD 2D had approximately 30% body cameras issued.  No video exists of the ordeal.
           </p>
           <p>
            4) Nothing matches between the eyewitness accounts, the discharge of the firearms, the charging documents, etc.  And WTF owns an AR chambered in 9mm?  Oh, someone that needed to more safely discharge a firearm in a live fire exercise. Or, shoot a hard drive without over penetration.

Welchs' phone records were sealed upon first appearance so nobody can see who he was speaking with prior to the incident.

             I head the timeframe was listed as 20 minutes from the time he entered the building until the last patron ran out. That's an awful long time considering he didn't face kidnap charges.

            No offense, but none of this is new.  All of this has been documented previously. DC dropped the charges, remanding EMW over to Federal custody.  Supposedly, Federal charges were filed, and he has had pre-trial hearings, but he doesn't appear anywhere in the Federal system.  His next appearance in Federal court (under a real judge) is 06 Mar.  This is a continuance form his previous appearance date.

            I'm flairing this as "possible disinformation" because the DC Clerk of Courts site shows that he was arrested by the feds right after the local guys dropped the charges. You could be right, I just don't want people jumping to conclusions.

            This whole post is very misleading, OP. His case has been dropped by the police cause it was handed over to the feds. And don't claim that same name = same guy.

              -- peekay's videos are pretty good. Yes, hoax. This is one of the ways people tell the shills from the real ones -- shills present hoaxes as false flags (gatekeeping) and hold fast to the narrative. In orlando, the 'victims' were seen being transported

              ?!? Orlando was one of the sloppiest of idiotic hoaxes with Crisis Actors abound (Leinonen going for gun control immediately/ Fatpatriot guy is an actor/dancer/etc.)

              (there are better areal views). Much more... For gun control,.. they just got a large portion of the LGBT crowd lobbied to the gun control agenda. This is Cultural Hegemony and Identity Politics at it's finest.

             Yeah, having been a spectactor/researcher in everything false flag/hoax for a while, I have learned that many crisis actors are a mixed bag of 1-depraved narcissists wanting to be seen, regardless of morality 2-Poor minded people who just will do anything for money 3-low life scums with criminal charges against them (recent or not), having bargained to have them cleaned off their record in exchange for their part in a stage event. 4-Professionals (security services and agencies/alphabets/former soldiers/media people) who are protected by politicians/media conglomerates through personal contact (read «....AND/OR BLACKMAIL»), serving the agendas of their masters.

            It looks like the charges were dropped by District of Columbia and charges filed by the U.S. Marshal Service.  In the messages column (in your link above) for one of the 12-13-16 docket dates, it says, "Government dismissed the case without prejudice at this time; A federal arrest warrant has been filed against the defendant and will be executed by the USMS following the proceedings."

            Just a couple of questions here.
           </p>
           <p>
            Does Justia differentiate between local, state, and federal jurisdictions? Is it for only one of those jurisdictions?
           </p>
           <p>
            Am I reading the Gyazo link correctly? It seems there's a motion to dismiss this case since there's a pending federal case, and therefore the judge agreed and dismissed this case.

             I think you're right. It looks like they got switched to Sherry Trafford, then had her dismiss the charges and release him over to the Marshals for filing interstate transportation of a firearm.

           <p>
            The case is dismissed, but then the US Marshals are going to arrest him? Sounds like they're handing him over to another agency for the kill.

              Well then, the dismissal of the charges isn't nearly as suspicious, I would say. And as you haven't proven that the agent in question is bogus, I don't really see the proof of anything here, other than agencies fighting over who gets the credit.

             Dude, the first claim you make in your post is that a supposed federal agent has a double identity, and then you never prove it, and now you're saying it's not important. If it wasn't important, why did you mention it in the first place? The more you dismiss this part of your post, the more this is seeming like disinfo.

            Maybe the charges were dropped by the local courts and refiled when his case was transferred to the Federal Court?

             Now I'm confused as well, because the records I pulled were from the same court. The District of Columbia Court system. But looking at the charges, they may have dropped the initial charges and filed for interstate carrying of firearm.

            Them having the same names isn't proof of anything. Are you saying there's only one Justin Holgate in America? It'd be more suspicious if they were both from the same area, but they aren't. They're hundreds of miles apart.

            Folks: don't claim two people with the same name are the same person until you have proof. We've been down this road before since the very beginning of pizzagate and people have concocted what turned out to be BS accusations against others who had the misfortune of having the same name as someone.

            The WaPo /AP surrender photo by Sathi Soma via AP/AP is interesting because the camera angle shows that the photographer was inside the cafe across the street's in the seating area, which to me, indicated that it was stake out planned shot, that they were already there drinking coffee or something.  I mean if this person got a call to head down there, or was on a scanner and just showed up, why would they go behind this metal fence?

            The image of the case dismissal states he is to be immediately arrested by federal investigators and the case resumed by them, so this is just the D.C. investigation being handed over. See where it says: "a federal arrest warrant has been filed..."

            I reported a little over a week ago that he pled not guilty to all charges, however, despite ongoing plea deals.

               During a Jan. 24 status hearing at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Assistant U.S. Attorney Demian Ahn told a federal judge a plea offer had been made to Edgar Maddison Welch, 29, who has been charged with multiple federal and D.C. gun-related offenses in connection with the Comet pizza case.

              No, I had to update it anyway so it doesn't matter now. The case was moved from DC CIrcuit court to US Circuit court in DC. That was the mistake. We live and learn, but there is still some good info coming out of this thread.

             There are several on this board (including myself) who have reason to believe that the mods from reddit infected voat a while back.

               Educated hunch... (Joking) -- right around Nov. 2016 there was an exodus from reddit to voat and I personally witnessed a consistent narrative/NLP/disinformation tactic being used in both the OPs and the comments across the reddit/chan/voat boards. As well, another voater had compiled a list of images and links that built a bigger picture scenario of reddit/voat where mods had various alts across these boards, 32 votes from same computer, etc. Also, deletion/flairing of relevant posts consistent with topics and mods (which is what I thought was happening here but apparently not.) Can't provide links as SLI.mg is down?, am on mobile, and I am not trying to build a case...

               I don't think Infowars and Alex Jones are scared so much as in they're being very careful about what they say. He's right when he's said previously that they can't immediately arrest everyone as this will create misperceptions and reinforce certain groups into thinking (believing) that a coup is being attempted. If they don't have concrete evidence they're gathering it my opinion so as none of these sick fucks escape the noose, or dragnet. We can all see how big this story is and we can all see just how many people are involved...we, and I mean YOU, all of you have only scraped the scum off the tip of the iceberg... I've never seen such a filthy octopus with so many tentacles...they literally go everywhere. I firmly believe there are 'good' guys on the job but let's give them time to do it, especially now that we have a chance with Trump and Sessions and Chatvetz? and a bunch of others...patience is a virtue and we're going to need it. You never tell the enemy what your plans are do you? Art of War remember? Keep on digging you guys you're doing great work and I'm sure there are many watching, taking YOUR notes and investigations seriously...another way to look at it is that you're doing the hard yards freeing them up to go even further down the black hole that this obviously is...I've seen Alex screaming and almost frothing at the mouth over this story he's not happy that he can't speak about everything he's been made aware of as it will possibly ruin the case they're building... When a certain level is reached (aware people), that being a critical mass, it will all go viral and they simply will not be able to stop it no matter what they do nor who they kill...patience.

              Infowars is afraid of the story.  The "fake news"  frame up was supposed to be for them as this story broke.  Only they backed off and the dog turd stuck to CNN's backside instead.

               Alex Jones speciality was exposing false flags and hoaxes. Not any more. Infowars has become a Trump propaganda arm of FOX - sad! Alex won't go near Pizzagate. I listened to his recent interview witb R.D.Steele when he launched into Pizzagate and when Alex started to look some what distressed, Robert told him ....'Alex, stop being so scared.....' Alex is under gag orders. Pizzagate has thevelites teriffied.

             What's crazy is I have been telling my friends for years that I wish something will just shake this world up a bit, like a UFO to crash down on earth just to add a bit of spice to my mundane life. Nowe suddenly my earth bubble is crumbling Infront of my eyes, I kind of want to go back to my ignorant self again.

             The scary experience of "seeing everything clearly for the first time" is what is generally called "awakening", so congrats that you also made it past this point. It gets better eventually...

             There are so many resources about reptilian races. One of the first things that piqued my interested a few years ago were the "Lacerta files", I can still recommend it. It was a pretty eerie experience back then because the interview rang so true even though I was not ready at all to consider it. See for yourself:

               Just to clarify, from my perspective today I would not consider to be much of what is said in this interview to be truthful. I believe that this interview took place but since reptilians are said to be dishonest and devious I think that most of the answers are probably misinformation. E.g. the statement that the reptilians have been on earth longer than humans is for sure a lie.

             While reptile people may be actual reptiles, I have always believed that the term refers to a particular group of exceptionally dangerous psychopaths ..."those who can't be named."
            </p>
            <p>
             If you can't name them, code words will be all you have. The connection is that reptiles are cold-blooded.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those who can't be named?  Voltaire said it best:
            </p>
            <p>
             "“To know who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticise,”

              I agree that's the connection. The
              <em>
               cold blood
              </em>
              . The worst psychopaths, with no concept of how to FEEL anything at all. The depravity they go to, in order to FEEL something, or feel vicariously through their victims, is why we're all here.

              Many people have said that Fidel Castro is CIA sponsored.  One of the most believable is Servando Gonzalez (Cuban born author and historian), author of "Psychological Warfare and the New World Order: The Secret War Against the American People" and "I Dare Call It Treason: The Council on Foreign Relations and the Betrayal of America".

              Fidel Castro has an IMDB page as well (he was an extra for a couple movies):

                 I haven't pondered that in a long time but when I started hearing about Bohemian Grove in 2004, I told my husband to turn that shit off.  He listened to Alex Jones and a couple of others on what I called "paranoia radio" and said the most outrageous stuf...only, over the next 12 years, everything came true...one unbelievable thing after another.  Then FBIAnon started...and Pizzagate.  Still took me seeing some of it with my own eyes to believe it and even here, there has been stuff that was simply impossible....but wasnt.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I have resolved to no longer dismiss anything completely.  Lizard people, gondolas, Bigfoot...I just won't think about it.

                 There's a reason all the conspiracy theories are turning out to be true. We're the only ones using critical thinking and actual evidence to come to our conclusions.

                  pick one because these are an oxymoron to a rational person. the whole purpose of religion is faith which is to believe in something without facts or the knowledge at hand to support it. this is about catching pedos abusing their power. the angels and demons shit is unnecessary to me unless we're discussing these sick fucks occultist practices.

                   They are allegories. There is truth to the stories weather or not you believe in the bible and god and all that. And like you said, there's good evidence there are satanists out there, so to understand the bible is helpful to understand their motives and the way they view the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I believe that these people think they are the bloodlines of the fallen angels. They think they are better than god, and they want to create a post-human society. That's why they are all transgender

                   and blasphemous child rapists etc. They live their lives to mock god.

                   It's irrelevant how you personally feel about god.

               Of course, but remember there was a time when Satanic Ritual Abuse of children among the Aristocrats was just as unbelievable. Everything David Icke has told us so far has been coming true. Kinda makes you wonder...

                The secret war being fought that has caused, and is causing, real wars to be fought by us., is against the old money (The English Royalty (w/ the Catholic Church) vs. their former Ottoman/persian enemies (United Arab Emirates, Saudi Royals, etc)., Vs New money (Intelligence Community, New World Order, 7th Floor, Private Commercial Leaders)., Which is fueled, funded, and continued, by The Rothschilds &amp; Fractional Reserve Banking (Along with other powerful Jewish Families).

                On one side of the war, is the Church vs. Islam  (Just like they have been fighting for the last 2000 year). Then there is the Rothschilds (representing Judaism - independently)., Who's family thinks they where here first., Because the basis of both religions came from a Jewish man. Christianity (Which came from Jesus, decedent of Abraham, father of Issac And Ishmael = All Jewish) and Islam (Which came from Mohamed, descendant of Issac and Ishmael, son of Abraham = All originally Jewish)., Are all deviated branches of the same story., The main issue being, each claim their own interpretations, to be the sole "Holy" doctrine.

               <p>
                The Rothschild's and their supporting members, believe this because the decedents of both religions, descended from Judaism. The Rothschild's believe, The Kings of of the house of David (Judaism) are the true owners of the world.

                Think, why else Hitler was willing to go to war with the world to end their banking monopoly (Please do not take this like im advocating his horrendous acts). He was well aware of what they had created and the political influence they had (The Rothschilds that is)., Because of their lending and money power, anyone was willing to go to war for them. If they didn't help, they could recall loans, or they could collapse an economy. Which they have done. Many times. ie. US stock market crash of '29, '08, many small in between.,

              Sorry to break it to you but them actually being literally reptilian is a pretty mood point.  I don't believe in literal reptile people but they are just as bad. The pedo elite in this world literally believe themselves to be of a higher order. They don't respect the same laws and they see us as worker bees at best and nothing but food at the worst.  Seeing them peeling off thier skin and having scales underneath would actually calm me down.  I'd rather live in a world where humans are decent and reptiles are the enemy as apposed   to the one I'm in now where some humans are ok and others just act like it so they can rise to power and eat my children.   It's fucked up anyway you slice it.

              That would be an overreaction friend. The presence of reptile people is considered straightforward in Hindu epics and they're referred to as the race of Nagas.

               Yeah, there is even a large faction of south asians (mainly in Indonesia) who actually still worship Ravana, the serpent/reptile king who is the main antagonist in the Ramayana. He is quite literally worshipped as still living, and it's actually not that far out of the question when you consider all the hollow/honeycomb earth evidence and how it coincides with ALL the knowledge of the nagas in the Hindu texts (I learned about all of this as a kid because my family is hindu, it just about blew my mind when I realized those "myths" that I would read/hear as a child were not that far-fetched). Quite fascinating really.

              Do a search. There's obviously something still charged against him, as he was apparently in court recently. Maybe its local charges I can't tell. The next court date is March 6th

               They are running those news pieces per the narrative, but the narrative got blown up because it was rushed and not coordinated aptly.

                Haha comet ding dong. So heres a link to the "plea deal":
                <a href="http://wtop.com/dc/2017/01/plea-deal-on-table-in-pizzagate-case/">
                 http://wtop.com/dc/2017/01/plea-deal-on-table-in-pizzagate-case/
                </a>
               </p>
               <p>
                Which if what you are saying is true, and since the charges are technically dropped, this "plea deal" will end up with him walking away? Or community service to appear like there has to be some consequences to walking into a pizza shop over "fake news" and firing a weapon?

                  If you look on the DC clerk of courts for his case, the charges were dropped and he was immediately arrested on federal ones, they're just handing this over to the FBI.

               They were relying on the dockets being sealed, per their request. But if you follow the chain of resolutions, the judge was switched and the new judge denied their motion. This one took a big shit on them because they were rushed and had to pull off the hoax shooting immediately to get rid of the hard drive under veil.

                But there was no investigation, no one was looking for the hard drive, so why stage all this just to get rid of a hard drive that no one was looking for, unless there was some fear that it might come up in the future, and incriminating evidence was on it.  Throwing out or upgrading your hard drive is not illegal, happens all the time, and the bullet damage must have been a smokescreen for any future investigation, which only suggests that there WAS incriminating material on it and only re-enforces our suspicions. Why do they think we are stupid?
               </p>
               <p>
                Aside from the hard drive, this whole incident was to frame pizzagaters as violent instigators.

                 It was too rushed and too sloppy to just be a propaganda piece. Those are planned out carefully. They don't get assigned to the wrong judge, the documents aren't made public.
