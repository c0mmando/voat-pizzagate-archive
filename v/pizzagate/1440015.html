<p>First of all, <strong>for anyone investigating Pizza Gate, watching &quot;The Conspiracy of Silence&quot; should be mandatory</strong>. The parallels between our case and theirs are eerily accurate and spot on.</p>
<p>Now, John DeCamp was the lead perspective on Conspiracy of Silence, an unaired Discovery Channel documentary about the alleged &quot;Franklin cover-up&quot; that documents a U.S. child sex abuse and pedophilia ring whose involvement leads to the highest levels of government. When they say the HIGHEST levels, they mean THE highest levels. This was confirmed by The Washington Times, “Mr. Spence arranged at least four midnight tours of the White House, including one June 29, 1989, on which he took with him a 15-year-old boy whom he falsely identified as his son.” The boy Mr. Spence claimed to be his son, was later identified as foster child prostitute, Paul Bonacci featured in the documentary speaking out about his abuse. On February 27, 1999, the U.S. District Court of the District of Nebraska awarded Bonacci $1 million in compensatory damages and punitive damages, related to the Franklin Cover-Up. Omaha’s Franklin Community Federal Credit Union handler, Lawrence E. King Jr., was held responsible for the damages done to Bonacci, due to King\'s failure to respond to the lawsuit from jail. Decamp was Bonacci’s defense attorney for these related scandals.</p>
<p>We need a man like John DeCamp while he\'s still alive. He\'s 75, and I have a bad feeling about how much longer he\'s going to be around. We need an investigator that\'s good at being discrete to contact this man about Pizza Gate.</p>

<p>P.S. On a side note from 4chan, people have been thinking that it could also be a good idea to contact Kesha and Corey Feldman due to their past claims about widespread abuse in hollywood which is linked to government instances of this ring. If encouraged, both of them may speak out to save other children from following their alleged abuse. As private citizens, contacting figures that could work as allies is one of the most powerful things we can do at this stage.</p>',

            Agreed - but how do we do this safely in a way that doesn't expose him to more danger, or his contact info to the wrong ppl? We can't post that here. So.....
