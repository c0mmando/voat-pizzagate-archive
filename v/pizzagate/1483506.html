            I try to spend 2 hours a day tweeting and RTing on #pizzagate. But have been shadowbanned for 2 days and a bit. I want to get back to bringing this to the light but I am waiting for twitter to un-shadowban me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Any way to challenge the shadowbanning?

              I have two twitter accounts. The account I pizzagate with and a business one. I look at the recent tweets from the pizzagate one in a incognito tab using the twitter of the business one. If I am not shadowbanned it should match the tweets I am sending. If I am shadowbanned all of my tweets will disappear and not show up on the business account.

            You can't abandon twitter because its only fucking use is its user base.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fight CENSORSHIP. Don't bitch about it, FIGHT IT.   No one has a right to decide what topics we'll discuss. NOBODY.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's a CIVIL, and NECESSARY right.   Whatever actions that have to be taken, up to and including CIVIL WAR, must be taken when fighting those who attack the pillars of our freedom.
           </p>
           <p>
            This ISN'T rhetoric. It's a fact. If you ignore it, you spit on every defender of Liberty that ever was.
           </p>
           <p>
            Don't be beta in this situation. Take SOME ACTION.
           </p>
           <p>
            Increasing signs of ACTIVE and CONCERTED censorship are INCREASING.  Along with a massive disinformation project being carried out by supposedly neutral third parties.  Now they are legitimizing opposition with a 'Ministry of Truth?'.

            Add Twitter to the list of entities that need to be investigated once we're finished with the other pedorgs. Their value will be at rock bottom soon enough and any political protection they imagine they have right now will be long gone.

            all he was doing, was posing questions. he did not even allege anything! and they ban him. oh my, they really are intent upon exposing themselves for all the world to see. Nonetheless, I think this man has the right idea. Maybe why he was banned? By putting things as questions, they have more impact. If we go, and say things all passionately, they may use it against us. The more objective we get, the more the facts, can speak for themselves, and people will of course hear the truth eventually. Our misconduct at this stage, could be the only strand they have to cling to. Most people have been great the whole time ,and shown more decorum than professional investigators. Comet has had to invent animosity. The threats that comet pizza says they have received, I believe are mostly made up, or extremely exaggerated. ie a person rings up besta pizza and asks why they changed the logo -mark that up as a threat. A few questions, should not threaten anyone. They wouldn't! Only someone caught out, at a serious crime, suddenly finds questions, an attack and harassing... innocent people are glad of being asked, and will take the opportunity to allay any concerns. Kind of like, Alefantis pretended to be, in that first video, but instead of a few minutes, gloss over, a full interview, that really adresses the concermns. Actually, in that video, and others, Alefantis has only raised more concerns...  An innocent person, would not pretend they do not to have basement, they would not say they have never met Clinton, when obviously they have, as she has been there many times. An innocent person would not hide, and avoid questions,  and say they feel terrorised. James Alefantis, does not look an innocent person. He is the one of the most guilty looking people, I have ever seen. His behaviour is an embedded confession. His contradictions are an embedded confession. And he is being protected, by members of a govenment that claims to be for the people, but seems determined now, to reveal, that it works, for the elite one percent. A press the claims to be there for the people, but is now just saying what these one percent tell them to.
            <br/>
            If government really were for the people, we would live in paradise. They would grow trees everywhere, and source free power from the sun wind and water. They would not milk people dry, but invest in them, and only feel prosperous, when they see all people prospering. They certainly would not sit idly by while children go missing. They would make it the highest priority. Instead we are seeing the opposite. All the most important areas of our lives, are coming under increased threat.  Perhaps that is what it will take, for us to wake up, and recognise these elements that have been our overall undoing. They are not hard to see, when looking ... I believe a simple answer to this situation, would be polygraph tests. Done on camera and with independent verification. I am going to look into this, because all this speculation could be put to rest, with an answer to just a few questions. The people who are in suspicion, can simply take them and we will know, by the truthfulness of their answer. if Arun Rao,  Tamera Luzzatto, John Podesta, Clinton, James Alefantis, and others, have never killed or traffficked or sexually abused children, let them say so, and then a good many of us, might actually believe them. Why let so many people go on worrying about this if you are innocent and could show it? why?

             While Gab is a great place to regroup and recharge, it's a bit like preaching to the choir there.  That's where all the critical thinkers are moving to.  It's essential to keep your twitter account and keep up the noise because that's where all the brainwashed KoolAid drinkers are.

              In what sense? If you just mean VTR etc, then just grow a pair. Meeting organized resistance means you're moving in the right direction.
             </p>
             <p>
              Corruption = when admins etc are part of the cover-ups. Not annoying shills or voat-botting. That's down to personal corruption not systemic corruption within Voat itself.
             </p>
             <p>
              Edit: Seeing your other comments you seem to have a problem with OP stemming from some bullshit in another thread.
             </p>
             <p>
              ...look man, not everyone is going to catch this stuff and without context you're coming off like a maniac engaged in some personal spat. It's better to write up a general Public FYI describing what's going on and posting that to let everyone know what's happening, rather than dropping cryptic comments all over the place.

               Yes you are correct. It began on a submission that I felt was unfair.  OP pulled out an older submission and held it up as an example of a 'retarded post' it was really un called for,  it was a post that had sunk away,
              </p>
              <p>
               OP is engaging in behaviour that he is posting about, like Mainstream Media stifling pizzagate by calling us crazy or Twitter shutting down accounts.

             These accounts and others recycling the same tweets are using the hashtags pizzagate, altright, and the words "mass casualties" among much other shit. Maybe one fake comet gunman was just Hillary's opening move

             Good find.  I've never seen such good proof of shill bots before.  Usually it's a multitude of links and the viewer is to piece it together.  Nice presentation.

            I can't even be bothered to read what you have written quite frankly.
           </p>
           <p>
            The irony that someone as closed as you can be here trying to bring something into the light that has been kept in the dark for so long, by closed minded people, is just absurd.
           </p>
           <p>
            You do realise this, don't you?
           </p>
           <p>
            It's ok that you have your path, but calling people,who are looking for a broader reason as to WHY this is happening, retarded, psycho, CIA psyops (and you did say that) is just ridiculous
           </p>
           <p>
            You are part of the problem and that you think you are not makes it even worse.

            Learn to Package the up votes. Like.... with !!!!!!! AND BIG LETTERS.
           </p>
           <p>
            Focus on the real issues. You had an ongoing debate with me about why it was ok to out another poster as retarded.
           </p>
           <p>
            You actively took their post and submitted it, got 178 up votes, misquoted them and called them retarded.
           </p>
           <p>
            Yea focus on the real issues, take your own advice.
