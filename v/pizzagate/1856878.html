(The court case info is a bit boring to read but it could have new hints,i cut out some interesting part from different sources but be sure to read the below text about Abiku and friends and Heavy breathing  !.)</p>

<p>About the court case:</p>
<p>This is the case in which three judges wrote letters in support of a drug peddler. (the building where Abiku\'s poster and personal items where found) </p>
<p>YOUNGSTOWN -- It came as somewhat of a surprise to federal drug agents that a lawman and legitimate businessmen were linked to a massive pot factory concealed in a warehouse. </p>
<p>Warehouse address:
814 Marshall St. Youngstown</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roger S. Bamberger, assistant U.S. attorney and 23-year veteran of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force, reflected on the case that ended Tuesday with the guilty plea of Edwin J. Stupka, 49. 
Stupka, the 11th defendant in the case, moved to Tucson, Ariz., from Youngstown around the time the first marijuana trafficking arrests were made in 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>William Umbel operated the popular Pyatt Street Diner.
Kevin Rouan had the Pyatt Street Produce Co.</p>
<p>William Umbel was indicted in May 2006, charged with money laundering (nearly 2 million) and conspiracy to distribute more than a ton of marijuana. He will be sentenced April 3 by U.S. District Judge Peter C. Economus in Youngstown federal court. </p>
<p><strong>As part of a plea agreement, Stupka must forfeit his ill-gotten gains -- including a plane and hilltop mansion in Arizona.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before sentencing in 2005, character/reference letters on his behalf were written to Judge Economus by three local judges -- R. Scott Krichbaum, Robert A. Douglas Jr. and Charles J. Bannon. 
<strong>Judge Economus called the letters self-serving and did not consider them.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June 2002, Pedaline was featured with his then-partner, Arroyo, in The Vindicator as co-owners of the B &amp; amp;O. The remodeled train station opened then in its second attempt as a restaurant. - See more at: <a href="http://www.vindy.com/news/2007/jan/22/businessmans-plea-ends-pot-factory-case/#sthash.fnVr8oSy.dpuf">http://www.vindy.com/news/2007/jan/22/businessmans-plea-ends-pot-factory-case/#sthash.fnVr8oSy.dpuf</a></p>
<p>The new restaurant\'s hours are 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. seven days a week. The owners plan to open from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. weekends, with security on duty inside and outside, to cater to the Uptown-area\'s nightlife crowd. </p>

<p>this is very suspicious?!. was this just a very big coincidence..? </p>
<ul>
<li>Why does many of the friend have very disturbing imagery on there band websites and personal profiles?</li>
<li>Why are many friends into very specific occult things? (can we find the same things with the bands played at comet ping pong?</li>
<li>Why does Comet ping pong posters and abiku poster have the same kind of format and almost always mentioning for all ages, they also both often are themed about kids and mindcontrol, alternate personality/split peronality things</li>
<li>Why such Band names like:  Abiku(Spirit of dead children) Furvert, Baby Venom, Teenage souls, ....Heavy Breathing...... ? </li>
<li>How come that the band Teenage souls (Balltimore) that makes mind control &quot;music&quot; (/sound) also makes pink spiral art?, and answers the question about there band with: &quot;We are doing Teenage souls&quot;  and hint in his interviews about &quot;does he know more about what we we want to know? </li>
</ul>
<p>Are Heavy Breathing and Abiku.... friends...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A comment from someone:  Remember in the &quot;Abbandoned stip club video&quot; the room with the tree twigs hanging on the sealing?
-&quot;Maybe Forest kingdom <a href="http://forestkingdom.tumblr.com/">http://forestkingdom.tumblr.com/</a> stayed inside the room with the tree twigs hanging on the sealing&quot; (!thanks op)</p>
<ul>
<li>Did other crazy friends of Abiku stayed inside one of the other rooms inside the building ?</li>
<li>If the other friends/bands also stayed inside there, this would mean they also didnt had a problem with the Polaroid pictures of the naked boys/girls. hanging there ?</li>
<li>We have a lot more info, and we know almost all of Abiku\'s friends are into disturbing things. maybe if see the video\'s again we can find more clues. (i will do later again)</li>
</ul>

            If the other friends/bands also stayed inside there, this would mean they also didnt had a problem with the Polaroid pictures of the naked boys/girls. hanging there ?
           </li>
           <li>
            We have a lot more info, and we know almost all of Abiku's friends are into disturbing things. maybe if see the video's again we can find more clues. (i will do later again)

            In the beginning this material was spurious and loose, now, though, it seems you have been able to ferret out an important connection, that at least we know that another bizarre band Abiku has an affiliation with our favorite Comet Pizza band Heavy Breathing. However disjointed and confusing these operations seem to be somehow you found a connection. Good work.
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as definitive conclusions linking a
            <em>
             network
            </em>
            to Alefantis' CPP is highly inconclusive and seems to be another one of those possibilities that will remain in pure speculative mode however you raised some good questions about how the Youngstown operation amassed so many assets.
           </p>
           <p>
            However speculative or factual your findings become I just wanted to convey gratitude for the time and effort you've put into this thread. Upvoated.

             In the strip club we found a lot of things pointing towards Abiku living there/ staying there .
            </p>
            <p>
             Inside on the wall of the building where pictures of kids in underwear
            </p>
            <p>
             Abiku means spirit of dead children
            </p>
            <p>
             Comet is close by
            </p>
            <p>
             They played with Heavy breathing at least one time
            </p>
            <p>
             The owner of the place looks like Amanda (because of the same outfit he also cal himself a she sometimes)
