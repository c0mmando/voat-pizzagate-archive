            Can you share the code and any related files? I would love to integrate that into my script and auto generate the website for every scan I do. Would save me a ton of work and the multiple pages will fix the issues I have with large subs breaking trying to load tens of thousands of entries at once.

            Man. That's a lot nicer than I've come up with. Maybe use bootstrap so it's responsive? It doesn't scale well on mobile and won't let me zoom. But that looms great.

            Please forgive my ignorance, but since I'm a bit illiterate in this and I'd like to help, I have a couple of questions:
           </p>
           <ol>
            <li>
             <p>

            </li>
            <li>
             <p>
              If something happened (e.g.,
              <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate">
               /v/pizzagate
              </a>
              dies or whatever), what could/should I do with the file I downloaded?

            If you look in the Redmash folder and view the HTML file it will have a link that says "comments". This will take you to the threaded view of that post.

            Thank you very much for doing this! We'll never know the extent, but you may have saved many children lives. One question: are you sure you crawled everything? It seems like we would have had a bigger db than 16M altogether. Did you backup all threads/comments that ever appeared on that sub, or only within a specific timestamp interval, or vote counts? Thanks for the info.

             All of it. It's all essentially just .txt file so 16mb is about right for a little over 2000 posts and comments. About half of them only had 1-3 comments.

            If you PM me I might be able to help or at least ask the dev who wrote it for me. It's been a growing project for several years now and has gotten more and more complex. Even I need assistance most of the time when things go wrong.

             Another user created one but is stalled. I will tomorrow if it does not complete, but I will delete it from my server either way. I do not want to be responsible for hosting this. Just doing this because I could and was at the right place at the right now.

            That's exactly where it is hosted now. I am putting a limit on it because I have not personally vetted the info. I do not want to be responsible for hosting it permanently.

            You, sir, are a goddamn hero. While I remain hesitant about this whole pizzagate thing, the fact that the subreddit and a bunch of others just got banned like that is definitely bad for free speech in general. You having backed it all up proves to me that this is information that
            <em>
             someone
            </em>
            doesn't want us to see and that we need to keep it out there for the sake of everyone involved
