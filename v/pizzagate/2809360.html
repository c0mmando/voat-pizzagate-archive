<p>After <a href="https://voat.co/u/Vindicator">@Vindicator</a> questioned my source, I\'ve found a 2nd stronger PRIMARY source verifying that AHEPA is a MASONIC organization.</p>
<p>SRA76 NOVEMBER 2012 MASONIC MAGAZINE Published on Oct 28, 2012 The Monthly Masonic Magazine of Lodge Stirling Royal Arch No.76.</p>
<p>The official magazine of the Scottish Rite Masonic Lodge Stirling Royal Arch No. 76 <a href="https://www.lodge76.co.uk/">https://www.lodge76.co.uk/</a> lists the exact same AHEPA initiation ritual as the one listed by Stichting Argus</p>

<p>Part 2:  AHEPA &amp; the Masons</p>
<p>The Initiation Ritual: Spanking, Electroshock, and SECRECY </p>
<p>Whether AHEPA is a true “Masonic” organization isn’t the point. They operate as an elitist Secret Society that instills values of Silence and Loyalty over Truth. This is evident in the violent, Pavlovian hazing each initiate undergoes:</p>

<p>*In performing the second part of the initiation it is necessary that the President instruct the Brothers to keep absolutely quiet. Many Brothers feel that the second part is given in order to have some fun, but in reality with the second part you are teaching the candidates the lesson you expect them to learn. If there are many candidates then the President will ask the assembly as to how many they wish to have tried. If one or two, then the President asks the Captain of the Guard to bring in all the candidates with the exception of the ones to be tried. The President then will immediately appoint two Brothers, one for the prosecution and the other for the defense. These Brothers to speak from their seats without coming forward. The candidate then should be taken to the Secretary’s Office while a discussion is going on in the lodge. The Secretary will then ask the Candidate in this manner: It is our desire to prevent undesirables from becoming members of this lodge. If you know of any man who has committed an offense or who has harmed you or anyone else we would like to have his name. </p>
<p>Whereupon the Secretary will pass him a slip of paper and pencil. While this is done the Captain of the Guard will stand behind the candidate, indifferent, and when, if the candidate marks someone’s name, he will pound his sword upon the desk, grabbing the candidate by the shoulder.* <strong>The President will say:</strong> Captain of the Guard, what is the meaning of the disturbance? </p>
<p><strong>Captain of the Guard:</strong> This Candidate is about to violate his oath and obligation</p>
<p><strong>President:</strong> Bring him before me. </p>
<p>*Whereupon the Captain of the Guard, taking the slip of paper and the Candidate, he stands before the President. *
<strong>President</strong>: What evidence have you that he is about to violate his oath and obligation. </p>
<p><strong>Captain of the Guard:</strong> He was about to write the name of someone who has committed wrong to him. 
<strong>The President, turning to the Candidate:</strong> Were you about to write someone’s name down who has committed wrong to you? 
<em>The Candidate will answer yes or no. If he says yes, then the President will ask the Candidate how long he has been in this country. If he understands the English language, whether he understands his oath and obligation, whether he remembers the paragraph where it says “I will speak evil of no one” After he gets the answer of the Candidate,</em> <strong>the President will say:</strong> I am very much surprised to see that you have so little regard for the oath you have taken. A few minutes ago you have sworn to speak evil of no one and here I find you violated that very same oath. If I had the power I would have you expelled immediately, but since that power rests with the Brothers, I will consult them in regard to your act. </p>
<p>Brothers, you have heard what this Candidate has done, He has already violated his oath.. What is your pleasure? 
<strong>Assembly:</strong> Put him out. 
*If there are some Brothers who say give him a chance, then the President will ask for a rising vote at which time the majority should rise for expulsion *
<strong>President:</strong> Candidate, I’m sorry, but you see yourself that it is the desire of the majority for you to go out. Captain of the Guard, you will conduct this man out, giving him his check. 
*At this time, while the Captain of the Guard is conducting the Candidate out, the Brother who was appointed to defend the Candidate should get up and ask the President to say a few words in favor of the Candidate. After the defense finishes then the Brother who has been appointed for the prosecution should begin to speak against the Candidate. When he is through the President will ask the candidate if he has anything to say himself before he takes another ballot as there seems to be dissension among the members and in order that justice might be given the Candidate. When the Candidate is through the President will again ask for another rising vote and again the majority should be for his expulsion. *
<strong>President</strong>: I am sorry, but you see yourself the majority wishes you to go out. Inasmuch as I have given you the grip and our secret word, it is necessary that you toke another oath that you will not reveal anything to anyone. 
<em>And the President will ask the Captain of the Guard to blindfold the Candidate and conduct him before the Altar, cause him to kneel. At this time the spanker should be filled with a blank and one of the Brothers stand behind the Candidate. The President should get down from his rostrum and give the Candidate the following oath</em>: </p>
<p>I solemnly swear that I will not reveal anything that I have seen or heard here this evening. If I do, may they do to me as they do to me now. </p>
<p><em>The Brother who stands there with a SPANKER should strike the Candidate, causing the spanker to explode, the hoodwinks to be immediately brought down and the President congratulating the Candidate while the Brothers applaud. After the applause is over and while he holds the hand of the Candidate</em> <strong>the President will say</strong>: Speak evil of no one. He who steals my gold steals trash, but he who robs me of my good name enricheth him not but leaveth me poor indeed, I solemnly promise to guard the good name of every member of this Order. I further promise to live by the Golden Rule and ‘Do unto others as I would have them do unto me,’ and guide my actions so that they may be a shining light and example to my fellowmen and let my heart spread the mantle of charity over the actions of every man in his weakness and to help create a spirit of Brotherly Love and Fidelity among men. 
*
Whereupon, the Brothers congratulate the candidate. If, however, the candidate does not give any name then the same procedure can take place charging the candidate with disobedience. Or if the Secretary wishes he may ask the candidate to put down on a piece of paper the secret word and if the Candidate does he can be charged for disclosing a secret and can be tried the same way as heretofore provided. </p>
<p>In many Chapters where they have different devices, electric mats, or chairs, or any of those and they wish to have some fun, either with the same or another Candidate they can do so. Some one of the Brothers gets up and tells the President that he has heard this and that about the Candidate and that he wishes to make sure whether it is so or not, The President then asks the Lodge what is their pleasure and the Lodge answers: Let us try him. </p>
<p>Then the President orders the Captain of the Guard to prepare the Candidate according to the device that they have, but by no means should this take place before the real trial takes place which is one of the most important ports of the initiation. 
After that’s over* <strong>the President will say</strong>: My Brothers, I congratulate you for becoming members of our Order; with the trial that you have witnessed we wish to teach you three lessons: 
Speak evil of no one. If you can not say anything good about a man, say nothing at all. If you did not give anyone’s name, you would be tried just the same for disobeying the officer. With this, we want to teach you that obedience is the paramount duty of every Ahepan. With that I do not mean that you should obey blindly. You have a perfect right to express your opinions in the lodge room, but when the majority speaks, then that is final. And the third lesson that we wish to impress upon your mind is secrecy.”</p>

            , this is a pretty sketchy looking website you're using here as a citation. I'm giving this the "Unverified" flair.

             From the Source's original website: 
STICHTING ARGUS
The Argus Foundation is an independent research and press-agency
Our main topics of research are political, economical, religious and social (power-)structures (so-called parapolitics). We publish on these subjects.
We also conduct research on behalf and on request of others and can train and assist researchers.
For the latter we can also help with Freedom of Information requests.
One of the largest projects of the past years is an inquiry into fraternal organizations, such as Freemasonry, modern chivalric orders and Greek Letter Societies.
A second project is an investigation into reports of Dutch intelligence services to their ministers, the police and other officials.
A part of the collected material is published on this site, another part is published on downloads.
With this site we want to make available a large number of primary sources we have collected over the past years and in that way support research by others, based on this material.

            TLDR
           </p>
           <p>
            My Brothers, I congratulate you for becoming members of our Order; with the trial that you have witnessed we wish to teach you three lessons: Speak evil of no one. If you can not say anything good about a man, SAY NOTHING AT ALL. If you did not give anyone’s name, you would be tried just the same for disobeying the officer. With this, we want to teach you that OBEDIENCE is the PARAMOUNT DUTY of every Ahepan. With that I do not mean that you should obey blindly. You have a perfect right to EXPRESS YOUR OPINIONS IN THE LODGE ROOM, but when the majority speaks, then that is final. And the third lesson that we wish to impress upon your mind is SECRECY.”
