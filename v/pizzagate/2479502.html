            He is a smoke screen. The fact that he is looking at pedophilia in the UK of all places as a Muslim issue and not a systemic issue is problematic. PizzaGate researchers have no use for smoke and mirrors, except to investigate the proponents of said smoke and mirror tactics.

             But here in the U.K. the Muslim pedos ARE a huge issue.  Muslim grooming gangs were allowed to operate, the police covered it up for years....so how exactly is he problematic for exposing this?

               Tommy Robinson is dedicated to stopping the spread of Islam in the West.  If it really is
               <em>
                their agenda
               </em>
               to destroy western civilisation then why would Tommy, being a Zionist as you say, bother exposing Islam?  Why would anyone bother if the infiltration of Islam into Europe is deliberate?
              </p>
              <p>
               What he is doing for Britain and Europe is a really fantastic thing.  It’s refreshing to see a normal man from working class Luton, someone who isn’t “politically correct” speaking out so much and so often.  He is intelligent.  The media and the establishment keep huge Muslim pedo gangs quiet but Tommy Robinson was there 10+ years ago saying the same and being silenced.
              </p>
              <p>
               I do not think is a Zionist or shill or gatekeeper or any of that. I just think he is an honest man, patriotic, putting his neck on the line for the country and his kids future.   Please stop with the accusations, unless you have solid proof.  Thanks.

                Enough said. You're blinded by confirmation bias. You just cherry pick what agrees with you, which is why you take the mainstream media seriously when they say the police did nothing about pedophile rings and grooming gangs for fear of raycismss.

                 Also, that link proves exactly nothing.   It looks like a reporter going on a trip and taking pictures.   There’s no allegiance or alliance, it’s literally just a man posing with a gun for shits and giggles.   You tell me I listen to the MSM, but here you are using the MSM’s words to smear his name.  Hmm....have a pleasant evening.

                  I'm not using their words, I'm using a picture, which says plenty. Moreover, no reporter just goes and shows support to the IDF, which is something he did by standing on top of an Israeli tank proudly. You're using statements, I'm using a picture. One can be a lie, the other just IS.

                 I’m indifferent on the Israel vs Palestine issue.  The issues that affect me, my future, my children’s future, and the future of this country, is Islam.  It is a serious threat to Europe at this very point in time.

                 I don’t believe for a second the police were too scared of being labelled racist.  I can tell that is bullshit as much as you can.  Tommy Robinson knows too so that’s why he’s called it out.   You have to remember it’s difficult to speak freely in England.  Free speech is being eroded.  Sharia law will one day be live and well in the once Great Britain.   God bless Tommy Robinson and others like him for exposing Islam for what it is. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧

              he said the UK is known to have had pedophilia rings among the indigenous elite, so shills like Tommy Robinson redirecting attention to the fraction of the 5% of the population who are Muslims is a harmful distraction.
             </p>
             <p>
              The bigger issue of course is that young British girls are even susceptible to being "groomed" by strangers with drugs and pocket money.  They aren't being stuffed into vans off the street.  How does denying this aspect help anyone? Even without Muslims/Poles/any group the girls would still see their bodies as bargaining chips from being sexualized too early through pop culture, which is produced entire by JEWS, who Tommy Robinson demonstrably loves.

              It is pretty baffling that I have to keep explaining this to adults.

            Its not TR the government uses, its the Russians. The news about the huge scale of child abuse in Rotherham was exposed and two days after that there was a nerve agent attack on a dissident Russian spy and the whole establishment press and government went crazy. The Rotherham scandal was not mentioned in the press after that.

               He criticizes anyone far right / alt-right who goes beyond the anti-islamism angle. He doesn't need to embrace anti semitism and come out talking about the Jews but I hate the fact that he attacks people who are fighting on the same side for roughly the same things. It would be like regular liberals attacking the far left. They just don't do it. They might not agree with everything on the far left but they do shut up about blasting their own side. Tommy Robinson needs to do the same then I won't be so critical.

            the remote and sparsely populated ISRAEL is: "one of the main destinations in the world for trafficked women; it has also consistently appeared as an offender in the annual US State Department's Trafficking in Persons (Tip) report."

            first few seconds of this news report show israeli police breaking through concrete walls to release European sex slaves hidden in tiny cavities (then insulting them).

            ever imported millions of Muslims and will continue to happen as long as the few people who care are following what Tommy Robinson or a pair of nubile young airhead women claim is the real problem.   Which of course is their goal.  "DER DER BUT LOOK AT HOW THEYRE SILENCED, THAT MEANS THEYRE LEGIT" lmao dude get a grip
