<p>Saudi\'s Donate $1 Mil to McCain Institute Then John McCain Lies About It</p>
<p>Arizona Senator John McCain is an outspoken ally of Saudi Arabia and promoter of American Military intervention in Syria on behalf of the Saudis. When it was disclosed Thursday that the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia had donated $1 million dollars to the McCain Foundation, many were left wondering if the Saudi\'s were buying influence with McCain.</p>
<p>The donation became even more suspect when it was discovered it was made in 2014, but wasn\'t publicly disclosed
 until the press started looking into it.</p>
<p>What makes the situation even more suspect is that, when questioned by KPNX Channel 12 in Phoenix, McCain
 attempted to deflect the issue of impropriety by saying he, &quot;had nothing to do with it -- except that they use my name&quot;.</p>
<p>The reality is John McCain has a whole lot to do with the McCain Institute.</p>
<p>McCain founded The McCain Institute in 2012 with money leftover from his failed 2012 Presidential Campaign.</p>
<p>McCain and his wife Cindy are featured prominently in the McCain Foundation\'s introduction video
. On the video McCain says, &quot;I\'m very committed to this partnership with Arizona State University,&quot; 
McCain added, &quot;I\'m really optimistic, there\'s a lot of work to do but, frankly, it\'s the kind of work that I really enjoy.&quot;</p>
<p>CONNECTIONS TO CHILD ENSLAVEMENT IN DUBAI</p>
<p>McCain Fundraiser Hired to Fight Child Enslavement Claims. Peter Madigan, a top McCain fundraiser, lobbies
 for Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, “facing a class-action lawsuit over alleged enslavement
 of boys as jockeys in camel races, has hired several top Washington lobbyists and PR firms to present their case
 to Congress and the public.” The lawsuit alleged “that senior ministers from Dubai conspired to force thousands of underage boys to race camels.” According to The Hill, “The yearlong contract with Johnson Madigan could cost 
the sheikhs’ more than $800,000. Jeffrey Peck, Sen. Joseph Biden’s (D-Del.) former counsel, and Peter Madigan,
 once a State Department official under the first President Bush, signed the subcontract.”</p>',

             Yes  I very much agree.  I read an old article in Rolling Stone tat really opened up my eyes.  He left his ship many times to party onshore and left his shipmates in the lurch.  Imo he is supported by the Old Guard Vets that are also caught up in this mess with him.

            Well those that are against Regulations will be happy to know that McCain voted for everything that HE would benefit from.  Please read the above link to see all the good bills that would have cut into his profits and that of the UAE and others.  The little boys strapped to the camels just breaks my heart.  What happens to those boys afterwards is probably even more heart breaking.  God must make this man suffer.  He deserves it.

            Let's see how much attention this post gets.  Ashton Kutcher blew kisses to McCain not Bernie at the Congressional Report of his THORN org.  McCain is filthy dirty when it comes to our Pizzagate Cause.  Just found this

            and then there is THIS The Sedona Forum
            <a href="https://www.thesedonaforum.org/">
             https://www.thesedonaforum.org/
            </a>
            THE SEDONA FORUM is the McCain Institute’s annual, high-level, private gathering of national and international leaders held each spring at The Enchantment Resort in the red rock country of Sedona, Arizona.

Gen. H.R. McMaster; Actor/Director Ben Affleck; CEOs from GE, Chevron, Walmart-USA, Fedex, Freeport McMoRan and Hewlett Packard; and presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers, experts and civil society leaders from around the world. THANK YOU for Bringing This Up.  EVERY once in a while we need to be reminded HOW DIRTY Johm MCCAIN IS  UPVOAT4U

             To put it bluntly, Ashton Kutcher is a pedophile posing as a protector of children.

              He is disgusting and you can find that by following his life from when he was young that he has been turned into a pedophile.  He also has done it to others I am sure.  McCain and he have a special "friendship".  It is disgusting, imo and so are they individually.
