           The Story of the CIA's "Finders" Abduction Operation

           On February 7th of 1987, the Washington Post ran an interesting story that did not at first seem to have any particularly national significance. The article concerned a case of possible kidnapping and child abuse, and material discovered in the Washington area that they say points to a 1960s style commune called the Finders, described in a court document as a "cult" that conducted "brainwashing" and used children "in rituals." DC police who searched the Northeast Washington warehouse linked to the group removed large plastic bags filled with color slides, photographs and photographic contact sheets. Some showed naked children involved in what appeared to be "cult rituals," bloodletting ceremonies of animals and one photograph of a child in chains.

            &lt;&lt;  The work of Hermann Nitsch shares a weird similarity with the Finders Cult in the ritual disembowling and skinning of animals while specifically wearing white robes.

            This case is well known, well documented and well covered up! Watch some of Ted Gundersons's videos. He investigated this when he was in the FBI and retired. This program still exists today but has been renamed. They are experimenting on children, utilizing satanic ritual abuse as a form of mind control. It all traces back to the CIA's remote viewing programs like Project Monarch and Project MKUltra.

            I've done quite a bit of research, but can't find a connection to pizzagate.  I've traced down to his grandkids. Marion Pettie had 2 sons - George &amp; David. George still lives in the DC area &amp; David died of cancer in 2009 ( I think). The family still owns property in Virginia that originally was owned by Marion.  David's widow, daughter &amp; son now live in some sort of compound on the Island of Maui in Hawaii. They seem to be Budist (ish). I have more info if you would like.

            Don't forget that the CIA made this a secret internal matter and shut down the investigation completely, &amp; the warehouse is right next to Georgetown University. (cough John Podesta COUGH CIA) Also one of the individuals mentioned with shady visas from China or North Korea was supposed to be a "student" at Georgetown.
