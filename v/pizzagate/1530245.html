              is 100% in CPP. Check video recon here with shots of the back "party room" and stop it from 5:29 to 6:03. You can even see the blue ping pong table folded up in frame 5:50

              What I noticed that no one has talked about is that the floor is about 3 feet deeper after the renovations. That is an illegal modification to the building. And maybe they did it to make a stage where bands can perform back there as well. Notice how he goes down stairs at around 5:29 and then back up at 5:50.

              The other stores in that development all have basements so why wouldn't CPP in the front?

              CPP has an extended back section, where the said instagram photos from 1 above are located. That must have been added on after the strip mall was built way back when.

              "We don't even have a basement" doesn't mean that his other restaurant, Bucks doesn't technically lease the basement space and make his statement legally accurate at the time he said it.  Don't forget JA is surrounded by lawyers in his circles so they come up with this shit all the time to CYA.

            The problem we have had with the two images showing the digging is that people have misinterpreted the images and the angles they are taken from. In the first image, the close up of the hole

            note the wall behind with the breeze blocks in an almost striped pattern with two rows of brick in between and note how the right hand side of that wall and the wall to the right go together to make an almost "Z" shaped brick pattern. Now look at the second image;
            <a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/0aab857046.jpg">

            </a>
            in the far corner directly behind the Black guy doing the digging we see the corner in question; Breeze blocks in a striped pattern on the left with two rows of brick in between and the "Z" shaped brickwork that goes onto the right wall.
The ping pong table suggests it is at, or very close to, Comet ping pong. There is no reason for a ping pong table to be miles away at the Pajama factory.

            Maybe someone can clarify for me why it is important to identify where the digging was taking place? There was speculation earlier that perhaps it was an attemp to connect with the underground tunnels, or to identify construction violations, but I haven't been keeping up.

             couple reasons = JA claimed Comet does not have a basement
            </p>
            <p>
             if this proves there IS a basement, why is he lying about it and what happens there?
            </p>
            <p>
             why are they renovating without permits, a space that supposedly doesnt exist??
            </p>
            <p>
             not sure if tunnels are involved, but very well could be - it is just one small aspect of the case
            </p>
            <p>
             I do recall there was a private party at Comet and the instructions were to enter Buck's Fishing and Camping to get there - which is 2 doors down
            </p>
            <p>
             but to catch him in a lie about the basement, well now...that would be interesting

            There was another thread that pretty much proved the construction was taking place next door to CPP. The place to the left of it from the street. There is even a ping pong table in one of the pictures and a shot where you can see CPP through the door.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a door in the same spot inside CPP that seems to have been covered/bricked up. I guess they just use the back door now.

            I can't tell you how many times I've argued this point and just get pushed back with no counter proof. Don't expect anyone to agree with you. The dig room is absolutely positively next to Comet in McCoulough Construction. They are the same building with different store fronts.

              Thank you for agreeing with me, you're the first one. I'm not aware of their timeline but that would make sense. McCoulough has fake windows and probably a fake second floor. One guy pointed out there's a secret passage in the walls which makes me think of hiding things if a raid happened and also allowing people to peep into comet to watch the kids.

            Sorry, this isn't definitive proof of anything. Where's the shoulder height brick with the two parallel running lines? Brick is brick. It looks pretty much the same wherever it is. II still need proof that this is Pajama Factory also, though.
