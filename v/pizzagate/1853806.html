            They just caught two more child porn users in San Francisco. One is a psychiatrist. With so many arrests for this here lately, I
 really think they stumbled onto a ring.

            In March 2017, the SFPD Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Unit began an investigation into an individual who was uploading and trading child pornography on the internet.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the result of the investigation the ICAC unit was able to identify the suspect as Billy Lockhart, a 36 year-old San Francisco resident. Lockhart was identified as Psychiatrist employed by the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Investigators determined that Lockhart was using UCSF Wi-Fi internet to upload child pornography.
           </p>
           <p>
            On May 9, 2017, SFPD investigators served a search warrant at Lockhart’s residence in San Francisco on the 100 block of Buena Vista Terrace. During the search warrant investigators located numerous media devices belonging to Lockhart, which all contained hundreds of child pornography videos and images. Investigators were able to gather evidence that Lockhart was also viewing child pornography . Another resident a t the home was also arrested, 33 year-old Benjamin Martin.

            New Cache of child porn busted reported today. Tiburon babysitter took naked pics of children he babysat. 10, 000 pictures and shared with a teacher, Boy Scout leader in Aptos. Follows cop guilty plea to child porn and the Marin County Coroner arrested a few days ago for raping a child in his family. Coroner was also a photographer and posted creepy pictures. I think they found something on the coroner's computer that led to this, possibly.

            Yes there seems to be. But are there high profile folks involved, either as part of the ring, or covering it up, is our question. The news you link mentions
            <strong>
             camp counselors, teachers and baby sitters
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            This is important regarding child sex trafficking, but not so regarding pizzagate. These persons were searched by the feds and are waiting for court decision, so everything seems to be as it should be - You need to find something more to make this a part of our investigations.

             Read this thread where Marin residents post about Aquino and other cults and the corrupt family court. It is no secret the family court here is corrupt. I am actually scared posting this because I have met some of these people and they get mean. I have been screamed at because I did not want to associate with a self-proclaimed witch or participate in meditations 
and visualizations.

             "I think EVERYONE is grappling with the whys of what the court in this county is doing. Why are children being taken from good parents and given to abusive parents--thereby creating a new generation of victims/abusers? Money? Favoritism? Corruption? Social engineering? Bribes? Federal monetary incentives? All of the above? The number one question EVERYONE asks when they hear about family court problems is--WHY ARE THE COURTS DOING THIS at the obvious expense of the children?"

              I experienced the same. These people become frenzied if you don't follow along with whatever bullshit comes out of their mouths. Then they will whisper gossip how bad a person you are. I studied Buddhism for a long time in an Asian monastery and then settled in SF. I was shocked at how they twisted the teachings to conform to weird agendas and often mentioned it to people in charge (of the meditation centers) and they accused ME of making trouble and BEING WORLDY as opposed to spiritual. Always with a fucking smug attitude. The monastery I stayed at in Asia were really into correct translation and understanding of the original texts and accuracy was required in all teachings. But it's like westerners get into this stuff and then use it to manipulate people and push agendas that are dangerous and not at all connected to Buddhism. This was long ago and I want nothing to do with this type of person anymore, but what a wasted period of my life, spending it in that hub of batshit crazy.

              I lived in SF around that time, very near the William's house. I can't count how many times random aquaintances invited me to a channeling session. People I met once, randoms at a party, talking to a stranger while waiting in line for a restaurant, you name it. That area is majority new agers and kooky spiritual types, even normal looking people will come out with this shit after a short conversation.

               he project consisted of a web of CIA-run safehouses in San Francisco, Marin, and New York City. It was established in order to study the effects of LSD on unconsenting individuals. Prostitutes on the CIA payroll were instructed to lure clients back to the safehouses, where they were surreptitiously plied with a wide range of substances, including LSD, and monitored behind one-way glass. Several significant operational techniques were developed in this theater, including extensive research into sexual blackmail, surveillance technology, and the possible use of mind-altering drugs in field operations.

               IT has long been rumored here that Harvey Milk and George Mosconi were pedophiles supplied by Jim Jones when he was Director of the Housing Authority. White lost it when Guyana happened (not justifying the assassinations). 
Jones corpse was discovered in a bed he was sharing with a 5 or six year old boy, whom he had shot in the head.

                I grew up thinking Milk and Harry Britt were local heroes, because it was relentlessly drummed into my head. On watching the Milk movie I was disturbed and had questions. Finding out the truth about the LGBT movement and Milk's open lust for underage was quite a shock. That dovetailed with the Jim Jones cult, which I was then researching.

                I didn't know he was found with a child - source? I have listened to the death tape and he clearly says to an assistant "get Dwyer out of here" that's Richard Dwyer, his CIA buddy embedded with him.

                The woman at this timestamp, Deb Lawson, is always featured in the docs about Jonestown. What is not mentioned is that her father was CIA in the Georgetown Guyana office and her brother was one of the zombified shooters on the tarmac that killed several people.

                 The custody battle over John Victor Stoen was the crux of Jonestown. Jim Jones’ claim of paternity created a situation in which he could not leave Jonestown. Former Temple loyalist Tim Stoen joined his wife Grace in fighting Jim Jones for custody of the boy, who had been moved to Guyana along with many Temple members. Initially, Tim Stoen had approved of the move and thought that John would be safe in Peoples Temple, but he eventually came forward to stand with Grace in her request that the boy be returned to her. The battle over John raged throughout Jonestown’s final year, and was heavy on the minds of the people who lived there. It became such a hot topic that on November 18, 1978, when Jones was calling his people to commit “Revolutionary Suicide”, Christine Miller invoked John’s name in her plea for life “You would see the little ones die, even John?” she asked Jones. It wasn’t just a rhetorical device. She knew – and she wanted to remind everyone, especially Jones – how much energy those at Jonestown had invested in the child, how insistent Jones had been that John Victor was his own flesh and blood, and how John must be protected at any cost.

                 This is the boy, John John. But it does not include the part about where his body was found. Some. of this I know because I know.

                   Larry shot and wounded two people at the Port Kaituma airstrip on 18 November 1978, and he attempted to shoot a third. The shootings took place on one of the airplanes which were to take the party of Congressman Leo Ryan to Georgetown after his visit to Jonestown. Extradited to the U.S. after a Guyana jury found him not guilty of murder, Larry was tried twice on four charges related to the shootings, including Conspiracy to Kill a Congressman. The first trial ended in a hung jury. A second jury convicted Larry, although four jurors took what the trial judge called an “unprecedented” step of asking for leniency in Larry’s sentencing.

             Just don't join a church that pushes the commie/oneworld shit. They have mostly been subverted by predatory groups.  I'd love to find a church that was against the refugee invasion and all for America first. But they seem to worship Africans and others that hate us more than our own poor. My family is like this, I speak from experience.

              I am a Catholic, and you won't believe the shit I hear. We had a Mass, but before Eucharist, a woman from Catholic Charities spoke about the migrants soon to come to my area.  If I had another parish readily available I'd go. It makes me sick.

               I would believe it. I read refugeeresettlementwatch.wordpress.com and that blog goes into detail of how all religions in the USA are complicit in resettling these people. All for money, of course. Fucking Bishops pushing for more of it

               What to do? Is there any Catholic Church that doesn't support this?  I found this site but it needs a list of churches that are safe, if they even exist.

                Traditionalist Catholic churches that still say the Mass in Latin and employ other forms of pre-Vatican 2 worship are usually far more conservative, but they are much rarer than the "infiltrated" ones.

              I present to you one of the WISEST men in the world :
              <strong>
               Russian Patriarch Kyrill of the Eastern Orthodox Church
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              He answers the refugee crisis question from 8:35 to 11:30 and I really suggest you hear what he has to say about Trump, the LGBTQ community and same sex marriage and the Liberal agenda of the Western World.

               I didn't listen to it all but when Krill met with the Pope, I thought something strange was going on.  Then Krill went to the Antarctic? Ummm...why? To hang out with penguins?

                Lol, I know that lots of theories are going on about Antartica, but I don't think there's a problem with him going there on a trip. Hell, I'd love to go there myself if I was invited... And yes, he met with Pope Francis, but lots of other religious leaders do. There's nothing to suggest that Kyrill has done anything bad.
