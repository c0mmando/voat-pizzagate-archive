&quot;Mark Goldring, who took up the post in 2013, was at the helm when news broke this year regarding sexual abuse of victims of the Haiti earthquake in 2011 by then members of the charity’s staff.</p>
<p>He said: “Following the very public exposure of Oxfam’s past failings, we have redoubled our efforts to ensure that Oxfam is a safe and respectful place for all who have contact with us.</p>
<p>“We are now laying strong foundations for recovery.</p>
<p>“I am personally totally committed to seeing this phase through.</p>
<p>“However, what is important in 2019 and beyond is that Oxfam rebuilds and renews in a way that is most relevant for the future and so continues to help as many people as possible around the world build better lives.</p>
<p>“I think that this journey will best be led by someone bringing fresh vision and energy and making a long-term commitment to see it through.”</p>
<p>Mr Goldring also led the charity’s response to conflicts in Yemen, Syria, and South Sudan.
He is due to stay in his post until a successor is found.</p>

CREDIT: PA Oxfam Chief Executive Officer Born: 8 March 1957 (age 61) Education: Keble College, Oxford Appointed Oxfam CEO: May 2013</p>
<p>Goldring has always been involved in humanities work, having began his career with the Voluntary Service Overseas VSO, an international development organisation. Goldring was awarded a CBE in 2008 for services to tackling poverty and disadvantage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The two-month suspension came after charity chiefs revealed Oxfam has received 26 allegations of misconduct since the Haiti sex scandal erupted two weeks ago.
Mark Goldring, Oxfam GB\'s chief executive, said 16 of the claims stemmed from abroad, while 10 came from the UK.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Beleaguered Oxfam trustee Caroline Thomson, who made a \'full and unqualified apology\' to Britain and Haiti, is no stranger to being at the vortex of a major corporate scandal.
In a previous role at the BBC, she was dragged into the controversy over the cover-up of paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile\'s activities, as well as a row over excessive pay-offs for BBC executives.</p>
<p>There was widespread criticism of Ms Thomson — who uses her maiden name rather than her title by marriage, Lady Liddle — when, before she became chairman of Oxfam\'s trustees, she left the BBC (where she was chief operating officer) with a £670,000 pay-off — more than twice her £330,000 salary.&quot;</p>

            The name Lady Caroline Thomson is now out in the open.  Savile was a nasty embarrassment to the Royals when the news came out about him.  Mostly because it is bad press, not that they have any morals.

            A huge payoff by the BBC whose head is not the head of the NYT.  Wonder what he rally knows.

             According to Larouche:
            </p>
            <p>
             “In the early 1970s, the LTTE (Tamil Tigers) began establishing training camps and secret arms caches under the cover of a chain of Refugee and Rehabilitation Farms of the Gandhian Society.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <strong>
               “Funds for the farms came from Oxfam (Oxford Famine Relief), one of the most powerful and secretive British intelligence organizations acting under non-governmental organization cover…
              </strong>
              "
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             "..“John Glover, a British feature writer, wrote to the Western Mail in Wales about the ongoing and future training programs for Tamil youth by British mercenaries.
            </p>
            <p>
             “A band of mercenary soldiers recruited in South Wales is training a Tamil army to fight for a separate state in Sri Lanka. About 20 mercenaries were signed up after a meeting in Cardiff and have spent the last two months in southern India preparing a secret army to fight the majority Sinhalas, in the cause of a separate Tamil state in Sri Lanka,” he said…
            </p>
            <p>
             “According to accounts by retired officials of the Israeli secret service, the Mossad, the Israelis were simultaneously training the Sri Lanka Army and the Tigers, and providing arms to each.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Victor Ostrovsky, author of By Way of Deception, told Indian Abroad news service in 1991 that the Tigers were trained in Israel in 1985. “These groups kept coming and going. It was part of our routine job to take them to training camps and make sure that they were getting training worth what they paid for, not more and not less.” The groups paid in cash.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Ostrovsky said that the arrangement for the training was made by the Mossad liaison in India, who lived there under a British passport."

                 The very word black in law means civiltus mortuus..who controls the industry of law ...the people who designated a people ..negro..ie necro...dead jn the eyes of civil law...made them dead to their iwn history as well...which group did that ..
..and still does that..
The only difference today is that legally we all carry a registere name that is a dead legal fiction trust..which is controlled by the civil government ..running a papl war under licence of dum diversas 
..the courts are adninistrative courts running the roman occupation and accounting system..
What i do know is that this accounting system was run by the true tribe of judah ...and was stolen and is being run in reverse undrr the principles of war ..ie we r lost in a war game...the first people they got to blindfold were the so called blacks ..of both east and west ..then they moved them about and geographically got them lost

              This is the BBC Journalist who is so anti-Israel and soooooo pro-Palestinian (no hiding her bias) its quite sickening to watch when she reports on the Middle East, pretending to be fair news.  I even noticed this years before I even knew anything about fake news! -

             Sat on the edge of my seat reading all of this. Wow. The connections don't just wrap around the world in the here and now. More chains of those evil doers that go back in time are being exposed. Thank you God for your Light. Please continue to surround everyone investigating and kicking down doors with your Holy Angels. In Jesus Name Amen.
Fantastic post.
