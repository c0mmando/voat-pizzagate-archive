            My life was destroyed when my husband sent me packing, after 13 years we have been together. I was lost and helpless after  trying so many ways to my husband back to me. One day at work, I was distracted, not knowing that my boss called me, so he  sat and asked me what it was all about, I told him and he smiled and said it was no problem. I never understood what he  meant by it was no problem getting back my husband, he said he used a spell to get back his wife when she left him for  another man, and now they are together till date and initially I was shocked hearing something from my boss. He gave me an  email address of the Prophet Abuvia which helped him get his wife back, I never believed that this would work, but I had no  choice coming into contact with the sayings that I get done, and he asked for my information and that my husband was able  to propose to throw him the spell and I sent him the details, but after two days, my mother called me that my husband was  pleading that he wants me back, I never believed, because it was just a dream and I had to rush off to my mother's place  and to my greatest surprise, was kneeling my husband beg me  for forgiveness that he wants me and the child back home, when  I gave prophet Abuvia a conversation regarding sudden change of my husband and he made clear to me that my husband will  love me until the end of the world, that he will never leave for another woman. Now me and my husband is back together and  started doing funny things he has not done before, he makes me happy and do what it is supposed to do as a man without  nagging. Please if you need help of any kind need, please contact Prophet Abuvia for help. His email is

            Regarding
            <strong>
             Heather Locklear
            </strong>
            ...NEVER EVER FORGET she was married to the unbelievably insane
            <strong>
             "TOMMY LEE"
            </strong>
            , ex-husband of
            <strong>
             Pamela Anderson
            </strong>
            who is now (allegedly)
            <strong>
             Julian Assange
            </strong>
            's girl toy...oh what a tangled web!
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Tommy Lee
            </strong>
            is about as envelope pushing as they come so don't think for one second that little Miss Locklear is an angel....

             God, we have to know these people lead wild lives, but those videos!  Good God.  They all deserve to be outed just for the lying lives they promoted to us.  Not to mention all their messed up kids the world will have to deal with.

            It could be Heather Locklear. She didn't lose custody, but Sambora did just take the little girl. He kept saying how he wanted to spend lots of time with his daughte and dropped out of Bon Jovi to do it.

             Problem with that, I just realized, sheen married the women he met when she did a guest spot on Spin City
            </p>
            <p>
             Engaged in 2001 yr they met and married in 2002

             Denise Richards
            </p>
            <p>
             They divorced in 2006 and it was nasty
            </p>
            <p>
             Heather  and Ritchie divorced 2007
            </p>
            <p>
             Heather filed Feb 2006
            </p>
            <p>
             Ritchie went for joint custody with reinforced prenup
            </p>
            <p>
             Ritchie quit Bon Job I in 2013
            </p>
            <p>
             I tell ya, reading both Heather and Ritchie past, it's a wonder Ava made it this far
            </p>
            <p>
             Really dysfunctional, depressing, so I done with this
            </p>
            <p>
             Time wise these blinds are never solid,  so maybe it is them,  Ritchie did go out with Denise Richards at some point
            </p>
            <p>
             All that money and oh so miserable

              There are also stories that he was blindsided by Heather filing for divorce, but then there's another account where he told her to file. That makes more sense. And the cover story was that he cheated on Heather with .... Denise Richards! Heather's bff and was Sheen's also. One big incestuous family.
             </p>
             <p>
              He entered rehab in 2011, but that could have been a cover story to get Ava help.

                The police should have arrested him. If she leveled the charge in court, they should have followed up on it. It's not her decision to make. But Sambora never put that out there. Locklear filed for divorce, according to rumors, at his insistence.

                HL and CS should both be in goddamn jail if it's them and they did do this. So disgusting.

                Yes, it was ugly, but she discovered he was a pedo. That's what's alleged in the divorce papers.
               </p>
               <p>
                And I'm just so goddamned happy that after some people find out their spouses are MOLESTING THEIR OWN CHILD they don't go to the police. Not talking about Richards because she did put it right there in the divorce. It's addressed to Mia Farrow and RICHIE SAMBORA if the blind item is about his ex-wife. It's really nice that he didn't want to ruin her career with felony charges and a stint in prison.

            Heather NEVER lost custody of Eva, so unless that part wrong, she's not the mother
           </p>
           <p>
            One mother, who eventually lost custody was Lisa  Bonet
           </p>
           <p>
            Zoe was born in 1988
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1993, when Zoe was 5, Lisa and Kenny Kravitz divorced
           </p>
           <p>
            When Zoe was 11 she moved in with her Dad permanently and just visits her Mom
           </p>
           <p>
            Zoe struggled with anorexia and bulimia through out high school
           </p>
           <p>
            What I'm not sure of is who the co star is
           </p>
           <p>
            She worked with Malclom Jamal Warner
           </p>
           <p>
            He was seeing Michelle Thomas at the time of show
           </p>
           <p>
            She worked on Cosby show from 1988-1990
           </p>
           <p>
            She then worked on Family Matters 1993 till her death in 1998 of cancer
           </p>
           <p>
            Malcolm and Michelle split at some time, cant find date, but since Cosby show went longer then 1990, because Lisa came back after 1 season of Different world with a yr off having Zoe, she got fired in 91 , I'd say she left when Lisa came back in 90
           </p>
           <p>
            Other costar could be Hakeem Harrison, co star in Different World, they hooked back up in some movie later on,  he works on Disney show with Zendaya
           </p>
           <p>
            Haven't looked into him yet
           </p>
           <p>
            Fits timeline and breadcrumbs better
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the son who is now hooked on drugs, I still looking into it,  will get to it as soon as I can
           </p>
           <p>
            Just wanted to get this up
           </p>
           <p>
            Will check more on Charlie and see if any other Mothers would fit

             She didn't lose custody. Richie Sambora just took the little girl. He dropped out of Bon Jovi because he wanted to spend time with he so Heather did not have her daughter.

               Something like that. I just remember he had the child. It's why he didn't go on tour. And it was joint custody, but the daughter was with Sambora. Oh, wait a minute ... wait, a minute. Lookie here:

                Heather filed for divorce in 2006 and Richie’s filed for joint custody the next month. In 2007, the divorce was finalized. In 2011, Locklear announced her engagement to Jack Wagner — her Melrose Place co-star — however, in November of the same year it was called off.

               No, it had to be Sheen. Don't know that she starred opposite Wagner before. And she got in trouble for defending Sheen.

            I was re-reading the original script of Robocop recently (sad git, I know!), mostly for the original opening scene which would've shown Officer Frank Frederickson and his colleagues being gunned down by Clarence Boddicker &amp; his gang rather than the audience just hearing about it in the opening Media Break clip ("You give us 3 minutes and we'll give you the world").  This time, however, I read to the very end and apparently, the original script had the film ending with another Media Break report which would've included, among other things, Bixby Snyder (the lecherous, old "I'd buy that for a dollar" guy) leaving court after having been charged with coercing sexual favours from his underage co-stars (in exchange for job security) on the 'It's Not My Problem' show which we get little glimpses of throughout the film.  It reminded me of the previous CDAN blind item which I read probably referring to poor Heather O'Rourke.  Now Robocop's a great old action sci-fi film, of course, but it's also quite a clever satire, and I have to wonder whether the writers, Ed Neumeier &amp; Michael Miner merely had a warped sense of humour or if they knew of the appalling practices in Paedowood.  There's many a true word spoken in jest, as the old saying goes...

            Pretty disgusting. Don't know how Locklear would spill the beans, as she was part of it. Wonder how many people Sheen has abused over the years. He should be locked up.

            Yes, the story is really nauseating so I have to know Sheen is part of it.  He is in a class by himself.  I don't know how many people said they wanted throw up after reading it.  That's another Tip Off that it's CS.  Heather's 5 yr. Old Daughter?  Yeah, sounds like Charlie.

              Stephanie Seymour has two sons both of which are gay and one likes to photograph her in provocative clothing. She also had a daughter, Lily (Lilith) who she is barely ever at home with, she’s left to nannies and is a lost child. Her husband Peter Brandt is heavily into art and they are Luciferians. He is a Freemason and made most of his cash scamming pension funds as a banker. Poor Stephanie never had a chance though, she was thrown into modeling as a kid and that’s all she ever knew. She was in a relationship with John Casablanca of Elite agency when she was just 14 sleeping with him. She was unchaperoned in Europe for modeling at 13. She’s also an addict sadly.

               I remember Beau Biden's widow and his brother started boning right after he died. But, it's the Biden's, so that's about right.

                No, it was an Australian somebody? Was it Australian? I think so. Her husband died ... and the brother took her out to make her feel better ... cheer her up ... I guess that involves groping and sticking your hand on her crotch. And that was on the beach where pics were being taken.

              Do they not all just make you want to throw up?  Some of the stories with adults are sickening enough, Debauchery at it's worst, but when it starts including a parent pulling a child into bed with another adult, that is the worst, imo.  Is hat child able to file charges?  I think whoever she is living with is lax as well.  He should have taken her straight to a lawyer and filed charges against that piece of vermin she calls her mother.  No wonder there are so many problems in Hollywood. If the producers and directors are not messing with the child actors, then there parents are.  Stop Going To The Movies.

                  Wow.  Bunga Bunga as in Berlusconi parties?  Remember the girl that was caught up in that scandal?  She was Middle Eastern.  She may have been underage as well, or procuring girls for him.

                This is all pretty depressing.  Just when you think you have read it all something else pops up.  The one from today with Epstein and Prince Andrew and possibly Richard Branson or how about Geller is another mystery.  There is no shortage of nasty stories for Enty.  This could go on for quite some time.

                 the copperfield one is UNBELIEVEABLE!! Especially as close ties to Epstein. Should it be posted as a separate submission??
