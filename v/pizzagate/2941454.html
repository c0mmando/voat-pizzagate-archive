<p>Young Boy From \'Jewish Taliban\' Reveals Physical, Sexual Abuse: \'Hell Is Real, I Live There\'</p>
<p>Boy, 14, tells of men in Lev Tahor cult, now in Mexico</p>
<p>&quot;I’ve lived in Lev Tahor for 12 and a half years and I want to tell you everything,” the boy says. “I’ve been living in this hell that everyone claims is made up and untrue – it is true. I want to tell you about the things that are happening in Lev Tahor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wrote down on a piece of paper all of the things I want to talk about,” he continues. “Bad things are happening here. First, I want to tell about XXXX. He is a bad teacher. He does bad things to children. He hits children, kicks them and does other bad things.”</p>
<p>The boy continues to charge that another member of the group “killed a baby and another man. He hits and kicks all of the children.” He added that the men he named “undressed me and beat me and kicked me many times. And did bad things to me many times. At first, I thought they were good Jews. But then I saw they were bad people.”</p>
<p>The group, the rabbi said, had only crossed the border to Mexico three weeks ago, after three years of living in multiple locations in Guatemala. They left, he said, because they feared apprehension by Israeli authorities. Families of Lev Tahor members have been pressuring the Israeli government for years to assist them in repatriating their relatives, claiming they are being drugged and abused, and that underage girls were regularly married off to older men. The group fled Canada three years ago, after authorities there investigated allegations that Lev Tahor was physically and sexually abusing children, and removed some of them from their homes.</p>

            This started in Quebec around the year 2000, I remember how it briefly made the news because the media was focusing on the children.
           </p>
           <p>
            Translated from article :
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The more than 200 members of the ultra-orthodox Lev Tahor community settled in Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts in the Laurentians in the early 2000s. They fled to Chatham-Kent, Ontario, in November 2013, and a few months later later, in Guatemala.
            </p>
            <p>
             The DPJ ( Quebec CPS)  had stepped up interventions to remove children from the community because it feared that some girls under 14 would be forcibly married. The sect lived on its own, and the children were brought up in fear of others and under dubious rules of hygiene.
            </p>
            <p>
             For its part, the Sûreté du Québec (provincial police) suspected community leaders of engaging in human trafficking and the production of false documents. The sect has always denied these allegations, which have not been proven in court.
            </p>
           </blockquote>

             I love how Quebec is nationalist enough to have no time for this fucking shit. Even standard ultra-Orthodox Jews get shat on by Quebecers for their weird customs.

            I'm wondering why you guys still bother. Jews control 90% of the media and our entire financial system. At this point, pizzagate is like dogs whining that their owner didn't give them an extra bone.
