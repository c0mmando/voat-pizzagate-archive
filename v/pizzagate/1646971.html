            do we need a history lesson here? is that really fucking necessary? khazars are "jews" since 800ad. the rothschilds were the synagogue of satan in late 1700's used adam weishaupt to foment multiple revolutions. oliver cromwell etc. very well documented. then they used albert pike to plan 3 world wars. these people are not jews they are zionists. yiddish and hebrew are 2 completely different languages. i dont have anything against the jews. gavin is a fucking shill though. they are all fucking shills how is this hard to understand? jesus christ. his boss is ezra levant. he is pushing the destruction of white people agenda without much skill or subtlety. says he supports white nationalist views and then says western instead of white. hes a sellout liar. are you fucking kidding me? every party competing for white house waas OWNED BY ISRAEL/ROTHSCHILDS. have u heard of balfour declaration? how about jews being kicked out of every fucking country for their underhandedness? these are facts. im have no doubt that most jews are good people but the fact remains that those in control have chosen judaism as a cover. no they are not jews they are zionists and on top of that satanists. there is nothing fictitious or insane about these claims. they are fact. go read a book. perhaps pawns in the game by william guy carr
they are and always have been khazars, who were hated by their neighbors for stealing and murdering kids and practising black magic. this shit has been going on for over a thousand years, and the zionists knew about the holocaust before it happened. purpose to kill palestinian jews so that balfour declaration wouldnt matter and they could take israel. 
gavin's boss is EZRA LEVANT. can you fucking read? do some goddamn research. they are all zionist shills and on top ofthat satanist shills. gavin will talk about a lot but he wont touch the jews. wonder why? anti semitism is a fucking joke.
im gonna link one or two things but do your own research and widen your scope. fuck me, are my fingers the only ones not broken here? is google that fucking hard to use?

            "The general consensus among the far right is the West’s open-border immigration policies are the result of Jewish meddling.
           </p>
           <p>
            They insist the Jews wanted to wipe out the goyim and are committing white genocide by using immigrants to outnumber us to death. If that’s the case, they’ve made a real dog’s breakfast of it. In Europe, there is no group that gets more hatred from immigrants than the Jews. We saw this when that Israeli journalist walked through the streets of Paris. He might as well have been in Germany in the 1940s. In Sweden, Jewish groups are begging the government to clamp down on immigration. There’s a massive Jewish exodus going on in Europe right now that rivals WWII.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other effect mass immigration has had is a huge boon for neo-Nazis. As Michael Moynihan pointed out on Bill Maher’s show, ten years ago the “Sweden Democrats” were only for skinheads and got barely 2% of the vote. Today, they are the most popular party in the country. The exact same thing happened to Denmark. It’s mainstream to be a right wing extremist today and it’s all because of terrible immigration polic-es. The Syrian influx is only going to make things more severe (Denmark said no to all of them).
           </p>
           <p>
            So, if you’re gong to get all conspiracy theory-y about it, there’s a better case for saying neo-Nazis are behind the open-border politics because they’re the ones who benefitted. They got way more power and way less Jews.
           </p>
           <p>
            I don’t think either theories are true. The government imported more dependents because they thought it meant more people relying on them and subsequently more votes. They have done more damage than the evilest Nazi or the most cartoon Machiavellian Jew. Let’s come together Nazis, Jews, and average Joes, and focus on the real enemy, the government."

           <p>
            who owns the governments? the bankers- the jews(not actual jews zionist satanists). holy fuck
whats that quote about controlling money and not caring about law makers? they have followed this logic for literally a thousand years. jesus fucking christ

             yeah i cant even name a person who i trust because they have all sold their souls. bought and paid for. do you not understand that everything given to use by "famous people" is an act? even if there is truth, even if they are being genuine, it doesnt matter because they are being controlled
jon rappaport 
richard presser
catherine austin fitts (do not entirely trust her)
lada ray
mostly people unheard of
not much to trust out there imho

Anyone is free to believe whatever they want. 
But please don't name call me on this; especially when you obviously are not familiar with the evidence.

            You are the Sophist.
Fallacy #1
           </p>
           <p>
            I discussed the alleged "difference in age" Liar. And gave citations with photo evidence.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nor the physical attributes which remained the same - i.e. teeth. 
I demonstrated, with links to photos, evidence as the the "look" both before and after the alleged death.
           </p>
           <p>
            Peruse those photos, and make up your own mind. But do read the evidence first; otherwise you prove your ignorance by your opinion on something you don't, apparently, know anything about
           </p>
           <p>
            Fallacy #2

           </p>

            No . ! absolute sign:"that's all you've got" i.e. name - calling..
           </p>
           <p>
            Fallacy #3
           </p>
           <p>
            I have no idea what you are referring to bandying the word "scientific"
           </p>
           <p>
            Fallacy #4
           </p>
           <p>
            People make fun of the idea, that makes it wrong.
           </p>
           <p>
            U struck out. 
Try to read the article first, but I guess since you can't disprove it, it's better to ignore the evidence, right?

            "On Monday February 27th, 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing The Global Intelligence Files, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered “global intelligence” company Stratfor. The e-mails date between July 2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal’s Dow Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show Stratfor’s web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods."

            I'm sorry if I wasn't clear:
I'm saying he is an actor - which is a real person. I'm saying he's a lifetime actor who has played two roles.

            No he doesn't. The old childhood pictures are photoshopped.

            I met him. He's a fraud.

            Do some math and look at some  photos. 
He's likely being blackmailed.

            This is a garbage video. This topic is not for entertainment purposes, and regardless of his conclusion, he was trying to be amusing, entertaining and was putting on a show with his Burger King bag and drink. Anyone that is putting being a personality as a priority over a serious investigation on this top[ic, is a troll or just somebody who needs to be distance from. Down vote.

            Yep, there's nothing fun about the early stages of digging into this shit. It's one big bummer to take on board just how shitty and low people can be, people with really no reason or cause to be. Just because they
            <em>
             like
            </em>
            being shitty and low.

            But he's a great shitlord and he'll find his shitlording voice on this subject eventually, and it'll be a great thing to witness.

            People with public profiles who have been openly talking about Pizzagate have a habit of suddenly talking extreme nonsense the next day.
           </p>
           <p>
            There's some thought that they've been "talked to" by somebody scary and it's their way of backing down under threat. And sounding like a nut is more convincing than some robotic statement that you no longer believe the vile scandalous thing you believed yesterday.

            I love Gavin, but even the most 'conservative ' talk people missed the boat on this....wake the FUCK UP before it's too late! How dare you dismiss their crimes, even for a minute? You want to bury your heads in the sand, while children are raped, tortured, cannibalized? You should have publicized this from the beginning---cowards!!!! That's why I don't mind Seaman, at least he ran with it, believed it might be true....

            He does a great job in this video, giving enough information to get his audience to question the validity of Pizzagate. He doesn't try to spell out copious amounts of overwhelmingly information; his demeanor is more like "let's take a look into this together" while being logical. He comes off sounding like a normal guy, just looking for answers. I think the way he approaches the subject will appeal to the fence-sitters, turning them to believers.

               I see Maddog. Prove to me that "Bill Hicks" is buried in his parent's backyard. Show me the death certificate. If you can't do that, according to your own logic, you do not know all the details and therefore do not understand the situation.

               Also, to bring up something that has direct link to Pizzagate .. For one, in the interview "Alex Jones" did with Dr. Steve P. , "Jones" had to be re-assured that when all this came down, which Dr. P. was laying out, that he, "Jones," would be alright for the work he did in the Alt Media.
              </p>
              <p>
               That was implied in their interchange.
              </p>
              <p>
               You can see the fear on "Jones'" face as Dr. P is talking; and that could partly explain "Jones'" non-stop interruption of Dr. P.
              </p>

              <p>
               The notion "Jones" is short on money and has to hock vitamins and vitality remedies is total mis-direction. While in England, on radio, Jones bragged about the oil wells he owns. I assume he's paid for his job. And the vitamin shtick is just to mis-direct people from that reality.
              </p>
              <p>
               One explanation for the, what I hear, is the present non-stop coverage by "Jones" of the Pedo issue - is that he's got a chance to redeem himself as all this comes down? He's maybe being given an opportunity to be on the side of the piece of bread which lands butter - up, when all the shit - storm settles?
              </p>
              <p>
               Here you can see all the issues he sat on, and played gatekeeper for, over the years.

              <p>
               "Jones'"' [along with the Mainstream Media - of which "Infowars" is a branch] tells the craziest lies - (reinforces the lies of the Mainstream), to counter his audiences from finding out what's really going on; including the fact he is a re-purposed "Bill [the] Hicks."
              </p>
              <p>
               It's likely he and his partner, Booth, who was also his partner and manager when he was "Hicks," are the ones who are still raking in money from the Hicks comedy material / fans?

               100% Agent; faked death. Have no idea what they did to him, but that's why he's falling apart. .Handler is Booth. 
Sad , really.. read the "Thriller" called "Seconds" from ; '64 by Eli and you may get a grip on what it is.. 
Very freaky.

                Oh FFS he is not Bill Hicks, because if he was, he'd be nearly 60, and judging by his appearance a week ago on the Joe Rogan Experience, he's not even close.
               </p>
               <p>
                Additionally, if he's an agent, why did he help rebuild the Branch Davidian's church? Why was he arrested multiple times for civil disobedience? Why did he sneak into Bohemian Grove?

                  His ravings about the Warren Commission make you realise that if he were around today part of his routine would be a swivel-eyed diatribe about 9/11 and who was really responsible for the towers coming down, not to mention chem trails. It's no wonder he's become an internet idiot's poster boy. (At the end of Revelations, check how he gets ‘shot’ by an assassin because his truth was, y’know, too heavy for the government . . .) It wasn’t the latent paedophilia he aspired to, no doubt inspired by his heroes from the world of 70s rock. ("Why do you like young girls Goat Boy?" "Because there’s nothing between your legs. It’s like cotton candy framing a paper cut. I’m going to turn you over and spread your cheeks. It’s like a pink, quivering rabbit nostril.") Oh, my sides.

                 The arrests were faked. We noted that in NYC in '05. It was obvious and staged.

                 I do not know the details, but he's an actor, 100% and he's on a job. 
At his last shows as "Hicks" he talked about his new job - always the big mouth.

                <p>
                 And wasn't sick an iota on stage - Appeared 100% vital and healthy only weeks before he allegedly died.
; did not appear to be sick at all - after at least year of supposed alleged chemo,
Was allegedly buried at his parent's backyard, with no funeral.

                    I didn't say I didn't understand it. I do understand it, whether you care to acknowledge that or not. My disbelief is a direct result of understanding it. If you cannot provide details, then you do not know something 100%, and those who do not believe you do not necessarily lack understanding. Why you continue to claim something is 100% true when you can't prove it is far more of an important question.
