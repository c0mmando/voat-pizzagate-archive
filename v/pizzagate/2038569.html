            A dancing puppet doll made of wood
I bet he'd run away one day if he could choose to leave or stay
He's got a string attached to every bone
She's got him round her little finger so she'll never feel alone
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh sometimes I wonder, did it go
When lots of men had caused his soul
Dreaming of a wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man
           </p>
           <p>
            Sometimes I wonder, did it go
When lots of men had caused his soul
Dreaming of a wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man
           </p>
           <p>
            Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind
           </p>
           <p>
            The day of leaving her, has struck his mind
When he sees her smile, he's hypnotized and he can't leave her behind
Looking to his left, there's the door
No need to try, tried it once before
And the bounds tied him beneath the floor
           </p>
           <p>
            Sometimes I wonder, did it go
When lots of men had caused his soul

            Oh, she's taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind
           </p>
           <p>
            When they were out to buy her wedding-gown
She wanted nothing but the dress over a hundred thousand pound
But what she wants, she gets, or she will cry
Hits the man with her umbrella
She'll continue till' he dies
           </p>
           <p>

            dude just read its lyrics....are you all blind?  It is a trannie...read the lyrics.  Many many of the songs kind of spell it out plain as day to those with eyes to see.

            What these lyrics mean to me is.....HE is waking up and imagining HE is a man.......BUT SHE is taking over another MAN"S MIND.

            Damn people think it through.  She is a one of the mass produced trannie soldiers they are producing under MKULTRA mind control....IT or HE or SHE is screaming it at you all.....

            That is a trannie......another in a long line of fake women we are supposed to imagine are feminine. Damn Kazars are laughing at us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Look at it closely...look at the shoulders....the hand size.....listen to it talk.....it is a TRANNIE

            And yes it is likely the victim of MKULTRA mind torture.  This is likely one of the little kids locked in a shower with hot water forced to take Acid and have weird lights flashed at him.  Probably had the whole coffin insect treatment.  And this is the result..... a life actor.....like Podesta was.  Like Chester Podesta and James Alefantis.....they are all MKULTRA creatures.....
           </p>
           <p>
            Kinda sad....they are just LIFE ACTORS with limited free will......trapped in their own prison of the mind.

              There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he
             </p>
             <p>
              And then one day
A lucky day he passed my way
Then we spoke of many things:
Fools and kings
Then he said to me
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is to love and be loved in return"
             </p>
             <p>
              It is talking about his old self....

              In one song she is repeating the word boyboyboyboy in binary code.....normal behavior?

             <p>
              I fall asleep in my own tears
I cry for the world, for everyone
And I build a boat to float in
I'm floating away
             </p>
             <p>
              [Pre-Chorus]
I can't recall the last time I opened my eyes to see the world as beautiful
And I built a cage to hide in
I'm hiding, I'm trying to battle the night
             </p>
             <p>
              [Chorus]
Let love conquer your mind
Warrior, warrior
Just reach out for the light
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior- ior -ior -ior -ior
Warrior, warrior
I am a warrior- ior -ior -ior -ior
Warrior, warrior of love
             </p>

              I stand behind a wall of people and thoughts, mind controlling
And I hold a sword to guide me
I'm fighting my way
             </p>
             <p>
              A dancing puppet doll made of wood
I bet he'd run away one day if he could choose to leave or stay
He's got a string attached to every bone
She's got him round her little finger so she'll never feel alone
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh sometimes I wonder, did it go
When lots of men had caused his soul
Dreaming of a wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man x2
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind

             <p>
              Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind
             </p>
             <p>
              The day of leaving her, has struck his mind
When he sees her smile, he's hypnotized and he can't leave her behind
Looking to his left, there's the door
No need to try, tried it once before
And the bounds tied him beneath the floor
             </p>
             <p>
              Sometimes I wonder, did it go
When lots of men had caused his soul
Dreaming of a wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man x2
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh, she's taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind
             </p>
             <p>
              When they were out to buy her wedding-gown
She wanted nothing but the dress over a hundred thousand pound
But what she wants, she gets, or she will cry
Hits the man with her umbrella
She'll continue till' he dies
             </p>
             <p>
              Sometimes I wonder, did it go
When lots of men had caused his soul
Dreaming of a wonderland
Wakes up and he's a man
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Taking control of his min
             </p>
             <p>
              Oh, she's taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over another man's mind
Oh, taking control over another man's mind
Oh taking control over his mind x2
             </p>
             <p>
              face the truth.....it is a trannie......it has been tortured......it has a mission assigned to it......go and be an influence on the youth of the world....sing depressing songs and confuse them what a female looks like......

            I appreciate you taking the time to think about and comment on the video, but I really don't see what you're trying to do with your analysis here. It doesn't make any sense to me at this time, and also, if we're here we clearly already know about the band Heavy Breathing. This is separate and perhaps a call to recognize that there are tunnels underground DC. And, even further, perhaps to recognize what might be going on in other countries. Who knows. I'm definitely not interested in saying that Aurora is in any way involved in this, just that circumstantially it seems a little odd.

              Thanks. You know, there's now a whole nonprofit that puts on community shows in the Dupont Tunnel. It seems pretty new and I wonder if it could be a PR movement, sort of a get-ahead-of-it type thing.

            I'm wondering why this young artist from Norway wanted to do an acoustic session in the underground tunnels in DC. I think it's relevant to pizzagate because of some of her song titles ("I Went Too Far," "Through the Eyes of a Child," "Murder Song") and because the intro to the video shows areas of the Dupont Tunnel, which are said to be located close to the pizza shops in question.

             Norway is connected to PedoGate on many levels, several pedophile arrests (Operation Darkroom) late 2016. Norways shady dealings with CGI is of interest. 
Aurora is most likely part (victim) of the global pedophile ring/cabal since birth. Brainwashed butterfly
