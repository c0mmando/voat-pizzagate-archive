<p>Germany[edit]
The age of consent in Germany is 14, as long as a person over the age of 21 does not exploit a 14- to 15-year-old person\'s lack of capacity for sexual self-determination, in which case a conviction of an individual over the age of 21 requires a complaint from the younger individual; being over 21 and engaging in sexual relations with a minor of that age does not constitute an offense by itself. Otherwise the age of consent is 16, although provisions protecting minors against abuse apply until the age of 18 (under Section 182(1), it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 &quot;by taking advantage of an exploitative situation&quot;[</p>',

            Milo Y himself talked about this in his apology speech a few days ago. His mom is German so he grew up with a skewed view of what constitutes 'enjoyable sex'...ie ok to enjoy at 14, but guilt felt at 13 etc.
