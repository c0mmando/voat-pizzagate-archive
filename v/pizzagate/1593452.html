  'formattedContent' => '<p>I started with this photo <a href="https://archive.fo/zMo1N">https://archive.fo/zMo1N</a> posted by Justin Barrows aka Jabbaroos</p>
<p>It is liked by the usual suspects: Joe Wills, James Alefantis and Jeff Smith, as well as a Bigjonheister. Now the left and right guy in the photo have been identified long ago as <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1525501">Justin Barrows</a> and (most likely) Alefantis. The mystery was the middle guy\'s identity.</p>
<p>Some people <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1553591">suggested</a> Podesta but that seemed far-fetched (lol). The only clue was the comment about a &quot;Hungarian coal miner terrorist&quot; at their backs. Now Soros is Hungarian, and his son\'s name had come up a few times before at the start.</p>
<p>Alex Soros had been marketed as the \'<a href="http://nypost.com/2016/09/04/the-least-likely-playboy-in-the-hamptons/">playboy of the Hamptons</a>\', posing with, or mostly below - an entourage of supermodels, always looking distinctly out of place. Recently he also wrote his (unavailable) Master\'s thesis on <a href="https://ias.ceu.edu/people/alexander-soros">The Jewish Dionysus</a>: Heine, Nietzsche, and the politics of poetry.</p>
<p>But he came up at the start of Pizzagate because of his presence - with <a href="http://imgur.com/a/fXwLQ">red shoes</a> no less - at one of Marina Abramovich (public) <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9I7U883.jpg">Spirit Cooking acts</a>.</p>
<p>So I compared images of the third hooded \'Hungarian coal miner&quot; and Alex Soros, and found hit after hit. I tried to come up with a detailed visual facial analysis but I\'m a fucking clown with visual software so I just pasted pictures side by side here <a href="http://imgur.com/a/5ag2z">http://imgur.com/a/5ag2z</a> </p>
<p>I think his body contours and distance between head and shoulders, his facial features and facial hair, the position of his glasses, his eyes with the typical baggy curves, his nose and nostrils from that angle, the form of his head under the hood up to his barely visible hair and ears, even the asymmetric facial lines leading up to his nostrils (with the left side moving more sharply toward the nostril). All of it matches perfectly. </p>
<p>Now about the &quot;Hungarian coal miner terrorist&quot;, I think the first and last are more or less clear, but the \'coal miner\' isn\'t. It could be a reference to Alex\'s real last name (Schwartz, i.e. black), or to a <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=coal%20mining">gay sex practice</a>.</p>
<p>Soros (via American Bridge Pac) donated <a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?14960793887">$11.600 dollar</a> to Comet for catering, probably a party, in 2013 after the picture was taken. But I haven\'t been able to find many further links between Alefantis and Alex Soros (who seems homosexual to me, and posts some rather unusual but telltale photos of  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/DkEAk">himself as a kid with his parents</a> )</p>
<p>The guy commenting on the picture, Bigjonheister, obviously wanted only James and Justin to know he knew that was Soros. So he commented cryptically. The photo must have been taken between this \'<a href="http://archive.is/utAju">recently finished job</a>\' by Bigjonheister (what is that? <a href="http://imgur.com/a/yGu9e">http://imgur.com/a/yGu9e</a> a private zoo??) and the last picture that got liked by Jabbaroos, a private Beerfest in december 2012. Jon Heister probably hooked up with Barrows cs. around that time, when the original hooded picture was also taken.</p>
<p>Maybe Bigjonheister fucked it up with his comment. Jabbaroos doesn\'t like or comment any of his IG after that. Heister himself only likes <a href="https://archive.fo/XavGT">some</a> of Jabbaroos\' <a href="https://archive.fo/shLc7">more sinister photos</a> (along with the usual suspects).</p>
<p>Maybe the hood in the picture precludes any 100% positive identification, but I believe quite firmly this is Alex Soros, and I dare anyone to come up with a (random) face that more closely matches these features.</p>',

               I agree that the guy on the left of the three guys is balaclavas in James Alefantis.  If performing as Majestic Ape in video or musical performance, it is Amanda Kleinman.  She usually wears the big hoop earrings.  I tried to find original Comet footage but found this:
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR1w6IkpE6o">
                Majestic Ape video
               </a>
               .  If this is one you mean, it is Amanda Kleinman I am pretty sure.

                Yeah I honestly can't tell if it's a girl or a guy beneath that mask and wig. The way they're clothes are it looks like a woman. And if you listen to the voice behind the voice changer, it sounds like a woman.

            And they call him jokingly terrorist in allusion on the repeatedly made allegations against his father george soros who has literally often been called a terrorist, financial terrorist, market terrorist and so on. and what the father may be, is the son inevitable too.

              A lot of my upvoats on pizzagate material aren't going through according to the Voat mobile app; Boats for Voat. I'm chalking it up as a bug in the app but I might as well mention it.

            How do the pictures of the clean-shaven, no-glasses guy relate to 'Hungarian coal miner mask' guy in the CPP-related Instagram pic? I'm not clear on where you got those two images. It does very strongly resemble him, but it's hard to tell conclusively unless you can find pictures of him with no beard and glasses. There are a lot of people who look like the clean-shaven guy. Or are all five actually Soros and you're just trying to tell who the masked guy is?

             All the pictures are in fact Alex Soros. I added the clean shaven ones because they show a very distinctive feature: the facial lines towards his nose are asymmetric, under every angle, with the right side going upwards along the nostril, and the left side going towards the nostril.
            </p>
            <p>
             These type of lines would be very visible when smiling with a cold face, regardless of age. He is 27/8 in the picture, which could very well have been taken on his birthday on January 1st 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
             Counting 202 weeks from then I arrive at a date of November 15th 2016 when the screenshot was taken (or the IG account made private). Possible.

            That is the same nose in all the pics. I'd bet money on it. It's fairly unique looking, as well. Nice job, OP.

            Seems like a pretty strong match to me. I'm too tired to find the original image, but is there a chance the image with Alefantis and Barrows has been mirrored? I was looking specifically for the freckle beneath his (Soros) left eye. The spacing of what would be that freckle in the mirrored image seems accurate with the other shots.

             I don't think it's mirrored because of the unique asymmetry of the facial lines towards his nostrils. If mirrored the freckle would not be visible due to the reflection in the glass on his right eye. If you zoom in close enough there seems to be a barely visible freckle on the 'right' (i.e. left) eye.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again I don't have the software and couldn't use it if I did, but I'm pretty sure there are darker pixels on the exact spot.

             Unfortunately to me at least and many others, it seems David may be controlled opposition. He has still failed to bring up MANY VITAL findings in this case and the only narrative he ever really seems to push is " The code used in the Podesta emails". We're all far, far beyond that now but he's not making it known. The other narrative he really seems to be pushing at the same time is his gold and bitcoin shit, and how he wants to start a network of his own that takes over CNN etc. When you compare him to someone like Marty Leeds who doesn't have a patrion, isn't pushing other shit to distract from pizzagate and is getting a wealth of information out there and making a solid case for us, David seems highly suspect. I hope I'm wrong but logic is telling me I'm not.

              I don't know, he seems more like the typically sloppy (and lazy) journalist to me.
             </p>
             <p>
              For example, when he reported on Pegasus he talked about image metadata, which is complete nonsense, but doesn't make sense from a controllet opposition point of view either.

             <p>
              He also first pushed vid.me, but was then too lazy to post his videos there.

              You can only fully trust pizzgate investigators by who they align themselves with. I am not in favor of any politician, including Trump. While I don't think Trump is anything like Killary, I would not campaign or promote their cause. Now if Trump started openly saying we're going after pedophiles involved in Pizzagate and Washington... then I might say Trump really is a good guy. David Seaman aligns himself heavily with a political party.

              Plus fucking two. Seaman is so likely a spook whose job it is to distract from the actual details of the investigation and affirm the idea that all pizzagate researchers are right-wing fruitcakes. Huffpo or no, Seaman is a Trump fanboi and never fails to drop mention of his patrion or how everyone should invest in bitcoin and gold, cliche tin foil hat doomsday prepper rhetoric. He is so controlled opposition!

            Why can't we link direct to a photo rather than have the stupid 'Imgur album' black thing first? ... Anyway, yes, the photos do look like they are of the same person, so far as I can tell. The nose is identical. My only reservation is that the 'Hungarian coal miner' looks ten years older.

             When only that much of your face is showing it is easy for looks to be deceiving. Take for example Richard Spencers attacker. With the balaclava thing on he looked about 35 - 40yo, but in reality he's like a 50 year old human toilet cuck.

             Well gold has always been real money. Only fools trust fiat. As for bitcoin, it is too new to make a confident prediction but it is definitely better than the dollar system we have. Connections with Alex Soros at all are worrying.

            Can you imagine how fucked up Alex Soros really truly is? He had to have had the worst MK Ultra traumatic childhood filled with ritualistic abuse and regular cult killing attendances. He's got his father narrative down to a tee now though. He's VILE and repulsive just like his papa. George Soros is said to have been at many child hunting parties in Europe. They are so contradictory they don't even know who they really are. They have so many faces. Alex looks, dresses and acts homosexual yet ales out like he's a womanizing playboy but what woman would find him attractive (other than if they were gold diggers)? The Soros' are the most EVIL horrible people on the face of the earth, along with the Rothschilds.

             I thought those childhood pictures were pretty shocking. His father seems to force him to drink/take something, his mother lies on him as if to comfort him, but he has his eyes open staring into space. 
Very unusual for a kid that age.

              I disagree about the pictures. They don't look that weird.
Theory of coal miner = Alex is interesting...
I really thought it was podesta before but this is a good possibility.

               Seriously.  If people stopped thinking this is a partisan issue and its just the dems, I think we would make a lot more progress.  This was labeled a right-wing conspiracy from the beginning by the media and that was pretty smart of them.  Half the country immediately dismissed it for that reason.

               Yeah Bush's niece defended the Silsby gang. Bobbie Kilberg connects to Alefantis thru Grandma Rita's. And a Rockefeller owns most of the properties around Comet.

            Yeah... that's him. I vehemently disagreed that the middle character was Podesta, every time it was previously brought up. Podesta  had a job that required way too much of his time to get into the day to day of the DC child trafficking world. I had also said Alefantis was not featured in this pic, but I have since concluded that I was wrong, it is Alefantis. Alex Soros would make a perfect bagman for the DC operation, delivering not only funding but prime directives from the top. These creeps are thrill seekers. They are the base jumpers of the child trafficking world. Let me congratulate you on what I think is an amazing find. It is making many things come into focus.
