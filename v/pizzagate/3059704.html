<p>Maryland Del. <strong>Nick Mosby</strong> was recently combing through the state criminal code when something disturbing jumped out at him.</p>
<p><strong>The “sale of a minor” was listed on the state books as a misdemeanor.</strong> Mosby was stunned.</p>
<p>The Baltimore City lawmaker, who initially was conducting unrelated research on the expungement process, shifted gears and asked his staff to research what he had found. He also called the Legislative Services office to make sure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I couldn’t believe my eyes,” he said Thursday. “This shouldn’t be listed as a misdemeanor, it should be listed as a felony.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mosby said the law been in effect since 1980, based on a case in Anne Arundel County where a couple sold their daughter for $3,500 and some cocaine. Unfortunately, he said, the law hasn’t been updated since.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With the uptick in human trafficking [and] drug abuse situations, children are the most vulnerable assets that we have,” he said. “As [a] government, we must protect them in any way.”</p>

<p>According to the Maryland Human Trafficking Task Force, the state rescued nearly 400 people from human traffickers in 2014. About 124 were children used for labor and sex trafficking.

<p>The University of Pennsylvania School of Social Work said the average age of a person targeted ranges between 12 and 14.</p>

            This smacks of slave days.  The punishment is fines paid but who will have the money to pay those fines?  Only the rich for sure.  They will get off with out too much suffering but others will suffer the consequences (not that they shouldn't). The time in prison is much too short.  Prison sentence should match the fines. Each 10K charge should require 10 years incarceration.  Imo, I would lock them away eternally, but that just won't fly.

            Hmmm. So by definition, these are mostly girls who drop out of high school. Seems like maybe the state human trafficking task forces could stop this if they started tracking and checking in on girls who drop out. They know when kids don't show up at school...shouldn't be that hard to do.

             It's not in their best self interest to keep watch.  Their masters need their sick pleasures.  Ah, but for sensibility.  Yes your statement makes too much sense.  There are so many things that could be done to keep those that are trafficked much safer.  We just need those few  honest lawmakers to propose the solutions.  I won't hold my breath.

               Im sure we are the laughing stock of the entire galaxy and maybe even the whole universe.  Perhaps that's why ET's don't want to make contact with us. They observe us but won't stop over for some coffee.  Why ? They know we'd probably kill them and the ones who don't kill them will think demons are here.  Demons, who are allegedly of a spirit realm, all of a sudden need space craft to get around according to the Christian community.  (Sighs)

                Both demons and angels need craft to get around. The results of human and extraterrestrial demon contact are abundant (just look around) Not so obvious is the fact that the positive angelics (besides the many non-public contacts that have already been made) have attempted direct, public contact at least once:
               </p>
               <p>
                "(President Eisenhower) met with thought-forms which are indistinguishable from third density. This was a test. We, the Confederation, wished to see what would occur if this extremely positively oriented and simple congenial person with no significant distortions towards power happened across peaceful information and the possibilities which might append therefrom. We discovered that this entity did not feel that those under his care could deal with the concepts of other beings and other philosophies. Thus an agreement reached then allowed him to go his way, ourselves to do likewise; and a very quiet campaign, as we have heard you call it, be continued alerting your peoples to our presence gradually. Events have overtaken this plan."
               </p>
               <p>
                Now, although I have no current information to back it up, I have no doubts that President Trump has been approached in the same fashion and asked the same question. What do you think his answer was?

                 So you have video footage of demons flying around in craft ? Post it !....  Oh wait.. You don't have any do you.  It's all in your head. Someone wrote it or made a youtube video and you simply believed it. Like a monkey looking in a mirror. They don't know its them they are seeing.

                  According to the book, it looked like (Image 1) but with living versions of the being pictured in (Image 2) piloting the ringlike craft. It must have been pretty terrifying.

                 Nope. If spirits existed. They would be of a spirit form and wouldn't need  trains, planes and automobiles. Nope.. You watched a video someone made that said President Eisenhower meet with ET's and your tiny little brain believed it. 
Teeny tiny little weak minded fools fall for whatever some Youtube prophet put online. Like reptilians. Some fool posted it and fools like you fell for it.

                  Actually I just thought of an instance of demons using spacecraft to move around in the Bible. There's more than one. But if you're interested, look up the book of Ezekiel. It describes a horrifying manipulation of the incarnate individual Ezekiel, by an extraterrestrial alien demon claiming to be God (name of those ones are the Yahweh). But in the process of beginning the manipulation of Ezekiel, this particular member of the Yahweh group introduces himself with an entourage of at least 4 terrifying demonic creatures piloting craft that appear like a crystalline rings. They are evidently using some sort of full body/mind interface with the craft according to the description given by Ezekiel.

                  Actually, this isn't about me personally, or youtube videos. Just google that paragraph I pasted if you're brave enough to investigae my source material for yourself. A fair warning though, it may change your life.

                  I'm not entirely sure on the topic of disembodied spirits and mobility. Remembering that we are mind/body/spirit complexes and the three cannot be separated. I'm pretty sure that navigating as a disembodied spirit would be tricky, because you would be on an astral plane related to earth (always bound to earth in some way), or you might be in some sort of quantum soup.

                  Portals to different times and places may exist as you wander about in discarnate form. But eventually, you would have to incarnate in a body to interact with whatever system you portaled to. However, this is assuming you're adept enough to control your own movement and not finding yourself on some roller coaster ride, pulled about to your next destination by your karmic ties.

                   No No little minded fool. I am mature enough to know fact from delusion.  An all forgiving, true loving creator would never hold the fear of eternal burning over his creations heads. Those are the words of Human beings. "Love me or I'll burn you forever"  You don't see the irony in that do you. LOL. You go now and play Youtube Prophet and read your bible like a good little puppet.

                    Both bad ETs and bad humans have used or lived on that principle. The creation is mutifacted, so there is good and evil, light and dark, in everything and everyone, including the God of the Bible. In any case, it's possible for fallen angels to get their wings back. Discernment is always necessary.

            In Virginia, most if not all are felonies. Virginia is a well-known corridor of such criminal activities. If you see something say something. Get license plates. Send tips to State Police and local sheriff. This should be done everywhere.
