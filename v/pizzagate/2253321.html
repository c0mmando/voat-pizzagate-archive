            Adam Sandler has been on my radar for some time now.  He is Super Creepy and Walking on the Edge.  He has said a few things that were off the wall on the Night Shows.  Needs to be Called Out.

            This thread was more worthy than my submisson of a documentary about the Catholic church holocost of native Candian children. At least MF and Vincdicator think so. This is allowed, my post was deleted and I was banned. Pedo pedo pedo, I really want to slay, pedo pedo pedo, afraid there here to stay. Pe Do Modssssssssssssssss!

             for what its worth my post was deleted too... had to resubmit and include "link descriptions". i agree,  seems like the MOD's may be answering to someone/something.  Just like a day job though,  sometime we just have to "play by the rules" and be persistant to get what we want (in this case we want the info on the forum).  Keep trying to post the documentary and add whatever bullshit "rule"' the MOD's claim is missing from the post.

            I see how this could also be signified as tribute. Look what we put in our movie, "hiding in plain sight". Those that are in the circle laugh and hand out treats, money, drugs,get out of jail passes, underage kids, other actors or actresses out of their league.  So it would be good to find out who writes these scenes. Costume and Set designers, Producers,and Directors.

              To make the magic work, they need to be open about what they are doing.  This is why there are symbolism where we choose to look for it.  It's there, it's always been there.
             </p>
             <p>
              You think it ends at pizza?  What other things are in movies that need to be viewed by the masses to work?  A better question is not whats real, but what is fake?

               Excellent point. I don't think we have actually dug anything up compared to what is actually there. That is scariest of all given the little we did find is already far too much.

               No point in buckling up now, pizzagate is traveling at the speed of light without anyone's opinions or input right now. As it should be. I was tired as fuck trying to prove this to brain dead educated idiots who watched the news that told them its fake. 
It's absolutely foolish to argue its validity now. I'm pretty happy about that fact.
