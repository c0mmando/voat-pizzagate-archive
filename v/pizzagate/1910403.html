The Italian political party Lega Nord has stated that NGOs funded by George Soros are colluding with human traffickers. These are NGOs specifically charged with protecting the refugees. Italian prosecutors, led by Carmelo Zuccaro from Catania (but also prosecutors in Palermo and Cagliari who investigate the relations between NGOs and Libya), repeatedly underline that there are signs that “some NGOs and traffickers in Libya are in direct contact.” MOAS (Migrant Offshore Aid Station)received half a million dollars from Avaaz, another NGO, co-founded by MoveOn,an online community, receiving donations from none other than George Soros himself.
Save The Children, another NGO involved in the Mediterranean migrant shipping, lists among its partners Open Society Foundation, George Soros’s primary NGO. Médicins Sans Frontiéres is listed among the partners of Open Society and the Soros network.</p>
<p>The Italian Foreign Minister has publicly agreed ‘100 percent’ that migrant NGOs are working with people traffickers to smuggle Africans into Europe. Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano has come out and said that he “agreed 100 percent” with claims made last week accusing african migrant rescue charities of colluding with people smugglers and traffickers in Libya. Sicilian prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro, told the Italian media that he had “evidence that there are direct contacts between certain NGOs and people traffickers in Libya”  Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in Brussels said , “if magistrates have usable and credible information, the government will certainly not stand in the way” of an investigation. Their ability to appear in locations to where “migrants” have been towed in rubber ducks at night has made many question how did they know where to go to given that it can take many hours to cross to Libya.</p>

                 This is not made up, its history and provable fact.
“THE ORTHODOX JEWISH TALMUD IS ONE OF THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD”!
                </p>
                <p>
                 The official unabridged Soncino Edition of the Talmud published in 1935 was “Translated into English with Notes, Glossary and Indices” by such eminent Talmudic scholars as Rabbi Dr. I. Epstein, Rabbi Dr. Samuel Daiches, Rabbi Dr. Israel W. Slotki, M.A., Litt.D., The Reverend Dr. A. Cohen, M.A., Ph.D., Maurice Simon, M.A., and the Very Reverend The Chief Rabbi Dr. J.H. Hertz wrote the “Foreword” for the Soncino Edition of the Talmud. The Very Reverend Rabbi Hertz was at the time the Chief Rabbi of England.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The world’s leading authorities on the Talmud confirm that the official unabridged Soncino Edition of the Talmud translated into English follows the original texts with great exactness. It is almost a word-for-word translation of the original texts. In his famous classic “The History of the Talmud,” Michael Rodkinson, the leading authority on the Talmud, in collaboration with the celebrated Reverend Dr. Isaac M. Wise states:
                </p>
                <p>
                 “THE TALMUD IS ONE OF THE WONDERS OF THE WORLD. During the twenty centuries of its existence…IT SURVIVED IN ITS ENTIRETY, and not only has the power of its foes FAILED TO DESTROY EVEN A SINGLE LINE, but it has not even been able materially to weaken its influence for any length of time. IT STILL DOMINATES THE MINDS OF A WHOLE PEOPLE, WHO VENERATE ITS CONTENTS AS DIVINE TRUTH…”
                </p>

                 SANHEDRIN, 55b-55a: “What is meant by this?—Rab said: Pederasty with a child below nine years of age is not deemed as pederasty with a child above that. Samuel said: Pederasty with a child below three years is not treated as with a child above that (2) What is the basis of their dispute?—Rab maintains that only he who is able to engage in sexual intercourse, may, as the passive subject of pederasty throw guilt (upon the actual offender); whilst he who is unable to engage in sexual intercourse cannot be a passive subject of pederasty (in that respect) (3). But Samuel maintains: Scriptures writes, (And thou shalt not lie with mankind) as with the lyings of a woman (4). It has been taught in accordance with Rab: Pederasty at the age of nine years and a day; (55a) (he) who commits bestiality, whether naturally or unnaturally: or a woman who causes herself to be bestiality abused, whether naturally or unnaturally, is liable to punishment (5).”

                 This “divine truth” which “a whole people venerate” of which “not a single letter of it is missing” and today “is flourishing to such a degree as cannot be found in its history” is illustrated by the additional verbatim quotations which follow:
                </p>
                <p>
                 SANHEDRIN, 55b: “A maiden three years and a day may be acquired in marriage by coition, and if her deceased husband’s brother cohabits with her, she becomes his. The penalty of adultery may be incurred through her; (if a niddah) she defiles him who has connection with her, so that he in turn defiles that upon which he lies, as a garment which has lain upon (a person afflicted with gonorrhea).”
                </p>
                <p>
                 (footnotes) “(2) His wife derives no pleasure from this, and hence there is no cleaving. (3) A variant reading of this passage is: Is there anything permitted to a Jew which is forbidden to a heathen. Unnatural connection is permitted to a Jew. (4) By taking the two in conjunction, the latter as illustrating the former, we learn that the guilt of violating the injunction ‘to his wife but not to his neighbor’s wife’ is incurred only for natural but not for unnatural intercourse.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 SANHEDRIN, 69b “Our rabbis taught: If a woman sported lewdly with her young son (a minor), and he committed the first stage of cohabitation with her, Beth Shammai says, he thereby renders her unfit for the priesthood (1). Beth Hillel declares her fit…All agree that the connection of a boy nine years and a day is a real connection; whilst that of one less than eight years is not (2); their dispute refers only to one who is eight years old.
                </p>
                <p>
                 KETHUBOTH, 11a-11b. “Rabba said, It means (5) this: When a grown up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing, for when the girl is less than this (6), it is as if one puts the finger in the eye (7), but when a small boy has intercourse with a grown up woman, he makes her as ‘a girl who is injured by a piece of wood’.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 (footnotes) “(5). Lit., ‘says.’ (6) Lit., ‘here,’ that is, less than three years old. (7) Tears come to the eyes again and again, so does virginity come back to the little girl under three years.”
                </p>
                <p>
                 KETHUBOTH, 11a-11b. “Rab Judah said that Rab said: A small boy who has intercourse with a grown up woman makes her (as though she were ) injured by a piece of wood (1). Although the intercourse of a small boy is not regarded as a sexual act, nevertheless the woman is injured by it as by a piece of wood.” (Dildo)

                 ABODAH ZARAH, 36b-37a. “R. Naham b. Isaac said: They decreed in connection with a heathen child that it would cause defilement by seminal emission (2) so that an Israelite child should not become accustomed to commit pederasty with it…From what age does a heathen child cause defilement by seminal emission? From the age of nine years and one day. (37a) for inasmuch as he is then capable of the sexual act he likewise defiles by emission. Rabina said: It is therefore to be concluded that a heathen girl (communicates defilement) from the age of three years and one day, for inasmuch as she is then capable of the sexual act she likewise defiles by a flux.
                </p>
                <p>
                 SOTAH, 26b. “R. Papa said: It excludes an animal, because there is not adultery in connection with an animal (4). Raba of Parazika (5) asked R. Ashi, Whence is the statement which the Rabbis made that there is no adultery in connection with an animal? Because it is written, Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot or the wages of a dog etc.; (6) and it has been taught: The hire of a dog (7) and the wages of a harlot (8) are permissible, as it is said, Even both of these (9)—the two (specified texts are abominations) but not four (10)…As lying with mankind. (12) But, said Raba, it excludes the case where he warned her against contact of the bodies (13). Abaye said to him, That is merely an obscene act (and not adultery), and did the All-Merciful prohibit (a wife to her husband) for an obscene act?”

                 Of the “sacred” Talmudic teachings of the “Sages,” preserved since 500 A.D. and taught more widely today than ever before in Talmud-Torah schools in the U.S.A., perhaps nothing better illustrates “fools” with “reprobate minds” than the teaching in the Talmud book of Yebamoth that spittle on the top of the bed curtain proves that a wife has been guilty of adultery, as only lying down face upwards could she have spit up on it. Spitting several feet straight up! The Talmud states: “When a peddler leaves a house and the woman within is fastening her sinnar [breech-cloth] . . . . If spittle is found on the upper part of the curtained bed she must, said Rabbi, go.”

                  Just because something is written does not mean all are following it.  I have Jewish friends and have been to a few baptisms.  Thee was nothing sordid at any of them.  There are many heinous acts committed by all religions.  We know all too well what the Catholic Church and many of it's priests have done.  Radical Muslims believe not what the Peaceful Religion teaches.  The Christian Preachers like Oral Roberts and Jim Baker not to mention Billy Graham and Franklin his son, all read from the Bible.  The Bible has been misinterpreted by many to convince themselves that they can do what thou whilst. Do unto your child or woman.....so I am not going to believe that the Talmud Dominates the Minds of All Jews.  Are there bad Jews, Of course. Yes,  Just as I gave examples in other faiths people of the Jewish faith can also err.  I am not going to throw my friends under the bus for they have stood by me for decades.  By the way I am German born.

            Alex Soros has started Libraries Without Borders.  Hmm.  Connected DWB (Doctors Without Borders)?  I remember when they were hit by shelling in Syria and he was present.  Someone on here told me they have been infiltrated.  I do not have proof, but I remember that there were Doctors kidnapped, and I am wondering if they were replaced with infiltrators.  Libraries Without Borders is giving IPADS to the little children of Syria saying it is giving them Humanity.  WTH?  Yeah, getting their info through facial recognition.  This is suspect.  So then if they take these with them when they make it to Italy, they can track them?  IDK, but they have all kinds of technology at their fingertips.

             Alex Soros is the one to watch. His position is just that, "philanthropist". With save the children fundraisers and open border societies galas attracting the rich and famous all over the world to Cannes to show off his power and charm these sheep think he's wonderful. He is the problem. His father is vile enough but Alex is following his exact path and he knows exactly what he's doing. What you said about the iPads is bang on to track and infiltrate. They can record video and listen even when the device is off. Humanity is an iPad lmfao!!! These people are fucked.

            This goes right along with the other article posted here on Voat yesterday about people disappearing and bodies being found without their eyes and their belly sewn shut in Lesbos.
People's organs are being harvested, and others...the pretty ones are being sold as sex slaves.

            One of the most vocal critics of the NGOs has been Italian prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro who has claimed he has evidence that members of the charity groups directly communicate with people smugglers in Libya.The allegations have led Trapani Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio to also investigate members of some NGOs for possible links to people smugglers, though Cartosio stressed that the investigations targetted members and not the organisations themselves.Matteo Salvini, leader of the Italian populist anti-mass migration Lega Nord party, commented on the NGOs’ activities earlier this week saying: “You can’t any longer speak about immigration but about an invasion organised, funded and planned by Brussels with the complicity of Rome.”Some members of the public have attempted to take action against NGO ships including the hipster-right Identitarian youth movement who tried to block a migrant rescue ship from leaving port last month in Sicily.***Thank you OP for a magnificent post and excellent articles.  This is most definitely crying out for research.  I also recommend that the people that have spoken out must get High Level Security at once.

            Are we going to pretend that Lega Nord is a disinterested, neutral potrayer of facts?  Or are they shilling for Puting after signing a cooperation agreement with Putin's United Russia party?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             President Vladimir Putin’s ruling party has signed a co-operation deal with Italy’s far-right Lega Nord, deepening Russia’s ties with Europe’s populist movements.
            </p>
            <p>
             The deal marks the Kremlin’s latest attempt to develop formal links with populist groups ahead of elections this year in which the right is set to make gains.
            </p>
            <p>
             United Russia, the main pro-Kremlin party, signed a similar agreement late last year with the far-right Freedom party of Austria, whose leader Heinz-Christian Strache was narrowly defeated in December’s presidential election. The leader of Germany’s anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Frauke Petry, also held talks with United Russia’s Viacheslav Volodin, speaker of the Duma, the lower house of parliament, during a visit to Russia last month.

              You've been on the wrong track for quite a while, I'm afraid.

             <p>
              And there is nothing surprising about a political party that is formally aligned with Putin pushing Putin's Anti-Soros line.   Putin hates Soros as Putin feels the loss of the Soviet empire was a catastrophe and a humiliation for Russia and Soros through promoting democracy and financing dissidents in Poland and Czechslovakia and other Soviet bloc countries helped bring that about.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is nothing different that what Putin used to do when he worked in the KGB.  Projecting Russian influence into other countries was how Putin spent the 1980's.  He was a Russian Intelligence officer serving in Dresden, Germany.

               You have no idea what you're talking about. Beppe Grillo couldn't give a shit about doing deals with Putin, or anyone else, unless it suited Italy.  Italy is too independently minded to be anybody's puppet.  Seriously,

               you're not on drugs?? You can't put a cogent thought together.  The fact that Soros has rushed off to Italy shows that he's worried now that the truth has been discovered.

              Yes, and Thank You, as we know we simply MUST research everything that is a highly credible clue.  Repeat.  I said clue.  That is what we do.  Research to find what is credible.  Duh.
