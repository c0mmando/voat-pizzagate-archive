            I don't think the comments are weird, I think "The Duss. I am truly grateful" is what the hotdog is meant to be saying. "existential terror" is about the hotdog putting sauce on himself, and "You've been lobbying Congress?" is just a joke to indicate this hotdog is meant to represent congress.
           </p>
           <p>
            The link to hotdogs could be relevant though, and a sign to others.

             I think your points are mostly valid except your explanation of the 'lobbying Congress' comment (which motivated posting the observation) seems vague. It may be something innocuous but I can't comprehend it without presupposing some other tacit premise to that, outside of the picture. If the hot dog is 'meant to represent Congress' as you say, I think it still needs more context in order to be considered funny or make sense.

              Your right oily, "you've been lobbying congress?" So lets take the 'joke' to its most simplest forms so we cant get disputed too heavily.
             </p>
             <p>
              Wiki-  Lobbying (also lobby) is the act of attempting to influence the actions, policies, or decisions of officials in a government,
             </p>
             <p>
              So when their going to their meetings with congress to discuss their agendas there is something relevent to a 'HOTDOG' there too.
             </p>
             <p>
              100% an inside joke too. Another tick for 'hotdog' being something relevant to #pedogate

             100% that "you've been lobbying congress?" comment suggests a hidden meaning to 'HOTDOG'.  It is undeniable
