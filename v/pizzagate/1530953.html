            Agreed, some of anons best movements evolved from that dark swamp. Use a meme similar to the jet fuel can't melt steel beams in seemingly innocuous places and you'll get attention for the cause

            I only just discovered this concept of meme magic...(super late to the party!). It's fascinating and intriguing and I think there is definitely something to it. Look at Pepe!
           </p>
           <p>
            I wholeheartedly agree with you. We do this by stealth, perseverance, remain calm, focused, logical and unwavering and we will expose this.
           </p>
           <p>
            It may take months or even years but fertile seeds have been planted in half-awake half-asleep minds, and it just takes regular little meme waterings here and there for the seeds of greater awareness to sprout.
           </p>
           <p>
            Something has shifted. Perhaps we have reached the critical mass of awareness where the trickle is beginning to cascade. Bring on the flood!

            IRL when I talk to people who aren't wanting to hear, or I feel its too complicated, people who are hearing about Russia hacking for example, I causually remind them that we've been dragged into war on false intel before, I say "whatever did happen with Saddam Hussain's weapons of mass destruction?" , it usually enough to plant seeds of doubt and remind people that the MSM has a history of deceit and ill intent.

            I was a lurker for a while until a few weeks ago. I haven't even created a Reddit account before. How many lurkers do we have here? Come out of the shadows, lest ye be overtaken by the shadow forces. We need every man we can get here to investigate. It's for the children, dammit!
