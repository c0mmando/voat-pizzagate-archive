<p><a href="https://meginvestigates.wordpress.com/2019/04/15/the-heather-orourke-death-conspiracy/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">https://meginvestigates.wordpress.com/2019/04/15/the-heather-orourke-death-conspiracy/amp/?__twitter_impression=true</a> A lengthy shill article attacking the Heather O’Rourke story. Has all the common shill tactics against this story:</p>
<p>Calling CDAN a gossip site, but ignoring Enty’s proven track record for exposing sexual predators in Hollywood or for knowing stuff is going to break before it actually happens (big part of why people spread the story in the first place).</p>
<p>The official cause being correct: BS. Several GI specialists are on record saying “congenital stenosis” is BS. Also, the account of an RN says its BS too.</p>
<p>Heather died directly on set: WRONG. Enty NEVER claimed Heather directly died from the Rocky Road incident. It was implied that COMPLICATIONS from the incident caused the stenosis. Fact: IBD and intestinal stenosis CAN be caused by anal sexual abuse.</p>
<p><a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2362611273992972&amp;id=100007323674461&amp;ref=group_header">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2362611273992972&amp;id=100007323674461&amp;ref=group_header</a> Someone did an numerology analysis of Heather O’Rourke. This combined with Renegade Anon’s words leave the possibility of Heather’s death being a “medical homicide”.</p>

<p><a href="https://subliminalsynchrosphere.blogspot.com/2013/03/steven-spielberg-symbolism-mystery.html?m=1">https://subliminalsynchrosphere.blogspot.com/2013/03/steven-spielberg-symbolism-mystery.html?m=1</a> Some occult symbolism in Spielberg films, including Poltergeist.</p>
<p><a href="http://glaserforensic.com/81-team/19-william-vicary">http://glaserforensic.com/81-team/19-william-vicary</a> I think I found the name of the forensic psychiatrist that Speilberg works with. Dr. David Glaser. Been active since at least the early 80’s. Just like the notes said, worked with BOTH Cedars Sinai and UCLA Medical Center.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center#1980s">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center#1980s</a> It wasn’t just Heather who died at a Cedars Sinai linked hospital. BOTH River Phoenix and Jonathan Brandis died here. Both of them Pedowood victims. This hospital needs further investigation. </p>
<p>Timeline: </p>
<p>-Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.</p>
<p>Accomplices: Judy Wix</p>
<p>-Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).</p>
<p>-The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather\'s fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.</p>
<p>Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather\'s illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather\'s health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The &quot;skinning&quot; was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral. </p>
<p>Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane.</p>
<p>Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.</p>
<p>-Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.</p>',

           A lengthy shill article attacking the Heather O’Rourke story. Has all the common shill tactics against this story:
          </p>
          <p>
           Calling CDAN a gossip site, but ignoring Enty’s proven track record for exposing sexual predators in Hollywood or for knowing stuff is going to break before it actually happens (big part of why people spread the story in the first place).
          </p>
          <p>
           The official cause being correct: BS. Several GI specialists are on record saying “congenital stenosis” is BS. Also, the account of an RN says its BS too.
          </p>
          <p>
           Heather died directly on set: WRONG. Enty NEVER claimed Heather directly died from the Rocky Road incident. It was implied that COMPLICATIONS from the incident caused the stenosis. Fact: IBD and intestinal stenosis CAN be caused by anal sexual abuse.
          </p>
          <p>

           Someone did an numerology analysis of Heather O’Rourke. This combined with Renegade Anon’s words leave the possibility of Heather’s death being a “medical homicide”.

           Heather was wearing red shoes during one of those Happy Days episodes. Were “they” foreshadowing what plans they had for Heather’s fate.

           Baby Burlesk was a thing in Pedowood even around the time of Shirley Temple. The details of the Heather O’Rourke BI creepily match some of those Shirly Temple films.

           Some occult symbolism in Spielberg films, including Poltergeist.
          </p>

           I think I found the name of the forensic psychiatrist that Speilberg works with. Dr. David Glaser. Been active since at least the early 80’s. Just like the notes said, worked with BOTH Cedars Sinai and UCLA Medical Center.
          </p>
          <p>

           </a>
           It wasn’t just Heather who died at a Cedars Sinai linked hospital. BOTH River Phoenix and Jonathan Brandis died here. Both of them Pedowood victims. This hospital needs further investigation.
          </p>

           Timeline:
          </p>
          <p>
           -Poltergeist Series. Three incidents over a period of 5 years ranging from 1982 to summer of 1987. The crimes themselves occured in Simi Valley, California, Culver City, CA, Altadena, CA, and Chicago, Illinois. Suspects: Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplices: Judy Wix
          </p>
          <p>
           -Happy Days: Most Likely Suspects: Garry Marshall (dead), Bobby Hoffman (dead), Henry Winkler, Tom Hanks, Rob Reiner. Accomplice: Penny Marshall (dead).
          </p>
          <p>
           -The Fatal Incident. Note that this incident is the START of Heather's fatal down turn rather than a quick death. Location: On the set of Rocky Road. Hollywood, California.
          </p>
          <p>
           Time: November 7, 1986. The incident backstage involved anally violating her with a foreign object. 3 men were involved. Execs flocked to the studio, so its possible for a culprit to be one of the flockers. A medic was called in likely because what they did perforated her colon. The injury was severe enough that it also inflicted either penetrative or blunt force trauma on her small intestine, more specifically, her ileum. For this reason, I suspect that the object itself was a hard object. Possibly made of metal or some other hard material. I’d say the object in question was about 10-14” long. Heather's illness (the one that was covered up) first started to manifest around December 1986. I suspect that the Chrons diagnosis was the cover up. The episode was released in May of 1987. She was on medication throughout filming of Poltergeist 3 as her condition worsened. Heather's health took its fatal downward spiral on 1/31/1988 before she died on 2/1/1988. The funeral was an open casket event on 2/5/1988. The "skinning" was most likely on the following night, with the casket being looted. This crime is fully possible because Heather was interred in an above ground mausolium according to accounts of those who attended the funeral.
          </p>
          <p>
           Suspects (Rocky Road): Gene Abravaya, Arthur Annecharico, Chris Colombus, Richard Vane.
          </p>
          <p>
           Accomplice (others): Wesley Staples. Corey Feldman. He actively covers for the big pedowood names and their crimes, which would make him an accomplice. Other accomplices include the MSM, Patrick Little and Tom Steyer due to their involvement in the attempted false flag along with Gabe Hoffman for protecting Steven Spielberg. Fredrick Brennan for deplatforming 8chan, a site that was providing informants in this case. Richard Bretzing.
          </p>
          <p>
           -Cause of Death: Sepsis infection and intestinal stenosis of the ileum (last 1/3 of small intestine) due to repeated anal rape related injuries and infections. The main incident responsible was the injury to her small intestines as a result of the Rocky Road incident.
