<p>This is getting bigger by the day, with more new threads to follow, more pieces of info to sift and sort through. In the last week, a lot of stuff has been found, lost, repeatedly posted, and covered up. Not just here, but all over the web. Especially as the word IS getting out, and more and more people are tuning in.</p>
<p>I have always believed that we need as many pieces to this jigsaw puzzle as possible to help even the stupidest of us on the planet connect the dots and hopefully draw the correct conclusions.  &quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot; should still be our underlying principle, even as we comb through the most miniscule actions and comments in an effort to prove to the world this is really happening.</p>
<p>Not all those who disbelieve are necessarily against those of us who do believe. And there IS a very fair likelihood that some (not all) people may truly be innocent in this entire affair, and are being unjustly lumped in with true perpetrators of some truly heinous and nefarious goings on.</p>
<p>That is one of the main reasons many of us are trying to research and investigate all the leads and evidence, no matter how obtuse or vague the connections may be.</p>
<p>I am attempting at this time, to make a mind map to document ALL the jigsaw pieces, and their connections to #pizzagate as we know them. But, I am far from an expert in even attempting this. Not to mention I certainly don\'t know all the pieces or directions the puzzle building is taking.</p>
<p>It is my hope to, at some point, start a #rabbithole subverse, as a sort of &quot;wiki&quot; of #pizzagate, with a listing and explanation of all the players, their connections to each other, the locations, the photos, the comments, the articles, etc. etc. of the entire situation as we know it and have been discussing it, so that anyone can go to it, and see just what the fuck is going on here, and make their own conclusions.</p>
<p>Now, <em>1.</em> I am still in \'noob\' status, so am unable to create this subverse at the present, and <em>2.</em> I have a LOT of mapping to do before even attempting to present it as a map. We have members from all walks of life, and I have read some posts from people with marketing backgrounds, journalism, research, and just general &quot;I want to help,&quot; comments. At present, I am doing &quot;prep work,&quot; similar to cooks who clean, scrub, and prepare vegetables for a restaurant\'s dinner service. I am trying to at least start to compile the mountains of leads and links of this spider web of intrigue and mystery.</p>
<p>And this is where I need YOUR help, please. I am working with the <em>Freemind</em> mind-mapping software application (freemind.sourceforge.net), and would greatly appreciate collaborating with some of you to <em>1.</em> List all the names, places, dates, and auxiliary evidence (photos, e-mails, quotes, etc.) and <em>2.</em> help to cross-reference and connect the somewhat disjointed and far-flung associations between some of this evidence.</p>
<p>It is a HUGE wad of chew, and I am overwhelmed just trying to explain it all. Once we have a foundation to build upon, I believe it will be far easier to then minimize repetitive posts and easier to see connections. I know there are some out there who will consider this endeavor to be idiotic, a waste of time, futile, and stupid. Please spare me your condemnation replies. I know. I think I must be retarded to even attempt this. But, as most retards will tell you, it seems like a good idea to me...</p>
<p>If you think you can help, by collating the data I try to list, or tackling a portion of the mountain of data to be sorted through, please message me. I most particularly need help with the Instagram photos that have been archived, a list of everyone so far connected to #pizzagate (it is starting to become a very long list of big names), as well as someone to help me with timelines. I DO intend, where possible, to also include &quot;devil\'s advocate&quot; data that may debunk/minimize this information (the thread here about debunking #pizzagate does present SOME [not all] compelling arguments about a few points. But that will be more of a footnote endeavor. My current focus is to get as much of the base information under one giant umbrella, with &quot;circles and arrows and a paragraph&quot; explaining what each piece of the jigsaw puzzle implies...(that was an &quot;Alice\'s Restaurant&quot; reference, btw...)</p>
<p>If you think this is a total waste of time, please spare yourself the energy of telling me. If you have suggestions for Nodes of the Mind map, please tell me. I will try to upload a .jpg of the mindmap as it grows - Once I can figure out how to convert the .mm to a .jpg and upload it to s.lim.g (or however it is spelled). I have a LOT to learn here, thank you for your tolerance and patience...)</p>
<p>Keep fighting the good fight.

At the moment, I can't even find the time to assimilate your efforts, but THANK YOU for all your time and efforts. Will update you soon.

             Thank you. Yes, I have a copy on my hard drive, and have been pulling bits and pieces off to fill my lists on my mind map.

             This is a HUGE amount of information, even discrediting some of the more obtuse affiliations and connections that are tenuous at best...

            So, who is this "Someone," and who are the police investigators. You have all these interesting tidbits, but NO valid links to back it up.
           </p>
           <p>
            MANY pedo cases are deliberately derailed, covered up, and dismissed. While the Madeline McCann investigation IS a potential tie in (those artist sketches and the missing e-mails are highly suspect!) Some vague story about "someone" finding "something" does not pass muster in the situation. FIND and LINK the article to this "someone," or FIND the NAMES of the supposed investigators framing the wrong guy. STAY FOCUSED. Don't just pull up any vague tale to try to add to the evidence. In order to get the general populace to SEE and BELIEVE, we cannot tell vague stories. We NEED verifiable names, or links, or something more than "someone"...
           </p>
           <p>
            The term "Fake News" is already being applied to this. Please don't give them additional off-the-wall connections to make it look any more loony. It's hard enough as it is to try to present a convincing collection of facts. VERIFIABLE facts.

            Unfortunately, while I have a ton of info saved, it is not sorted and as I am only able to use my phone, it is too difficult to even try right now.  I would like to help, though.

            I can play devil's advocate (I have already found a couple of things that are posted all over the net to be erroneous) and can help verify information and locate links if you would like.

              I have seen the claim that there is an abandoned tunnel directly under the section of Conneticut Ave. where Comet and the other businesses are located, but I have not been able to confirm that.  There are old trolley car tunnels that run under Dupont Circle, which Conneticut underpasses down the road from Comet, but it appears to me they run perpendicular to Conneticut.  They are being used again, though.

              There are, however, two pictures that Comet's owner posted on his Instagram that show people breaking through cement.  You'll have to scroll through this link to see them.  I know there are links to each separately, but I am as yet unfamiliar with this site they want us to use to link images, sorry.

               OOH! TY for those links! Yes, I've seen the one picture where they have pickaxed thru to "the basement?" with some beer kegs next to 2-3 guys. Hopefully that picture will pop up again.
Thanks again for the links!

               Confirmation that the underground "whatsit" (tunnel? complex? labyrinth?) does run under Comet Ping Pong is something I have not seen verified either. That will be a most interesting thing to discover for sure!

            <p>
             MANY thanks. At present, my three main nodes off of #pizzagate are:
            </p>
            <p>
             Players - As I try to list everyone whose name is connected to this,
            </p>
            <p>
             Locations - All the buildings, businesses, and physical locations connected to it,
            </p>
            <p>
             and "Sources" (needs a better name) - Trying to list all the auxiliary evidence: the photos, the comments, the news articles (pre-pizzagate), the events at Comet Ping Pong, the FBI symbols list, etc. etc.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you would pick one to help list all the puzzle pieces, it would help, if only to be able to compare and cross reference lists. If you chooose "Sources," you can narrow your focus to just one part of that mountain of pieces, or just list all the pieces parts that you have come across for me to add to the mountain.
            </p>
            <p>
             Again, thank you.
            </p>
