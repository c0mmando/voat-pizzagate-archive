<p>On Wednesday, Gailhaguet had refused to step down, saying he had made \'mistakes\' but that he was never \'at fault\'.</p>

<p>French prosecutors on Tuesday launched a preliminary investigation into former figure skating coach .Gilles Beyer for the alleged rape of a minor and sexual aggression.</p>
<p>Former figure skater Sarah Abitbol, a bronze medallist, recently published a book in which she said Beyer had raped her multiple times from 1990 to 1992.</p>

<p>Beyer last week said that he had had \'intimate\' and \'inappropriate\' relations with Abibtol, who is now 44, in comments to Agence France Presse. His lawyers on Friday said in a statement he \'reserved his comments for the prosecutors\'.</p>

<p>The inquiry showed that in 1999 Beyer went to an underage skater\'s bedroom during a training camp and \'put his hand behind the young girl\'s neck, pulled her toward him and asked, \'Do you want me to kiss you or do you want me to go\'.\'</p>
<p>\'He asked her how old she was, adding, after she had told him she was 17, \'17 or 18, it doesn\'t change anything\',\' stated the report, which Reuters has seen.</p>
<p>\'Everybody makes mistakes. I made mistakes but I was never at fault,\' Gailhaguet, who said he initiated the 2000 inquiry, told a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>\'Yes, the executive committee named him (Beyer) team manager of the juniors team in 2011. It\'s easy to judge now that we know the facts.\'</p>

            He was never at fault for his mistakes? What? If you make a mistake you own it. Assault/rape is not some little mistake.
