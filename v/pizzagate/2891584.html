<h2>The 65-year-old  \'surrendered\' and agreed to an undisclosed financial settlement with attorney Bradley Edwards, who represents several of Epstein\'s alleged victims.</h2>
<h2>Edwards had sued the financier alleging malicious prosecution and defamation after the billionaire filed a lawsuit attacking Edwards and his methods.</h2>
<h2>Epstein admitted today to making \'totally false allegations.\'</h2>
<h2><em>More than 60 girls have claimed they were turned into sex slaves by Epstein when they were teenagers and Edwards previously won $5.5million for some victims.</em></h2>
<h2><em>In this case, which has dragged on since 2009, Edwards was suing the financier for \'malicious prosecution\' as the result of a long-running battle between the two men.</em></h2>
<h2><em>Epstein had tried to sue the lawyer claiming the civil cases involving three victims financed an unlawful Ponzi scheme run by Scott Rothstein, a partner at Edwards\' former law firm.</em></h2>
<h2><em>Rothstein was convicted of financial fraud and got 50 years, but denied Edwards had been involved in the scheme.</em></h2>
<h2><em>Epstein then dropped his case, but Edwards then sued over his reputation.</em></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The settlement means none of the women will be able to testify against Epstein, who is accused of pimping out 80 underage girls to his friends from 1995 - 2005.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edwards\' lawyer Jack Scarola told the court the climbdown was \'not a compromise but a surrender\' by the \'serial sex offender.\'   
</p>
<p>\'For the sake of Epstein\'s victims, Bradley Edwards would not and did not compromise his claims. He did not settle for anything less than a complete surrender by Jeffrey Epstein,\' Scarola said. </p>
<p>\'While the financial terms of the settlement are required to remain confidential, there are important components that are not confidential.\' </p>
<p>He revealed Edwards remains committed to continue with his challenge to Epstein\'s sweetheart \'non prosecution agreement\' that allowed him to escape a possible life sentence and serve just 13 months in a Florida state facility.</p>
<p>He added: \'That will be followed through to conclusionâ€¦.to set aside the non-prosecution agreement for Jeffrey Epstein and his named and unnamed co-defendants fully responsible for the crime that they have committed.\'</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Epstein was not in court on Tuesday but his attorney Scott Link read out his apology in which he admitted to lying.</strong> </p>
<p>\'While Mr Edwards was representing clients against me, I filed a lawsuit against him in which I made allegations about him that the evidence conclusively proves were absolutely false,\' he said. </p>
<p>\'The truth was that his aggressive investigation and litigation style was highly effective and therefore troublesome to me.\'</p>
<p>\'The lawsuit I filed was my unreasonable attempt to damage his business reputation and cause Mr Edwards to stop pursuing cases against me. It did not work.\'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>\'Despite my efforts, he continued to do an excellent job for his clients and through his relentless pursuit, held me responsible. I am now admitting that I was wrong and that the things I said to try to harm Mr Edwards\' reputation as a trial lawyer were false.\'</p>
<p>\'I sincerely apologize for the false and hurtful allegations I made and hope for some forgiveness or my acknowledgement of wrongdoing.\'</p>
<h1></h1>
<p>As many as 60 other girls have come forward to claim they were recruited by Epstein into having sex with his coterie of friends and acquaintances while they were aged between 14 and 17. Many were from disadvantaged homes or had troubled childhoods.</p>
<p>The underage girls were lured to Epstein\'s mansion in Florida with the lure of a couple hundred dollars to give him a massage- he allegedly sexually assaulted many of them </p>
<p>Despite what began as a full-blown FBI investigation into Epstein\'s alleged prostitution ring of young girls, he was eventually offered a \'sweetheart\' deal in 2007 instead of facing a possible life sentence. </p>
<p>Victims were outraged at the court\'s treatment of the billionaire, who counted Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew among his rich and powerful friends.     
</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty to two prostitution charges in a Florida state court following an agreement that effectively kicked out a 53-page federal indictment.</p>
<p>The hedge-fund tycoon was sentenced to 18 months and served just 13 in Palm Beach County stockade, not a state prison. He was reportedly allowed out for up to 12 hours a day to visit his office and meet clients.  
</p>
<p>The \'non prosecution\' deal with the state also meant he, his named co-conspirators and his unnamed co-conspirators were given immunity from federal prosecution.  
</p>
<p>The deal was also sealed from the public and the victims, meaning no one would  ever learn the entirety of Epstein\'s crimes. </p>
<p>The deal was brokered by Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta when he was US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.  
</p>
<h2>Edwards alleges the deal violated the Crime Victims\' Right Act, which states victims should be kept informed of possible hearings and \'reasonably heard\' over pleas and sentencing.</h2>
<h2>He wrote in a court filing that if the victims knew about the non-prosecution agreement \'they would have taken steps to object\', according to the New York Times.</h2>
<h2>Epstein could be stripped of his criminal prosecution immunity if the case succeeds, possibly leading to a federal trial for the sex crimes.</h2>
<p>Scarola had said earlier this week that the purpose of the second case is to \'invalidate Epstein\'s non-prosecution agreement.\'    
</p>
<p>\'If the case is successful and with the agreement canceled, Epstein\'s immunity from federal criminal prosecution will be revoked,\' he said. </p>
<p>\'That means he, plus his named co-conspirators and his unnamed co-conspirators will face the possibility of federal prosecution.</p>
<p>\'In a subsequent criminal trial it is very likely that many of the victims will be called to give evidence and heard their stories heard.\'

            You guys continue to play the fool. The system is a farce, yet you look to the subverted system to provide justice. You all deserve the next eight years. I know everything you refuse to learn, and sharing it with you is like talking to the wall. Keep getting played fools. Arrest just around the corner, right? Agenda 21 will deal with each of you soon enough. It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.

            Pay attn. to the photos..he looked like a hardened criminal in the UK Daily Mail photo...definitely looking like things have gone south for him. Dershawitz has changed his tune from  totally innocent to embarrassed at being affiliated with him. ABC morning show this morning was damning ...actually an honest report....for US MSM. This is also different. Even Gayle King didn't manage to show him support. She has done this in the past , showing she was on the side of the rapists...little subtlties ...some not so subtle on this subject.

            Thereâ€™s one person we can blame...Black Hat Mueller, that son of a Gestapo officer. After all, he was involved in Epsteinâ€™s past sweet heart deal.
           </p>
           <p>
            Therefore, Mueller was behind witness intimidations to hwlp protect Epstein.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mueller needs to be the target of an extensive dig. NO information off the table in what gets made publc.

              Not "kidding" at all. They're adult women now, and they started as prostitutes, so it's no surprise that they wanted money over justice. You have no idea what their income is, so to say that they "are poor" is an ignorant statement. Stop letting your emotions override rational, objective, analysis.

             Edwards remains committed to continue with his challenge to Epstein's sweetheart 'non prosecution agreement' that allowed him to escape a possible life sentence and serve just 13 months in a Florida state facility.

            Heh. This is excellent!
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I read, the vicious tactics used by Epstein's legal team against victims, their families, his employees, the investigators and the state and federal prosecutors were insane. They took down multiple victims' attorneys by maneuvers like this to destroy their reputations. It's crazy.

            This win will make it much more likely that information will ultimately come out.
