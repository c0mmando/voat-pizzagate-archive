            Random thought.  I'm pretty sure a lot of us were wondering
            <strong>
             WTF
            </strong>
            when Pamela Anderson started getting involved with Julian Assange over a year ago, flying to the UK to hang out with him.  And he recently included her in a Tweet with photos of others where he says "My intermediaries are legion."
            <a href="https://twitter.com/julianassange/status/931589328270131200?lang=en">
             https://twitter.com/julianassange/status/931589328270131200?lang=en
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            I guess it's obvious in retrospect that Pamela, Playboy Bunny, acted as an intermediary between Julian and the commodity he deals in, which is information.

            This is a very positive opening further into the world of Hefner and CIA ....
underground tunnels and those who frequented the Playboy Mansion.

            Q is limited hangout. He has got you to stop focussing on the Satanic systematic traficking of children and made you into his disciples waiting on his next nugget of truth. That is not how it works. Wake up or sleep.

            Not sure if anyone has mentioned this somewhere already, but this is a book written by a former playmate and ex girlfriend of hugh Hefner, Holly Madison.
           </p>
           <p>
            It’s called
            <br/>
            Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny
           </p>
           <p>
            “A former girlfriend of Hugh Hefner describes how her years inside the Playboy Mansion went from a fairytale of A-list celebrity parties to an oppressive regime of strict rules, scheduled sex, and a total loss of identity, so much so that she even contemplated suicide”

            Thanks to you srayzie !! Amazing info being shared in this thread! I've no idea why my earlier comments when you first made the post didn't send. I was eating out where the internet wasn't so good, so I guess that's why. I'm so sorry. Bravo to all your diggers, this is painting a fascinating picture indeed. God Speed.

            In 1953, Hugh Hefner setup Playboy, which was eventually revealed to be bankrolled by the CIA. It was the same year the CIA was officially incorporated from the OSS.

            By murals openly visible at the Playboy Mansion, Hefner is associated with a secret elite Dionysian Cult. Once secret Luciferian rituals hidden away within the Playboy Mansion, Hefner’s Dionysian Cult is now associated with an annual public Shakespearean “A Midsummer Night’s Dream Party (Rite).”[7]

            Playboy was a desensitization tool for young boys and the masses, it was a catalogue for those that could afford it. However, each mk-ultra trained 'sex kitten' or 'bunny' led you into rooms wired for sound and video, and the girls were proficient at collecting sperm samples. Imagine the array of sports stars, actors, politicians and big businessman could have been compromised by such an operation?

Team and whoever else has codes “triggers” and enough money to afford “state of the art” Oz-Dorothy, Jewel prog’md DID (MPD) lovelies. This NSA-CIA asset w/his degree in psychology (read Mind Control Prog’mr) controls an army of BETA-trained Sex Slaves available for blackmail, espionage (honeypots), underground porn and whatever else their ”ALTERS” (mind files) are Prog’md for. Hefner works closely w/MK Prog’mr/handler Heinz (Henry) Kissinger, and operates under full protection of NSA/CIA military-apparatus.”[41]

            The 1974 death of 1968 Playmate of the Month, Paige Young, is linked to Hugh Hefner and Bill Cosby who used her as a personal “Sex Toy.” When Paige took her life on a Palm Sunday, she wanted to make a STATEMENT and stir an investigation into Hefner’s Satanic Playboy Circle, she left pictures of Hefner labeled the DEVIL, and a large PENTAGRAM that had nothing to do with the five wounds of Christ on the floor of her Hollywood apartment. Undoubtedly, she was trying to tell us about repressed memories of a PENTAGRAM being a central part of a Ritual to indoctrinate her into the Cult of the DARK MESSIAH.

             Thanks for your post.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a victim, I frequently went to the Playboy mansion with enablers in the 1990's as a young kid  (I am male). 
I would observe all sorts of weirdness. The staff of the house was by many measures 'normal,' but there were always meltdowns and emergencies that always needed to be dealt with. At the frequent parties neighbors and celebrities would come, not all were in on it or involved. You would have to know who to ask for, and be referred, to get to the 'next level.'
            </p>
            <p>
             Hefner was definitely a devil worshiper. He would drug and rape new 'recruits.' Not everyone knew what they were signing up for. Many of the women would lure new girls into it. Many thought they were just coming for modeling careers. Hefner was very good at getting girls drugged. All he had to do was offer a drunk. Alcohol or not, didn't matter, he knew what to offer so they couldn't taste it. Sickening to think about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'll wager to say if Hefner was ever working with the CIA, that they eventually broke off when he branched out and started doing his own thing, and started working with other organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
             <em>
              "it was a catalogue for those that could afford it."
             </em>
             Bingo. People don't realize it, but everything was/is for sale. Some customers would come wanting crazy things and the models would have to oblige. It goes without saying that many athletes and film stars were clients.
            </p>
            <p>
             But, many operations were blackmail schemes involving a very high profile attorney (in the news today). It was pay up, or the story goes public, and that would end you career.

             A blueprint was found in the basement of the Playboy Mansion, detailing plans to dig tunnels to the homes of "Mr J Nicholson", "Mr W Beatty", "Mr K Douglas" and "Mr J Caan".

            Bill Cosby's ex girlfriend said that 'Hugh Hefner was the devil" before killing herself. Seems MKULTRA related.

             There was a time (before pizzagate) when I felt bad for Bill Cosby. I thought that all those women just wanted their 15 minutes of fame when they called him out. Now I don't doubt it at all.

              Right, because as you will subtly begin to realize that those women were all CALLED UPON, SUMMONED if you will, and all went down as a sort of executive decision from on high through a COVEN.
             </p>
             <p>
              The PTB are using Cosby, as per part of all satanic agreements, at full knowledge of the price of his bargain, as a MASS PSYCHOLOGICAL TOOL TO DEMORALIZE THE PUBLIC. Your idols are all melting, your lives are being intentionally manipulated so that it will reenforce already existing conditioning about the black man, fatherhood and race relations. It is meant to form strong anchors in both the black man and the white race, nay all ethnicities.
             </p>
             <p>
              As well, this is what all these celebrity reveals are all about.

                Oh no.  They were absolutely victimized, however,  were fully aware of what their role was in compromising their target.  That is,  depending on their level of conditioning if they were aware or not.  I'd be willing to bet they were consciously trained in sexual extortion but I guarantee some of those 'bunnies'  were fully mk'd operatives that had alters that made them unaware of certain operations.

                 Yeah. I think some allow it because they continue. Fame is more important. Then they cry like victims when others come out.

              Hold on a sec...screech! I'm with you on all of that, BUT...do you remember when Cosby was all over the place telling the black community to grow up and start taking responsibility for themselves? Uh huh, and you can imagine what TPTB thought about that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Now think about the reports of his horrible abuse in recent years. I remember when I finally gave in and read the full article on the topic. The story was about how he DRUGGED AND RAPED A GIRL. Fair enough. But at I read I realized the girl was a 33 YEAR OLD WOMAN at the time, she had pestered Cosby for drugs but he didn't have any, then he finally obtained a few Quayludes which she ASKED FOR so he gave her some. Afterwards, they had sex. Oh, the horror!
             </p>
             <p>
              Just saying, it's complicated. And I'm no Cosby defender. I'm aware that he was Royalty by blood and ushered into entertainment while a mere sophomore in college.

            It's well known Playboy bunnies were used just like the original Presidential Model Marilyn Monroe to entice &amp; to blackmail heads of corp &amp; politicians around the world. Adultery from US Congress members representing Conservative Bible Belt districts was still very shocking, especially since much of the recorded footage was of orgies.

             Thanks you two, I'm just doing my bit like everyone else, for God and country, to bring end to this darkness. Thanks for the offer of help! Anything you can do to get the info being uncovered out there will help alongside praying, and posting memes on SM to RedPill those who have no idea yet. Thank you guys!

            I saw someone comment somewhere else (then I lost it) that it would be a good idea for anyone with old issues to look back through the articles to see if anything of note is there.
           </p>
           <p>
            A thought of my own is that such magazines might have been a way to subvert young minds. The kids sneak the magazines, see their first sexual images, then that could get tied to whatever is next to them? Trigger words, items, ideas?

             I don't think that "mind control" really works like that.  I mean it's pretty clear that our government has developed some means to manipulate people into behaving weirdly, but in practice I think what they do is they run a false flag on someone who is already impressionable with a combination of drugs and bullying.  And then they roll the dice. 
It's not like your brain has some secret receptors in it that I can "hack" or something to make you begin behaving like a robot.  Can you bully people?  Obviously.  Manipulate people?  Absolutely.  But it would be difficult to get a reliable agent to go against his instincts, against his family, against his country.  "Brainwashed people", and that's a terrible word for it, are unpredictable.
             <br/>
             My point is that I don't think that this works the way that you think it does.

              You're missing the bigger picture.
Mind control is a very real thing. The level at which it is done varies, but for this high level mind control, you can count on the following variables being used: Drugs, Electric Shock Therapy, done repeatedly, and for extended amounts of time.
             </p>
             <p>
              There's no quick way to hack someone's brain, like you wrote. Some people are more susceptible to it than others, but bottom line with drugs and shock therapy, they can program anyone. Also another reason they start with young children, teenagers. Their brain is more susceptible and 'elastic.'
             </p>
             <p>
              As a victim myself, it's take me years to undo years of programming. 
Read the book 'Thanks for the Memories' by Bryce to see how deep it goes, how effective it is.

              For the first 40 years of my 48 year life I believed what you've stated, essentially. And I've followed very fringe topics for many years.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then I was sent "Operation Mind Control" by Walter Bowart. Springmeir had piqued my curiosity after explicitly detailing the many dozens of layers of alters in a single person and the complex relationships between each. But I doubted that such tight control and regulation of consciousness and memory could be possible. But after the Bowart book and a friend explaining that mind control war largely simple hypnosis, I changed my mind.
             </p>
             <p>
              The final barrier for you may be related to your view of what "susceptible" to hypnosis really means. I heard one hypnotist describe how he often speaks to people who think they aren't good candidates. He said, as he talks them through why their technique doesn't work, they become deeply hypnotized.
             </p>
             <p>
              When you hear me say "dolphin popcorn" you will awaken and have no memory of this conversation. Really? Is it that simple? Apparently so, with a little bit of other knowledge. Something to think about.

               Tyranny --
              </p>
              <p>
               Hadn't heard of the Bowart book -- but on the internet you will find 
Operation Mockingbird ...
and there are two other Operations which worked with it ...
Operation Paperclip (200,000 ex-Nazis used to found the CIA, funneled into the FBI and other 
government agencies and to "hot spots" around the world to ensure the rise of the Fourth Reich),
and Operation Gladio which would ensure that only right wing governments would rise and 
control government in nations over which the US had influence and control after WWII -- i.e.,
France, Italy, Germany, Japan.  In Italy, the US actually resurrected the Mafia in order to ensure
the plan was carried out properly.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you're here, I'm sure you're familiar with CIAs MKULTRA ... but I would suspect that TORTURE became recognized as the way to create new personalities based in information gained by the Catholic Church/Vatican 
over the long history of their 'Crusades" and "The Inquistion" and the "Hammer of Witches."
               <br/>
               The Vatican would have passed this information on to the Third Reich and Elites.
Organized patriarchal religions underpin Elite Patriarchy.
In turn the Nazis would have passed this info on to the OSS/CIA.
Pope Pius XII actually catapulted Hitler to power.
However, it was American Elites and International Elites who recruited Hitler -- from what
I've read from a brothel where he was a homosexual prostitute.
               <br/>
               And, again, we see that Hitler was also severe beaten by his father as a child.
These are the kinds of men recruited by Elites.
              </p>
              <p>
               Re HYPNOSIS ....
It would be impossible to argue that hypnosis hasn't been made a TABOO subject in the US.
Rarely mentioned or discussed any longer.
              </p>
              <p>
               From what I've read ... Sigmund Freud's original method of the "talking therapy" was to hypnotise
the patient.  However, as he began to recruit followers who would carry on the profession of 
psychiatry, it turned out that a good number of them were unable to hypnotize their patients.
Therefore, hypnotism was removed as a necessity for a psychiatrist to be able to perform.
Interestingly, we still see some of this in old movies -- dramas and comedies -- one of these
was SPELLBOUND (1945) where near the end you see Peck being hypnotized.
              </p>
              <p>
               Mind Control isn't simple hypnosis.  In order to create "disassociation" or split personalities, 
trauma seems to be necessary -- not only to initiate the split personalities but to maintain them.
You'll find some of the answers in Operation MKULTRA by Wiki.
Also note that the Host is generally unaware of the other personalities or what they are doing.
CIA used young children for homosexual prostitution, drug running, and for espionage/spying-blackmail.
This was all funded by Congress.
              </p>
              <p>
               Many people who are aware of the splitting of personalities don't know that the new personalities
can also be programmed -- to speak a different language, and/or with photographic memories.
Presumably with other talents?
              </p>
              <p>
               This is about Mind Control over populations ...
it doesn't begin and end with Mind Control over one individual -- or a few Manchurian Candidates.

                I'l love a link or a source showing that Hitler was a homosexual prostitute as a child. Just to show to a few others that would trip.

                At one point Nazis preferred to advance gay men. Then they flipped and sent them all to the camps where many quickly perished. Sad that there is no memorial for gays.

                  In 2001, noted German historian Lothar Machtan published the book, "Hitler's Secret: The Double Life of a Dictator." As the far left London newspaper, The Guardian, reveals, not only is it a well-established matter of historical record that Hitler was a practicing homosexual, he murdered those around him who threatened to expose his sexual preference to the public.

                 Wherever I read it, the emphasis was on Hitler recruitment by Elites/International Elites.

                 These kinds of workings of the mind seem to have been active in the thinking of Allen Dulles,
for instance, who eventually ran a training camp for pedophiles out of the CIA.

                  “Oh we do have our stable of weird people working for us. Did I ever tell you about the Pedophile Academy? We actually had one down at Camp Peary, (in Virginia) right near (the CIA’s) Jim Critchfield’s place. I don’t know if you’re aware of it, but we called it ‘The Farm,’ and it was supposed to be a secret training center for young agents. Allen Dulles set up this training center down there for pedophiles. They were in training to seduce, molest, and most especially photograph the young children of targets. Not only, Allen reasoned, would our graduates have a spanking good time but they could get wonderful action photos of the wee ones to blackmail their families with. I understand they broke it up when one of the graduates nailed a (CIA) Deputy Director’s son at a summer camp.”

                 But you also have to remember that MKULTRA also shows us that children (who obviously
would not have all been homosexual) were manipulated within that program to create new
personalities (disassociation) and that those new personalities were programmed and trained
to perform homosexually when they were with targets they were spying on for blackmail.
If they didn't perform as trained they were under threat of further torture.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I don't know about Hitler specifically "as a child" -- except that his father beat him brutally.
And that he dearly loved his Mother who I imagine tried to intercede.
And that the sexually abusive father of a child was what the CIA looked for ... the father
was rewarded financially and the child taken into the MKULTRA program.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Don't know if you read the Kevin Spacey family story told by the brother ... but the women
in these families are themselves usually abused, threatened.

                 The Menendez Brothers also told really sad and horrible stories of their childhood -- 
and the Mother in that case was also an active abuser.  This often happens when
females are under threat by an abusive heterosexual male.  No one can say now 
whether this sexual abuse was in any way natural to her -- either generationally in
her own family, or whether she had been sexually abused as a child.

                 Also remember that Hitler was a baptized Catholic and experienced Catholic training.
In fact, he wrote questioning why he was being criticized for his treatment of Jews when
the RCC had been doing the same thing for centuries.... though he was moving towards
a "final solution."
                </p>
                <p>
                 Quote -- 
"Well, what do you really object to in my treatment of the Jews?
I have certainly been consistent.
I am doing what the Catholic Church has already done for fifteen centuries.
The difference between the Church and me is that I am finishing the job."

                <p>
                 The Vatican kept Jews in Jewish Ghettoes for more than 1,000 years ...
forcing them to wear Yellow Stars on the clothing and isolating them from society in the Papal States.
They were barred from education, university, careers, professions.
Somewhere around 1860's, first the French began to close down the Jewish Ghettoes and then
the Italians closed them down.  At this point, the Pope went into hiding/isolation and when he 
came out again, it was with the theory of "Papal Infallibility" which he proclaimed.  At that time, 
the Italians also moved the Vatican back into the 1 or 2 square mile area it now occupies.
The Italians also tell us that Catholic priests were sexually abusing children from day #1.

                 PS - --
                 <strong>
                  Hitler himself likely functioned as a male prostitute in the days of his youth in Vienna
                 </strong>
                 Needless to say, heterosexual males have also done the same to survive.
Just as homosexuals married and had children in order to appear "normal."

                 Re gay memorial -- 
I'm not sure there is even anything related to the AIDS epidemic yet.
Saw something on that the other night and still no mention of how/who might have
begun that epidemic in the gay community.  CIA?
Similarly the HIV/AIDS epidemic which seemed to have been transmitted by polio vaccine.
Seems to be why Big Pharma is considered part of the "national security state."

                 Thank you -- will have to save the link for another day.
But I am familiar with Bonacci -- who also reveals that he was used to aid
in the kidnapping of Johnny Gosch (which seems to have been arranged by
the father) .... and he apologized for it which proves you really can't destroy
a person's mind or heart forever.

                  It does not but you do because you are a designated family wrecker. Its your job. Its what you do. Your side of the fence seeks to intentionally destroy the nuclear family and all that is cohesive and nurturing in the societies of "others." I have you pegged like a nail. I know exactly what you are.

                     In order for parents to protect their children, they have to know just who the sexual abusers
of children are -- and historically they are males ...
INCEST is one of the oldest crimes committed by fathers, grandfathers, uncles, male cousins --
and male friends of the family.

                       Overall, look at the poverty rate of Africans here since they were hauled here
to perform as slaves.  Look at the rate of imprisonment of AA's here.
Look at the 50% or more unemployment among young AA males.
This is our own government destroying the AA family, including in what's left
of it's "Welfare" requirements.

                      <p>
                       Look at the attempts state by state by right wing government to return to segregation
in our public schools and to destroy public education by moving tax-payer dollars
into support for "Charter" schools -- all of which deprives AA's of educations equal
to educations received by "whites."

                        However, not everyone agrees with the premise of the moral decline “epidemic” argument. Critics argue the use of this statistic perpetuates an assumption that children born out of wedlock don’t have fathers involved in their lives and ignores other reports concerning the black marriage rate. Ta-nehisi Coates has criticized this conversation and responded by breaking down the numbers:
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        As you can see the drop in the birthrate for unmarried black women is mirrored by an even steeper drop among married black women. Indeed, whereas at one point married black women were having more kids than married white women, they are now having less.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I point this out to show that the idea that the idea that, somehow, the black community has fallen into a morass of cultural pathology is convenient nostalgia. There is nothing “immoral” or “pathological” about deciding not to marry.

                        Until you can come to grips with who is responsible for the slave trade and who destroyed the Native American Indians, which is not the "white heterosexual male" then you can get your own grip and stop groping our communities.

A smirk spread across my face when I watched CNN's Wolf Blitzer give the “ Breaking News” this week that the U.S. Senate issued a formal apology to African Americans for Slavery and the era of Jim Crow. It is obvious the election of President Obama helped to usher that through. However, what does it ... **

                          Whereas after emancipation from 246 years of slavery, African-Americans soon saw the fleeting political, social, and economic gains they made during Reconstruction eviscerated by virulent racism, lynchings, disenfranchisement, Black Codes, and racial segregation laws that imposed a rigid system of officially sanctioned racial segregation in virtually all areas of life;

February 20,1766, a letter by Aaron Lopez to Captain William Stead. October 8,1766, a letter by Captain William Stead to Aaron Lopez.

                             Aside from that, there are similar statements out of letters by Aaron Lopez in the original, which he directed to the Captains Henry Cruger, David Mill, Henry White, Thomas Dolbeare, and William Moore. Indeed, one letter by Captain William Moore to Aaron Lopez &amp; Company, is particularly revealing, and of special mention at this point. We wish to remark on the main contents of this letter in which Captain Moore writes: “I wish to advise you that your ship ‘Ann’ docked here night before last with 112 slaves, consisting of 35 men, 16 large youths, 21 small boys, 29 women, 2 grown girls, 9 small girls, and I assure you this is such a one rum cargo (rum in exchange for slaves) which I have not yet encountered, among the entire group there may be five to which one could take exception. “
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The date of the above letter was November 27,1773. We have not yet concluded, because of lack of space, the excerpts and grateful compilations made available by the “Carnegie Institute.”

                            You think its ok for Jews to be slave traders. You made that perfectly clear. You need to get help for your supremecy issues because you can't admit that the zionist jews are the slave traders. That means you have narcissistic personality disorder masked in a false victimhood status. You just left a long trail of getting your ass handed to you. I am a formidable opponent. You are not accustomed to that. Get used to it. You just displayed extreme racism

                              When all else fails whip out the Hasbara handbook and blame the victim. I can't remember which page that is on at the moment though. I bet you do though. Thats a nice little book. I'll have mine handy for next time your racist narcissistic delusions show up.

                                 The staggering amounts of money acquired by the Jew ship owners and slavery dealers is better illustrated when we emphasize the many years in which this sale and purchase of human flesh was practiced. Prior to 1661, all of the Colonies had laws prohibiting slavery. It was in that year that the Jews had become powerful enough to bring about the repeal of these laws, and slavery began in earnest.

                               The fact that Aaron Lopez had control of over more than half of the combined deals in the Colonies of Rhode Island, with Newport, is well-known. The well-known Rabbi Morris A. Gutstein, in his book, The Story of the Jews in Newport, attempts to remove these facts, maintaining that there is not any evidence that the Jews were connected with the Slave Trade. It is therefore imperative to prove that the Jew was indeed connected with the slave trading. Especially so since this rabbi insists they had made great contributions, and how very “blessed” their residence became for the city of Newport. Surely Morris A. Gutstein will grant us permission to present the facts which he was unable to find.

                               Turning to one report of the Chamber of Commerce of the “Rhode Island Colony” in the year 1764, we find, for instance, that in the year 1723 “a few merchants in Newport” devised the idea to send their Newport rum to the coast of Africa. It developed into such a great export that in the matter of a few years “several thousand (hogsheads)” of rum went that way. To which purpose did this rum serve?

                          You are laying the blame on a nebulous entity such as "government" that has no individual faces. When will the Jews apologize for enslaving the black slaves by kidnapping them and forcing them into their slave ships? I want to talk about the Jewish role in starting, controlling, and profiting off other peoples misery. I want you to admit that the white male race is not responsible for slavery, but that it is distinctly the Jews responsible for black slavery and for "indentured servants" of the white race which is also slavery by a fancy Jewish name.

                         Hayman Levy was soon joined by Jews Nicholas Lowe and Joseph Simon. Lowe conceived the idea of trading rum and whiskey to the Indians and set up a distillery in Newport, where these two liquors were produced. Within a short time there were 22 distilleries in Newport, all of them owned by Jews, manufacturing and distributing ‘firewater.’ The story of the debauching of the Indians with its resultant massacres of the early settlers, is a dramatic story in itself.

                        <p>
                         You're now saying the Luciferians destroyed the Indians ... ?
112 million native people here?
You're claiming the world "New" now as something shunned by white heterosexual males.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         And onto your anti-Jewish postings . . . .
If those selling rum/whiskey to the native people were working for the US 
government I'd be greatly surprised.
It was only by such means did the US finally get any native period -- allegedly --
to suggest that they "owned" any land here which could be SOLD.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Of course the natives people here held the land in common --
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Their major mistake was in not building a wall.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The "New Frontier" was BS ...if a conquering nation wants to claim/hold land
there have to be people on it to defend it.  The entire farce of settlers who were pushed onto native lands has fallen apart long ago.  The "Heartland" was anything but.... it was the US sending settlers onto native land.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Today our US government is still warring on Indians/native people -- 
stealing their natural resources, overturning treaties, stealing their land.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Again -- find something else to do -- get help.

                        It is essential to comprehend the seaport of Newport. It is important in order to recognize the Jewish share in the Slave commerce. There was a period when it was commonly referred to as ‘The Jewish Newport-World center of Slave Commerce.’ All together, at this time, there were in North America six Jewish communities: Newport, Charleston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, and Savanuah. There were also many other Jews, scattered over the entire East Coast. Although New York held first place in the settlers of Jews in North America, Newport held second place. New York was also the main source of Kosher meat, supplying the North American settlements, then the West Indies and also South America. Now Newport took over! Newport also became the great trade harbour of the East Coast of North America. There, vessels from other ports met, to exchange commodities. Newport, as previously mentioned, represented the foremost place in the commerce of rum, whiskey, and liquor dealings. And to conclude, it finally became the Main Center of Slave dealings. It was from this port that the ships left on their way across the ocean, to gather their black human cargo and then derive great sums of money in exchange for them.

                       <p>
                        An authentic, contemporary report, based on authority, indicates that of 128 Slave ships, for instance, unloaded in Charleston, within one year, their “Cargo,” 120 of these were undersigned by Jews from Newport and Charleston by their own name. About the rest of them, one can surmise, although they were entered as Boston (1), Norfolk (2), and Baltimore (4), their real owners were similarly the Jewish slave dealers from Newport and Charleston.

                        One is able to assess the Jewish share in the entire dealings of the Newport, if one considers the undertaking of a lone Jew, the Portuguese, Aaron Lopez, who plays an important part in the over-all story of the Jews and Slavery.

                        Concerning the entire commerce of the Colonies, and the later State of Rhode Island, (which included Newport) bills of lading, concessions, receipts, and port clearances carried the signature name of the Jew Aaron Lopez. This all took place during the years 1726 to 1774. He had therefore more than 50% of all dealings under his personal control for almost fifty years. Aside from that there were other ships which he owned, but sailed under other names.

                        In the year 1749, the first Masonic Lodge was established. Ninety percent of the members of this first lodge, fourteen all told, were Jews. And one knows that only so-called ’’prominent” individuals were accepted. Twenty years later, the second Masonic Lodge, “King David,” was established. It is a fact that all of these members were Jews.

                        In the meantime, the Jewish influence in Newport had reached such proportions that President George Washington decided to pay them a visit. Upon his appearance, both of the Masonic Lodges sent an emissary—a Jew named Moses Seixas—to approach the President with a petition, in which the Jews of Newport stated: “If you will permit the children of Abraham to approach you with a request, to tell you that we honor you, and feel an alliance and then: “Until the present time the valuable rights of a free

                          You need to acknowledge that the Jews were the black slave merchants and stop whining about anti-semitism because you believe you are allowed to be the slave traders. What makes you think Jews have the right to get pissed off because us white and black people did not want to be your slaves? Tell me how you qualify for that position.

                             Jews, living in Newport. Among these we find, for instance, the Jew Isaac Elizar. He wrote a letter to Captain Christopher Champlin on February 6,1763, saying he would like to be an agent for a load of slaves. Then follows the Jew Abraham Pereira Mendez, and one of the main slave dealers, Jacob Rod Rivera-the father-in-law of Aaron Lopez. And then there is Aaron Lopez, himself, and many, many more other Jews. Although we have

                             considered Aaron Lopez several times, the size of this documented treatise limits us, and we cannot describe all of the writers concerned in the Slavery Dealing correspondence, their names and the special dates—rather, we wish to study the documentation of the ‘Carnegie Institute’ itself—keeping Aaron Lopez in mind. We wish to see what in the main this Jew was pursuing and what his business was. This is due to the fact that Rabbi Morris A. Gutstein presents him as a “lofty and fine civilian of Newport” who was so generous and even “made contributions to welfare.”

                        Jewish slave traders owned the slave ship fleets and most of the slaves. Considering that only about 2 or 3% of the population is Ashkenazi and only about 2 or 3% of the population were slave owners that about adds up right? Anybody can look up the ownership of the slave ships on Google in two minutes and find out the Jews owned the slave trade. Much to your horror...Its those heterosexual Jewish men! You are not used to dealing with people that know this stuff. There are entire books written on the subject.

                       Women will abuse children, especially when they are under the influence of a heterosexual male.
But both women and children are abused in just about every way by males in our society.
HOWEVER, statistics show that MALES are our sexual abusers of children.

                       Meanwhile, increasing poverty in the US and rising unemployment among "whites" and AA's
in the US -- destruction of the Middle Class -- exists because of the corruption of our government
and the greed of Elites/corporations.

                      <p>
                       That's why we are losing the Middle Class, for one -- for another Elites no longer needed
a Middle Class as propaganda against Russian communism since the Wall fell.
Elites have stopped funding a Middle Class here.

                         They are not referred to as "slaves" because the conditions were markedly different.  Bondage isn't the total slavery endured by Africans enslaved here.
And "Indentured Servitude" and "Servant" make that quite clear.

                          Since white people contracted upon to death as indentured servants, living in the same conditions as black slaves, and owned by their jewish masters are not slave according to you because they are "white", take your Talmud with you and don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. Racist.

                           Indentured servants did NOT live in the same conditions as African slaves.
The "Confessions" by the USHR and Senate make that clear in their apologies.

                            Keep denying it. I want to talk about how the Jews started, owned, and profited from the black slave trade they founded in Newport. Lets talk about that ok.

                            Typical zionist refusing to admit that the jews started, owned, and controlled the slave trade. That is what you are. "Don't prove to other people  that us zionist are the slave owners. We keep that secret. How dare you!"

                              Admit it. It is documented in more places than the world can count. Jews own the slave trade. Its plastered all over this thread. Your a liar. You just proved it. I can use some of my Jewish sources if you don't like these because you know I got those too.

                                 In Virginia, or in any of the other Southern port cities, the slaves were transferred to the land and immediately sold. A regular auction would take place, following the method of purchase in Africa. The highest bidder obtained the “Ware.” In many cases—due to the indescribable filth—some of the Blacks became ill during the sea voyage from Africa to America. They became unemployable. In such cases the captain accepted any price. It was rare to dispose of them for no one wanted to purchase a sick Negro.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 Therefore, it is not surprising that the Jewish, unethical doctor senses a new form of revenue. They purchased the sick Negro for a small sum, then treated him, and sold him for a large sum. On occasion, the captain would be left with a few Negroes for whom he did not find a buyer. In that case he returned to Newport and sold them to the Jews for cheap domestic help. In other cases, the Jew owner of the ships took them over. This is why the city of Newport and its surroundings had 4,697 black slaves in the year 1756.

                          Their jewish masters had fancy legal names for their white slaves so in your opinion being bound into a malicious contract unto death is not slavery huh?

                               During this time there were a number of plantation owners established in the West Indies and two Jews, Eyrger and SayUer, with strong Rothschild connections in Spain, formed an agency called ASIENTO, which later operated in Holland and England. It was through these connections that Jews in Holland and England exerted influence and both of these connections cooperated in helping the Jews provide Black Slaves for the Colonists.

                               With the yearly capture and transport of one million Black slaves it is not difficult to figure that from 1661 to 1774 (one hundred thirteen years) approximately one hundred ten million slaves had been removed from their native land. About ten percent, or ELEVEN MILLION, Black slaves reached the Colonies alive.

There were many other ships but we will concentrate here on only a few, such as the “La Fortuna,” “Hannah,” “Sally” or the “Venue” which

                               a group of Jews settled in Charleston, South Carolina, where they set up distilleries for making rum and whiskey. They, too, learned that they could trade with the natives on the West Coast of Africa for ivory, and several ships were purchased and sent to Africa, trading the usual glass beads and other cheap ornaments for ivory, which, however, took up but little space on board ship. It occurred to these Jew traders that they could supply the plantations in the South with ‘Black ivory’, needed under swampy and malarial conditions which European labor could not tolerate without sickness, and which would not only fill the holds of their ships, but bring enormous profits. (This same group had earlier tried selling Indians as slaves but they found them completely unsatisfactory, as the Indians would not tolerate this type of work.) Thus, another segment of the slave trading had become active and profitable out of Charleston, South Carolina. Several shiploads of Black slaves were sent by the Dutch West Indies Company to Manhattan.

                          You failed to take the burden off the WHITE man for black slavery. The white man didn't do that. The Jewish merchants in Newport did that and they also owned the liquor and gunpowder businesses. Why don't you ever talk about that?

                        And an even sicker joke is that tons of the people that came to America were kidnapped in brothels that had drop away floors where they fell into a pit were and brought to America in slave ships, or were told they were being given a job on a ship, and then put to work in America as slaves. They were white people too. I wonder how much you have to say about all this slavery now.

                          Not true. Its greedy PEOPLE. Not men, because its only about 2 or 3% of the population, hiding as many flags, that promote this. Your approach is division and a distraction. Why put the onus on the entire male population for the actions of a small fraction that drive it into reality?

                  mkultra is related to nazis, and so are the catholics, but because they're into trans humanism through pain. druids (british jews) were the first to recognize pain as a mechanism for inducing new states of mind. today, the more civilized among us, and those who have been to india, know that fasting and exercise are the sane person's version of self-torture to produce new states of mind. pain works, but breaks most.

                  freud; shit... where to start with the inversion (remember that reality isn't duality, it's an inversion. the ying yang is not a flip or reverse, it's an inversion...); so frued's words and skills were well known, but his methods were not passed on in the way that -students- where taught how to prescribe his methods. Freud used his environment, and he new lighting, mood, tonality, temperature, and -ambiance- where the true masters of his skills. he simply orchestrated materials in a way that helped him cast his spells. Midnight mass is held at midnight for many reasons; but the most important—least know reason is; at midnight, after working on the farm or in the fields—everyone is exhausted, and the power of suggestion is easiest at night, when you're fatigued. if you're a parent, consider how often your kids try to tire you patience once they learn it as a skill.

                  splitting personalities; everyone does it. it's a result of your life, no matter how you are raised. "we are pieces of the people we love and hate" which is why the notion of "broken to be whole" is used for rebuilding personalities on a philosophical level. mkultra is a bastardized version of the jews and catholics taking ritual/performance magic to the next level by conditioning us to openly exploit and expel all facets of our being onto video (with the help of masons, obviously as the prop builders of the world). it's a ritual with each movie... for each person. so I suspect you need to shut down too, if you're going to live on the level.

                <h1>
                 1 -- No ... Vatican invented brainwashing, especially of children:: "Get them while they're young."
                </h1>
                <pre><code>     It's always been a dictatorship which requires total obedience from members young and old.
     90% of Germans were "Christians."  And "obedience" was the problem there ... until it was 
     too late and any challenge to Hitler meant death.
</code></pre>
                <h1>
                 2 --
                </h1>
                <pre><code> MKULTRA is a continuation of the Nazi experiments.  Experiments they actually carried out in 
 concentration camps, as well.  Fasting and exercise aren't exactly TORTURE as carried out by Nazis...
 Or by Vatican in "The Inquisition" or "The Hammer of Witches" where women they labelled "witches"
 were actually burned at the stake.  And again, a state of mind isn't a split personality which is quite
 different.  These new personalities -- Paul Bonacci was tortured resulting in 199 new personalities -- 
 aren't something beneficial to the host.  And, again, these new personalities can be programmed 
 to speak other languages, programmed with photographic memories -- and generally to carry out 
 assignments they normally wouldn't do -- such as homosexual prostitution, drug running, spying
 for blackmail.
</code></pre>
                <h1>
                 3 --
                </h1>
                <pre><code> Freud originally used HYPNOSIS -- they stopped when some of those he was training were unable to hypnotize clients.
   People are often also exhausted at 9am mass on Sundays -- but now they go to church at 5pm on Saturdays.  :)
</code></pre>
                <h1>
                 4 -- If you think disassociation/split personality is the same as everyday moods or upsets, you're quite wrong and you
                </h1>
                <pre><code>    should read something about it.    
</code></pre>
                <p>
                 The Vatican's files hold many secrets -- presumably shared with Elites/Hitler/Nazis/Gestapo/CIA.
Every once in a while they seem to need to practice torture all over again -- as we've seen at Abu Ghraib.
They don't want the knowledge or art to die -- you can't run a dictatorship without it.

                   <p>
                    Sigmund Freud studied with Charcot, in France, in 1885 and was impressed by the therapeutic potential of hypnosis for neurotic disorders. On his return to Vienna he used hypnosis to help neurotics recall disturbing events that they had apparently forgotten. As he began to develop his system of psychoanalysis, theoretical considerations,** as well as the difficulty he encountered in hypnotizing some patients, led Freud to discard hypnosis in favour of free association**.&gt;

                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Although Freud has been criticized for being an inexperienced hypnotist (Schneck,
1954), his own publications provide evidence of extensive clinical experience with
the technique of hypnosis. He probably retained it in his reservoir of clinical tools for
about a decade, from 1886 to 1896 (Strachey, 1966).
                    <strong>
                     The therapeutic use of hypnotic
suggestion, he reports, was his “principal instrument of work” during his first years as
a physician
                    </strong>
                    (Freud, 1925/1959, p.17). He then adopted Breuer’s cathartic method and
“eventually, especially after my visit to Bernheim in 1889 had taught me the limitations
of hypnotic suggestion, worked at nothing else” (Freud, 1925/1959, p.22).

all patients nor put them into as deep a trance as he would have liked

                    Link Between Trauma and Dissociation
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    People who have experienced sexual abuse and/or physical or emotional abuse and/or neglect in childhood may be particularly at risk for developing a dissociative disorder. In fact, 90 percent of all people with dissociative identity disorder report at least one type of childhood abuse and/or neglect—dissociative identity disorder being the most common type of dissociation in which a person develops two or more distinct personalities.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    To further support this link between trauma and dissociation, authors of a 2014 article in Clinical Psychopharmacology and Neuroscience state that people with dissociative disorders report the highest occurrence of childhood abuse and/or neglect among all psychiatric diseases.
This is a pretty astounding connection, suggesting that dissociation is the ultimate reaction to significant trauma.

                Thanks for the detailed comment. You're into about the church being an earlier source for hypnosis and trauma inducing techniques is fascinating. Going to look into that.

                Side note : Don't forget how prominent propaganda and smear campaigns are in recent decades. After all, Joseph Mengele evolved to become the Angel of Death! Take that, Freddy Krueger! You don't suppose Hitler has been the subject of concerted propaganda over the years as well, do you? I'm reading Meine Kampf again at present. Check it out if you haven't.

                 Yes, but the Vatican was pretty much inventor of propaganda -- 
I've read some of their vile propaganda against Jews during the time of the Jewish Ghettoes
and before they were closed down by French and then Italians ... and it's absolutely sickening.
Even after the Ghettoes were closed down, the RCC continued on for another 100 years with
vile propaganda against the Jews.  They were very effective at creating intolerance and hatred...
and ultimately violence against Jews, Women, Homosexuals, Gypsies, Native People ... on and on.
So successful that "The Hammer of Witches" actually resulted in women they labelled "Witches"
being burned at the stake.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What I think is that Hitler was suitable as a "Manchurian Candidate" of the time -- a leader Elites
here and internationally could be used as a puppet, dictator to introduce fascism to the world.
Seriously unbalanced individuals seem to be the most useful to them -- 
which is one of the reasons why I think many aware of that fact look at Trump with rising fear.

              One way to look at what Hefner did -- or was available over a long period of time
to do -- for the CIA would have been to convince men that women are simply
sexual objects.  Did Hefner help do that?
             </p>
             <p>
              This would have been part of the CIA's response to getting women out of
the workplace after WWII and the anticipation that women would continue
to rise in our societies and continue their revolution to free all women from
oppression by patriarchy in all of our societies.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most often, as well, those women who sought lives of their own -- other 
than existing for home and childbearing -- were often featured in Hollywood
which became a very special TARGET for right wing in the McCarthy Era.
Undeniably, it was liberals in Hollywood who were targeted and removed.
Same throughout the American government where the goal was to purge
liberals from government.  This continued on with new impetus after the 
coup on JFK (where liberals were a threat in raising new investigations and
investigations of the CIA via Frank Church).
             </p>
             <p>
              Another attack which seems very definitely CIA inspired would be the CIA/NRA
targeting of liberals -- and moderates -- in both parties who stood against the
CIA/NRA model of an armed American public.  (Except for AA's of course ... 
except for the times that the FBI were trying to accuse AA's of starting a race war.)

                 1950s: Origins of the CIA's "Pedophile Academy"

               <blockquote>
                <p>
                 “Oh we do have our stable of weird people working for us. Did I ever tell you about the Pedophile Academy? We actually had one down at Camp Peary, (in Virginia) right near (the CIA’s) Jim Critchfield’s place. I don’t know if you’re aware of it, but we called it ‘The Farm,’ and it was supposed to be a secret training center for young agents. Allen Dulles set up this training center down there for pedophiles. They were in training to seduce, molest, and most especially photograph the young children of targets. Not only, Allen reasoned, would our graduates have a spanking good time but they could get wonderful action photos of the wee ones to blackmail their families with. I understand they broke it up when one of the graduates nailed a (CIA) Deputy Director’s son at a summer camp.”

               Yeah, see, many years ago in college, I had an old crusty professor who knew about these crazy mind control experiments because that's when he first got his PhD in psychology. One day he spent over an hour telling us about these studies where violence and sex were shown to be linked (you don't say "proved" in social science). Both men and women who were shown films with scantily clad women AND violence were much more likely to answer a questionnaire afterward with answers suggesting that "some" women "might not mind" being raped. Men and women seeing films with violence alone, scantily clad women alone, or even hard core pornography, answered the questionnaire how one might expect- that no one, or practically no one, would "want" to be raped, even "a little bit".
              </p>
              <p>
               If you remove yourself from all the movies and TV shows you've ever seen, it is puzzling why some things are linked in our mass media.

                Interesting ... but I can't agree that sex and violence are in any way naturally linked.
Quite the opposite as we see the right wing reaction to music in the 50's and 60's and 
onward which showed tenderness in men's hearts for women.  Adoration of women, in fact.
That didn't suit their purposes of defaming and debasing females.
(I'd suggest that the CIA has interfered greatly in the music industry, not only by manipulating
music and what is featured, but by getting rid of musicians who were in their way -- John Lennon,
of course -- John Denver and many others.
                <br/>
                Mae Brussel has a long list -- when I can I'll pass on a link to you.  (Note to remember!)
               </p>
               <p>
                HOWEVER.... It is clear that and studies show that ...
               </p>
               <p>
                "Pornography Consumption -- both violent and on-violent --
is associated with verbal and physical sexual aggression."
               </p>
               <p>
                We might also notice that connection in the violence of Superbowl Sunday
Football Games combined with Half-time Shows which feature scantily clad
females performing musical numbers ---
               </p>
               <p>
                and the connections made to Superbowl Day Domestic Violence by males.
               </p>
               <p>
                Thanks for the interesting response -- obviously some outsiders did have knowledge of
programs like MKULTRA .....
               </p>
               <p>
                And obviously, Allen Dulles had a keen interest in Hollywood -- and is said to have
worked closely with Walt Disney!  (See:  The Devil's Disciple by David Talbot)

                 Yeah that's what I was saying. The study was showing that those types of movies created unfortunate ideas in people's minds that weren't there already.

             The US gov is the world's largest corporation and investor. It is also the wealthiest and most tangible asset rich entity in the world. CBS was founded as a branch of the US gov. So were Time and LIFE magazines.

             When I was researching the media, I perused hundreds of radio industry rags published from the '20s -' 50s time frame. EVERY issue from around 1930 onward had at least one article on the development of TV. Clearly the radio industry was threatened by the possibilities of a visual version of their business. You could say they were speaking the unfiltered truth as they huddled in concern.
            </p>

             At the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin, Germany displayed their brand new television technology to the world, although actual TVs to receive their broadcast were only available in Germany. I remember reading a fascinating article published in 1947 in which the author expressed amazement at all of the wonders and hi tech the US had appropriated from Germany (spoils of War) ; egg sterilization techniques, farming and livestock techniques, computer circuitry, metals production, optics, etc and so on.

             Ever ask yourself why they have the Academy Awards each year and why it's akin to a royal spectacle? Because the film and TV industries are America's most precious resource. What, you didn't like the movie ET? Sure, child labor laws had to be rewritten but it was our sacred duty.
            </p>
            <p>
             Over the years the gov slowly cut the free press out of their fair share of the media spectrum, the free press being ME and YOU and our fair share being 100%!

                Check it out tho, if Hillary is the opposite of how they portray her (at tremendous expense) then Twitter banning "neo-Nazis" at tremendous risk to their brand is evidence that Hitler was the opposite of historys greatest monster; he was actually the greatest Western leader of all time in almost every way.

                 watched a show on the History Channel about Hitler not dying in a German bunker, but headed to Argentina

                 some say this is a Russian conspiracy

                <p>
                 It was very interesting the things they found

                <p>
                 also want to add That since I was little, it was taught that Russia was the enemy, always Russia
                </p>
                <p>
                 I so very tired of that one, I'm not saying they don't do things, but the narrative that they are at the bottom of everything is a little too convenient

                  They ARE at the bottom of everything, fool.  That's what happens when the most racist people own everything in gentile countries.

                  Bolshevism was a Jewish movement top to bottom and every synagogue on Earth sent aid to their coup slaughtering the Russian royal family.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Pro-Soviet propaganda was blatant as evidenced by Hollywood movie lines like "share and share alike that's democracy" UNTIL Stalin began purging Jews, recognizing them for the "rootless cosmopolitans" that they were, never to be trusted.

                 <p>
                  Then he died in 1953 and Krushchev didn't trust Jews either, so the same year Jewish media owners in America volunteer for new CIAs Project Mockingbird, then suddenly Jews/Israel are America's indispensable ally against int'l communism and their Arab client states! ONLY JEWS COULD CREATE A WORD LIKE CHUTZPAH!

             Why was this downvoted?  This is a great post and very important news!  Thank you for posting it.  Sounds like some idiot is claiming you are trying to steal

              No I was the one that posted that lol. I figured people would accuse me of that so I just wanted to let everyone know that AlphaBravo asked for help and I'm happy to help. I didn't want anyone thinking I'm stepping on toes. 🙂

                I knew Hugh Hefner. He is connected to the CIA. Hefner is a CIA progammer CIA sex slave handler and pimp. Hefner was also a part of running MK ULTRA super assassins and ops. He is Free Masonic Intel.m

               How simple things begin to become to untangle when we can see what's 
been going on from the highest perspectives.
              </p>
              <p>
               Also interesting that while the CIA gifted us with Hefner, they also gifted
us with Gloria Steinem who just coincidentally made her opening to fame
with an article on Playboy Bunnies which she wrote after working for a
time as a Playboy Bunny.

                 Quite sure it came from the links in the thread ....
just ran over some of them again and couldn't find it --
but it's either from the thread links or something that someone else posted
on the thread which also gave a link.
I'll take a few minutes to take another look ...
