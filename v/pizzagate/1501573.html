<p>This post is a copy pasta from freerepublic where it was offered a mixed reception in the comments and some fundamental holes are poked in the overall theory, this post makes a statement in the post title . &quot;Tick...Tock...Caught! John Podesta\'s &quot;Molesta Van&quot; found at center of child trafficking cover-up in Arizona.&quot; - Which has been proven incorrect and corrected by the OP thankfully in the body. </p>
<p>Is this why Hillary Clinton was called a &quot;lying killer&quot; by Arizona Governor Brewer? - This is the 2nd half of the title which is totally unsubstantiated and unaddressed. </p>
<p>The post body then discusses two stories, one regarding the vans used by Royal Traveler / Andrew J K and a photo sent to Podesta, most if not all of which was covered off on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1487301">https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1487301</a> and contributes nothing further to the story. </p>
<p>And a 2nd story about what appears to be a child trafficking bust in Arizona, which was not documented as such. </p>
<p>While both stories have merit unto themselves, I do not understand the HUGE number of upvoats over 600 at time of writing, making it one of the most popular posts ever put up here. The comments section is also a mess of wild accusations and no further research or substantiating claims. Given that the OP simply copied this story from elsewhere its doubtful that they can add more info to the  original story or train of thought in reaching the conclusions. </p>
<p>I am greatly concerned at the apparently success of this weak and potentially inflammatory post about Podesta\'s \'molesta van\' , this is the kind of thing that could easily be used against us. Titan will be running a gofundme soon as they wont be able to get anyone into their vans with a link to that voat post. I have reached out to the mods to at least add flair to this title or help the OP change the title but have not received any response  in about 16 hours. </p>

            I agree in general. I am VERY frustrated by the 80% nonsense that is being posted and discussed on this sub. I spend most of my time look through new submissions since the rest of it gets mass-targeted and upvoated, leaving a lot of good stuff to fall out. It's organic when there are more and more "public" people coming here, and it's a convenient outcome of that, too. Or, it's being engineered.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a side note - I have noticed that the new subscribers has hovered around 9300 for the past 24+ hours, whereas for most of the previous few weeks it has steadily climbed. This weekend was a big holiday party weekend but figured today would be a busy day w/ the electoral college event, etc. Interesting.

            From an outsider, this sub is a mess. Some of you that actually care about accuracy and substantiated claims are probably going to have to make another subverse that doesn't allow speculation and flimsy theories to be stated as fact. The sensationalism and paranoia is off the charts as well, get a grip. The credibility of "pizzagate" is going to be non-existent if all this keeps up.

            I know it's all so exciting, but it's not a game. There's real lives being affected.

            I up votes it based on the van being in the video and the need to look further into why apparently no arrests were made and the kids were released to what may have been a perpetuation of the problem. I feel like since this appears to be a network of global proportions, then anything is possibly connected. There is certainly enough here to look into. If you have debunking details do provide them, otherwise all you're doing is really posting once again the information that you yourself claim is dubious, that actually seems counter production to your own belief. Idk. Still I see nothing wrong with looking into this even if it is just for knowledge. I agree we shouldn't make accusations without any proof.

             There was no link from the content to the post title after even slight scrutiny. As I have stated here and on my comments on both posts the story HAS merit. But podestas molesta van is just a shit post title as there was no link between the activity in arizona and titan transport.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope my post title indicates my argument is not with the information provided but on how it was portrayed in the title. My post also saught to raise awareness that people simply looking at the title would be left with the wrong idea.
            </p>
            <p>
             We are treading a fine line of credibility here staying on the right side of it is all we have.

            Look I will admit when I am wrong for singling you out. I have edit my comments pertaining to you (2) and have pinged you on both. I cant stand by a post about why people wont correct themselves when wrong and then be guilty of it myself. I felt you pushed a story without examining it first, and I still feel that way to an extent, but I all but called you a shill, and looking through some of your comments and the whole comment chains on that op I feel that I was in error to single you specifically out.

            Absolutely.

            Thing is, is that the FBI is the only government institution at the moment standing against pretty much the whole behemoth.

           <p>
            Their leaking to the public is the only power they have at this moment. Their only card.
           </p>
           <p>
            They leak it directly, they will be labelled Russian infiltrated and demolished.

            <p>
             We should use restraint until such a time as a story or lead matures, and shows evidence beyond a simple connection. Potential alone is not enough, and UPVOTES alone to not substitute for hard information.

            This supposed former cia worker has this to say about the vans used for transporting children. written in 2007.
            <a href="http://www.gailallen.com/theo/Secrets-of-the-CIA-Global-Sex-Slave-Industry-by-Dr-Sue-Arrigo.html">
             http://www.gailallen.com/theo/Secrets-of-the-CIA-Global-Sex-Slave-Industry-by-Dr-Sue-Arrigo.html
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            That means that their own vehicle license plate numbers are a weak point for them. If the buyers are front organizations for the bosses and the CIA, then those license plates may be “unregistered” — fakes that do not link up to a real name anywhere in the world. But the numbers still help one track the trade, just like the numbers on the rendition planes.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the van owners are free lance brothel owners — then those vehicle numbers may go to a person who the police might be willing to prosecute in the sex slave business. Like in the drug trade, the police will prosecute the free-lancers to make it look like they are doing their jobs.
           </p>
           <p>
            The free lancers are often fairly obvious — they are less rich and more varied in appearance both personally and in their vehicles. The rich often buy a vehicle, use it for a few months and then turn around and sell it for another purpose. The VIN numbers could be a problem for them even though the plates are false.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, almost all of the vehicles that the rich use to transport the sex slaves on land in the US are made at one plant in the US. That plant in in Atlanta, I believe. It is the only plant that make vans with holes in the bottom of an enamel type of floor.
           </p>
           <p>
            Cattle do not have to be hidden in transport, so this combination of having to be hidden and having to be hosed down and needing some ventilation but good sound-proofing is almost unique in the automotive industry.

            Its a repost from freerepublic, just google any of the paragraphs. I dont know if its just a leap of faith by the OP - they have now edited the post to advise the connection is basically non existant but no input from the mods to correct the title or any further attempts to delete any of the original sections in the post that assume the link.

            I think its a function of having grown from 3000 subscribers when i joined a couple of weeks ago to 9000 now.  So, if this was 2 weeks ago those upvoats would be the equivalent of 200 only

             I get where you are coming from but the active users has gone from 4.5k to 1-2k at any given time and there are no other posts with this level of upvoating. As another comment mentions I am just concerned this is a setup for something happening with Titan then being linked directly to that post, CPP shooter v2.0

            It's the shills. They've basically taken over the forum. They make it impossible to collaborate. We've been so focused on welcoming new members, and focused on our reputations, that we never thought about the logistics of communicating with each other.

              I don't think that the mods can keep up. There is literally too much to read through. The mods can't just take our words for it. They have to read the context, which requires pretty much reading everything.
             </p>
             <p>
              To put this into perspective, I read that entire post yesterday, and I was convinced that he was on the right track, but in hindsight, it's stupid idea. Even though we know that government is corrupt, there is some level of corruption that is not of interest to us. Maybe Hillary bribed the manufacturer or vice versa, and then they got a great deal of vehicles, and then maybe John Podesta used a separate vehicle for his own personal use. As far as the vehicle is concerned, maybe he hasn't done anything special with them. Maybe he just likes black. Maybe Hillary trusts only 1 person to be in charge of buying and managing the vehicles. Do you see where I'm going with this? Yes, society should be drawing attention to this, but it is meaningless as far as Satanism, pedophilia, and human trafficking are concerned.
             </p>
             <p>
              If we're going to think so foolishly, then we should point out that James A. and John Podesta both wear clothes made in China. Come on, guys! Let's start digging!
             </p>
             <p>
              This is why I think that he's a shill. The shills aren't trying to embarrass us any more. They are drowning out the signal.

               . In defense of the OP I can find one item that I do not believe is stock on the videos that is the front license plate holder, but im not sure if thats a customisation done at point of purchase as standard or a 3rd party modification.

            They're preparing the next straw-man to beat. The next "fake news" is: "Podesta has a black van, so he must be a child rapist". The upvoats are a CTR job.

            Probably a shill operation to discredit the investigation. That thread is totally stupid. It's kinda like: Podesta has a black van. Some pedo in another state ALSO has a black van. So obviously Podesta is a pedo.

               well, one bullet fired in Comet managed to find its way miraculously into Alefantis' computer - thus destroying potential evidence.
So Im happy to consider anything otherwise preposterous might happen to a podesta vehicle

             I agree, theres two stories in there of merit but together its a clusterfuck with what appears to be massive upvoat briggading. I have reached out to mods twice now, though I didnt realise that kindkongwaswrong has taken a step back so perhaps my first attempt was overlooked.

            I just played around with voting, and the upvote count is 613. When I down voted, it dropped to 18!
           </p>
           <p>
            I've  never downvoted a submission, before; so not sure if it's something I'm missing?

             Your one of the 18 people who downvoated the article, thats normal, you need to go into the post now and look on the right ( if on computer ) and you will see total up and downvoats.

            A majority of the subscribers are already convinced Pizzagate has a truth to it. So they will be upvoating en masse the threads that seem to confirm this idea. Most subscribers are not here to investigate further. They just want to see their views confirmed.
           </p>
           <p>
            This medium(voat) is highly imperfect for a community that tries to investigate something. The way the voats work, sensationalism goes before substance.

             Also consider that voat requires upvoats to downvoat...I think this comment is erroneously cynical. Some research is gleaned from here and taken to proper channels who will act on it.  Dont stop researching! Dont give Up! Dont let Discouraging people gain a foothold on solid ground of truth and revelation.

             I agree this does appear to be the case, but was not always so. At least not to this extent. Given there are a few people specifically
             <s>
              'WakeUpAndCare'
             </s>
             pushing this story VERY hard I am concerned that there is something untoward happening here.

             I was in error in singling you out here and should not have done so. Many jumped on the bandwagon pushing this story. My frustration let me down here. The remainder of my sentiments remain the same this is worrying.

              Yes, it is very easy for disinformation agents to thrive in such an environment as the one on Voat here and influence the community dynamics.
             </p>
             <p>
              The only guard against this are the mods. But who are the mods, and are they still the guys we think they are?
