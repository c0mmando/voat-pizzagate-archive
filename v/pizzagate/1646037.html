<p>The Apes\' strange webpage and biographical history indicate that they are either a part of or are advertising a Crowley-inspired cult known for creating &quot;Visionaries&quot; through trauma and abuse. </p>
<p><strong>Body</strong></p>
<p>I may be repeating a couple of points from previous threads but The Apes still warrant A TON of looking into. </p>
<p>The Apes are an interesting part of the Comet Ping Pong investigation because they can easily hide any insinuation of pedophilia behind the plausible deniability of being hipster/punk. But it\'s worth noting that their whole narrative doesn\'t exist in a vacuum. Rather, they seem to be following the tenets of a loose, Crowley-inspired cult called <strong>The Visionaries</strong>, who are inspired by Thelemic ideas (such as the &quot;Do as thou wilt&quot;) and Jungian Psychiatry (using trauma and horror to &quot;release oneself&quot;, to steal the &quot;numen&quot; of others).</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, satanic abuse victim Kim Noble was likely a victim of these practices, as the goal was not simply to abuse her, but to literally split her personality and showcase the potential of creativity-through-sexual-abuse. Remember that a Comet PP poster references <a href="https://i.redditmedia.com/JpIBHE8e64f6wfNq7kBLjODySLt7Ra7GNAA-3rD4Z6M.jpg?w=1024&amp;s=1f195523741169ba7d94532e8f59e620">Kim Noble\'s abuse in this poster conveniently featuring two bands with the word \'teen\' in them</a>. </p>
<p>Now to the Apes. If you remember the Baba\'s Mountain portion of their website, they reference a \'visionary\' called Jackie Magik, the name a likely reference to Crowley. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.theapes.com/babas1.html">http://www.theapes.com/babas1.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theapes.com/misc/prologue.html">http://www.theapes.com/misc/prologue.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jackie Magik, the maniacally focused visionary, guides the vessel with his heavily-effected voice modulations. His body shakes violently as gale forces and riverspray sweep through the mainmast, into his bass held against it, and are transmitted out again as flashing torrents of lightsound and booming triggers, signals for Ronald Wolf\'s rhythm track and Majestic Ape\'s piano incantations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The visionary movement is inspired by occultists like Crowley and psychiatrists like CG Jung and Otto Gross, and believe that mental health mainly illusory and that most mental issues derive from repressing one\'s savage tendencies. That\'s why they are called &quot;The Apes&quot;--they deliberately release their madness, their transgressions and their urges for sinning as a way to heal themselves. Otto Gross is a lesser-known psychiatrist who was famous for hosting orgies and coining the term \'sexual revolution\' in the late 1910s. </p>
<p>The Babas\' Mountain page on their site talks about something called Captain 20\'s Children. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have seen the graffiti on the walls. Captain 20\'s Children. Mount of the Child Generals. APES. Imp Ahh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, of course, leads to Alefantis\' Transformer Gallery, and <a href="http://www.transformerdc.org/exhibitions/images/captain-20s-children-c20c">this image</a>, which is creepy in itself but <strong>implies that the gallery name is deliberate and relates to whatever the Apes and Alefantis do in secret</strong>. And this pattern of &quot;transformative&quot; galleries is GLOBAL -- be it Creative Growth in Oakland, Intuit in Chicago and the American Visionary Arts Museum in Baltimore. So, I ask, what are these galleries really showcasing?</p>
<p><strong>Back to the Apes</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Baba\'s Mountain&quot; has been one of creepier and elusive parts of the investigation simply because no one really knows what it is. What we do know is that the Visionary Cult (as outlined in <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Spiritual-Gift-Madness-Psychiatry-Movement/dp/159477448X">this book</a>) sees <strong>Baba Ram Dass aka Richard Alpert</strong> as a pseudo-messianic figure. As one of the pioneers of LSD research, it\'s not surprising that he became spiritual, but what may be more important is that he started several Ashrams and retreats in New Mexico and Maui.

            Your post is a great example of confirmation bias and pattern recognition though, it highlights exactly why most of this Pizzagate "evidence" is so stupid. You can see whatever you want, wherever you want, if you look hard enough.

            I have searched high and low for a definitive correlation of crowley &amp; pedophilia.
Ive looked for quotes out of all of his books, looked for possible arrests or investigations in England or sicily to no avail.
Is there quantifiable documentation demonstrating the correlation between Crowley &amp; Pediphilia in a direct , rather than indirext manner?

             The sites called Temple of Thelma. A woman post a quote from Crowley 's diary and wants to know if Crowley was into pedophilia.  She says:
            </p>
            <p>
             "The quote is purported to be taken from "The Magical Record of The Beast 666: The Diaries of Aleister Crowley", edited by John Symonds and Kenneth Grant, Pg 239.
            </p>
            <p>
             The quote: August 12th 1920 - "Her breasts itch with lust of Incest. She hath given Her two-year bastard boy to Her lewd lover's whim of sodomy, hath taught him speech and act, things infinitely abhorred, with Her own beastly carcass. She hath tongued Her five-month girl, and asked its father to deflower it."
            </p>
            <p>
             Most of the bashing sites insert the name "Rose Kelly" in brackets. Of course, this quote (if accurate) would most likely refer to Leah Hirsig, since she was his Scarlet Woman at the time and had a son by a previous lover and had given birth to 'Poupee' earlier that year (1920)."

            Don't know if this has been brought up but chimps (great apes) are known to engage in infantcide if a male suspects the child is not theirs.  Could be a possible connection or maybe I am grasping at straws.

              Westworld! That show was so creepy because it seemed to mirror what was going on in the world, with people waking up to realise that the world isn't what they thought it was, that they aren't truly free, and that the people in charge are just sadistic fucks who enjoy raping and pillaging and murdering. There were so many parallels it made me wonder what it was trying to achieve. But perhaps it's just one of those things where certain themes and ideas arise in the events of mankind, and eventually find their way into the record through creative expression, rather than something deliberate.

             Thanks! I encourage you to look for tells within your community, including art galleries and punk-pizza-restaurants with the same aesthetic. They are advertising a cryptic but very present belief system that I believe is directly related to the pedo allegations.

            The link takes you to what is probably a web interface to the backend of their website via their hosting environment. Can anyone hack into this? Spread the word!

            This becomes even more pertinent after Hillary Clinton has come fully out of the closet in her defense of Comet PPP. We need to go full steam ahead on everything related to Comet now. Because now it all reflects directly on Clinton.
