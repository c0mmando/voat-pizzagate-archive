<p><strong>QUESTION TO VOATERS:</strong>
Should we start a campaign where we bombard the <strong>Department of Justice Criminal Department head Leslie R. Caldwell</strong> with demands to look into Weiner\'s laptop, John Podesta and Pizzagate, and the weird lack of investigation from FBI? Is there a better way to push the issue of starting a proper investigation with FBI and DOJ working together? Or is the fake news narrative so successful and the entire government (CIA, FBI, DOJ) so corrupt that it won\'t work? Please share your thoughts on this with me.

             Maybe the focus on Comet and Alefantis is the diversion, I agree with you that this is the most explosive and potentially devastating lead in the whole case,  and it hardly gets any mention on this forum.  If only the nypd would leak it.  If they see the ptb ignore the evidence, maybe they will have to.  Legally obtained evidence,  no bogus Russian hack, no wiki whistleblower.

              There is a high probability that Comet is the diversion being played out in the public because it's so bizarre to run a ring from a pizza place. Also the actor going in with a gun. FBIAnon said focus on the Clinton Foundation. I think that there is loads more than pizzagate on that laptop. Do you have ideas about how to put pressure on the laptop release?
