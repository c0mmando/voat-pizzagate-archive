            THIS WOMAN IS A FRAUD. The story is 100% FALSE fiction. I spent a lot of time reading the entire story and looking her up afterwards. "Dr." Sue Arrigo is her name so I googled both that and her email address which is located on the story. I found her online real life pics and some messages from her sister to conspiracy theorists' websites advising Sue Arrigo has delusional schizophrenia and was NEVER in the CIA, MK Ultra, abused, kidnapped or anything remotely similar. She should be banned from the internet. There were a number of red flags in that long story which I will not expose so she can potentially correct them. I believe she is here posting as "Against Pedos" and "logjam" below looking for credit on this story. I believe Ms. Arrigo watched a number of YouTube videos of Brice Taylor and others, as well as reading first hand accounts of children in MK Ultra stories and put them all together in her fabricated story. Brice Taylor is real, Sue Arrigo is not. In another conspiracy forum she posted about Obama abusing her and sitting in on CIA meetings as of last year!!! As far as being a "Presidential Model" she is an overweight late 50s early 60s woman who, again, has severe schizophrenia. **I wish people like this would STAY OFF THE INTERNET and not post delusional fabricated stories that are not true in such a serious investigation. **

             I hear where you're coming from. I'm skeptical myself. But look at what she says the
             <em>
              does
             </em>
             pertain to things that we are connecting the dots with. That has to account for something. What she says about other things - are beyond my scope of understanding - but doesn't make her wrong. The bits on children and transportation and setting up in war zones - that stuff clicks.

            The article reported here appears to put the story of "migrant smuggling"  by NGO's in a present-day war zone into a whole new perspective. See:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-04/something-strange-taking-place-mediterranean">
             http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-12-04/something-strange-taking-place-mediterranean
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            From what I understand from this investigation:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="https://gefira.org/en/2016/11/15/caught-in-the-act-ngos-deal-in-migrant-smuggling">
             https://gefira.org/en/2016/11/15/caught-in-the-act-ngos-deal-in-migrant-smuggling
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            one ship received a call from the Italian coast guard, well before the others, and 17 people have been reported missing, including a 3-year old child. It appears to be a possibility that these 17 people have been "selected" and found their way to the ship receiving the early call and thus officially do no longer even exist.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now wouldn't it be ideal to be able to recruit "non existing people" into the kind of CIA "training programs" reported about by Dr. Sue ArrigoJune 15, 2007, the article linked above by
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/user/logjam">
             @logjam
            </a>
            ??
           </p>
           <p>
            Another interesting connection between NGO's and war zone activity in Africa can be found here:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_blacknobil12.htm">
             http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_blacknobil12.htm
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            There's a very interesting further detail in the article:
           </p>
           <p>
            "If one wants goods shipped off the record it goes "by the way." That is code slang for "off the record."
           </p>
           <p>
            One throws it into the shipping conversation. Suppose I at the CIA want to ship a load of goods to Iraq for “reconstruction” purposes. I call up almost any shipper in the world and say for instance, 'I want to send 17 “boxes” of construction goods, and “by the way” two bodies to look after them. Make sure they arrive safely, you know.'"
           </p>
           <p>
            As far as I know, radio communication between coast cards and ships go over open, unencrypted channels, with documented frequencies. If this is correct, radio amateurs could listen in to these frequencies,  record the conversations and post them on the internet.  If "code words" are used and can be identified, these conversations could be analyzed and further evidence gathered.
           </p>
           <p>
            And that's also what the article says:
           </p>
           <p>
            "The conversation is like an insider’s language. You have to know it and not slip up on it to place the order to move them. But it is all done plain text, not in encrypted format.
           </p>
           <p>
            Much of it is done on cell phones and is not secure at all, anyone could listen in. As soon as I send this to you it may be changed. The point is that an investigator could listen to shipping conversations for awhile and quickly figure out the system."

            I don't know how good (or bad) present day cell phones in Libya are encrypted.

            As an example of the documented frequencies, the Dutch "marifoon" frequencies can be found here:
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://www.scannernet.nl/scanner/scannerfrequenties-marifoon">
             http://www.scannernet.nl/scanner/scannerfrequenties-marifoon
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            On this page, there is even a link one can click to listen in via internet to some channels!
           </p>
           <p>
            Perhaps such streams can also be found in Italy and elsewhere?

            Wow a lot to digest.  Alefantis went to Georgetown i think, seems like he is maybe MK multiple.  Maybe Comet was a front for a brothel, but is it notable that historic reviews (before this blew up) notes high numbers of unruly unaccompined children suddenly appearing.  We know from the disturbing artwork of Podesta, Comet posters etc that that circle see children as objects to abuse and cute babies as "serious business".  Time to focus on the logistic side (J&amp; T) etc good tip.that the auctions likely take place nr docks with offloading areas away from public eye, &amp; Chevroltte van for transporting.

            She also said Russia was doing similar things. US puppetmasters must be pissed the spotlight's on them! Maybe they're working overtime to catch Russia in the same predicament?!! Either way this whole thing is getting pushed closer and closer to a war with Russia

            I think this should be documented later. If someone could reply to this comment, it would allow me to use it in the future as I don't have the capacity to write myself notes on the current device.
