<p><strong>According to an Oct. 5, 2003 interview conducted by Judi Amber Chase, (widow of David
Chase) and Co-founder/President of The Earth Harmony Foundation and Chair of The
International Children\'s Right\'s Committee, many of these \'runaways\' are abducted into
child pedophile rings. Ms. Chase interviewed Sergeant Richard Valdemar, an L.A. County
sheriff who is a ritualistic crime and child trafficking networks specialist.</strong></p>
<p>Valdemar: &quot;... A lot of these kids that are missing are six, five, and three years old....&quot;
&quot;These kids are not running away! They are abducted and they are disappearing into a
system... and this system eats them up.&quot; They are used for sexual abuse... they are killed
and we don\'t hear about it...&quot;</p>
<p>Valdemar: &quot;If they are doing a lot of trafficking, and the children are not &quot;broken&quot; yet then
they are going to be caged, and they are going in cells, confined in rooms, and
basements. They {abducted children} belong to the \'group\' and the \'group\' transports the
children from one place to another, and they are abused by one group of people after
another. Sometimes for a great deal of money which is exchanged.&quot;</p>
<p>Chase: &quot;Are any of these children {procured} through adoption?&quot;
Valdemar: &quot;Oh yes, once they get into the system foster children adopted children... any
place where they can be procured from the regular system... And they have people that
are able to do that.&quot;</p>
<p>Chase: Have you heard of the term safe houses?</p>
<p>Valdemar: In a generic way, when you moving people, it keeps them from being
discovered. We had safe houses in American History when we had the Underground
Railroad when slaves were being moved from the south to the north. We had safe houses
where they were kept in secret \'til they could be freed. But this is opposite of this; it is a
perversion of that. Drug dealers have safe houses, kidnappers have safe houses, and
child abusers have safe houses. All these people use homes, even the nicest
neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Chase: So it looks like a regular home on the outside.
Valdemar: Probably looks better than your average home.
Valdemar: &quot;... What you hear on the news, that no one has been prosecuted for satanic
murder, that is not true!!! If you want to look back in history you can look at Boston
Strangler, Charlie Manson, Leonard Lake, you can look at the St. John case in San
Francisco where there is human sacrifice. It is all documented and Janet Reno
prosecuted the people in Dade County. it\'s all a lie that it hasn\'t been done. They don\'t
prosecute a person for being involved in a cult crime. They prosecute them for a murder,
kidnapping, rape&quot;</p>

<p><strong>BRITISH SATANISM</strong>
“Just as in Australia, there are tunnels and caverns beneath Chequers and I\'m aware that
Heath used these. Balmoral Castle also sits atop a vast expanse of underground
workings. There are secret tunnels beneath London that lead into the Earth. If you know
where to look, a few of London\'s subterranean ghost railway stations and the odd pub
cellar are good places to start. Some of these may be natural whilst others have been
constructed. Prior to London becoming a Roman city there were mines in the area, mines
that were later discovered and used. Indeed, it would be true to state that thousands of
people could live in the tunnels and caverns beneath the City as there are abundant water
sources. The crowning, in-your-face audacity of the British Establishment was to name
the bunker beneath the Ministry of Defence \'Pindar\' - after the Greek poet, of course!</p>
<p>Both Wilson and Heath used to sacrifice children and the British royal family still does.
Ted Heath took a real delight in it, or so I\'m told. Apparently he used to engage in ritual
outside of London on a Common associated with Francis Dashwood. Likewise, the British
royals have public and very private lives. Their obsession with hidden, esoteric traditions
stretching back millennia is nothing short of amazing.”</p>

<p><strong>Archaeological Investigations of the McMartin Preschool site , Manhattan
Beach, California by E. Gary Stickel, Ph.D.</strong></p>
<p>“During the month of May 1990 an archaeological project was conducted at the McMartin
Preschool site to determine, once and for all, whether or not there had ever been tunnels
under the building, as described by various children. Excavation was carried out
according to established scientific conventions with a careful research design defining
what might prove or disprove the existence of &quot;an underground feature that would
connect to the surface of the site and extend underground for some distance..(with)
dimensions large enough to accomodate adult human movement through it.&quot; (p 24)</p>
<p>The project unearthed not one but two tunnel complexes as well as previously
unrecognized structural features which defied logical explanation. Both tunnel complexes
conformed to locations and functional descriptions established by children\'s reports. One
had been described as providing undetected access to an adjacent building on the east.
The other provided outside access under the west wall of the building and contained
within it an enlarged, cavernous artifact corresponding to children\'s descriptions of a
&quot;secret room&quot;.</p>
<p>Both the contour signature of the walls and the nature of recovered artifacts indicated that
the tunnels had been dug by hand under the concrete slab floor after the construction of
the building. Whatever the purpose of this elaborate enterprise, even more effort must
have been devoted to filling the tunnels back in and trying to conceal any evidence of
their existence. Much of the fill dirt used for packing the tunnel spaces was mixed with
historic debris, as if to mimic the surrounding terrain.</p>
<p>Not only did the discovered features fulfill the research pre-qualification\'s as tunnels
designed for human traffic, there was also no alternative or natural explanation for the
presence of such features.”</p>
<p>“One of the supposedly bizarre aspects of the McMartin case was the children\'s insistence
that they were taken into underground tunnels. They explained that the tunnels led to an
underground &quot;secret room&quot; where abuse occurred, as well as providing a route for
subversive transport to off-site locations for sexual exploitation. These stories were
apparently considered fantastic by investigators, who made no attempt to search beneath
the building.</p>
<p>The first opportunity for private exploration came in April 1990 when the property was
sold. Several parents obtained permission from the new owner to search for the tunnels.
After cutting out a section of concrete and coming up with ambiguous findings, it became
apparent that experienced supervision was need. Gerald Hoobs a professional miner,
was engaged to insure safety and to better define the nature of the underground artifacts.”</p>

<p><strong>Dutroux Case</strong></p>
<p>“To think that Dutroux masterminded this blackmail operation all by his lone nut self would
be utterly absurd. To suggest that it was a modern manifestation of Gladio at work would
be quite logical. In any case, even Time Magazine, in one of the rare mentions they\'ve
had on this apparently unimportant scandal, described shadowy links from this operation
to mobsters, and mentioned the usage of &quot;underground tunnels.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whale.to/b/ramsey.html">http://www.whale.to/b/ramsey.html</a></p>
<p><strong>The Wheel of Fortune</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The British brothel madam Lindi St Claire, the original Miss Whiplash ran a similar service
supplying the most extraordinary beautiful women to those in government in the seventies
and eighties. Her underground torture chamber was reputedly rigged for secret sound and
film, although I hasten to add that I do not know for which intelligence service, if any.</p>
<p>She also would arrange a service called ‘normalising’. This occurred when suspected
homosexuals were dining quietly in a cosy romantic restaurant with someone of the
opposite sex when press photographers would suddenly burst in on them. The resulting
photos would then appear in the next day’s papers.&quot;</p>

            Chase: Have you heard of the term safe houses?
           </p>
           <p>
            Valdemar: In a generic way, when you moving people, it keeps them from being discovered. We had safe houses in American History when we had the Underground Railroad when slaves were being moved from the south to the north. We had safe houses where they were kept in secret 'til they could be freed. But this is opposite of this; it is a perversion of that. Drug dealers have safe houses, kidnappers have safe houses, and child abusers have safe houses. All these people use homes, even the nicest neighborhoods.
           </p>
           <p>
            And there you have it... Remember the recent case in LA of the Saudi sheik who had a girl jump the fence and escape and report to police that she had been kept as a sex slave? A multimillion dollar house he was renting out and having "parties" at. The U.S. did nothing bc he fell under the protection of Saudi. So he hopped a flight and fled. I'm sure driving through uber wealthy areas in DC no one would assume their maybe sex trafficking hostages being kept there. Reminds me of the Franklin case as well as Barney Frank and his "boyfriend".

            Like Sgt. Vlademere who was quoted in the Op's post I have felt that these children are often acquired through the foster care system or adoptive homes.
           </p>
           <p>
            They are not only trafficked to these rings for the elite but also to the second tiered members who often get caught and don't have the protections of the upper echelons of these perverted communities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Stories about porn and trafficking can easily be found by Googling or through many FB groups comprised of parents screaming from the rooftops that their children were removed without warrant and actually legally kidnapped by the state.  Many of these children are sexually abused, subjected to porn and even murdered .  Here are just a random few:

            Many old tunnels existed in Sydney Australia in olden and modern times.Some went direct to hotels where  drunks were taken and found themselves on a ship out at sea and had to work to get home....Criminals would shang-hai a individual and transport him to the waterways through tunnels....Usually the waterways have these secreted tunnels....Many were built to transport convicts from the ships to designated areas.The same applies for slaves.Convicts which is what australia and the americas was originally built on....A nice way to justify slavery.
              Australian convicts suffered intense painful treatment...Sub-zero tempatures ,bare footed dragging large logs through tasmania forests.locked in sandstone cells whilst they were not working.They did not enjoy temperate weather picking cotton.

            The problem with all of this Internet sleuthing is none of the people doing it knows what sections of that tunnel are still accessible, which portions are now being redeveloped, which portions are now actual BUSINESSES (heard of the Dupont Underground?), etc. In order to have REAL intel, someone needs to walk the tunnels. And I do not recommend it; at the VERY LEAST some of the tunnels are used by the homeless and thus can be dangerous WITHOUT pedophiles and human trafficking.
