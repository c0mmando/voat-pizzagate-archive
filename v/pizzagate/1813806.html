<p>There seems to be something odd about this <strong>dual Egyptian/American citizen</strong> who grew up just a few miles from the hub of <strong>Washington DC and Virginia, Falls Church.</strong></p>
<p><strong>President Trump</strong> and his aides worked for several weeks with <strong>Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi</strong> to secure the freedom of <strong>Aya Hijazi</strong>, 30, a U.S. citizen, <strong>as well as her husband, Mohamed Hassanein</strong>, who is Egyptian, and four other humanitarian workers. Trump dispatched a U.S. government aircraft to Cairo to bring Hijazi and her family to Washington.</p>
<p><strong>Hijazi</strong>, who grew up in <strong>Falls Church, Va</strong>., and graduated from <strong>George Mason University,</strong> was working in Cairo with the <strong>Belady Foundation</strong>, which she and her husband established as a <strong>haven and <em>rehabilitation center</em></strong> for street children in Cairo.</p>
<p>In <em>every</em> report I have reviewed on this event the <strong>MSM</strong> have tried very hard to <strong>keep her husbands face from getting much mainstream attention</strong> and instead, have focused on her, her beauty and demurity, considering that the charges were primarily laid on the him, this lends to a bit of curiosity over her Egyptian born husband.</p>
<p>I knew, as soon I saw their <strong>LOGO</strong>, I had to do a <strong><em>little bit more investigation</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The \'illuminati\' Triple Six &quot;OK&quot; Symbol</strong> <a href="http://thecairopost.youm7.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1393876_347927132017798_1258042193_n-620x310.gif">http://thecairopost.youm7.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1393876_347927132017798_1258042193_n-620x310.gif</a></p>
<p>The mainstream news <strong><em>would like to have you believe</em></strong> that there were nothing but baseless charges levied against these two and were egregiously charged and held illegally. I will agree that they were held indiscriminately for a very long time indeed violating international human rights treaties and passing the two-year legal term in the Egyptian penal code, this though was what the whitehouse made as their lead argument, getting them acquitted of the array of charges originally levied against them that might just have some element of the case that must remain shrouded in secrecy for national security reasons:</p>
<p>&quot;The dropping of charges set in motion the release of Hijazi and Hassanein from custody and their journey to the United States, which was personally overseen by Trump and detailed Thursday by the senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of <strong>anonymity because of the national security sensitivities of the case.</strong>&quot; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/...1127c4ef88">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/...1127c4ef88</a></p>
<p>As you can see, the Obama administration, along with <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> in the lead, <strong>spearheaded this effort from the beginning:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hillary Clinton Asks Egypt’s President Sisi to Release Aya Hijazi</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://egyptianstreets.com/2016/09/20/h...ya-hegazy/">https://egyptianstreets.com/2016/09/20/h...ya-hegazy/</a></p>
<p>Making it explicitly clear that this effort was in direct relation to Egypt\'s continued good relations with the United States:</p>
<p>“Secretary Clinton emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to <strong>Egypt’s future progress</strong>,” said Clinton’s campaign in a press release.</p>
<p>The sources for the real story have been scrubbed from Google or sent into oblivion in the search results. Clinton\'s ties to this couple are extensive and Hillary spent years trying to get her out of prison.

<p>It is quite telling when reading in between the lines of this <strong>Washington Post</strong> paragraph what the Trump administration was doing by gettin Hijazi released:</p>
<p>&quot;The senior Trump administration official said the agreement for Hijazi’s release was the product of Trump’s “discreet diplomacy” — meaning the president’s efforts to cultivate warm relations with strongmen such as Sissi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, in part by <strong>avoiding public pronouncements on human rights that might alienate the foreign governments.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/...1127c4ef88">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/...1127c4ef88</a></p>
<p>Meaning, The United States wanted to <strong>avoid any embarrassing leaks as to how they operate in destabilizing governments through their NGO\'s, humanitarian organizations and charities by implanting CIA agents that steal and abuse the children</strong> as well as....</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Getting paid to clash with the police at the presidential palace</strong>. Some of the children were forced to participate in <strong>Muslim Brotherhood</strong> demonstrations.&quot;
<a href="http://www.madamasr.com/en/2016/03/24/op...oundation/">http://www.madamasr.com/en/2016/03/24/op...oundation/</a></p>
<p>No recent news story tells any of the details of the arrest or mentions the transcripts, however, the charges are quite alarming:</p>
<p>&quot;Aya Hegazy, a dual Egyptian-American citizen, was arrested with three others on charges of <strong>pushing street children to participate in protests, as well as operating an NGO without a license as well as human trafficking, abduction, inciting homosexuality, and sexual abuse for pornography, among other accusations</strong>. The charges were denied by the forensic report on children inspected.&quot;</p>
<p>However, The White House seemed prepared and meant to downplay the entire incident:</p>
<p>“The United States can sometimes lead with things, and do it publicly, [in ways] that are offensive to people and likely not get the kind of result that we’d like, whereas <strong>working it quietly</strong> and making it a priority, but doing so in a way that is not a public embarrassment to the other party, that’s the way they worked this,” Corker said in an interview Thursday.&quot;</p>
<p>However, regardless of how prepared prosecutors in Egypt were on this case it seemed both heads of government had their minds <strong>made up even if Aya and her husband were guilty either way</strong>:</p>
<p><em>&quot;A senior administration official said that no quid pro quo had been offered for Hijazi’s release but that there had been <strong>“assurance from the highest levels [of Sissi’s government] that whatever the verdict was, Egypt would use presidential authority to send her home.</strong>” The official said the U.S. side interpreted that to mean that <strong>a guilty verdict and sentencing would be followed by a pardon from Sissi</strong>, <em>but they were pleasantly surprised</em>.&quot;</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/...1127c4ef88">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/...1127c4ef88</a></p>
<p><strong>However, let us review the operations of this NGO and boil down their practices for a better perspective:</strong></p>
<p><em>The prosecution charged the accused with 10 charges, including the crime of trafficking in human beings, the kidnapping of children, the detention of street children against their will, the physical torture of children, the trafficking, sale and rental of children for money, the assault of children, the sexual exploitation of children, the depiction of victims without their consent, Nationality and keeping them with computers and safes to threaten children, and to carry out the activities of civil associations without a permit and the work of the association.</em></p>
<p><em>The prosecution also faced a number of CD-ROMs with child abnormalities and forced them to have sex with each other, as well as their participation in the demonstrations and admitted that the accused and her husband had filmed him. The investigations revealed that Aya Hijazi, a 27-year-old US citizen, and the director-general of the association, and her husband Mohamed Hassanein, 26, are the sales supervisor of the Baladi Association\'s financial director, and Sharif, 34, , And 22-year-old Amira F., a housewife, volunteered to work with the association by attracting 20 children between the ages of 12 and 16 from the streets and holding them in an apartment located at 31 Mohamed Mahmoud Street in central Cairo with an association called Baladi. Sexually exploiting them to force them to commit obscenities.</em> </p>

<p><strong>With the facts presented here it is easy to piece together the modus operandi of the Clinton Foundation and how they infiltrate countries using a humanitarian guise, cull, brainwash, and inculcate poor street children using sexual abuse and trauma into committing not only sexual crimes but religious crimes which are used against them as blackmail to commit even more heinous crimes, beginning with throwing rocks at presidential palaces. With this template we can see how these terrorist organizations get their hooks into these children as early as they can. This is what the Trump administration and the Clinton\'s are so apt to want to hide.</strong></p>',

           <em>
            The prosecution charged the accused with 10 charges, including the crime of trafficking in human beings, the kidnapping of children, the detention of street children against their will, the physical torture of children, the trafficking, sale and rental of children for money, the assault of children, the sexual exploitation of children, the depiction of victims without their consent, Nationality and keeping them with computers and safes to threaten children, and to carry out the activities of civil associations without a permit and the work of the association.

           <em>
            The prosecution also faced a number of CD-ROMs with child abnormalities and forced them to have sex with each other, as well as their participation in the demonstrations and admitted that the accused and her husband had filmed him. The investigations revealed that Aya Hijazi, a 27-year-old US citizen, and the director-general of the association, and her husband Mohamed Hassanein, 26, are the sales supervisor of the Baladi Association's financial director, and Sharif, 34, , And 22-year-old Amira F., a housewife, volunteered to work with the association by attracting 20 children between the ages of 12 and 16 from the streets and holding them in an apartment located at 31 Mohamed Mahmoud Street in central Cairo with an association called Baladi. Sexually exploiting them to force them to commit obscenities.

           <strong>
            With the facts presented here it is easy to piece together the modus operandi of the Clinton Foundation and how they infiltrate countries using a humanitarian guise, cull, brainwash, and inculcate poor street children using sexual abuse and trauma into committing not only sexual crimes but religious crimes which are used against them as blackmail to commit even more heinous crimes, beginning with throwing rocks at presidential palaces. With this template we can see how these terrorist organizations get their hooks into these children as early as they can. This is what the Trump administration and the Clinton's are so apt to want to hide.

            Can't you see, the security services use sexual abuse and homosexual extortion on a religious level to get these terrorists to commit false flags, from the Bataclan,  Omar Mateen to the middle east, beginning with these charities, NGO's, orphanages and  'humanitarian efforts'.

            Great research, thanks for sharing. There was something really disturbing about this whole thing, plus pics on their facebook (all the kids in nearly all photos are doing that hand sign, plus the one of her husband with a young boy in a creepy embrace).

               This one ^^ seems harmless, playing Twister. However Twister is also used to groom kids.

               Totally agree, only perverts use this stupid game.

               Thank you for posting these, IMHO they all contain allusionary elements.

                Glad I could contribute. The whole thing smelled rotten to me, there was a time I would have thought gee whiz, why are these people being persecuted for helping street kids? But I know better now. Great research on this, btw.

               Some links are already scrubbed.  Strange pics.  Soon as I knew trump was behind this had to be more to the story
               <em>
                sigh
               </em>
               .  All that was necessary was typing in Clinton/if it was important to her that says it all.

               Thank you both for such excellent research.

            <strong>
             If you'll notice this approach is not to far from how James Alefantis arranged his organization:
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            <strong>
             Pinging Doktor Pong
            </strong>
           </p>
           <p>
            The Obama-Alefantis connection has deeper roots, as shown by the availability of a ham-and-pineapple pizza in East Berlin. Our passage to Hawaii starts below the Berlin Wall, or what’s left of it, into the Death Strip on the edge of uber-hip Green Party stronghold Prenzlauerberg. This section of the infamous wall was preserved as a stretch of open space to memorialize East Germans who attempted escape but were gunned by the GDR border guards.
           </p>
           <p>
            Post-Cold War, the Death Strip is a graffiti-sprayed playground for teens, with its Sunday afternoon Bearpit amateur karaoke show in the amphitheater and outdoor basketball courts (take note, Barry, and be sure to tuck a hankie in your back pocket). Adjoining the Turkish ghetto of Kreutzberg, the Death Strip is a gay-cruising zone for those hankering after Arab, Kurdish, Kosovar, Bosnian or Albanian hot meat on a stick, a spicy kofta kebab slathered with tahini sauce.
           </p>
           <p>
            In year 2000, James Alefantis and partner Oliver Miller discovered Prenzlauerberg, where Miller opened Dr. Pong, a ping pong bar. San Francisco architect Miller had arrived to Berlin earlier, in 1993,
            <strong>
             when he noticed that ping pong is the only low-cost sport for plebeian youths in every sad town from Muncheberg to Kosovska and Bucak, Turkey. Playing ping pong is an easy way to strike up a conversation with penniless and hungry young kids eager to please an older male who takes them under his wing.
            </strong>
            In the sexually segregated Muslim realm, sex between an older man and a young boy is taken casually as a misdemeanor that goes unnoticed as opposed to the felony of adultery by a woman, which is punished by the death penalty. The bored boys from nearby Kreuzberg are easy pickings drawn to the bait of ping pong and beer.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just up the street from the Mauerpark market,
            <strong>
             the ping pong tables at Dr. Pong provided the model for Comet Ping Pong Pizza in Washington D.C.
            </strong>
            The Berlin pedo-center is described in a reddit post: “Dr. Pong is a rugged little dingy bar in the heart of Prenzlauerberg, reminiscent of a teenage clubhouse with its minimal decor.” Note “teenage”. Its limited beverage menu is mostly non-alcoholic for entry-level rough-trade Muslim boys circling around the game tables for the next volley in the group game of “Around the World”, a dress rehearsal for a daisy chain.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the Doctor doesn’t do beer deliveries to embassy residences, there’s probably a lot of demand from diplomats for take-out meat sticks, judging from the great reviews on Trip Adviser’s English-language list of the top 10 bars in Berlin. The Top Ten list fails to include the plusher interior of the fetishist KitKat Club. Another telling indicator is that 666 bar-hopping tours stop at Dr. Pong, indicating a connection to the Satanic rites similar to those in DC. What’s intriguing about Dr. Pong is that its male-on-male games may have provided the concept for torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Graibh prison.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the last years of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) or East Germany, Prenzlauerberg was the favored residential district for gays, hippies and avant-garde artists, a tradition that continued after national reunification in October 1990. Prenzlauerberg is also the location of Rykestrasse Synagogue, the largest Jewish center in Berlin, which was restored at great expense after reunification while Berlin was being restored to its former glory as a Jewish capital with coprophilia clubs and fetish bars to degrade the goyem.
           </p>
           <p>
            Oliver Miller’s arrival in 1993 coincided with the massive expansion of human trafficking of children for the European pedophile sex trade out of the war-torn Balkans in the wake of the Clinton-Blair NATO interventions to break apart Yugoslavia. Berlin was a transit point for children transshipped between Belgrade and the UK by the Kosovar mafia and Western military contractors including DynCorp. London is the wholesale global market for child sex slaves through fraudulent NGOs that act as adoption agencies.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sadly for Alefantis and Miller, the pair arrived a few years too late to join SchwuP, the Movement for Gay, Pederast and Transsexual Rights, which until 1987 was a wing of the Green Party, itself a product of the sexual liberation and drug experimentation theories of the CIA-allied Frankfurt School. Even after being busted for possession of methamphetamines, SchwuP leader Volker Berg survives as a parliamentarian in the Bundestag as the crusty old chief of the German-Israeli Parliamentary Friendship Group. Go chew on that, vice cops and DEA agents.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 1986, Volker’s “Schwuppies” distributed this Green Party flyer to parliamentarians: “He is a boy, roughly 10 years old, with a pretty face, full lips, a straight nose and shoulder-length hair. The wings of an angel protrude from his narrow back, and a penis is drawn with thin lines on the front of his body.” In any country other than defeatist Germany beholden to the Israeli pedophiles, this sort of drivel is called illegal pornographic trash and justification for SWAT shoot-to-kill raids.
           </p>
           <p>
            The politically ambitious Greens eventually had to repudiate their support for sex with kindergarteners by their founders including Danny “the Red” Cohen-Bendit, the CIA-promoted leader of the 1968 student riots in Paris. The pedophile campaign was carried forward until 2008 by Volker Berg’s partner Jacques Teyssier, a former member of the French intelligence service, who was on board of the Lesben und Schwulenverband in Deutschland (LSVD), the lesbian and gay association in Germany. The German gay movement is obviously a brainwashed arm of the CIA.
           </p>
           <p>
            The darker side of the pedophilic underground has since been carried on by a provocative novelist with the pen name Klaus Wanninger, the Anonymous of the Karlsruhe-based Schwaben-sumpf (the Schwabian Swamp). Sadistic and Satanic imagery was developed in parallel by this deviant strain, which obviously has had a huge influence on the artists and customers at Comet Ping Pong Pizza.
           </p>
           <p>
            In early 2012, Alefantis and Miller teamed up to start a restaurant called Nalu or “wave” in Hawaiian. The partnership in the Berlin restaurant inspired Alefantis to sponsor a “sausage festival” at his Buck’s Fishing and Camping restaurant in Washington DC to honor a visit by Oliver Miller. There is no indication that Nalu or Dr. Pong has ever celebrated Octoberfest in Berlin by adding traditional bockwurst mit sauerkraut und senf (mustard) to their menus. - See more at:

              It was Ivanka and Jared who lobbied Trump for this, according to an article I read a few weeks ago (on the Human Rights Watch website I believe).
             </p>
             <p>
              It's been reported that Ivanka and Jared have been peer pressured by the Deep State social elitists in DC and NY to do these things. Ivanka and Jared seem to be Hillary's proxy in the White House, perhaps unwittingly.
