            My instinct is that we have to be careful about some of these stories.
           </p>
           <p>
            There is good reason to believe that McCann was a media hoax, and the perps love to build further hoaxes around their previous hoaxes. At the heart of this all, is their desire to distort our sense of reality and to degrade and degenerate us. Of course, that doesn't mean real crimes of this sort don't happen. But we have to be discerning. In the UK and the US especially, there are all sorts of fake planted media stories, right down to the local news level; it's not just limited to the big NATO false flags.

             I agree that we need to be cautious about false flags; however, I'm not sure about Madeleine McCann being one. What's your basis for that? I'm interested to hear your theory.

              Well, I'm open-minded. I'm not really claiming to be certain 100%. There's something fishy about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do you know of the discussion forum, cluesforum.info? It's a highly valuable resource looking at the history of media hoaxes. I've been studying the UK media for years and they run all sorts of rubbish, to the point where it starts to get difficult working out the fiction from reality. And I understand that's what the perps are working towards.
             </p>
             <p>
              To be absolutely honest, I'm not sure what the basis would be, other than to encourage paranoia about child predators. I mean the constant theme in mass media is that child predators are everywhere, your next-door neighbour could be one etc. "Trust nobody"-type propaganda. It's kind of normalisation, and scare-mongering, but the real perps are still protected and the police hierarchy are their friends. Basically, just an all-round attack on the social fabric and the general public's trust in each other, while the elite pedos carry on doing it. Very evil.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I could be wrong. It's very difficult to figure out 100%..

               I agree, it's so hard to tell the difference between fact and fiction. These people are propaganda pros. There was definitely something fishy about the McCann case; I personally think the parents were involved somehow or know more than they're saying.

             Right? The judge is a pedophile sympathizer at the very minimum. What also made me wonder though, too, was the seemingly random way he mentioned Madeleine McCann in some of his texts. Why bring her name into it? Odd all around.

              Yeah unless they are actually going to investigate it or it's a new lead. They kind of just randomly brought it up and didn't seem to look into at all, it's strange they just mention it but not really talk about it in depth at all.

            <p>
             A PERVERT who sent “vile” texts about Madeleine McCann and raping children to people he barely knew has been jailed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Depraved Adam Cooke targeted 10 victims who were little more than acquaintances during his campaign of fear that left them terrified.
            </p>
            <p>
             The 35-year-old also sent images of child abuse including a film of a youngster performing a sex act on an adult.
            </p>
            <p>
             He made sick references to Madeleine, describing how she had been abused by a paedophile ring.
            </p>
            <p>
             In other texts, he told victims he wanted to rape them and abuse their children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Prosecutor Nigel Booth told Stoke Crown Court he sent one victim 19 texts about him having sex with children.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr Booth said: “The texts referred to a paedophile ring and Madeleine McCann.
            </p>
            <p>
             “He said he had a video of the witness’s daughter and added, ‘I am stalking you now’.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Cooke also texted a man and said he had a child who could perform a sex act on him if he was interested.
            </p>
            <p>
             Cooke, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to two offences of distributing indecent images of children; 10 charges of sending indecent, offensive, or threatening electronic communications and failing to surrender to bail.
Barry White, mitigating, said Cooke had “difficulties” and was being helped by mental health services.
            </p>
            <p>
             He said: “He is horrified by what he has done. He cannot really explain why he sends the messages to the bizarre extremes that he does.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Cooke was jailed for three years and one month, made the subject of a five-year Sexual Harm Protection Order and was placed on the sex offenders’ register indefinitely.
            </p>
            <p>
             Judge David Fletcher said: “These were unsolicited texts to people with whom you had very little prior involvement.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Some had given their telephone numbers as an act of kindness in an attempt to assist you which makes what you did all the worse.
            </p>
            <p>
             “You sent messages which are vile. They are simply disgusting.
            </p>
            <p>
             “The sort of language you used is depraved. It is difficult to understand what you were thinking at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
             “It is not some inherent mental health problem, it is the effect upon your mental health of the cocktail of substances you were taking.”

             “It is not some inherent mental health problem, it is the effect upon your mental health of the cocktail of substances you were taking.”  So was there any testing done or evaluation that would categorize him as a pedophile?  If not, testing should be done immediately. He should then be forced to join the sex offender list.  UK should also declare that pedophiles cannot apply for traveling visas, just as Australia is doing.  All countries should pass this law now, not later. If there are an over abundance of these people in a certain country, and they still are allowed to travel, we must put them on our no fly list.

              See, that bothers me. I've never heard of someone being a pedophile ONLY while under the influence of something. Is it just me?
             </p>
             <p>
              And I agree, I think it's great what Australia is doing.

               Another pass the buck sentence.  So now they are faulting his combo of pills he is taking?  Well they had better find out what they are and take them off the market.  Yeah.  Sure.
