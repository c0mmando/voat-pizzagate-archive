             Freakin sick. I didn't loose my virginity until I turned 21 last year and I was nervous as hell. I cant imagine being a young teen and my mom paying for someone to "teach me" Completely looses the intimacy and excitement of sex.

              I think that was the point. She's a psychopath but a successful one and wanted the same for her daughter. Weaponization of sex is a core part of that. Very sick bastards.

            Have to wonder what kind of childhood Big Kathy had: her father was a lawyer in Omaha Nebraska in the 1930s &amp; 40's.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Among the tidbits shared with the author: Paris Hilton’s maternal grandmother, the oft-married Kathleen Richards (known in the family as big Kathy), once fed dog food to one of her mothers-in-law; drugged a rival and crushed her ankle in a car door; tried to push her second husband, Ken Richards, down a staircase; and, out of sheer malice, served his daughter Diane a cheeseburger with a screw in it."
           </p>
           <p>
            She was married 1980-82 to an alleged major Mafia figure, Jack Catain.

             Meanwhile, his brother, William Barron, had married Marilyn Hawley in 1947. Their son, Rick, had known Little Kathy since high school in California, and they both ran with a showbusiness crowd that included the sons of Lucille Ball and Dean Martin. So we got Lucy who posed nude with Obama's mother , and drunken Dean from the rat pack. Sammy Davis was an original member of Anton LeFey's little coven.
