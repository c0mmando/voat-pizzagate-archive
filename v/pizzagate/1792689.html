            This comment on video worth a reprint:
           </p>
           <blockquote>
            <p>
             This whole scenario is way deeper than any of us could ever imagine. This isn't just an underground sex pedophile ring but a underground child trafficking and sex pedophile ring. These disgusting people purchase children of all ages and pay for them to stay with families room and board until they are ready to enjoy their "pizza" however that may be. Some children are kept secret for years and others much more brief depending on the abuse. Comet pizza and other locations provide secrecy from the underground tunnels to do their rituals ans It also provides them with security knowing that everyone on the block plays their special role in the secrecy. Imagine you were running drugs in a city underground and all your neighbors were protecting you taking their large cuts of the profits to continue the secret. This is getting beyond sick and I'm afraid this whole story is getting exposed because these sickos are not remotely scared of being caught at this point. This is a sickening sub genre of people that have been kidnapping and killing our kids for decades and the cognitive dissonance we have has allowed these sickos to grow in number and power beyond belief! We cannot allow this to go unpunished no matter how long spreading this information takes. This is way way bigger than Comet! This is just one front location that has been exposed. Think of the millions of operations underground worldwide! Just makes me so angry that our own governments, FBI and CIA are protecting these sick fucks all to make a dollar and keep their jobs in powerful positions. Great video though man! Keep up the great work﻿

            Thank you! I've been thinking we need to get back to our roots - this is exactly how we should be using our down time now, going over what we missed form the early days, IMO.

             UV check in Buck's bathroom at 51:40.

            <p>
             Begins to check first CPP bathroom at 56:02 (note the weird red lighting in the room).
            </p>
            <p>
             Begins to check second CPP bathroom at 1:17:05 (note weird red lighting AND artwork).
