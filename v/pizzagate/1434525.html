<p>WARNING: DISTURBING CONTENT<br />
from a pastebin i found - guy claims to have stolen 2gb of data from WeThePizza - which CTR is known to have ordered pizza from man times. It could be fake, but here is the majority of the pastebin.  
</p>
<p>WeThePizza update: Guy#1 presumed KIA. Our 3 letter friend is taking care of the rest of our botched sting  
</p>
<p>Hi, Guy#2 here, after nearly 24 hours we have been unable to contact Guy#1, he’s probably been either captured or killed. We are now releasing part of the deadman switch as we promised.  
</p>
<p>Without releasing too much info, we botched the whole thing and my 3 letter friend’s contact (who was to ensure prosecution against We The Pizza) is now confirmed KIA. We are safe and headed into the protection of a friendly foreign intelligence agency and the agency now possess the 2GB of child rape and cloned Hard Drives. My 3 letter friend assures me they are on our side and can be trusted.  
</p>
<p>What we are releasing is disturbing, it was to be November’s child rape menu. My 3 letter friend believes his other trusted friend already has the children from the menu in government witness protection or even hiding them somewhere in a hotel.  
</p>
<p>Me and Guy#1 were never trained for this shit. Sorry we blew it.  
</p>
<p>For those who didn’t follow the original reddit post, here is a run down of what happened:  
</p>
<p>We are friends with a 3 letter agent.  
</p>
<p>We volunteer to help him.  
</p>
<p>Guy#1 sneaks into WeThePizza and unplugs some computer cords and fucks up their network.  
</p>
<p>Our 3 letter friend is contacted by WeThePizza to fix the computer issues, but says he is busy and recommends me (Guy#2) as a trusted pedo friendly repair tech, I am no computer expert but I do know a pretty decent amount.  
</p>
<p>I walked out with 2GB of child rape porn, a half assed (I somehow fucked it up) cloned Windows XP hard drive and some weird .exes that generate client lists.  
</p>
<p>We setup multiple deadman switches.  
</p>
<p>The original plan was to get this verified by the media, and contact verified government agents. But fucking Guy#1 panics and wants the FBI, CIA, NSA or whoever to know we have the deadman switches operational and he makes his first Reddit post (we told him not to) on the now banned <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a>. He lied about the specifics (thankfully). But then people start asking for proof and he posts child rape porn as proof. But people still don’t believe him and people start coming up with all sorts of fake theories about him. He then gets drunk.  
</p>
<p>To further verify our story wethepizza.com changes their website to “Coming Soon”, just less then two hours after Guy#1’s post.  
</p>
<p>A couple hours latter I create a reddit account to do damage control, but shills and disinfo agents confused the shit out of me. I tried posting a PGP message, for people to brute force, but I didn’t know you couldn’t brute force PGP and I am called a troll and disinfo/shill. Honestly the whole night was an  absurd combination of being called a shill, CTR agent, spook, disinfo agent, etc. I am NOT responding to anything non-constructive today, I will only answer valid questions. <strong>I WILL NOT BE FEEDING THE TROLLS.</strong>  
</p>
<p>I gave up with the shills and called it a night, sometime during the time I was trying to relax, a shill at thedailybeast.com makes up this bizarre article that makes no sense and (kind of?) tries to take credit for our work.  
</p>
<p>Article here: <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/21/i-ve-been-making-viral-fake-news-for-the-last-six-months-it-s-way-too-easy-to-dupe-the-right-on-the-internet.html">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/11/21/i-ve-been-making-viral-fake-news-for-the-last-six-months-it-s-way-too-easy-to-dupe-the-right-on-the-internet.html</a>  
</p>
<p>I also had the analysts arguing about not wanting more lunch from We The Pizza, a real pizza place from which Correct The Record had frequently ordered. When internet sleuths googled We The Pizza, they were stunned to discover it was a real place in the middle of Washington, D.C.—just down the street from CTR’s offices!”  
</p>
<p>That makes no sense at all if you actually were trying to take credit for our data theft.  
</p>
<p><strong>Also, I saw an info graphic all about we the pizza, does anybody have it?</strong>  
</p>
<p>WARNING USE TOR BEFORE DOWNLOADING:
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/">https://www.torproject.org/</a></p>
<p>This is a menu for We The Pizza:  
</p>
<p>END OF THE COPIED PASTEBIN  
</p>
<p>HE THEN LINKS TO A PHOTO MENU THAT OTHER USERS SAY CONTAINS A CHILD  TYPE MENU FROM WETHEPIZZA. This was said to contain cp by other users so I did not click it. I wont include the link here so we\'re all safe from that shit. Another anon posted this image, taken of text contained in the menu. It is DISTURBING but contains no cp and nothing illegal to view
<a href="https://i.sli.mg/Fp3Q1T.jpg">https://i.sli.mg/Fp3Q1T.jpg</a></p>
<p>Another anon says &quot;the menu is not to visit the children but to watch them tortured and tell the torturer what to do.to finish the pizza is to have them killed live. That has to be what the menu is. They also sell prints of bloody asses for 1 thousand dollars a piece why would someone who is buying the kid want a photo of it too for 1k?&quot;  <br />
Anon describes the pictures in the menu as<br />
Kid on the floor mouth bane on and tied up. metallic ball/fishing weight in front of genitals.<br />
Kd on the bed with ducktape over mouth tied in the missionary position. Blue comforter maybe fish themed<br />
An image of the mouth bane and a close up of it.<br />
Do not remember the rest there was the bloody ass/spanking compilation with a nude child frontal nudity. <br />
Pizza is related to the blood loss of being molested by a grown up. They bleed from the genitals.
Anons indicate the text picture fits within the context and format of the supposed menu, and even if the menu was some sort of roleplay by some disturbed guy and isnt real, it at least took a lot of work and contained cp, which is itself a crime. If the pizza place is implicated, they\'re sick fucks. We can table this as iffy until the leaker proves its real. But its another thing to ad to the pile at least. <br />
So now that we have found a menu with children in bondage. And that is called pizza. Then the Podesta handkerchief really is pizza related (black and white - bdsm child rape).  And down below, that Pizza is as in bleeding. A bloody rape. I\'d heard they liked that but it never connected before about Pizza sauce and bleeding. I suppose manual trauma of other types counts for pizza sauce too. Add in podestas &quot;still in the torture chamber&quot; email.

Interesting article with more evidence

Anon says &quot;I \'decoded\' the numbers on the side of this box into hebrew letters and got \'That had been mangled Justice Barley St. forcing kid Bible\'. working on the other letters now.&quot;  
</p>
<p>rt.com/usa/367890-fbi-playpen-hacking-warrant/<br />
&quot;The FBI hacked into more than 8,000 computers in 120 countries during an investigation into a child pornography website with just one warrant, a court hearing transcript has shown. It represents the largest known law enforcement hacking campaign to date.&quot;
malware datamine. With a network that global, I\'m convinced the FBI has a world of evidence into our elite pedos.

           I gave up with the shills and called it a night, sometime during the time I was trying to relax, a shill at thedailybeast.com makes up this bizarre article that makes no sense and (kind of?) tries to take credit for our work.
          </p>

           Article here:

           I also had the analysts arguing about not wanting more lunch from We The Pizza, a real pizza place from which Correct The Record had frequently ordered. When internet sleuths googled We The Pizza, they were stunned to discover it was a real place in the middle of Washington, D.C.—just down the street from CTR’s offices!”
          </p>
          <p>
           That makes no sense at all if you actually were trying to take credit for our data theft.
          </p>
          <p>
           <strong>
            Also, I saw an info graphic all about we the pizza, does anybody have it?

           This is a menu for We The Pizza:
          </p>
          <p>
           END OF THE COPIED PASTEBIN
          </p>
          <p>
           HE THEN LINKS TO A PHOTO MENU THAT OTHER USERS SAY CONTAINS A CHILD  TYPE MENU FROM WETHEPIZZA. This was said to contain cp by other users so I did not click it. I wont include the link here so we're all safe from that shit. Another anon posted this image, taken of text contained in the menu. It is DISTURBING but contains no cp and nothing illegal to view

           </a>
          </p>
          <p>
           Another anon says "the menu is not to visit the children but to watch them tortured and tell the torturer what to do.to finish the pizza is to have them killed live. That has to be what the menu is. They also sell prints of bloody asses for 1 thousand dollars a piece why would someone who is buying the kid want a photo of it too for 1k?"
           <br/>
           Anon describes the pictures in the menu as
           <br/>
           Kid on the floor mouth bane on and tied up. metallic ball/fishing weight in front of genitals.
           <br/>
           Kd on the bed with ducktape over mouth tied in the missionary position. Blue comforter maybe fish themed
           <br/>
           An image of the mouth bane and a close up of it.
           <br/>
           Do not remember the rest there was the bloody ass/spanking compilation with a nude child frontal nudity.
           <br/>
           Pizza is related to the blood loss of being molested by a grown up. They bleed from the genitals.
Anons indicate the text picture fits within the context and format of the supposed menu, and even if the menu was some sort of roleplay by some disturbed guy and isnt real, it at least took a lot of work and contained cp, which is itself a crime. If the pizza place is implicated, they're sick fucks. We can table this as iffy until the leaker proves its real. But its another thing to ad to the pile at least.
           <br/>
           So now that we have found a menu with children in bondage. And that is called pizza. Then the Podesta handkerchief really is pizza related (black and white - bdsm child rape).  And down below, that Pizza is as in bleeding. A bloody rape. I'd heard they liked that but it never connected before about Pizza sauce and bleeding. I suppose manual trauma of other types counts for pizza sauce too. Add in podestas "still in the torture chamber" email.

            Eventually Kim re-emerged from hospital, and her story took another dramatic twist: somehow she found herself exposed to the activities of a paedophile ring. In the book we are told that when she reported it to the police, she received anonymous warnings to be quiet: "Threats of retaliation escalated until one day a man threw acid in her face and someone tried to set light to her bed with her in it." Kim got out, but the house was gutted. The album art is very horrific, it is very similar to the crimes of Dutroux. For anyone who doesn't know anything about Dutroux, In the late 90s there was a huge case against Dutroux, who was kidnapping young girls, abusing them, not feeding them and using them for his own pleasure. For the 5 involved, 2 girls died due to starvation since Dutroux didn't feed them when he locked them away. It was known that Dutroux was a pedophile and had commited the crimes, yet it took 14 months and a national protest for the police to finally arrest him and proceed to the court. The story of Dutroux is horrid. 
But Kim Noble has likely gotten used by the same pedophile network that Dutroux was part of. And in that network were reportedly very high profile people (hence the coverup). The 23 or so witnesses of the Dutroux have all deceased or died mysteriously.

            WeThePizza manifesto
            <br/>
            “We” is powerful. “We” is strong. “We” is where “I” meets “you” and “us” meets “them” and change happens. “We” means togetherness, unity, peace and good will. “We” will never be alone. “We” is selfless, because there is no “self” in “we.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “We” is community and family. “We” is belonging. “We” is no one place or thing or idea. “We” is an ideal. “We” is the promise of better days and brighter futures and the opportunity to finally be ourselves because together, “we” are one. “We” are all. There is no separation or exclusion with “we.”
           </p>
           <p>
            Smells are richer. Sights are more beautiful. Sounds are clearer and tastes more glorious with “we.” “We” brings meaning to the mundane. When “we” joins together and puts another before “I” and “me,” the world becomes a better place.
           </p>
           <p>
            And “we” are all in this together. Welcome to “We.”
            <br/>

            This traffic is really warm and really weird in light of Hastert. Boy that's sad.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Traffic" is code for "child trafficking?". How else can traffic be "warm and weird.” 
"Warm" means the victim was freshly kidnapped.
           </p>
           <p>
            "Weird" means the victim wasn't properly trained to be an obedient and enthusiastic sex slave yet. Raping them is an awkward experience.
           </p>
           <p>
            These pedos love hiding things in plain sight with double entendres, so "Boy that's sad" might be a crypto-punchline meaning he was specifically raping a sad boy that day. Normally the male victims are trained to not react with sadness, but this one did, hence calling him "really weird". The lack of a comma after "Boy" also supports this possibility

            Former House speaker Dennis Hastert, who less than a decade ago stood second in line to the presidency, was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison Wednesday for a bank fraud case linked to allegations he sexually abused teen boys more than 30 years ago.

            That's right, he is a serial sex offender. Check out the dates of the article and the email; They match. Pedestal was sad that his friend was caught for child molestation, while seemingly involved in some kind of ‘weird’ trafficking related act himself.

             comet ping pong is as rectangular as Solomon temple. There is a porch a middle ping pong room and the lowered party room at the end.
            </p>
            <p>
             ALSO IT IS ON THE CROSSROADS AND IT IS FACING WEST TO EAST.
             <br/>
             Well comet ping pong is congruent with the masonic layout of dc. Connecticut avenue is longer than 16th street.
            </p>
            <p>
             it represents the lightning bolt of Lucifer to logans circle. The right eye. It is the antichrist symbology. Even ping pong balls are playing with the lost eye of the false prophet.
            </p>
            <p>
             it is 4 miles from the House of the temple which is directly north from the white house.

Remember podestas 14 fish on his hands? 
there is a possibility that podesta and the DC pedo ring are related to the temple of set, especially We, the pizza

             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             The Temple was established in the United States in 1975 by Michael Aquino, an American political scientist, military officer, and a high-ranking member of Anton LaVey's Church of Satan. Dissatisfied with the direction in which LaVey was taking the Church, Aquino resigned and – according to his own claim – embarked on a ritual to invoke Satan, who revealed to him a sacred text called The Book of Coming Forth by Night. According to Aquino, in this work Satan revealed his true name to be Set, which had been the name used by his followers in ancient Egypt. Aquino was joined in establishing the Temple by a number of other dissatisfied members of LaVey's Church, and soon various Setian groups were established across the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pylons typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel.
            </p>
            <p>
             it has already been established that podesta has 14 and a fish tattoed on his hands, and the myth of osiris being cut into 14 pieces by set and having his dick eaten by a fish might be the reason why
            </p>
            <p>
             also note the similarity of the temple of set's logo and we, the pizza's
            </p>
            <p>
             In 1987, during the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, the three-year-old daughter of a Christian clergyman accused Aquino of sexually abusing her during Satanic rites held at his Presidio home. Responding to the allegations, police raided Aquino's home, however—after no evidence was found to substantiate the allegation and it was revealed that Aquino was living in Washington D.C. at the time of the alleged abuse—the police decided not to charge him with any felony.
            </p>
            <p>
             well this lead isn't concrete but it is fucking fishy, and considering this cult meets at a member's house and aquino has a house in DC that means if this case is linked to the temple of set, so is aquino and vice versa
            </p>
            <p>
             It would also establish its own intranet, allowing for communication between Setians in different parts of the world.

             Set killed Osiris and cut him into 14 pieces. The 14th piece, Osiris dick, was eaten by a fish. Isis made Osiris a new dick made from gold. Osiris is the god of the underworld, and the fish is attributed to life and resurrection (Jesus fish especially, and that's the one Podesta has).
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm guessing Podesta's "14 fish" means that he ate the life force of someone. According to Crowley, you do that by eating blood and semen - main recipe in the Spirit Cooking dinner.

              Graham Caldwell is part of the "Meat and You" exhibition at StrandVolta linked to Alefantis (who owned it).

             <p>
              This guy does metallic art.  Anyone find this peculiar?
             </p>
             <p>
              "When Graham Caldwell’s furnace telephoned him at about 8:30 on a recent Sunday morning, it had bad news. Housed in the DC GlassWorks studio in Hyattsville, Md., the furnace was issuing a distress signal. “The electricity had gone out,” recalls Caldwell. “The oven’s safety system was set off.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Having a friend with a furnace could be useful.

              They managed both Talon and GOPUSA both newssites.
             </p>
             <p>
              And Talon just happened to have a Prostitution scandal and had to close down.
             </p>
             <p>
              The sites hit the national radar when Talon's Washington bureau chief, going by the name Jeff Gannon, asked President Bush during a White House briefing last month about working with Democrats, whom he described as "divorced from reality."
             </p>
             <p>
              Details emerge
             </p>
             <p>
              That sparked the curiosity of Media Matters for America (mediamatters.org), a Web site that monitors conservative media. The group began scrutinizing Gannon, learning that his real name is James Guckert and saying that his stories were largely regurgitated White House press releases and his questions in White House briefings were softballs.
             </p>

             </p>
             <p>
              Bloggers linked Gannon to gay porn Web sites and prostitution. Naked photos of him and his Web profile of sexual preferences are in wide e-mail circulation."
             </p>
             <p>
              There it is. Perfect Privacy, LLC linked to Gannon gay prostitution scandal.

              HOLY FUCKING SHIT. GUESS WHO OUTED GANNON? MEDIAMATTERS, DAVID BROCK. WTF? LOL
             </p>
             <p>
              "Media Matters has dubbed the scandal Gannon-gate.
             </p>
             <p>
              "How all this happened still hasn't been sufficiently answered," said David Brock, president of Media Matters and author of four political books.
             </p>
             <p>
              Brock said his organization's analysis of Gannon's questions over the past two years shows that White House officials called on him to change the subject when they faced intense questioning from other reporters."

            The 'we broke in' menu is sick.  Not sure what to make of those guys -- leftists making up stories and laughing about it was my first inclination.   The contents of the menu and details are certainly disturbing.   I hope they wait until Trump is in office and get it to some of his people (the proof) to examine.

              Where did you find all this information, I followed the We The Pizza case very closely and OP never delivered anything that he promised. The text you've posted doesn't match to what I read on Reddit at the time. I ruled it out as trolling from a sicko who had CP.
             </p>
             <p>
              But, the most suspicious thing was We The Pizza taking their website down almost immediately, and when it came back up the mysterious login page had disappeared. www.wethepizza.com/login

            That "I've been making fake news" is really odd.   They just happen to make up Hillary's poor health right before she just happens to collapse?   Anyone with real knowledge of her (even publicly available) knew she was in bad shape.  Not buying that.   Also not buying "We the Pizza" was a lucky shot in the dark and it just so happens to have had a child pedo symbol and so happens to be near Jimmy Comet.   That's a pretty complex psy op disinformation hit piece.

             Has anyone actually heard of any of the stories he's claiming he made go viral? Because I haven't, and I'm a news junky.
