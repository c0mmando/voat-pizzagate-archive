<p>A news story from 2011 saying that the recent charges of sexual abuse in Hollywood are just the tip of the Iceberg. These were involving Martin Weiss and Fernando Rivas (the composer for Sesame Street.)</p>

<p>This one is about Donald Luciano who was guilty of possessing images of a minor in sexual positions (pictures with kids as young as two years old). Creepy looking fucker.</p>

<p>This one might need some other reference but it talks about Lou Pearlman (the guy who created NSYNC and The Backstreet Boys) waws a Paedo aswell. When he was asked once what it would take to get into a band he leaned back in his chair and spread his legs then said &quot;you are a smart boy, figure it out.&quot; It gets creepier.</p>

<p>Next one is about David Leigh MacLeod, a Hollywood Producer (this is a trend aswell) who was being hunted by the FBI for nearly a decade, they said there was no foul play in his death but he was found in an underground walkway with a bottle of beer and lighter fluid.
Not much else, not a mention on the victims or his crimes to much detail either.</p>

<p>Ok, this one is about Jason Michael Handy, who took over 1000 photos of elementary school girls across the street from where he lived. He was a Producer for Nickelodeon and used that fame and connection to take email addresses and phone numbers from children. He sexually abused two little girls who wanted to be famous.</p>

<p>Michael Peterson had over 500,000 images and 7500 videos of child pornography. He lived in Ontario outside Los Angeles, and was arrested along with 7 other men but those men were not named in this article. This was the biggest collection of images captured, not sure if that still holds.</p>

             Oh, haven't seen this. Thanks. I have actually compiled some links for the Military and Government in the U.S. aswell. Not sure how much is repost but I will make a new post soon. Hope I can help in some way.
            </p>

             Edit : I had watched this but it was titled differently, thanks anyway.
