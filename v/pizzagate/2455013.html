</p>
<p>Last year, U.N. officials vowed to improve funding and staffing for sex abuse cases. Atul Khare, under-secretary general, said those efforts have led to a 50% drop in assaults on children by peacekeepers across the globe during the first 11 months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.  &quot;We believe our new strategy is bearing some initial fruit,&quot; said Khare, who conceded that &quot;even one allegation is one too many.&quot;</p>
<p>Even so, the U.N.\'s own watchdog said in a June report that while progress has been made, much improvement is needed, including recording complaints and following up on accusations. The number of victims is far higher than the U.N. reports, said Remy Djamouss, president of the Center for the Promotion and Defense of the Rights of Children in Bangui. His group takes the testimonies of children abused by peacekeepers.</p>
<p>One 17-year-old girl said she did not report being raped at gunpoint in June by two peacekeepers in the city of Bria because sexual assault by U.N. soldiers is so common. She said many friends and neighbors ended up having children as a result of being raped by peacekeepers.
“I did not tell people that I was raped by the peacekeepers because they would make fun of me,&quot; said Merveille, whose last name is being withheld to protect her privacy as a sexual assault victim under USA TODAY\'s policy.</p>
<p>Another young victim is still waiting for justice. The 13-year-old girl said she was attacked two years ago at Camp M\'Poko near Bangui’s international airport.   &quot;Three white soldiers told me to come get candies and cookies,&quot; recalled Joanna, whose last name also is being withheld. &quot;One of them covered my mouth with his hand and then the two raped me. I want these people to be punished.”</p>
<p>Peacekeeping soldiers, who come from dozens of countries, usually are sent home when they face sexual abuse allegations, as required under U.N. rules. That policy has become a shield for alleged abusers, according to child advocates.</p>
<p>SO, They are being sent home.  Just like that.  Without punishment.  And replaced with others that will be doing the same.  Evidently they have not improved on protecting the children of CAR, even though they claim they have.</p>
<p>PG Related because we know that the UN has been shielding and protecting the Peacekeepers and raping and abusing children.  The UN is responsible for protecting the Our Children.  They are not.</p>',

             I copied most of the article, but not all of it.  You will see in the article that there is really not much difference.  "The number of victims is far higher than the U.N. reports, said Remy Djamouss, president of the Center for the Promotion and Defense of the Rights of Children in Bangui. His group takes the testimonies of children abused by peacekeepers."   Also it says that victims are still too scared to come forward.  The UN is trying to make it seem like they are making a difference, when in reality they are not.  Typical.

              Yea, I agree. They are not making any difference at all, because they really don't care. Anything they say in regard to stopping the abuse is just PR or because they feel forced to say something about it.

               I  don't know why, but they seem to just be looking the other way to protect their brother pedos.  I think the UN is infiltrated with them.   What if there are compensations made by those allowed to travel to these countries.  Are former pedos allowed to return?  Of course they are.  They do not suffer the consequences but are just sent home immediately.  Why?  To protect their own and then they are able to send them back.  Something is not right here.
