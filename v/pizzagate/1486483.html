            No sorry. I looked through my youtube history, my saved voat posts and my bookmarks. Nothing.
I wasn't locked in to youtube and think I only clicked at it as it was in the suggested sidebar on youtube when I was watching something else before and I didn't save it...

             same situation here.
            </p>
            <p>
             though I found a different video which shares a couple of the same screenshots (can't find the person with his hand up a turkey though)
            </p>
            <p>
             i have observed more than one point of consideration that suggests the people here are protected , would not recommend following up on the following instagram accounts;

             remember, we may have made the same choices had been in their position's. they deserve every chance possible to show their worth to make amends before natural causes find them.
