<p>A priest who was affiliated with Ascension Catholic Church in Boca Raton is accused of molesting a 9-year-old boy and sexually abusing unidentified others in a scathing report issued Tuesday by a Pennsylvania grand jury that conducted a sweeping investigation into clergy misconduct.</p>
<p>Monsignor Thomas Benestad was among the scores of “predator priests” the grand jury mentioned by name in a 1,356-page report of its roughly two-year investigation, the most comprehensive in U.S. history. Benestad, according to the document, served at the church on North Federal Highway from 2007 to 2009 and still lives in Boca.</p>
<p>Neither leaders at the church nor those at the Diocese of Palm Beach responded to requests for comment about Benestad’s work in Boca Raton or whether he continues to serve as a priest in Palm Beach County.</p>
<p>Benestad couldn’t be reached for comment. But in a letter to the grand jury, his attorney said the Vatican in 2014 cleared the 73-year-old priest of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“Monsignor Benestad has never done anything that would be deemed inappropriate with any individual,” attorney John Waldron wrote to the grand jury on Benestad’s behalf. “Officials in Rome … adjudicated Monsignor Benestad’s case” and found there was no reason to place any restrictions on his ministry, Waldron wrote.</p>
<p>The grand jury report noted that police officials in Pennsylvania said their investigation determined the allegations of abuse by Benestad were credible. The document described in graphic detail the allegations the young man reported to the Diocese of Allentown where Benestad worked before moving to Boca. In 2011, the grand jury wrote, the unidentified young man reported that Benestad molested him when he was a student at St. Bernard’s Catholic School in Easton from 1981 to 1983.</p>
<p>His first memory of the abuse was being led by a nun into Benestad’s office when he was 9 years old for wearing shorts instead of proper school attire, the jury wrote. After berating the boy for being sinful by not dressing properly, the report stated Benestad ordered the youth to get on his knees and start praying. Benestad unzipped his pants and ordered the youth to perform oral sex on him and then performed oral sex on the boy, according to the young man’s account as cited in the report.</p>
<p>In what is considered RITUALISTIC ABUSE, Benestad squirted holy water into the youngster’s mouth “to purify him,” the jury wrote. Such abuse continued for two years, it wrote.</p>
<p>While police believed the young man, by the time the allegations were presented to prosecutors, the statute of limitations had run out, the jury said.</p>
<p>Just as diocesan officials ignored the young man’s complaint, it ignored other abuse allegations against Benestad, the grand jury report states.</p>
<p>While the grand jury only referred generally to “additional complaints” against Benestad from other victims, in 2005 the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests wrote a letter to the bishop in Allentown, alleging that two — possibly three — adults had been raped by Benestad.</p>
<p>Even after learning of the allegations by the young man and the other victims, the Diocese of Allentown didn’t discipline Benestad, the jury wrote.</p>
<p>“The diocese elected to rely on Benestad’s word rather than the word of the victims and the determinations of law enforcement,” it wrote. “No attempt was made to remove Benestad from ministry. Benestad was granted retirement, resides in Boca Raton, Florida, and assists with a local parish.”</p>
<p>Such a disturbing trend was repeated again and again in each of the six dioceses in Pennsylvania that the panel investigated by reviewing more than 500,000 pages of church documents.</p>
<p>“They contained credible allegations against over 300 predator priests,” it wrote. “Over 1,000 child victims were identifiable, from the church’s own records. We believe that the real number — of children whose records were lost, or who were afraid ever to come forward — is in the thousands.”</p>
<p>Yet, it wrote, because diocesan officials failed to act, few priests can be held accountable. Like Benestad, most are protected from prosecution because the statute of limitations has run out.</p>
<p>Judith Weiss Collins, 66, who lives in Lehigh Valley, said she was one of Benestad’s victims and learned of two other women who were also abused by the cleric. Benestad began molesting her when she was 9 years old and the abuse continued until she was in her 40s, she said.</p>
<p>“I’ve lost everything,” she said when reached by phone. In return, she said she received an apology from the bishop and the church paid for some therapy for her.</p>
<p>While she views the sweeping grand jury report with mixed emotions, she said: “I’m thrilled that it’s out.”</p>
<p>Still, she said, she worries that others may be at risk if Benestad is still working as a priest. “That’s what scares the bigemmies out of me,” she said.</p>
<p>Records show Benestad lives in a $300,000 condo along State Road A1A, south of Boca Inlet Park. In addition to the unit he owns in Atlantic Cloisters, where he is president of the condominium board, he and family members also own a $175,000 townhouse on South Federal Highway in Boca Raton.</p>
<p>In its report, the grand jury urged lawmakers to change the law so sexual predators won’t escape prosecution if victims are reluctant to come forward for years. Further, they asked that changes be made so the church can’t hide behind confidentiality agreements. They also want to see laws requiring people to report sex abuse to be beefed up.</p>

            This is great news, and I hope Judith can feel some vindication and peace, even though the worst of Benestad's crimes have yet to be revealed, according to her former allegations. This is a tremendous step forward, and my thoughts and prayers are with her. Must be very emotionally wrenching to go through this.

             Yes, somewhat Bittersweet.  Jubilation on one side while still there is a piece missing.  I heard they are suppose to vote on changing the laws. Hopefully it will pass. I presume there will a lot of money changing hands.  They also might make it easier for older victims to bring charges.  Prayers Please, Everyone.

             I am so very lucky to have her friendship.  She has been a Guiding Light.  She is an Angel and My Inspiration.  I don't know how she does it.  I am sure she is a thorn in his side.  But then he is backed by the Vatican.  Yes, she should get a Medal for Bravery.

             And why should they when they are guilty of the same things.  These people never see wrong when they agree that children are consenting to their raping and abuse.  They first of all must Groom Themselves into believing it, that's how they are so good at Grooming others.  We find many times there are these statements from clergy and those in the Vatican.   No reason for restrictions, after he raped a 9 yr old girl and committed a Ritualistic Act on a boy.  Really, I know how they are and it still Boggles the Mind.

             It is a relief for me too, yes.  Because I know how much it meant to her.  It's not over for her.  I know that she wants to get rid of the statute of limitations for Victims and would like for Benestad to be kept away from children, whatever that may entail.  He is a vile SRA Rapist. If you read the article, you know that they called the washing of the mouth by holy water Ritualistic Abuse.  Actually that is one of his milder torturous acts upon children.  I am sure he would say that the boy deserved it, for he didn't fight hard enough to resist.  Sick Sick Sick

               I don't rally know.  But I am much surprised by what just happened so who knows.  Hopefully this is a sign that people are sick and tired of it and will push and push.  Now that people know about him, he cannot hide.  No matter what the Vatican said, people know what he did and I hope it opens Pandora's Box.

                Me, too. The AG spoke about "secret archives" so maybe that's what they're waiting on. The nature of rats is to turn on each other when the ship starts sinking, so more may still come out.

                 They certainly are the type to turn on each other.  You may just be right and I will be relishing it.  They are so spoiled and coddled and far too well taken care of by maids and nurses and the Vatican. They keep them from jail because they protect their own and they know what will happen to them when they inmates get hold of them.

            That's great news, Carm! :-) But reading the article above made me cringe. He is
            <em>
             still
            </em>
            working as a priest? The Vatican 'cleared' him of allegations in 2014? (Well, then he must be innocent for sure.... /s).
           </p>
           <p>
            What is so unsettling about this report is that - as far as I know - it is the first time people really did an indepth investigation, based on documents found in Church archives. (!) Meaning, if they would do this for every other diocese out there, there would likely be similar results.
           </p>
           <p>
            All the abuse reports in the past have only been the tip of the iceberg.

             Yes, this is what worries her, he is still free to visit his horrid crimes on other children.  He is free and untouched because he heads the Papal Foundation.  There has to be a Huge Outcry and Demand for his take down.  He will never be defrocked.  That is for sure.

               Me too.  But I think most people will watch it on the news, glad to see the names released, and then just want it to go away.  It's a Nasty Business and most people don't want to go down into the weeds and know the really dirty cruel and heinous things that were done to those children.  I had someone tell me that when they look at those adults sitting on the stage, that they are glad they came forward for now they can live their lives in peace.  WHAT?  Do people even know what the rest of their lives will be like, when they are out at a restaurant, they may see someone that looks like their rapist, or can they ever go to church and look at the holy water fount again without screaming.  I think not.  It never goes away.

                  He is the controller of CBTS Patriot Stream. He outed himself months ago. He messed up and posted as Qanon from a regular old 8chan anon handle, tripped up, and a lot of people noticed. He fumbled the ball trying to explain iit all away. He has made other blatant mistakes too. If you are interested you can go to this youtube channel and watch the vids about Q.
