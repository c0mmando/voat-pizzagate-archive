<p>This is her today</p>

<p>According to her the picture I posted on my other thread today of a man drugged out in a chair was her father John Atkin and the doctor torturing him on the left WAS the famous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Good old DonkeyHole\'s alt auralsects tried to tell me I was wrong as &quot;Nazi\'s did nothing wrong and it\'s all a fairytale&quot;</p>

<p>Yet this woman, who has PROOF of herself and her family in MKUltra confirms it was him. </p>
<p>From her Facebook</p>
<p>&quot;Ellen Atkin discovered herself in that famous picture in Oct. 2015.. 2 years before that she saw her mother in a BxW film clip getting electroshocked by Ewan Cameron. There is also a photo of her father as a young man in a hospital chair looking drugged with Joseph Mengele standing beside him. Help us bring the case to the public. We are looking for support, awareness, media production, legal teams &amp; engagement. MK Ultra Girl: Discovery, Integration &amp; Resolve is Ellen’s first book in production. Her next book, Juicy Bits: MK Ultra Girl’s Inter dimentional Beta Programming will follow. &quot;</p>
<p>So the Nazi\'s were doing these experiments and torturing children as well. Meaning it goes deeper then the 1940\'s.</p>
<p>She linked this picture of Mengele with the quote &quot;The more we do it to you, the less you seem to believe we are doing it&quot;</p>

            Hi there gamepwn. Thank you for spelling out this woman is claiming Mengele was in Canada, rather than stating it unequivocally. I am going to give this the "Accuracy?" flair though, since she also may have been led to believe this by her abusers so she would look like a loon and be dismissed.
           </p>
           <p>
            Has anyone done a comparative image analysis of the guy purported to be Mengele?

             Here we go:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              These photos from a yearbook published in 1949 by Hopital Saint Michel Archange in Quebec city, were sent to me by a friend in Ontario. I believe the man on the left in the first photo, bending down to examine a boy in a wheelchair, is Dr. Josef Mengele, the “Angel of Death” of Auschwitz
             </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
             This is from 2011, so probably Ellen Atkin read the blog, read that the guy said this is Mengele, and now purports that her father (is it verified that her father is indeed the boy on the photo?) and her were tortured by Mengele.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://archive.is/TTetc">
              http://archive.is/TTetc
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             But as I said, if you compare the photo to photos of Mengele, you will see that these are not the same men. If we believe she is legit, it's interesting that she says the men spoke German though.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I have still never seen a trace of a papertrail / documents that would prove that Nazi doctors were involved in MK Ultra experiments in the US or in Canada, I only ever saw stuff about 'Operation Paperclip', where Nazi scientists were involved, no medical staff. (But I will gladly admit that I am wrong if I see evidence.)

             When you do a google image search, and look at the pics - the eyes look similar, but the mouth is different.

            <p>
             I also wonder why she thought this guy was Mengele, and since when she has been thinking that?
            </p>
            <p>
             She might have read Cisco Wheeler's stuff, but Cisco Wheeler isn't legit imo.

              Are you fucking kidding me with that shit?!?🤣 Muslims are the biggest slave holders at this very moment! How convenient that you want to direct attention away from your kind though! Loser!

               Well, even at the time of the slave trade, Muslim were the busiest shipping people from Africa as slaves to other countries. But then, he never gets his facts right, what do we expect? LOL

             A lot of Russian Jews do have that name Atkins. The English name Atkins is different and could not be Jewish.

             Atkin is a pretty Jewish name and fabricating Holocaust stories is a pretty Jewish practice.  Wiesenthal was claiming he had leads and trying to get money to capture Mengele for years after his death, which was of course in South America where he was known to have lived the entirety of his postwar life.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course the photo somehow places him in Canada in 1939 with this girl's Jewish looking father and according to a Canadian Jew called Kaplan.
            </p>
            <p>
             All they want is sympathy and shekels, as always.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Nazis certainly did something wrong,  in NOT gassing those kikes for real.   They would have spared us the Frankfurt School responsible for pedo/homo normalization we suffer today, among so many other disasters.
