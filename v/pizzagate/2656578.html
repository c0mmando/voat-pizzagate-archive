As many of you already know, AnonDK offered its help as researchers to assist in the searches and findings of traffickers and children trafficked across the border of mexico and arizona. We have been sharing Anonymous’ progress on this, as many Anonymous are helping in this operation. We have made videos on this information and sharing the work Anonymous has done, so more people can be aware of what is going on and help out as they can. It has come to our attention that the Veterans on Patrol is under the impression Anonymous is it’s personal army and has publicly demanded a dox of the Tucson PD. This is not how Anonymous works. This demand will not be met and as a result all videos and research we have shared and done on this operation will be removed from our websites and youtube channels as it is now considered compromised.</p>

            The article I just posted may have something to do with the hammer coming down on VOP.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seems what's referred to an ''Arizona Mafia'' is running interference for NXIVM. Seems coincidental that it just happens to be Arizona involved in trying to protect a sex cult involved in sex trafficking. While at the same time, VOP uncovers evidence of just that. The shill Sawyer is called in and all of a sudden Snopes calls the whole thing FALSE even though nothing has been substantiated to my liking.

              I think part of the problem is the complete erosion and bastardization of the media. Trump is five points higher in popular than The Kenyan was at the exact same point in his presidency, but would you be able to tell that from the media?

              I am saddened that journalists have been replaced with whores, pedos, and clowns. t depresses me also. No honor ... none.

            I may barking up the wrong tree, but this morning I heard on news that reddit was hacked of all earlier user info.  Around 2007 or so.  Also I read that some info was being scrubbed from twitter fb and others.  Seems there is a lot of taking back or scrubbing going on all over.  Could be nothing, just seemed odd.  This is very unfair of VOP imo.  Something doesn't pass the smell test.  Who is the main spokesperson for their group?  Can we contact them?  They at least owe an explanation on this.  Has some fake taken over?  We need answers.

              Well, I had my reservations about VOP right from the start, but I thought, well maybe I am wrong, give them a chance.  So many jumped right in that I thought I had been mistaken, but other strange things popped up along the way.  Now this.  Then yes, Honeybee.  I really Never listen to anyone of youtube.  Don't Follow Anyone.  Has been a rule of mine from the start.   I remember her post about Pegasus Museum  I helped out quite a bit on it and so did others.  I am not one to not help her out on here, just don't do Idols.  I too am waiting to hear her answer.  Very odd indeed.
