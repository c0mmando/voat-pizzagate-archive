The second piece had the name &quot;Elizabeth Rothschild&quot; printed in bold black on the side. So, I took it as a message and started digging. First I came upon an Elizabeth Rothschild who was a Titanic survivor, so I read up on that hidden history and decided it wasn\'t applicable. Then I found this crazy bitch on FB. She is truly vile to watch, but I suffered through the video posted below and took as many notes as I could. I\'m asking for help in digging, and also wondering what to do with the information. I think the state of TX is basically being held hostage by this witch (who I believe to be Muslim Brotherhood - check out her Twitter name - Rothschild isn\'t her real last name, she traded Ismael for one of the most corrupt last names in history)</p>
<p>Her FB page says something about being Houston\'s Mayor Turner\'s wife, but I couldn\'t find anything to back that up (however there are pictures of the two of them together, plus plenty more of side-by-side pictures, so maybe she\'s blackmailing him or just delusional?). As I scrolled down her FB, a picture of celebrities stood out to me <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CorporateLawSecurities/photos/a.198179463691387/986098784899447/?type=3&amp;theater">https://www.facebook.com/CorporateLawSecurities/photos/a.198179463691387/986098784899447/?type=3&amp;theater</a> and you can find them named with their positions within her &quot;company&quot; on the website <a href="https://www.findfinancialservices.com/US/El-Paso/197930863716247/Corporate-Law-%26-Securities%2C-Inc">https://www.findfinancialservices.com/US/El-Paso/197930863716247/Corporate-Law-%26-Securities%2C-Inc</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Standing contract with the State of TX which allows us to charge: Retainer: $417,000,000.00 Billable Hours: $247,943,600.00 Annual Billable on 52 hours: $12,893,067,200.00&quot; (both on her video and the website). She mostly speaks gibberish and gobbedly-gook. She said something about being under a state of duress was interesting. Here is the insufferable video: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/231773176965158/videos/1094092527399881/">https://www.facebook.com/231773176965158/videos/1094092527399881/</a></p>
<p>Another &quot;company&quot; of hers is Corporate Medical Industries - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Corporate-Medical-Industries-293529424318870/">https://www.facebook.com/Corporate-Medical-Industries-293529424318870/</a> HOLY GROSS SEX STUFF, BATMAN! This lists Sylvia Garcia as the chairman of Child Protective Services. Apparently she is resigning from the TX Senate in order to run for Congress. Seems odd. <a href="https://cw39.com/2018/06/27/senator-sylvia-garcia-reveals-new-details-for-houston-immigrant-childrens-detention-center/">https://cw39.com/2018/06/27/senator-sylvia-garcia-reveals-new-details-for-houston-immigrant-childrens-detention-center/</a></p>

<p>She also mentions Crown Publishing LLC, but I couldn\'t find any sauce for that one.</p>
<p>She was trying to start a business called Texas Casino and Horse Ranch (didn\'t happen as of this video and I can\'t find anything by that name online) Annunciation Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church (she claims she is a pastor/Cardinal here), Joshua Schwartz, property manager (this is clearly a tax shelter from the IRS, rectory office is located on the 5th floor of a BBVA Compass bank building)</p>
<p>She mentions multiple school districts, from El Paso to Houston, not sure what she is trying to do there. She mentioned Educator Expo, but I couldn\'t find anything.</p>
<p>She claims to be a Judge, Sex Therapist, CPA, pastor, Deputy United States Marshal with DoD</p>

The taxpayers are being fleeced, and her &quot;businesses&quot; seem like fronts for human trafficking.

            , I'm not sure if you are a troll and this is just a shitpost, or what, so I'll give you the 24 Hour Grace flair to edit before we remove this per Rules 1 and 2 (please review in the sidebar).

            only accepts research posts that are directly related to child abuse by the global elite, in which every major claim is factual and has a supporting link.
           </p>
           <p>
            The first two links cited are clearly not factual. They list Rick Perry, Madonna, Ellen Degeneris, Montel Williams and a bunch of other celebs as corporate officers. Everything else you've got is based on these, as far as I can tell (couldn't access the video since I don't have a Facebook account). Since this "Rothschild" is pushing the obviously fake company, I'd say this whole thing doesn't meet our standard of evidence to satisfy Rule 1 (direct connection to elite child abuse).

             There are a lot of corrupt politicians listed on her "board of advisors". Including Sylvia Garcia, who apparently has molested girls in the Houston ISD and was very vocal (along with Mayor Turner) against holding illegal immigrants in a warehouse managed by South Key Properties. It just seemed odd that she has compromised celebrities and tons of corrupt TX Dems on her page. I can delete the post.

              No problem. Just realize that we have fairly specific submission rules because we get bombarded with disinfo red herring type posts and fake news, so we require verifiable facts (as much as possible). Don't you think that the simplest explanation for this is that the lady is a nut and the info is untrustworthy?

             I think this is all a waste of time, as well. This woman "Elizabeth", is likely a split personality case and being used as a waste of anyone's time, that looks into her. She might be related to Mayor Turner. It could be his ex-wife or one of his sisters. There is a video on one of this womans many facebook pages where some white lady in a wheelchair tells this woman she ain't shit, after this woman goes into a rant about being a judge. The video looks like the inside of a mental facility.

            Apparently Sylvia Garcia is a kiddy fiddler, but the internet has been scrubbed of any sauce to confirm. But that would make sense why she is connected to the Corporate Medical Industries page
