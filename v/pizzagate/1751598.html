            It's like they just tell us how corrupt and evil she is and nothing happens.  I'm sure Comey was probably bribed with some kid sex slaves to keep him on her side.  They are sooooo sick.  They don't care that we know, as long as they are never brought to trial, then it's just fine.

            Yes,  thanks for bringing this up again.  It is going around.
           </p>
           <p>
            What this proves is that even MSM  doesn't matter.
           </p>
           <p>
            They brought the story up.  What happened?  Nothing
           </p>
           <p>
            Even if NBC, CBS, CNN etc  covered Pizzagate, the stall would be the same.
           </p>
           <p>
            Nothing more would happen than is happening now.

            What we have found out through this:
           </p>
           <p>
            There is a class of people for whom there is no law.  Hillary Clinton is in that class.

            All you attorneys...or those that play them on TV...legal minds please.  I still think we could out alot of this information (or at least scare them into outing it themselves)...is there a LEGAL mechanism we could employ to force MSM to tell the pedo story?  Like complicit in a crime?  Or have knowledge of a crime being perpetrated and do nothing?  For instance, I believe in OK we have good Samaritan laws...could these not be stretched a bit to sue MSM for non action?  We might start with the worst offender...say NBC above...would cost the writing and filing of the lawsuit unless we fully on prosecuted it..which would be fun with depo's and all :-)

             Here's a link below to a report, which may help establish if corporate MSM is complicit in a crime, by looking at...
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Corporate liability for gross human rights abuses
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Towards a fairer and more effective system of domestic law remedies
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             **A report prepared for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights **
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Business/DomesticLawRemedies/StudyDomesticeLawRemedies.pdf">
              http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Business/DomesticLawRemedies/StudyDomesticeLawRemedies.pdf
             </a>
            </p>
            <p>
             I've only had time for a brief look, but it does give some guide lines on the applicability to business enterprises of international standards prohibiting gross human rights abuses, potentially amounting to the level of international crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             It notes....
            </p>
            <p>
             While international regimes have thus far focussed on individual offenders, the contribution of business enterprises to gross human rights abuses around the world has not gone unnoticed.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, it maybe corporate entities can be held accountable by secondary liability.
            </p>
            <p>
             As the UN Guiding Principles make clear, the lack of accountability mechanisms for companies at international level does not mean that corporate entities involved in gross human rights abuses enjoy impunity for their actions. On the contrary, corporate complicity in gross human rights abuses attracts the possibility of sanctions under the criminal laws of many
7  UN Guiding Principles, Guiding Principle 23. 14
States, and may also give rise to the possibility of civil liability towards affected parties under private law (or “tort-based”) regimes.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, as discussed further below (see sections 1.3 and 2.1.3), establishing criminal or civil liability in any specific case depends on many factors including, crucially, the presence of knowledge and/or intent within the corporation and among key staff and managers, the degree of involvement and contribution by the company and the extent to which the company’s actions were the cause of the abuse.
            </p>
            <p>
             So first impressions would asume corporate MSM has to be seen to have knowledge of any human rights abuse first.
            </p>
            <p>
             Which in case of NBC it appears it did, with the leaked memo's.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, further reading is needed before any assertions that MSM are complicit in a crime can be made.

              More on secondary liability...
             </p>
             <p>
              Theories of corporate complicity in the wrongs of others therefore assume central importance in domestic legal responses to corporate involvement in gross human rights abuses. In the criminal law context, these revolve around concepts of “criminal conspiracy” and theories of secondary liability such as
              <strong>
               “aiding and abetting”
              </strong>
              , “accessory liability” and “incitement”. In the field of private law remedies, too, theories of secondary liability have been developed to help define the circumstances in which individuals and enterprises can be held legally responsible for the wrongful acts of third parties. The tests for liability applied by domestic remedial systems typically focus on knowledge (i.e. what the corporation “knew” at the relevant time), intent (i.e. what the corporation intended to happen) and causation.

             <p>
              Could it be a case that if corporate media and police department know that abuse is taking place and are failing to report / take action then they are "aiding and abetting” crimes to take place because the perpetrators carry on their hideous abuse knowing they will not be investigated or their crimes reported?

               Absolutely. This is how we fight the system, buy getting aquainted with the existing laws, and using it against them. Also - public awareness about SECRET SOCIETIES. Anybody occuping public office, whether it's the law enforcement, education, judge ... cannot be a member of any secret society. Public must sign petition that every high ranking member will give an oath '.. that he/she is not bound to protect brotherhood.' This should be a seperate post. I cannot emphasize how viral secret socities play in cover ups! Skull &amp; Bones, Freemasons (dozens of branches, rites, example FM rite of Misraim has 90 degrees), Dark Lodges of the same socities. As Albert Pike described it - it is Labirynthian! A great book to read would be Texe Mars' 'Codex Magica' and Juri Lina's 'Architects of Deception.' Once critical % of public awareness is reached, then we can use the legal system against them. The fight has just began. Next 4-8 years is our chance to truly drain the swamp.

             I agree.  The angle of 'complicity' is valid - but I feel that this route would be based on the premise that MSM provides a 'service' and further that that 'service' should reside within pre-prescribed parameters. Without such an establishment,  attempts to assign complicity or even 'culpability by default' would be difficult to say the least.  The MSM has no such interest in boundaries that force them to be in any way accountable for what they present to us as 'news' as fact or fiction.  In fact they rely on it.

            Of course. Our government needs to be overthrown, not pleaded with to uphold the law. Abusrd really that we pretend they can be reasoned with.
