The site\'s description of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rosewood Center in Owings Mills, MD, formerly known as The Asylum and Training School for the Feeble Minded of the State of Maryland, was established in 1888.  This institution provided care, education, training, and habilitation of developmentally disabled children.  It admitted it\'s first patients in 1889.  From 1912-1961 it was known as Rosewood State Training School.  In 1958 Rosewood established the Institute for Children which provided intensive inpatient psychiatric treatment for emotionally ill children.  The children were admitted up to their 13th birth date. In 1961 the name changed to Rosewood State Hospital.  In 1969 the Hospital was renamed Rosewood Center.  Rosewood Center continues to provide care for the state\'s developmentally disabled citizens.</p>

Anyway, here is more on the Rosewood Center-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The training served another purpose as well, as the Board often displayed an almost obsessive desire to have the asylum be self-supporting. Much of the food was grown or raised on the surrounding farm and virtually all the clothes and table linen were made by the girls. All laundry and cleaning was done by the inmates and their labor was even used during the excavations for new buildings in 1892 and 1900. The farm continued in operation until the 1960s.</p>

<p>An obsessive desire to be self-supporting. That way no one could check up on them, they would be private and using their own funds. If they used other funds, they would be checked on whenever as the money would be the states.</p>

<p>Not to mince words here: we\'re talking about a legal human trafficking operation.

<p>These patients (mostly girls and women, but a few lucky boys were on the roster as well) resided at Rosewood from 5 to 30 years before the onset of faux-liberations.

The patients had no prior knowledge of the writs (court orders) to &quot;check them out&quot; until they were summoned before the court to be released to the custody of people they’d. never. met.</p>

<p>The families of these patients weren’t told about their releases; many, of course, had dumped their unwanted relatives at the facility long before and weren’t likely to care.</p>

<p>In 1889 the Board decided to enlarge the building by adding a dining room wing, exercise room and dormitory space at a cost of $1,849, The design of the addition is attributed to the architect J, Crawford Neilson.

<p>It is, or was 683 acres.
&quot; The buildings at Rosewood exemplify the work of several Maryland architects prominent in the period, including J. Crawford Nielson, Jackson C. Gott, the firm of Ellicott and Emmart, and Henry Powell Hopkins&quot;
The board wanted several buildings.</p>
<p>&quot;Fornal complexes of buildings were seen at the Columbian Exposition in 1893 and in the McMillan COIIIIli.ssion\'s designs for the Mall in Washington, D.C., and were probably influential in the design of Rosewood&quot;</p>
<p>In my opinion, the fact a design from DC was influential in the design is interesting to say the least. 
Gott was dismissed in 1904.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1900, contracts were awarded by the architect to the builder John Cowan for the construction of two new buildings at Rosewood. The first, named Stump Cottage, was built to house seventy-five &quot;high-grade&quot; male patients and was completed in late 1901 at a cost of $20,383.41&quot;</p>
<p>High grade?</p>
<p>&quot;In his place the Board selected the well-known firm of Ellicott and En:mart from Baltimore. William B. Ellicott, the senior member, began professional practice in Portland, Oregon. Joining with William En:mart in 1901, he designed a number of buildings in Baltimore, including St. David\'s Episcopal Church and the Colonial Trust Building. After his retirement in 1917, he worked actively for the establish- ment of a comprehensive Maryland State Plan and is credited as being responsible for the creation by the U.S. Congress in 1926 of the National Capitol Park and Planning Conmission. William En:mart, a native of Baltimore, served as President of the Baltimore Architects Club for IIRilY years before and continued in practice through 1919&quot;
&quot;In 1939 the C. Lyon Rogers Hospital was completed, making it the largest building at Rosewood&quot;</p>
<p>They had a lot of buildings it seems. Including a pig shed, incinerator and more.</p>

            In 1889 the Board decided to enlarge the building by adding a dining room wing, exercise room and dormitory space at a cost of $1,849, The design of the addition is attributed to the architect J, Crawford Neilson. When Pembroke Cottage was completed in f892, the male patients were moved out of Gundry Cottage into the new building Gundry remained a girls dormitory for most of its history,

           It is, or was 683 acres.
" The buildings at Rosewood exemplify the work of several Maryland architects prominent in the period, including J. Crawford Nielson, Jackson C. Gott, the firm of Ellicott and Emmart, and Henry Powell Hopkins"
The board wanted several buildings.

           "Fornal complexes of buildings were seen at the Columbian Exposition in 1893 and in the McMillan COIIIIli.ssion's designs for the Mall in Washington, D.C., and were probably influential in the design of Rosewood"
          </p>
          <p>
           In my opinion, the fact a design from DC was influential in the design is interesting to say the least. 
Gott was dismissed in 1904.

           "In 1900, contracts were awarded by the architect to the builder John Cowan for the construction of two new buildings at Rosewood. The first, named Stump Cottage, was built to house seventy-five "high-grade" male patients and was completed in late 1901 at a cost of $20,383.41"
          </p>
          <p>
           High grade?
          </p>
          <p>
           "In his place the Board selected the well-known firm of Ellicott and En:mart from Baltimore. William B. Ellicott, the senior member, began professional practice in Portland, Oregon. Joining with William En:mart in 1901, he designed a number of buildings in Baltimore, including St. David's Episcopal Church and the Colonial Trust Building. After his retirement in 1917, he worked actively for the establish- ment of a comprehensive Maryland State Plan and is credited as being responsible for the creation by the U.S. Congress in 1926 of the National Capitol Park and Planning Conmission. William En:mart, a native of Baltimore, served as President of the Baltimore Architects Club for IIRilY years before and continued in practice through 1919"
"In 1939 the C. Lyon Rogers Hospital was completed, making it the largest building at Rosewood"
          </p>
          <p>
           They had a lot of buildings it seems. Including a pig shed, incinerator and more.

            I think we can learn a lot from these historical examples.  For example, your point about being self-funded so no one could check on them.  And the idea that people were dumped there and relatives didn't check on them and the families were not told when they were released to non-relatives.  We are seeing these kinds of things at play today with foster children.  Thanks for a great post!
