            There may be more story in the case of the Oakland Fire captain.  It seems he was a whistleblower who recommended in January shutting down a halfway house that was operating under hazardous conditions. He was ignored, and the house continued to operate. A fire occurred in March, resulting in the death of 4 and displacement of 80 people.  Oakland is notoriously corrupt. It wouldn't surprise me CP was planted to shut the captain up about something.  You may remember, that was the city that had the 16 year old girl who was passed around among several police officers, one of whom committed suicide.  I'm not apologizing for the guy. If it was his CP, I hope he fries. But if it wasn't, someone else needs to. At least we know he's not going anywhere until the trial. I will be keeping track of this story.

             I have seen firemen in Sarasota taking boxes of semi burnt items into their private residence before. There is a lot of corruption in the union. He could have an ulterior motive for wanting the halfway house closed and set fire to it himself, since he would be in charge of cause of fire.

             Yeah, I saw that where he was sending emails to the Fire Marshal about unsafe conditions and was being ignored. Doesn't sound like a guy who would be involved with child pornography but appearances (with sexually addicted individuals) can be deceiving. Maybe they should be checking everyone at the firehouse that has PCs on site (lot of down time to browse while you're making 300K/yr)
            </p>
            <p>
             They found the incriminating evidence at the firehouse but it was in his personal computer that he carried from his home to work. He allegedly sent 200 images to an undercover sheriff's deputy. The fire station is across from the Alameda Co. Family Justice Center: "The Alameda County Family Justice Center is made up of over 30 onsite and over 50 offsite agencies and programs that provide services and support to individuals and families who have experienced domestic violence, sexual assault and exploitation, child abuse, elder and dependent adult abuse, and stalking."
            </p>
            <p>
             I agree that pedophile accusations against prominent individuals need to be closely scrutinized for any hidden agendas.

            High level? More like small fish.
Pedosta is still cooking risotto. Hell will freeze over before he ever gets behind bars.

             I don't think it's realistic to expect take-downs at the upper level until we get the cabal into a checkmate position... keep tabs on the network, prevent leaks/early warnings/flight risks... I hope there is some kind of law passed that removes extradition limits and then another that eliminates statutes of limitation when it comes to anything related to harming children. That would be a clear sign of the house of cards coming down hard.

              ofc it's not realistic when the law clearly is on their side. the police is on their side and all kinds of politicians are in on this and you are waiting for what? new laws? are your purposely trying to make me laugh? i'm sorry but at this point i've got nothing but contempt for the entire system. 
we will not get to a checkmate position. pizzagate is over. they won. they declared it fake news and people listened. 
it's really fucking sad but i don't see a legal way out of this clusterfuck.

               Also, btw, there are multiple proposed changes to the litigation regarding statutes of limitation that specifically deal with the abuse of children. So... sorry for making you laugh earlier, but this isn't out of the realm of possibilities.

                Alright man you keep waiting for something good to happen. You can't change a corrupt system by abiding the rules. "You ask me to go living with the pigs, but I can’t go live with pigs and then not get dirty."
