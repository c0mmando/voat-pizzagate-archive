            I was thinking that too...I think it just comes down to some sort of organizational strategy moving forward. Separating tactics, research, and strategy.

            There is so much to this that anything that is outside of your area of interest is going to be a distraction.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that the corporate media has been focusing on Comet Ping Pong makes me think that it's not that important in the big picture.
Likewise the deletion of articles about Norway makes me think that the Norwegian government's connection to the Clinton Foundation and the timing of their drop in financial commitment is very significant. The resignation of New Zealand's John Key may well be due to NZ's connection to the Clinton Foundation as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            The paradigm shift is only getting started, the Pope talking about corprophagia is extraordinary, this will lead to the end of the Roman Catholic Church.
           </p>
           <p>
            Best strategy IMO is not to get overwhelmed by the details, focus on your area of interest, and share your conclusions across multiple media platforms.
           </p>
           <p>
            Edit: Don't forget about John Podesta, the fact that he's gone AWOL means he's a major player IMO.

             Agreed. A firm footing in dialectic and discussion has proven to the life blood of the group. And even where PG is dismissed as insane, the methodology cannot be refused in the larger court of public opinion. It's enough to single out a figure and prove their culpability, one at a time, and eventually there will be a cascading effect.

            I've said several times pizzagate needs to go into silent mode. People need to be looking at everything not just pedo rings.

            This post did a great job connecting the dots from another perspective.

              Then they would end up looking like conspiracy theorists while we go on to a deep silent running mode reopening after 5 days with a bombing of factual information. If we hold back, collect, build and then post, they can't down vote 100 posts per hour. And we can each revue to ensure the posts are fact based and up vote each others.

               Not sure about the 5day-cycle but that makes sense. I think we're already working with that mind frame. Getting info seems to be a priority. Putting in the effort and time is the only way to deal with info - post by post. Be willing to examine down-voted posts and process the info for yourself. Hopefully the cream rises and gets folded into next cycle of research. I doubt we're outnumbered so the up to down ratio should be at least partially organic. But we have to constantly be auditing the process so nothing gets missed.

               I'm sort of already running on silent while I see the nyt burn itself out. I post
               <br/>
               older stories connecting political figures to pedophile rings or general corruption. Using older articles from the same news site that's dismissing it. The Russian fake news narrative is only further discrediting mainstream. So, I inform who I can on relevant evidence about PG where I can and then attack the use of language and the meta-narrative in the "news" when I'm in dark mode. If that makes sense.

                They have the advantage there as they are an organized conspiracy. Where we are an anarchist system.

                Left or right wing, we are all becoming right wing anarchists. We need to get back to a more centrist or even slightly left wing system of our own.

                 Apolitical, unpredictable attacks will win this I think. The left-right paradigm is dissolving so don't buy into propping it up. Let people lie and then counter after they've committed to an indefensible position.

                  I'm referring to left right paradigm in the literal sense of left=heavily controlled and right=anarchist.

                  You are correct, there is an advantage to our individualism like a tape worm, we can't be cut up and killed off, only multiply. For them, if we find the head of the dragon, or heads, we can slay them.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So we need to form a swarm or hive mentality where we are still individuals but organized and coordinated at the same time.

                   That's what this is. As it evolves I think it will break into: development, tactics, strategy, and meta fields that interrelate. The key critical mass though.

            I agree 100%.  Like the anon said, focus on the CF!  I agree PG is real, but look at all the people that have put so much good effort in on here on PG, and we may not know til after January 20, if anything can or will be done about it.  I wish I could do more to help, so I am definitely not criticizing.  I just think they partly haven't taken down all of their incriminating IG posts and images, because maybe it's not the biggest fish in the ocean?

             That's my fear. PG is audacious at a glance too, so it might be the easiest to defend against prosecution. People simply won't want to believe. That's why I stress conversation with anyone willing to talk about anything incriminating, especially proven and prosecuted thing.

             As for trump, I think it doesn't matter - if we assume he is no help, and focus on informing the public in a controlled and incessant way, the victory will come from slowly removing the power these people have. If that makes sense. It's think all,this needs is more and more sunlight.
