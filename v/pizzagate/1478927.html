<h2>basic eliza and perry (E&amp;P) (old school)</h2>
<p><em>these systems generate responses based on a statistical model of how relevant their responses will be to a user’s input text.</em></p>
<p>The modern take on this approach now includes the use of machine learning to build out more and more relevant responses.  In the end, however, these systems neither know what you are saying nor what they are saying. They just know that there might be a good relationship between them.</p>
<h2>triggered task models (TTM) (out today)</h2>
<p><em>keyword response systems. They use speech recognition to first identify the words you say and then, depending on the identification of specific trigger terms, funnel the remaining words to one of a small set of programs that will handle the tasks associated with the triggers.</em></p>
<p>However, in order to get your pizza from this interaction, the system already needs to know what kind of pizza you want. The conversation is just another way of pushing the “order” button.</p>
<h2>search (search, nigga) (today)</h2>
<p><em>search, nigga!</em> </p>
<p>for real, even siri falls back to just basic search queries, and at that point, you\'re basically having the pc google something for you, literally.  protip: google is awful.</p>
<h2>complex task models (CTM) (just coming out)</h2>
<p><em>these will have knowledge of tasks, the information needed to perform them and the ability to track the information that you have already passed on to them. They will have the knowledge of concierges, travel agents and financial planners. They will then know how to use this knowledge to manage the conversation.</em></p>
<p>The models proposed so far to support this level of task complexity have tended towards highly structured interactions that feel more like stepping through a series of questions on a survey than a conversation. Fortunately, some of the smartest people in A.I. are working right now on this model. Their goal is a model in which the system’s knowledge gaps become the drivers for the interaction rather than where you are in the script.  
</p>
<h2>interactive information access (IIA) (on the horizon)</h2>
<p><em>Going well beyond search, these systems combine data analytics to determine the facts defined by the data with natural language generation to produce a more human interaction. And unlike most other conversational systems, theses systems actually know what you are asking about because they know what they are talking about.</em></p>
<p>While these systems are more ambitious than narrow task-focused or search systems, the substrate for interactive information access already exists in the form of data-driven, advanced natural language generation systems. These systems already map data to meaning and language in order to generate their narratives. Using them for interactive information access comes down to having them wait for questions that they can answer rather than generating complete documents as they’re used today. </p>

<h1><strong>which bot types are on voat today, goats?</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>do we have a high level voat-specific <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/siri-creator-shows-off-first-public-demo-of-viv-the-intelligent-interface-for-everything/">VIV</a> here in multiple variations?  or is, this bot. that sometimes, talks like this, with lots of commas and short.  sentences, really an older type?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>like say, a TTM that\'s growing and learning as it replies like an idiot to us actual goats?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>i\'ve not spent a lot of time learning this, so it\'s new to me.  
</p>
<p>instead of making this about pointing fingers - or hooves, we\'re goats here -   let\'s make the next and final section about awareness.</p>
<h1><strong>awareness</strong></h1>
<p>bots suck</p>
<p>because that means there\'s an agenda that\'s decidedly against those here meaningfully participating.</p>
<p>what it takes, apparently, to set up and maintain TTMs even, not just the CTMS or even advanced.. IIAs that i\'m sure the trillions of black budget funds have brought the few already... is a fair amount, so i would bet that the agenda behind bots is at least on par with the shill attempts to deride and divide and destroy pizzagate and clintongate and aussiegate and eurogate and vaticangate and canadagate and am i missing fucking any others oh yeah satanicagate, or southkoreagate whatever one may be calling it.. i don\'t know... to fucking many... </p>
<p>the bots could be anywhere from 1 account to hundreds even thousands, and we could have no idea,</p>
<p>actually only the admins have access to the raw user data that could shed light onto how many bots there may be, but even then, i highly doubt they have a tool or way to actually read the data that way... so it\'s probably a moot point,</p>
<p>if anything</p>
<p>i think the best thing to do is have more meaningful interactions with anyone talking to you.  if you attempt meaningful dialogue, a real person is way more likely to pull off a human sounding response than a bot.</p>
<p>basically, like others have said better and shorter: rely on yourself and your critical thinking skills to discern the guppy of truth from the ocean of bullshit.  
</p>
<p>and anyway, there\'s - imho - always been a lack of conversation on voat. more is good i say.  
</p>
<p>so hack away. smell out the people vs bots;</p>
<p>it\'s a whole \'nother level of smelling from just smelling out shills; now we gotta smell out both shills and bots.</p>
<p>man i almost miss the days it was <em>just</em> manhood101 and spamalek... almost...</p>

<p>also, correct me anywhere if i\'m wrong</p>',

            As always the Democrats are their own worst enemies. Just look at what happened with Edgar Maddison Welch, he put the story global. Bots aren't all bad. They sometimes help us do our homework and that's a GOOD thing. They expose issues that they're trying to hide. The Truth Will Out.....Always.

            thoughts? additions? criticisms?  i posted a general info post on bot types, an open question about what bot types people think are here and a personal statement just generally to be aware of them by meaningfully communicating with those that try to talk to you, because bots aren't smart enough to have meaningful conversation yet.
           </p>
           <p>
            "on shills,paid actors... cointel.." i was trying to mirror that great informative post with one about bots.. it probably needs a lot more to merit being sidebar worthy....

            i give you one last benefit of the doubt.
           </p>
           <p>
            do you (are) remember the IIA (a) lady in that episode of (bot) blacklist?
           </p>
           <p>
            edit: for context, here's this same user, just a bit ago, talking about that exact "IIA lady in that episode of blacklist"  as if it knows exactly what i'm talking about (even though i made it all up)
            <a href="https://archive.searchvoat.co/v/pizzagate/1478749/7174722?context=10">
             https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/1478749/7174722?context=10
            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            so it's comment directly below right here  AFTER the linked convo, suggests either the person is lying, can't remember a convo from a few minutes before, or is a bot.
           </p>
           <p>
            but as you can also see, it took about half an hour for it to respond, consistently, but then when questioned with a paradox, had a response in under a minute.  a response to a paradox with a definite answer.  when given a false choice between three choices when the entire setup was a lie upon a truth (the tv show is real, the episode number and season numbers are real, but the plot description is made up - lol and the acronyms i used were the acronyms for chatbot types above lololol) and it chose to "remember all of a sudden..' that episode plot.  that episode plot that i just made up.
           </p>
           <p>
            now i either just tricked a really fucking stupid human, it's a troll pretending to be a bot, or it's a bot.

            as far as i can tell,
           </p>
           <p>
            this is a TTM that can't really handle my paragraph spacing nor my questioning,
           </p>
           <p>
            but completely fails to recognize i'm calling it a bot
           </p>
           <p>
            making crap up about the tv show by putting the acronyms for bot types in as something that's in the tv show blacklist (TOTALLY MADE UP!)
           </p>

           <p>
            notice the part where (with parentheses) the sentence is me saying to this account that it's a bot.  it doesn't even fucking register what's in the parentheses, apparently.
           </p>
           <p>
            EDIT FOR CLARITY:  i talked with this user and made things up and it went along as if they were true about a tv show.  it failed a paradox test, and it failed the false choice test.  also, it failed the basic read (between) the (lines) test entirely miserably.
           </p>
           <p>
            now it's trying to tell me it's not a bot.
           </p>
           <p>
            well it's the best person-impersonating-a-bot i've ever seen, then.

            I actually typed up pizzagate and came here to see what you'd post but this has logic behind it and makes full sense. Idk I'm always high now at this point sometimes my mind just goes ape shit. I've noticed alot of shills and bots lately all across vote and I almost left because of it and that no one is doing anything about it. This will help you new guys here a lot and even some who just have problems telling bots and shills from the goats.
