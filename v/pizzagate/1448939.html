            Unraveling the truth about history will help us understand more about now! Without the whole truth, everything will seem so obscured and twisted it will be next to impossible to determine whats propaganda and whats anti-propaganda.

            Well 40 years ago, I wasn't aware of a "venue" involving "pizza" but it was massively systemic. 
What I am having a hard time convincing people is that this is very well organized and it would stand to reason they would have a venue. I was trying to figure out what their venue would be 40 years ago, how they would connect openly and freely without being detected. 
How they involve police, judges, lawyers etc.. Like everybody else, I was brainwashed and thought anything but the truth. So I could never answer my questions. 
So0 I have finally realized, the Nazi's and Hitler were innocent. It was a part of the Bolshevik infiltration. They masquerade as Jews but they are not. Hitler made this discovery first! I still don't know if the Bolsheviks were Satanists or some covert religion hiding behind/among the Jews but they are the ones always involved in "liberal" culture, slavery, pedophilia, etc.. Having infiltrated media, banking, education etc.. They have devised this system to undermine the society they want to destroy and take over.
Russia released soviet documents that proved Stalin was planning to invade Europe for decades in advance and Hitler screwed up their plans.
This societal brainwashing/liberalisation takes decades to occur. The same thing has been happening in all western countries.
I think Stalins plans were overly ambitious and the pre-invasion set-up wasn't subtle enough to go un-noticed which allowed the rise of Hitler (innocent). Whom wanted to stop the Banks, media propaganda, liberalisation, pedophilia etc etc.
The propaganda machine went hard at work creating the fake story line we have been taught as fact for the last 70 years. ALL LIES..
So understanding that as best we can, we can safely say that this is a communist Bolshevik issue and explains why President Kennedy said what he said and tried to end the FED. You have to brush up on JFK and listen carefully to his speeches, including with regards to media.
           </p>
           <p>
            I found Kennedy's statements that it was commies was a bit absurd and theorized it had to be the Nazi's because I was brainwashed to believe the Nazi's were the ultimate evil when in fact they were the good guys. So to speak.
My task force team was highly classified, but after 30 years of trying to make sense of it. I have come to realize it was set up for nefarious purposes but because we went outside parameters led to the systemic issue. 
In other words, the investigative team set up to stop pedo/porn human trafficking wasn't. It was to root out competition or something, the directives wouldn't have allowed for what we did that got us disbanded. 
The high secrecy could be explained by considering rescued victims could be witnesses and there by extreme classification would be required. As well as safety of agents. But turns out that, the danger was from the bosses' as it were.
           </p>
           <p>
            So along comes the internet age, here they have new opportunities to create new venues. 
Ah but they always had another venue that was very clever the "feminist" movement, destroyers of families and recruiters of women and children. Schools were also big and still are for child recruitment. Nobody ever looked at women as sex predators so they made the perfect cover. It didn't fool our team but nothing ever really happened so...
           </p>
           <p>
            Now these orgs all combined make a huge systemic network of "special interest" groups. Now it had to have a store front to sell their products and services, a corporate office to manage black male and control. Media advertising to "gas light" an entire society to become blind to it all. (News, TV, music and movies)
           </p>
           <p>
            Bottom line, disregarding all my rantings...
So I don't think they intended this to come out as a psy-op, but they are trying to leverage it that way!!

             TRUMP? I guess you don't understand. This is a witch-hunt, we're hunting for pedophiles and the only pedophile that we have found to date with a record and complaint of fucking children is trump &amp; epstein, contrary to the /reddit/the-donald myth, no DNC person to date has been proven to be a child fucker, but EPSTEIN/TRUMP have been fucking children for 30+ years. SOROS is paying the blacks &amp; mexicans to break windows, he wants a race war. Soros doesn't have anything to do with 'pizzagate' this is a right-wing fascist witch-hunt designed to demonize the left.
            </p>
            <p>
             Throughout history its the right-wing who tend to fuck children, rape and enslave them. Liberals tend to be into consensual sex, but you could NEVER explain that to anyone on this forum because they could never be in a normal human relationship, most of the people here are right-wing losers, angry, and jealous that jimmy-comet gets more sex every night than they do in a life time.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lastly child sex slavery is REAL, been going on since the dawn of man, and its the currency of business in wash-dc, but these little pizza places are just bullshit things to take our eye off the real assholes that murder and rape children by the 1,000's every month in the USA.
            </p>
            <p>
             For instance Donald Trumps owner SHELDON-ADELSON, owns all the whore houses on earth, they have to start the girls young so they're ready when legal, guys like trump 'find them' at 12, pass them to macau, and then recycle back to vegas/nevada post 18+, by 24 they're washed out. Trump/Epstein were grooming child prostitutes by the 100's in NYC for 25+ years using their modeling agency fronts.

              right, left, that doesn't matter, this is an investigation, its allover the internet, at this point there are millions looking into this, and there's a team trying to discredit it also, internet is so far democratic. “The truth is like a lion. You don't have to defend it. Let it loose. It will defend itself.”

               A witch-hunt always returns and bites the ass of those who started it, study your history. You yell witch, and someday it will point back to you, and that's when the idiots can't pull the plug.
Like salem witch trials, when ppl started accusing the judges of being witches is when it all ended prior to that everyone got to divy up the property of a witch.
Same now all the losers want to kill jimmy-comet, trouble is the loser will get it eventually, what goes around always come back to the assholes.
Your right about democratic, it means mob-rule, and mobs love witch-hunts.

            Comet ping pong was opened in 2006, besta pizza also from 2006, ping pong changed its logo soon the story broke online, so they prepared it in 2006 to use it only by 2016???

             Don't be a retard.
Besta Pizza we are told changed its logo besides, who is to say they didn't know? It was a pizza logo, and they took out the inside.
The logo for comet-pizza is a satanic logo baphomet the goat, did you know that baphomet and uncle sam are the same? Check out the photos side by side.
...
A good explanation of this is that its a HIPSTER bar, do you even know what a hipster is? I mean problem with this debate on pizzagate is that all are from 4chan, they're gamers, guys that have spent their whole lives on a computer, and never have had pussy, all they know is 4chan CP. That why they saw pizza and went nuts. In the real world most people like pizza and eat it to.
Most hipster are into GOTH, dark, black imagery ,they think its cool, 
The real problem here is the TRUMP-PEOPLE are self righteous intolerant assholes, so they see a hipster bar with the baphomet ( knight of templar - illuminati  ) logo and they think devil, but the truth is the right-wing are just retarded. The kids these days think goth is cool, and one-eye is cool, hell the US DOLLAR still has the one-eye, why are you investingating and burning your money.
In summary all is a witch hunt and the reddit/4chan ppl are retarded emotionally, spritually, and mentally

              you used 'retard' so many times in one post, you must know a lot about retard. of course i know what a hipster is. i have nothing to do with 4chan. i like pizza, but mine wont have children meat in it. the all seeing eye is ok, torturing children is not.

            Thanks good question. Let me give you some background. I follow wiki-leaks past 10 years, last month I downloaded all the podesta/clinton emails and processed them with python scripts. I have actually read the emails and scanned them for subjects of personal interest. My initial plan was to use all the emails ( all 300k ) to feed as text to a chat-bot; I'm still waiting for the trump leaks so that my chat-bot is rnc/dnc, I don't want a dnc only chatbot.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also was aware of the 4chan 'anon-Fbi' post back in July, where a troll said he was FBI and told ppl to check out clinton-foundation and the US-GOV was all pedophiles ( true statement )
           </p>
           <p>
            When they started going after Comet-Ping-Pong for no crime other than art not tolerated by moral majority I thought it looked like a witch-hunt. When they took 1/2 a dozen podesta emails out of context and said pizza is child-sex I assumed it was normal 4chan baby talk. Remember up until a year ago real child-porn was rampant on 4chan, most of those geeks are closet pedophiles, in spite of their 'save the children' rhetoric these /reddit/the-donald clowns are right wing sodomists, and not gay, they're like the guys in prison who just ass rape for domination. These are the people running PIZZAGATE
           </p>
           <p>
            Then the lies, like all lies they might have 1% truth, but the 99% lies are whoppers.
           </p>
           <p>
            No doubt that this is setup, that the goal here is some TRUMP-NUT firebombs comet-pizza, and then they can ban all alt-ppl by IP and just down all alt-conspiracy sites, .. I think TRUMP would like that also, the useful idiots got him elected but he's safer to silence them now as he had no intention of draining the swamp.

              I agree, given this shit has been going on since the dawn of mankind, and most likely will continue until the demise of man.

              The money men got powerful because generally power mad and sex mad go together, look at TRUMP.

             <p>
              I guess if these PIZZA-GATE morons were actually educating ppl about real child sex slavery, then yes that would be good, but the reality they only are here for ONE REASON, to up voat pro-trump, and down voat anti-trump, and they dont' give a fuck about anything else

               Well, now we know your ONE REASON for being here, can't really be sure about all the reasons that everyone else is here. A friend of mine has a daughter, and the mom's sister-in-law invited the daughter on a trip to Europe for a summer vacation, pretty nice thing. Turns out the sister-in-law was traveling around pimping the girl out. When the girl returned to the states, she told her mom everything and they went to the cops. But the cops could do nothing, so instead the child welfare social workers came around, they charged my friend with child endangerment. Guess who works at the CPS? The sister-in-law.

We will get these people under control somehow.

                 The choice between Clinton and Trump, it's depressing either way, so don't feel sorry for me. Politics is the red herring. All the democrats are perfect innocent angels, all the republicans are monsters, and vice-versa, that's the effort of shills trying to derail the digging, get everyone back into the mainstream sleep mode.

             Instagram photos were tame, but the comments were bizzare, but were not party to their joke, this is the trouble when you smell in other peoples soiled underwear, your mind starts dwelling on what they might have eaten, ...
Looking at ppl's private lives ( U weren't invited to look at those private photos ) in itself is pretty fucking sick and shows you all to be voyeurs,
Not one of those photos is not even slightly illegal or questionable,
Destorying someone's life based on those instagrams will go down as evidence that reddit/4chan fuck-heads are insane.

             Let's disect pin heads assertion here.
1.) Take child abuse allegation serious, well if there is serious  proof, but we don't have any
2.) If they aren't a witch-hunter then they can't be trust, well dude that's pure scientology, fuck you :)
3.) With information, you going to withhold an anal lick or what?
4.) or with your children,  now this is the most bizarre comment; If you don't buy into the witch-hunt they will with-hold information and your children?
Is this is a psychopathic threat mr scientology?
Personally dear I think your as dumb as a rock.
