<p>Some of you may have heard of the new documentary series on Netflix titled ‘The Keepers’ that was debuted recently. It is about a government-connected pedophile ring that involved the Catholic church and the murder of a woman who was about to come forward to the police with the information of the abuse being committed against the teenage and even younger students.</p>
<p>It is incredibly disturbing but congruent with everything we have been hearing about in regards to leaks from various whistle-blowers and e-mails which I have included below.</p>
<p>I had an instant hit when I heard the testimony in the docu-series about a man named ‘Skippy’ who was involved in Cathy’s murder and lover to one of the men who killed her. I immediately recalled Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta’s leaked e-mails which came out through Wikileaks.org recently.</p>
<p>He was described as a man with brown hair and a mustache.</p>
<p>Thanks to a comment from a reader on this blog they have provided a photo of John Podesta in college, with dark hair and a mustache, just like the in the description from the documentary:</p>

<p>This is Podesta at 20 years old.
He is a Catholic.
If you know the Cathy Cesnic story Skippy is mentioned as a possible helper in the murder.
Apologies if this has been covered already.</p>',

            You must also remember to care for yourself.  I will have no remorse for people that made fun of me and laughed at me and ridiculed me in front of others.  The poor ones will be an exception.  I am so sick and tired of the ones that know everything.  They talk louder than you and over you when you bring up the subject.  Oh, yes, dear, I am sure a little of that goes on.  But the Clintons?  No they could never do that.  OOOOOHHHHHHH!

            Watched the keepers a few weeks ago....I could be wrong but doesn't one of the women on the show describe the guy named skippy...like she saw him 1st hand along with others. What I'm getting at is if the woman on the show (currently alive) saw skippy and is describing his appearance on the show....don't you think she'd be able to say: "ya know what what...looks an awful lot like young John podesta." Again, could be  wrong but I thought one of the skippy witnesses was alive.

            Yes, the cleansing can usually be painful but the aftermath will be like your house after you let in the fresh air.  But I am so worried about the people that will not be strong enough to handle the red pilling for it will be blood red.

            The red pilling is hard enough.  I am so glad it happened a little at a time for me.  I would say since pizzagate started on reddit.  But being a Bernie girl, I was ready to believe almost anything after what they pulled at the Convention.  Many times I want to write or talk about something but cannot, I would dox myself and that is not good.  We all serve a purpose and do what we can.  Yes, they are evil, and I guess our level of trust is what allowed them to get away with their sins.  But they are the ones to blame, not us, for believing in good.   I believe we will be able to find the killers of Seth Rich and this will open that disgusting can of worms.

            Here we go again. The Keepers Skippy has been described as 6'2, black hair, big bushy mustache. Why do the Podesta-did-it  folks omit  descriptions. of  Skippy. .Where is your proof that Podesta  had the nickname Skippy when he was 20yo?  Where is your proof that Podesta is or was a homosexual?

             Also, what is the age and height of the person describing the height. I often remember people from my youth being much taller than they are when I've run into them many years later.

             what about the connection between Bob Wood, Bob Squire and Tony Podesta? It maybe John or not it should not be wiped away, I feel. It's not that anyone of us would know better. So, once again, what about their connection?

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The timeline appears to be very consistent. Almost fits like a glove. During his time in college he helped Eugene McCarthy’s candidacy to the Democratic Party.
Now here is a timeline that would have put McCarthy and the Podesta brothers in the Washington D.C. area at the time of Cathy’s murder. Just to note it is only a 30-40 minute drive from D.C. to Baltimore

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             In the docu-series there is another man who was in Maskell’s office that participated in the abuse and traumatization of the students called Brother Bob. In this interview above there are two men named Bob; Bob Wood and Bob Squire, both are dead now. They were both heavily involved in politics and both had close ties to the presidents/candidates of their time.
Tony Podesta had contact with both of them.
