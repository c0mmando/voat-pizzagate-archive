            I just read his Wikipedia page. 
He was a conservative investigative journalist and the first to investigate Bill Clinton's past which ultimately led to the Paul Jones lawsuit and almost ended Clinton's presidency.  He then went on to write the seduction of hillary clinton which was supposed to be the final journalistic blow to the Clinton's but it ended up being fair towards Hillary.  He started leaning left apparently the conservatives made him a liar and distorter.  In 2004 founded media matters and by 2016 was working with Hillary...Correct the Record super pac.  He failed.
Wtf....
Did he purposely sabotage her?

             No - it's well rumored that the Clintons likely paid him off to join their side during his time researching HRC.
             <br/>
             From that point on he joined the DNC and has had money coming from top DNC donors ever sense.

            Pro: So since Brock is a secret finder/blackmailer, and he is listed as living with Alefante, the 49th most powerful man in washington, how did he get that power? How does a gay pizza shop guy get an audience with Obama at the white house?
           </p>
           <p>
            Con: But who the hell would ever trust Brock? to be stupid enough to compromise themselves and give him any blackmail ammo.

            This is a conundrum in my theory.

             It's not that people even have to trust Brock. He has power because he knows secrets. (ie he has blackmail + money ) 
Actually your question might have solved a bigger piece of the puzzle.
            </p>
            <p>
             When he was a conservative journalist - Brock floated around DC as a gay man and found out about Republicans who were gay by floating through the DC club scene. 
Now as a liberal organizer ,  he might be doing the same by hosting pedophile parties that attract various members of the government.

              If someone knows blackmail about you and threatens to reveal it - you have two options  a) allow it to become public   b )  negotiate 
In small time blackmail you pay money. In big time , you give them money + secrets about other people.  It's like a blackmail pyramid scheme.

           <blockquote>
            <p>
             The defendant's testimony at trial, however, conflicted with portions of these particulars. He denied going to Friendly's with the victim. He testified that after the two men engaged in sex, he briefly left his apartment with permission to use the victim's automated teller machine (ATM) card, and returned shortly before 5:00 P.M. with cash and alcohol. The defendant testified that when he entered his apartment, he saw the victim appear to be downloading child pornography onto the defendant's laptop computer, and he "went off." He described hitting the victim with his hands and probably his fists, as well as with a bottle of alcohol and a cellular telephone. As he was being struck, the victim grabbed his clothes and fled the apartment, with the defendant following behind him, throwing things at him as he made his way out of the building.

             This case is in  Massachusets.    The date of filing fits with the news stories about Brock and Gray.    I wonder if the computer described in the lawsuit was searched for child porn.  Friendlys on Sumner Ave is in Springfield, Mass.  Using Intelius, I cannot find any William Gray/Grey or David Brock with addresses in both Springfield and DC.    The apartment could be in another name.  I searched Hampden County real estate records for Grey/Gray and Brock, and came up empty handed.  It's also hard to believe David  Brock would drive to a Friendly's It does seem to be very coincidental.

            The real story is pedophilia.
Its been ran by the CIA &amp; FBI for 60+ years.

Glad to see you all admitting that alefantis is a nobody, at best just one of Brocks fuck-boys,

             Alefantis spoke with someone yesterday on Facebook explaining why he is the 48/49 powerful person in DC.

             2 )  It depends on your definition of fuckboy?
             <br/>
             If there is truth to any of this ( I'm not sure there is) , the person is organized and dangerous. Child Traffickers are almost always affiliated with major gangs and not the lower "street" tier.  At best 10% of the major US / Latin gangs get involved with Trafficking because the association w/ child prostitution could be used against them.

            <p>
             3 ) To be fair ,  lower market magazines work with PR &amp; people who advertise to come up with these selections.  The magazine's ranking makes him seem important but he could have easily bought a year's worth of ads or had a relationship with someone at the magazine (or both ) and that's how it went down

              Please THINK they got HILLARY CLINTON rated #10, and at that time she was secretary of state the most powerful job in the world, please the GQ rating was 100% bullshit, also NO WHERE else did anybody ever mention him as having power. He was BROCK's FUCK-BUDDY, nothing more.
NOW BROCK is powerful, he was running clinton's campaign why isn't he mentioned? Because they couldn't find anything on him and went after his boyfriend this is how they do it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regards to planning, this was all put together by Cass Sunstein in 2006, ten years ago. To shut down the internet to conspiracy theory.
...
Boytoy fuck-boy its all the same, here's something to chew on, back when they were actively dating the comet-pizza was in the black, for the past two years the comet-pizza is in the RED, today its almost bankrupt. My guess is that BROCK was the sugar daddy to Alefantis and now the sugar bowl is empty.
I think team trump at /reddit/the_donald who invented this meme who absolutely HATE CTR (BROCK) they went after the fuck-boy to fuck BROCK, but they didn't have the balls to go after BROCK dirrectly.
...
Fuck the GQ rating, its just a fucking joke, its for social people in DC. Note that nobody else in DC ever said Alefanits had power, one little social news source. 
One of the main memes of the reddit/4chan pizzagate faux-fuck is that ALEFANTIS is the most powerful person in DC again this was all to drive BROCK crazy, the idea that his fuck-boy was HIGHER up the PEDO chain than him, this is how the CIA mind fucks people.

               A) It's not a popular magazine. 
B ) Power lists everywhere are created by PR Machines.

               Focus on Brock.  He's the one spinning everything. 
IMO he's killing the messenger by calling the investigators racists / homophobes / KKK / alt right etc. 
This is what happened to the LA Police in OJ's trial and many trials after that.

                Yes this is what I have been saying  for almost a MONTH, that focusing on comet pizza is BULLSHIT, the guy flips pizza, if he had power he would have a day job, and insult to injury since BROCK broke up with him his business has been facing bankruptcy for two years. Which is another reason he's desperate for a lawsuit, I'm sure the contingency lawyers are lined out to the steps knowing this thing is a rain-maker. A jones better have DEEP liability insurance for libel.
               </p>
               <p>
                Yes power lists don't mean shit, like richest men in the world from FORBES which lists billionaires, but NOBODY on earth every lists the TRILLIONARIES Rothschild, BUSH, Windsor,...
Yep lists are for minions, the powerful would prefer not to be on a list.
