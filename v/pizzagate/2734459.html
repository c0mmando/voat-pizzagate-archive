             His influence in the community was a focus
             <strong>
              of many of Laura Knoblach's immediate family members, who have repeatedly tried to keep her from going public
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             While her parents weren't interviewed for the investigation, the case file does included interviews with other members of Laura Knoblach's close family, including her maternal grandmother, Ellen Hughes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Hughes told investigators she never noticed anything out of the ordinary with her son-in-law Jim and his children.
            </p>
            <p>
             But in emails between Laura Knoblach and her grandmother included in the case file,
             <strong>
              Hughes told her that her father is an important figure in the community and she should consider how speaking out about his behavior will impact his ability to do his work.
             </strong>
            </p>

             </strong>
             Hughes wrote to her granddaughter.
             <strong>
              "But you, yourself, will be the greatest loser in the long term. You will lose your family."

              Not sure. I think they are taking it into account, and opt for protecting their own reputation, and maybe - in case of the mothers - their financial security. They just don't care for their daughters / granddaughters enough. Sadly.

            <p>
             Growing up in the St. Cloud area, Laura Knoblach attended St. Cloud Christian school, a private school
             <strong>
              where she confided in a teacher.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The teacher provided investigators with a copy of a note
             <strong>
              he wrote to the school principal
             </strong>
             on Jan. 30, 2013, about allegations Laura Knoblach made against her father about him showing affection to her in ways that made her feel uncomfortable. A copy of that note is in the case file.
            </p>
            <p>
             The school's public financial records show Jim Knoblach served on the school board from 2007 to 2011 and as board treasurer in 2011.

              a youth pastor of Laura Knoblach told law enforcement that she confided in him between 2011 and 2012 that her father made her very uncomfortable

             The file also includes interviews with three friends and a cousin who Laura Knoblach confided in at various points about her father's behavior.
             <strong>
              She also told a school teacher about what was going on, as well as a local youth ministry leader at her church in St. Cloud.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Laura Knoblach's cousin, Isabelle Hughes, talked to investigators and agreed to be interviewed by MPR News.
             <strong>
              Hughes said her cousin confided in her when she was in fifth grade and Laura Knoblach was in eighth grade, about a decade ago.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              She said Laura Knoblach told her that Jim Knoblach was touching and kissing her inappropriately, but asked her cousin not to tell anyone because her parents told her not to tell anyone.

             Laura Knoblach's case file reveals she reached out to various people throughout her life to express concerns about her father's behavior,
             <strong>
              including her mother, Janet Knoblach
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             On several occasions, Laura Knoblach said she told her mother that her father was making her feel uncomfortable, but that her mother usually shrugged it off, saying Jim didn't grow up with sisters and implying he didn't understand how to interact with girls.
            </p>
            <p>
             The case file shows that Janet Knoblach, through an attorney, declined to talk with investigators.

             That’s the difference between those of us with ethics, principles, and morality and those without. We have no problem identifying evil regardless of political/philosophical orientation. The ends do not justify the means.
