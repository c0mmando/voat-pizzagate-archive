Or not a coincidence as she was an IVF baby and may have been...oh never mind.)
Anyway. Back to David\'s video. Usually when you look at the comments (as I have been for over ten years), most of them are from fans, very positive in nature and generally respectful. In the last two weeks, however, shills have absolutely flooded his comments section with negative, disparaging remarks, one after the other, in an very obviously contrived way. I have never seen this happen before before and I am steaming mad. Soros and his paid minions again. FUCKER.  Hey Soros, if you\'re reading this, your filthy billions can\'t save you anymore. Isn\'t it about time you died? Your supply of young harvested blood containing the Pax 2 gene isn\'t going to last for much longer.  WE KNOW WHAT YOUVE DONE.</p>
