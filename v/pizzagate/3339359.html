His 30-year-old wife, sporting a new hairstyle and at least $75,000 worth of jewelry, watched from the packed gallery. It was likely the last time they will ever see each other since she has been banned from visiting him.

             Is that speculation?  Do you have research on it?
If the tunnels don't get an underground border wall, then we will know Trump wasn't serious. After all, he admired the one Israel just built with U.S. aid money.

            The previous administration was working closely with him. I was in a ghetto store Obama years back and they had all kinds of ghetto hats for sale. (Indian, Paki/other?) Owners got busted not too long after for buying stolen goods. I do have to admire those Oriental/asian/middle eastern guys love for capitalism though. They were selling the baseball caps to the guys affiliated with such cartel. They were then filmed in corner store and identified. That is why so many got deported, and others did not.

            Video shows alleged El Chapo drug tunnel

            OF COURSE, THIS ONE ENDS IN AN ARIZONA WAREHOUSE.
These are sophisticated tunnels with plenty of room for human trafficking.
           </p>
           <p>
            "But then there’s the matter of El Chapo’s most famous smuggling method: tunnels.
Early in the trial, Jesus Zambada García, one of Mr. Guzmán’s top logistics chiefs, told jurors how workers had dug a tunnel in the early 1990s under an innocuous-looking ranch house in Agua Prieta, Mexico, that reached a warehouse in Douglas.
The entrance on the Mexican side, Mr. Zambada said, was hidden under a pool table that could be raised off the ground by hydraulic lifts. The lifts were activated by turning what appeared to be an ordinary garden hose valve in the yard outside.
And the tunnel exit in the warehouse in Arizona?
Remarkably, Mr. Zambada said, it was located only blocks from a local office of Customs and Border Protection."

            </a>
           </p>
           <p>
            "In Guzman’s case, the government’s own witnesses — many of them former Mexican cartel associates — testified that after the government cracked down on smuggling tunnels, they began relying on legal ports of entry to bring drugs into the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Former high-ranking Sinaloa cartel leader Jesus Zambada Garcia testified about Guzman’s use of tunnels in the early 1990s to quickly smuggle drugs such as cocaine into the United States, earning him the nickname “El Rapido,” or “The Fast One.”
           </p>
           <p>
            “(A tunnel) is the most secure way to cross drugs to the US — the easiest way to cross over weapons,” Zambada Garcia testified."

             There are ways to shorten a life sentence (good behavior). The additional 30 years keeps them in.
