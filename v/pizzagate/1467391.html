            That's why they cant do a thing about it. If any one took them to court for some of the things they have pulled. Redit for instance they would be in breach of the first amendment. Spin is all they have.

            Hm, I don't mean to work cynicism in the hand, cause we certainly need to take steps ahead of in anticipation of the blows that we get to endure in the future. I am convinced there are alternative, to keep access to fluent community with focus on pizzagate somewhere unbiasedly. Somewhere that can't be touched and not be deprived from without infringing your civil rights. in which case, this would potentially be taken to the streets (if no other options exists to reason with eventually forces corruption and authoritarianism on a completely what-if basis).
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, there would be a problem 'if' the united stated and the people, under their government, condemn what are deemed minorities from persuading any kind of disagreeable narrative. Not just for the citizens, but also for the cause we're looking to resolve, and as well for the rest of the world, as one would argue a rogue world power high on domination arguably results in possible adversities, theoretically, which is just my  uneducated 'opinion', I reckon.
           </p>
           <p>
            Jokes aside, some level of central organization seems urgent, yes, which doesn't even need explanation in case there were powers thinking of the creation as such as a threat. It becomes self important at that point, so yeah, let's keep this ball rolling with steady commitment toward disclosure, correctness, accountability, and untouchability. (sorry for my english )
           </p>
           <p>
            I personally see that as my duty and responsibility and I would give up a lot to keep committed to that. Thinking about the people who don't even get heard when they scream and cry for help, sure, I'm devoted as heck, and there's lots to do, and lots to learn, tech savvy as I aint.
