<p>The article talks about a Twitter collective called Sleeping Giants, originated by Nathan Phillips, focussed on alerting advertisers that their adds appeared on Breitbart.com.

<p>But then all of a sudden NYtimes blends in \'fake news hucksters\'.

They fail to mention that Jestin Coler in an interview with NPR mentioned that he is a registered democrat and tried to infiltrate the white supremacy/alt-right with creating fake news (NPR Source) <a href="http://archive.is/SN2TB#selection-5089.0-5089.267">http://archive.is/SN2TB#selection-5089.0-5089.267</a> </p>

<p>I think it\'s noteworthy to see NYtimes suggesting strategies to combat fake-news business models, again without mentioning what and who fake exactly is.

            Just FYI, there are no "white supremacists". The people being called this are simply whites who identify as whites and care about the future of white people. That's apparently a big no-no and hence only whites are ever called racists.

            "Sleeping Giants", ha? What an ironic self designation :). The tide of history has turned, and they haven't received the memo. "Sleeping midgets" will soon be a more appropriate name.

            The Pizzagate perps cannot publicly acknowledge pizzagate in any way because there is only circumstantial evidence, so far. This would give credibility and thus would be incriminating. One of their strategies requires the Corporate to have a conscience or a moral code for the display of their ads. I don't think such a thing exists. They are heartless (but legally (in U.S.) they're people). It's putting the moral code or principal (in this case, 'fake news' and 'anti-multiculturalist' ideologies)
            <strong>
             <em>
              over
             </em>
            </strong>
            their bottom line... which wouldn't happen. Seems as if they're flailing about, trying to hit anything... but, yeah, I agree with islandofdelight -- we need to hit them with what they use on us. Conceptual strategies - it's like the military - that's what they're using on us - Critical Theory, Cultural Marxism, Fabian Socialism.
