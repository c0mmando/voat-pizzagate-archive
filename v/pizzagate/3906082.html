<p>Richard Blevins aka Ninja. Who has been on daytime talk shows like Ellen Degeneres\'s and was in New York on CNN at new year\'s (Has gone to Mixer a competing site by Microsoft, some theorize all this drama is a attack on twitch so microsoft/facebook can take over streaming)</p>

<p>The interesting thing about Reckful is he like Ninja is heavily connected to Hollywood and MTV,  Andy Milonakis a goblin jew who has attempted to direct zoomer politics was his close friend</p>
<p>Before passing he had got a 177 million dollar deal for a game that can only be described as crappy 2005 browser game that somehow was made in 2020 <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/q61qfz.jpg">https://files.catbox.moe/q61qfz.jpg</a> pic related</p>
<p>Much like Habbo Hotel and similar games they are usually co-opted by groomers to exploit minors. For someone like Reckful a &quot;competitive gamer&quot; it\'s strange his life dream would be to design a social game for children</p>
<p>I mention these people because they\'re all closely tied to Hollywood and are (((coincidentally))) the top streamers. Another thing to note about twitch is it no longer allows for other sites to inspect for botting and no longer discloses these things themselves. Thus the site is full of bots, a simple google search allows you to buy them and they even spam text at intervals</p>
<p>TLDR: Twitch is a possible haven for groomers, numerous allegations against staff and streamers, their top streamers are jewish and work with hollywood publicity agents.</p>',

            I've heard of streamers using their streams to launder drug money, prostitution money and even gambling money from somewhat credible sources. It's very likely that some of them are working with pedos. Andy Milonakis is very well connected and also has helped out a few sketchy streamers with publicity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a clip of the streamer Ice Poseidon supposedly meeting up with a 13 year old in japan. He had his streamer house raided by the FBI for wire fraud, he tried to create a ponzi scheme, and I've heard rumors of him laundering gambling and coke money. Their house also supposedly had kids' underwear and diapers in it, but that could have just been as a joke or prank for their streams (very suspicious though).

              Right it might be, but where did you get, 4chan? How do you know it's outside his apartment? That clip where he talks about simulation, that window does look like it might be that area but i'm asking how you know\?

             The CEO of the EVO gaming convention is being brought up on multiple allegations all the way back from 2002 when all he did was run a mini putt putt with a arcade
            </p>
            <p>
             Think for a moment, how does some guy who runs a small tournament out of a arcade become the CEO of a multi million dollar gaming convention. Is it because he does a good job? Or hes been abusing kids and had a similar situation to Alefantis going on

              Wow, looks like the gaming community is a haven for pedos. After watching the two vids I listed above, I was surprised to learn that all these young kids are traveling to these gaming conventions without any parental supervision , with alcohol readily available to them too.
