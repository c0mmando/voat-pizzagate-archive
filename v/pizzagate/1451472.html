            That's the video that made me realize this needs to be our next step. Like I said approach a trustworthy channel with a good sized subscriber base with the info gathered on voat. I just know it will work, I can't see how it wont

            Millions of videos with fragmented information and 99% misinformation, in 2 months it will end up like the Flat Earth, Aliens and New World Order, brushed under the carpet as conspiracy fringe nonsense, like every other conspiracy topic on YouTube. We need quality, not quantity.

             It can't all sway in our favor, this is something you must realize. It doesn't matter about how many bad videos are on YouTube with pizzagate, if anything the publicity from it is a win for us as of today. What really matters is getting a good video out to a channel that has 1mil subscribers for example. If this video were to ever go as planned and get like 1-10mil views, we would definitely trend like a fkn boss

              No, you must understand that trending worldwide with misinformation is worse than not trending with 100% facts.

               Who said the video was going to be misleading ? That's the last thing we need. I see where your coming from and I understand how hard everyone on this case has worked. I'm sure we have enough credible sources to put out a video on a popular platform. What's the point of having this information if we aren't putting it somewhere for the world to see. Come on now you can't tell me youtube doesnt have a huge user base. If you know of any other platforms that would be a better option, shoot away.

                I agree it has huge reach but saturation isnt the answer, it has to be a huge bombshell by a large youtube channel that has serious credibility.

               <p>
                Stephen Crowder, Milo Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones, Breitbart and Drudge are probably the best you're going to get until main news corps pick up on reporting.

                 Well there are videos on YouTube that aren't published by either of those people but yet the views are over 100k with a good looking like to dislike ratio. And some of those videos were this week and it's not alex jones but they do okay on informing. I think what you want is a home run on the 1st pitch type of video. If that's the case then a smoking gun would be what your looking for .
