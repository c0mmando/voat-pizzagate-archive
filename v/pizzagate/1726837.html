            This is a legitimate question, indeed. There are books if you care to read them. A quick study is this: Hillary's maternal grandmother was raised very strictly in California and Hillary's mother was raised similarly.

            "Her childhood has been described as Dickensian.[6][7][8] The family lived as boarders in a crowded house.[6] The parents were dysfunctional and unhappy[7] and prone to sometimes violent fights;[6] they moved Dorothy among various schools,[3] and paid only sporadic attention to the children before divorcing in 1927.[4]
           </p>
           <p>
            The children were then sent on a train by themselves, unsupervised (Dorothy was eight, Isabelle younger), to live with their paternal grandparents in the Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra, California.[3][7][9] The sisters endured harsh and unloving treatment from their grandparents.[7][10] The grandmother favored black Victorian dress and punished the girls for trifling acts.[11] After Dorothy was caught trick-or-treating during one Halloween, an activity the grandparents forbade, she was confined to her room for an entire year except for attending school, and was not even allowed to eat in the kitchen or play in the yard.[7][10]"

            Hillary's father had entered politics briefly and thereafter hated the Democrat Party ---- "Rodham finished fifth out of eight candidates with only 382 votes, or 1.5 percent of the total votes cast.[9] According to some family members, this episode led to his strong dislike of the Democratic Party for the rest of his life." -- He moved to Arkansas when Bill was governor, and tried to get Bill to change his political party. Hugh Rodham died 3 months after Bill became President.
           </p>

            Bill Clinton grew up in a small town "Hope, Arkansas" where the chief entertainment was a whore house and bar. There is speculation of just who his father was. His legal name was William Jefferson Blythe III until he was 15 years old when he changed it to his adopted father's name, Clinton. His adopted dad ran a car dealership. His mother went to New Orleans to study nursing, and left Bill with grandparents until she returned. Bill's "dad" was a bigamist who was married already when he married Bill's mother.

             Bill Clinton's mother. 
"Virginia married car salesman Roger Clinton Sr., the father of the second of her two boys, Roger Jr. Clinton was an alcoholic and was physically and mentally abusive to Virginia and her boys. He did not adopt Bill, but Bill took his surname legally in 1962. He told his mother that it would be easier if they all had the same last name. Roger Sr. and Virginia divorced in 1962 but remarried each other a few months later."

             That is correct and is linked to Racine, Wisconsin where Bill Clinton began his Sustainability mission which has become a evil arm of the global elite within Agenda 2030. These secret societies are linked together from DeMolays to Scottish Rite to Knights of Pythias to Pilgrims Society. The Rothschild, Rockefeller and Reynolds families are just a few of the top tier involved, and it is linked throughout the world. There are tiers of families and corporations that run the national and global kleptocracy and crime syndicate. Racine, Wisconsin is one of the epicenters where secret societies, Pizzagate and Global Criminal Corruption thrive.

              What connects all of these secret societies is their worship of Satan, they are all working together organizing the New World Order. eventually they want to reduce the population to 500 million people.

               Correct - this is Agenda 2030 and is why Racine, Wisconsin is such an important place tied to the lie of Sustainability to cover up the real Evil agenda.

             Really? Do you mind providing any links? I can never find this stuff myself on Google (must be doing something wrong LOL) ... I only get biased articles that show how these families 'do no wrong' etc :/
