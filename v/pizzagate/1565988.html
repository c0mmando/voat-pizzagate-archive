            The Vatican is not inhabited by Jews this is disinformation. Anti-semiticism will get us nowhere. The Vatican was the executioner of the King of the Jews... Jesus!  The Vatican is the seat of evil masked as good, It does not contain christians or Jews and is called the "whore of Babylon" in Revelations. Anyone should be carefu and study history before deciding the difference between Christians, the Jewish people, and the Vatican.

            while you are very correct satanism and pedophilia has been in the vatican since it's inception. It is the continuation of the roman empire, and the romans were human sacrificing pedo satanists

            Ok, I would like to ask you and Georgie both something. you may know nothing about it but it's a shot.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you think there is any chance that Alefantis asked or intimidated Chris Cocker into denying that anything ever happened the night Alefantis took him to the White House for that late night tour? He was maybe 20-21 then, it was 2012 and his documentary was just out. Do you know anyone in the "gay grapevine" that might know about this? We know Alefantis just intimidated and threatened a pizzagate researcher personally, and the Cocker story was just getting started when he made a video that denyed everything. A simple call from Alefantis could convince him to convincingly say nothing ever happened, after all Alefantis helped give him a second level of fame by producing his documentary and touring him in different cities. Also do you think Alefantis was or could have been pimping him during that tour of the doco openings? at the White House? He did become a porn star, so it's not completely a far fetched idea that that could have been the trajectory. Ok thanks for reading and your reply if you have one.

             The link is through several sources. L. Ron Hubbard openly confessed to being a CIA operative. His job was to convince his followers he would bring about the anti-Christ. Hubbard deeply connected in CIA mind control. If you study there procedures they are based on CIA principals. They demand constant confession of every behavior or thought to handlers which is of course is recorded for blackmail. The more you submitted the "Purer" you became. The higher you rose in power the more acting roles you got etc. Hubbard required tons of money and of course lived in mansions and on a yacht I believe. Required absolute locality. If you backslid in your programming you were considered flawed, threats of exposure, etc. Those who left lives have been threatened and worse. See Leah Remini story.
Many people have gone on record stating Scientology is a CIA/MK Ultra front to control Hollywood. 
Just a few days ago it was UN covered that the moonies cult which encompasses mass poet in USA and the world along with Vatican I taking Islam under its wings. The moonies are directly related to George H. W. Bush &amp; Barbara Pierce/Bush (who also has connections to Satanist Aleister Crowley.)
It was just released on a Voat submission the property records of James Alefantis which linked to the estate of Hubbard. I think this needs to be further investigated.

              Where is the documentation?  I've never heard a word about any "confession" of LRon being CIA.  Ever.  The Anti-christ has nothing to do with Scientology whatsoever.  I've read the mooney stuff, that's not what we are talking about.  You need to lurk over at Whyweprotest.com   If it exists you'll find it there, and I can't find anything about what you are asserting.  Get some dox.

               The documentation was just released in the post that outed the moonies cult connection through Bush Sr. through the USA, Catholic charities, secret societies, I could go on. Hubbard founder of Scientology known to be involved in CIA/mind control/LSD work mission was to run psyops to "bring about Anti-Christ" Think about anyone who has ever left Scientology? You can't scielenceed or blackmailed. Listen to Leah Remini story you will get a glimpse. Only survivor so far. It is about control and fear and blackmail. Study Hubbard/CIA.

                Leah Remini is great, but there is a WHOLE LOT MORE testimony about Scientology than just her story.  L Ron Hubbard WAS NOT KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE CIA.  You have to DOCUMENT that assertion, and you can't.  If you had that documentation it would be a breakthrough.  SO PLEASE STOP ASSERTING IT.
               </p>
               <p>
                There are documented cases of some Scientologiests being in the CIA, just not Hubbard.   Hubbard was not interested in the Anti Christ at all.  He did try to create a "moon child" with Jet Propulsion lab guy (forget the name right now)  but that was when he was younger.   This Hubbard/psyops/CIA/Anti-Christ thing of yours is YOURS ALONE.  It is clearly a misunderstanding on your part.  I have read about Scientology for years and what you are saying is not part of the discourse on Scientology any where else.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you have DOCUMENTATION then by all means show it.  If not, stop asserting things you obviously don't know enough about.  YOU NEED TO LURK AT TONY ORTEGA'S SCIENTOLOGY SITE AND at WHYWEPROTEST - the definitive site for anti-scientology anonymous.  Until you do PLEASE STOP SPREADING MISINFORMATION.
               </p>
               <p>
                If you continue to reply to me with misinformation, I'll have no choice but to consider you some kind of inept shill.

            This is interesting stuff.  I don't see this subculture really relating to pizzagate.  Men rent young people gay or straight.  That's not the same as compromising a politician with child sex and ritual blood magic!  Alefantis is a kinda fame whore and he just gravitates to cafe society types - if murder was involved, so much the better from his point of view.  Maybe I'm being naive but please continue on, and I'm glad to hear your voices and point of view.

              That did not happen.  Do you think they let prisoner's join Facebook?  This guy was convicted of murder almost a decade before Facebook started.
             </p>
             <p>
              He did not leave a comment on the murderer's Facebook page because Michael Alig doesn't have a Facebook page.
             </p>
             <p>
              On his own Facebook page he liked a post on a blog about how the world has changed since Michael Alig went to prison.  There's no evidence before he read that post that even knew when Michael Alig was getting out of prison and there's no evidence Alefantis is a friend of his.

            Yeah sure fruitcake, it's the Jews. Even though it's an established fact that the Vatican have been raping kids and protecting and fostering a culture of pedophilia for generations. But it's the Jews! Maybe it's the Nazis, maybe they developed this tactic in SA, post-defeat and are using mafia-style blackmail techniques to control the politicians of the world.

            Fun Fact: Culkin is really good friends with Elijah Wood.  Elijah Wood talked about pedophilia this summer and likely was referring to his lifelong friend (since the Good Son in 1993). Corey Feldman jumped in as well on the conversation.  What do Culkin and Feldman have in common? Both had sleepovers with Michael Jackson. Why is Michael Jackson connected to Pizzagate? Because he was good friends with Ron Burkle and Chris Tucker - frequent fliers on Jeffrey Epstein's jet, the Lolita Express. In fact, both guys were instrumental in Jackson's child molestation case in 2005 - Burkle gave advice to Jackson on bathroom breaks and Tucker was the defense's star witness. Michael Jackson's info was also in Epstein's Little Black Book.

            i remember that movie they supposedly started raves in new york with the gay club scene, and the dude was all fucked up on heroin (in the movie). That's extremely fucked up considering culkin's band and alig being a child abuser. That part was conveniently left out.
